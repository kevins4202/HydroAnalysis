warren and root 1963 zeng et al 2019 zimmerman et al 1993 warren and root 1963 were the pioneer researchers to characterize dual porosity reservoirs general review of the dual porosity reservoirs can be found in the literature hassanzadeh et al 2009 zendehboudi and bahadori 2016 the extraction of stored fluid from such low permeable reservoirs has not been economically feasible without developing new techniques such as horizontal wells and multi fractured horizontal wells mfhws through the hydraulic fracturing productivity is increased by increasing the contact area between the wellbore and the reservoir and decreasing the pressure drop during the production operation conventionally the decision making procedure of mfhws design is based on successful former practices however the hydraulic fracturing design is hard to be based on previous experiences in new fields with new rock and fluid properties many two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d numerical simulation attempts have been carried out to find the optimum design of hydraulic fractures lolon et al 2007 olorode et al 2013 due to the existence of local optimal points and high computational costs of the numerical methods a robust systematic and reliable strategy is required the impact of fracture penetration ratio and conductivity was evaluated by mcguire and sikora 1960 prats et al 1962 demonstrated that the infinite conductivity fracture is not a successful design to obtain the maximum productivity all the times based on the achieved results economides et al 2002 introduced the concept of unified fracture design ufd the ufd approach presents two main notations first both high and low permeability reservoirs are the same in the term of fracturing benefits long hydraulic fractures provide production access to distant parts of low permeable reservoirs in high permeable reservoirs high conductivity fractures prevent the extra pressure drop near the wellbore due to non darcy flow second for any specified design parameters such as proppant mass and type fracturing fluid rheology behavior number of fracturing stages number of hydraulic fractures and injection flow rate there is only one optimum fracture geometry the practical capability of the ufd approach was reported by diyashev and economides 2006 in a field study a square drainage area was assumed in the original ufd rectangular drainage area was modelled by ufd later bhattacharya et al 2012 daal and economides 2006 based on the results of the rectangular drainage area case wei and economides 2005 presented an optimization method for mfhw the optimum decision parameter was determined by considering the practical constraints where productivity was the objective function demarchos et al 2004 during the fracturing process a part of fracturing fluid invades the reservoir formation which may cause the fracture face skin ffs the impact of ffs on the productivity and pressure response of fractured wells were also studied as a practical consideration of hydraulic fracture design zeng et al 2019 asadi et al 2018 romero 2001 based on the ufd concept as a physical optimization method marongiu porcu et al 2013 introduced an economic and physical optimization technique for hydraulic fracture design they estimated the production based on physical optimum fracture geometry obtained by ufd and also considered the net present value npv to optimize the proppant mass as a decision variable bhattacharya and nikolaou 2016 optimized a multi decision variable fracture design by applying the global optimization method amini and valkó 2010 introduced the distributed volumetric sources dvs method to increase the accuracy of fracture design by considering both the pseudo steady state and transient flow regimes which was extended for different boundary conditions by asadi and zendehboudi 2019 all of the aforementioned production evaluation studies were carried out under the single porosity reservoir assumption dejam et al 2018 developed a new solution for the pressure response of a vertical fractured well in a dual porosity bounded reservoir they applied the laplace transform lt with respect to time and finite fourier cosine transform ffct with respect to spatial coordinates in their work they successfully modeled all possible flow regimes however their study was conducted under the infinite conductivity assumption in order to assess the performance and the design of hydraulic fractures in dual porosity reservoirs the finite conductivity hydraulic fracture should be taken into account this study aims to evaluate hydraulically fractured well performance and to update the optimum fracture design in dual porosity reservoirs therefore a new solution for hydraulic fracture pressure response in a dual porosity reservoir case is developed the fracture position is determined by two heaviside step functions and the dvs method is implemented to consider the pressure drop inside the finite conductivity fracture finally an economic evaluation is performed to optimize the decision variables the rest of the paper is organized as follows first the physical model and assumptions are presented the governing equations are solved for the infinite conductivity case and the model is extended to a finite case by using the dvs approach then the results of the presented methods are discussed finally the conclusions of the current study are summarized 2 theoretical modeling in this section the physical model is clarified and the derivation method of the governing equations is explained additionally the well pressure solution for a two dimensional dual porosity bounded reservoir with a multi fractured horizontal well is presented first the fracture is assumed to be as an infinite conductive source then the solution of a finite conductive fracture is presented in the subsection attributed to the distributed volumetric sources dvs technique from the mathematical modeling prospect the existing model is improved by considering the fracture width therefore the pressure drop inside the fracture can be incorporated in the modeling approach which plays an important role in fluid flow in the fracture and from the fracture to matrix the pressure drop inside the fracture is evaluated by dividing the hydraulic fracture into several segments and applying darcy s law through employing the dvs technique further highlighting the practical feature of this study the hydraulic fracture productivity can be assessed at the finite conductivity condition which helps to select more appropriate and precise hydraulic fracture design in dual porosity reservoirs 2 1 physical model and assumptions a horizontal well with multiple fractures which are uniform and spaced equally producing from a dual porosity formation is considered for the problem under study the top view of a horizontal well with four transverse hydraulic fractures is demonstrated in fig 1 fractures are assumed to be fully penetrated in the vertical direction all properties are homogeneous in x and y directions the dual porosity reservoir contains anisotropic natural fractures and isotropic matrix no flow boundaries are assumed for the boundaries of the reservoir which is acceptable in low permeable shale gas reservoirs the dimensions of the reservoir are x e y e and h as the length width and thickness of the reservoir respectively as mentioned before the fractures are assumed to be uniform and equally spaced in the drainage area therefore one can consider that the entire drainage area is divided between the fractures equally the production of one fracture can be multiplied by the number of fractures to calculate the overall production by all fractures the length and width of the drainage area of each fracture are x e and y e respectively hydraulic fractures are assumed to have infinite finite conductivity with two wings the wings of the hydraulic fractures are propagated along the x direction in the case of the finite conductivity the permeability of hydraulic fracture is k hf the length of each wing is 2 x f and its width is 2 w y fluid flow in the matrix and fractures follows the darcy s law and the fluid is considered to be a slightly compressible single phase with a constant viscosity it is also assumed that all the fluid is produced through the hydraulic fractures amini and valkó 2010 concluded that as the number of hydraulic fractures increases the contribution of horizontal well in the production will decrease hence the fluid production through the horizontal well can be neglected in spite of the vertical fractured well in which the fluid flows linearly toward the well through the hydraulic fractures the fluid flow converges toward the horizontal well in the mfhw causing an additional pressure drop in the transverse fractures the extra pressure drop due to flow convergence in the transvers fractures can be taken into account through employing the mukherjee and economides method wei and economides 2005 mukherjee and economides 1991 the ffs and chock skin which are resulted from embedding a part of the proppant or producing proppant during the clean up and production phases were not considered zeng et al 2019 asadi et al 2018 romero 2001 the natural fracture permeability is changed during the fracturing process the injection of high pressure fracturing fluid may induce an extra natural fracture permeability near the hydraulic fracture the natural fracture permeability is assumed to be homogeneous which is not dependent on pressure and stresses the transfer rate between the matrix and natural fractures is modeled by the pseudo steady state formulation in the dual porosity reservoir the pseudo steady state flow behavior assumes that the rate of pressure change in the matrix is constant this approach is widely used in the literature to model the fluid transfer between the matrix and natural fractures warren and root 1963 2 2 governing equations as mentioned in the previous subsection to study fluid flow in the entire drainage area the fluid flow for one fracture in its own drainage area will be

matrix total compressibilities respectively ϕ f and ϕ m symbolize the natural fracture and matrix porosity respectively and t shows the time the third term in eq 1 is the source term to indicate the reservoir response to the hydraulic fracture as a source the heaviside functions are used to determine the location of hydraulic fractures in the dual porosity reservoir the transfer rate from the matrix to the natural fractures can be formulated at the pseudo steady state condition as follows warren and root 1963 2 c m ϕ m p m t σ k m μ p m p f in which σ and k m represent the shape factor which has the dimension of reciprocal area and matrix permeability respectively to solve eqs 1 and 2 the boundary conditions and two initial conditions ics are required the initial conditions are listed below 3a i c s p f x y 0 p i 3b p m 0 p i where p i refers to the initial fluid pressure in the dual porosity reservoir the reservoir is assumed to be bounded in all directions thus no flow

model to its dimensionless form is helpful to generalize the solution furthermore introduction of dimensionless variables decreases the number of variables which makes the solution more understandable

transform ffct with respect to spatial coordinates are utilized to solve eqs 6 and 7 dejam et al 2018 introduced the basic concept of using these two transforms e g lt and ffct to calculate the pressure response of a hydraulic fracture in a dual porosity reservoir the details of the derivation of the semi analytical solution are provided in appendix a the dimensionless pressure solution in

2 5 distributed volumetric sources dvs method and optimal fracture design valko and amini introduced the dvs method valko and amini 2007 the reservoir considered in their study was single porosity and the source function was instantaneous in which a numerical integral over time is needed to calculate the continuous behavior of the source term while in the current study the reservoir is dual porosity and the source term is not instantaneous if the fracture is assumed to be an infinite conductive source the pressure drop inside the fracture is neglected the fracture is divided into n uniform flux sources as depicted in fig 3 cinco et al 1978 cinco ley and meng 1988 gringarten et al 1974 based on the superposition of pressure effect the pressure at each segment is determined as the summation of the pressure drop by itself and other segments as expressed below 13 p fdi σ j 1 n q dj p fdi j where q dj represents the source strength of segment j and p fdi j refers to the dimensionless pressure at the center of segment i when the source is placed at segment j see eq 11 eq 13 or dimensionless pressure can be rewritten in the matrix form as 14 a q b 0 where matrix a denotes a n n matrix that contains p fdi j as its elements q represents the vector of source strength and b is a vector where all elements of the vector equal the dimensionless pressure at the wellbore p fd w f when the fracture is assumed to be a finite conductivity source the same procedure as the infinite conductivity fracture case is followed while the additional pressure drop between the segments due to the finite conductivity of the fracture is considered the matrix notation for the finite conductivity case is expressed below 15 a c q b 0 where c symbolizes a matrix which describes the pressure drop between the source segments elements of the matrix c are obtained in details as described in appendix b fig 4 represents the workflow of the optimum fracture design optimal fracture design contains two parts economic and physical marongiu porcu et al 2013 ufd can be used to determine the optimum fracture geometry e g physical optimization based on both design parameters including drainage area a r and decision variable such as proppant mass m p then the production is estimated by the introduced lt ffct method and an economic evaluation is conducted to calculate npv the procedure is continued by changing the decision variable until the maximum npv is achieved appendix c provides more information on the ufd dimensionless parameters 3 results and discussion in this section the proposed solution is validated by comparing with the solution obtained by the separation of variables technique the impact of the number of sentences terms in eq 11 on the accuracy of the solution is assessed also different flow regimes for an infinite conductivity single fracture case are identified the accuracy of the model applied to the finite fracture conductivity case is compared to that of the separation of variables method finally a sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the influence of the dual porosity reservoir parameters e g storativity ratio and interporosity coefficient on the productivity index an economic optimization strategy is also employed for conducting mfhw design 3 1 solution validation in this section the solution presented by eq 11 confirms the results of previous studies valko and amini 2007 provided a solution for performance evaluation of both infinite and finite conductivity cases in a single porosity reservoir case by using the technique of separation of variables fig 5 compares the solutions obtained by the separation of variables and lt ffct techniques a 0 01 0 01 source is placed in the middle of the domain to enable comparison with the separation of variables method the reservoir is assumed to be single porosity as mentioned previously the solution presented by eq 11 e g lt ffct technique will converge to the single porosity case when f s 1 responses are duplicated at t d 1 10 4 where y d 0 5 fig 5 reveals a good agreement between both solution methods verifying the accuracy of the proposed model as the number of terms in eq 11 is reduced the accuracy of the solution will decrease more fluctuations for the cases with a low number of sentences are due to the gibbs phenomenon eq 11 with a high number of terms sentences approximates the accurate pressure behaviours within the entire area but the small fluctuations will remain in the discontinuous points e g at the boundary of the source 3 2 flow regimes of infinite conductivity single fracture for flow regime identification in the case of infinite conductivity the dimensionless hydraulic fractured well pressure in a dual porosity reservoir p wd and its derivative d p wd d l n t d versus dimensionless time are illustrated in fig 6 by using eqs 11 and 12 a fracture with a dimensionless length of 0 4 and a dimensionless width of 0 02 is placed in a dual porosity reservoir with a storativity ratio of ω 0 01 and an interporosity flow coefficient of λ 0 01 to show the impact of the reservoir anisotropy the diffusivity coefficient in the x direction is η x 1 while it is η y 0 1 i n t h e y d i r e c t i o n in agreement with the results obtained by dejam et al 2018 the early linear flow volumetric depletion of natural fractures natural fracture radial flow transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow and pseudo steady state flow are observed at the early stages of production for infinite fracture conductivity cases without skin and wellbore storage effects the fluid flows linearly from the formation to the hydraulic fracture kuchuk and biryukov 2015 this flow regime is recognized by a linear relationship between p wd and t d 1 2 in the cartesian coordinates and a straight line is obtained with a slope of 1 2 in the log log plot p wd versus t d after the early linear flow regime the fluid in the natural fractures is depleted volumetrically the volumetric depletion of the natural fractures is indicated by a linear behavior with a unit slope for both dimensionless pressure and its derivative e g p wd and d p wd d l n t d versus dimensionless time t d naturally fractured reservoirs are characterized by the interporosity flow coefficient λ and the storativity ratio ω warren and root 1963 the interporosity flow coefficient represents how easily fluid is transferred from the matrix to the natural fractures it is controlled by the ratio of the matrix permeability to the natural fracture permeability see eq 5i the storativity ratio is used to represent the ratio of natural fractures fluid capacitance to the total fluid capacitance see eq 5h the dual porosity reservoirs behavior will approach the single porosity reservoir when ω 1 or λ after the volumetric depletion of natural fracture flow regime the radial flow through the natural fractures is observed since the pseudo steady state formulation is used as the transfer rate from the matrix to the natural fractures in the current study see eq 2 the flow regime transition from the natural fracture radial flow to the total both natural fractures and matrix radial flow is indicated by a sharp dip in the derivative plot d p wd d l n t d versus t d in the log log scale the reservoir is assumed to act bounded therefore the pseudo steady state flow regime appears instead of total radial flow at the late time this flow regime is demonstrated by a straight line with a unit slope for both p wd and d p wd d l n t d versus t d in the log log plot 3 3 productivity behavior and physical optimization of finite conductivity hydraulic fracture due to the pressure drop along the length of hydraulic fractures the finite conductivity hydraulic fracture assumption is reasonable the dvs method is used to study the pressure and production behaviours in the finite hydraulic fracture a single fracture in a single porosity reservoir with a fixed proppant number n p 0 01 is considered and the fracture is discretized into 8 segments fig 7 illustrates the dimensionless productivity index j d values versus dimensionless fracture conductivity c fd based on the outputs obtained by the separation of variables and the lt ffct solution approaches in fig 7 there is a good match between both methods of solution at the pseudo steady state flow condition the inflection behavior at low dimensionless fracture conductivity c fd conditions is due to the low number of segments romero 2001 the insufficient number of sentences of lt ffct and gibbs phenomenon may cause small mismatching when the dimensionless fracture conductivity c fd is h i g h however the optimum points of both methods are the same confirming the capability of the lt ffct to achieve the optimized hydraulic fracture design when the optimum dimensionless fracture conductivity is determined the optimum fracture geometry can be identified and the physical optimization of hydraulic fracture design is completed marongiu porcu et al 2013 now the accuracy reliability of the lt ffct to evaluate the hydraulic fracture design performance is verified by comparing the results of this study with the outputs of the separation of variables method in the single porosity case next step is the evaluation of fracture performance in the dual porosity reservoir first the effect of storativity ratio on the productivity index is discussed storativity ratio quantifies the relative natural fracture storage capacity of a dual porosity reservoir the storativity ratio affects the depth of generated dip in the derivative pressure during the transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fracture and matrix radial flow this parameter is normally in the range of 0 01 ω 0 1 dejam et al 2013 which is also examined in the current study fig 8 demonstrates the effects of storativity ratio ω on the dimensionless productivity index of a hydraulic fracture j d versus dimensionless time t d in a dual porosity reservoir in this case the proppant number is n p 0 01 the dimensionless conductivity of the fracture is assumed to be c fd 1 6 which is the optimum point in the former case see the maximum point in fig 7 and the reservoir is considered at the isotropic condition η x η y 1 with λ 10 to increase the accuracy of the results the hydraulic fracture is discretized into 16 segments the single porosity case has a higher dimensionless productivity compared to dual porosity cases as the storativity ratio decreases the dimensionless productivity index decreases when all the other parameters are the same decreasing the storativity ratio leads to a decrease in the available storage capacity to produce this causes a reduction in the dimensionless productivity index dejam et al 2018 showed that a higher storativity ratio results in a lower dimensionless pressure before the pseudo steady state flow regime starts similarly a higher storativity ratio causes a greater dimensionless productivity index the inner plot in fig 8 is used to magnify a part of the plot as it is shown in the inner plot the earlier natural fracture radial flow is observed in the lower storativity ratio cases the lower storativity ratio results in a longer transition time between the natural fracture radial flow and total radial flow and consequently a longer time between the natural fracture radial flow and pseudo steady state flow regimes however the onset time of pseudo steady state where the dimensionless productivity index does not change with time is independent of the storativity ratio the ability of the matrix for directing fluid flow toward the natural fracture network is represented by the interporosity flow coefficient λ which depends on the shape factor matrix to fracture permeability ratio and the square of the dimensionless length scale l see eq 5i the beginning time of transition between the natural fracture radial flow to total matrix and natural fracture radial flow is controlled by the interporosity flow coefficient this coefficient shows the promptness of the matrix response to the pressure changes the range of 0 01 λ 100 was used by dejam et al 2018 to study the impact of infinite conductivity hydraulic fracture on the transient pressure behavior of a vertical well in a dual porosity reservoir the same range is also considered in the current case study fig 9 represents the impact of interporosity flow coefficient λ on the dimensionless productivity index j d at various dimensionless times t d in a dual porosity reservoir like the previous case the proppant number dimensionless conductivity of the fracture and diffusivity coefficients are fixed at n p 0 01 c fd 1 6 and η x η y 1 respectively the storativity ratio is equal for all cases which is ω 0 01 to keep the accuracy of the model at an acceptable level the fracture is discretized into 16 segments in the dvs method the results presented in fig 9 reveal that increasing interporosity flow coefficient increases the dimensionless productivity index the speed of matrix response to pressure change is thus increased leading to a faster support of producing flow by matrix since the storativity ratios of all dual porosity cases are the same the same performance is observed at the beginning before the early linear flow is terminated the duration of volumetric depletion decreases as the interporosity flow coefficient increases the pseudo steady state flow regime where the dimensionless productivity index is invariant with dimensionless time occurs earlier a higher interporosity flow coefficient can be interpreted as a higher matrix permeability therefore faster response to the pressure variations in the natural fracture network might be the reason for earlier flow regime changes in the higher interporosity cases figs 8 and 9 clearly show that the dual porosity reservoir parameters can affect the productivity index hence the proposed solution in eq 11 should be used to estimate the productivity index of the dual porosity reservoirs asadi et al 2018 concluded that the optimum fracture design in the pseudo steady state flow regime is the optimal case for all flow regimes before pseudo steady state in the single porosity reservoirs the same conclusion should be made for the dual porosity reservoirs as well fig 10 depicts the dimensionless productivity index j d for different dimensionless fracture conductivities c fd versus dimensionless time t d for a dual porosity reservoir system the proppant number interporosity coefficient storativity ratio and diffusivity coefficients are assumed to be fixed for all cases where n p 0 01 ω 0 01 λ 10 and η x η y 1 respectively the inner plot in fig 10 demonstrates the fractured well performance at the pseudo steady state flow regime as it is evident from fig 10 any design which has the maximum productivity at the pseudo steady state has the highest productivity for all flow regimes before the pseudo steady state condition therefore the physical or dimensional optimization of hydraulic fracture design can be conducted based on the pseudo steady state flow regime results 3 4 economic optimization as mentioned earlier every hydraulic fracturing design has two types of parameters namely decision variables and design parameters design parameter does not change for each fracture design whereas the decision variable can change while optimizing the hydraulic fracturing design to find the optimum decision parameter an economic evaluation should be performed the production is estimated based on the physical optimization of the hydraulic fracture design the net present value npv is selected as an objective function for the economic optimization analysis npv is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash inflow and the present value of the cash outflow during a specified time period fig 11 illustrates the economic evaluation of a hydraulic fracture design of an mfhw case when proppant mass is selected as a decision variable a horizontal well with 4 stages of fracturing e g 4 hydraulic fractures is considered in a dual porosity reservoir the reservoir properties and economic data are the same as provided by asadi et al 2018 as the main parameters the values for the interporosity coefficient and storativity ratio are assumed to be λ 10 and ω 0 01 respectively the maximum value of the npv determines the optimum magnitude of the proppant mass and also identifies the optimum fracture geometries the calculated optimum dimensionless fracture conductivity c f d opt can be used to obtain the optimum fracture length and width see ref asadi et al 2018 other variables such as the number of fractures proppant type and flow injection rate can be also selected as the decision variable bhattacharya and nikolaou 2016 conducted a global optimization of hydraulic fracture design so that they optimized multi decision variables furthermore multi objective optimization can be performed to optimize other objectives such as reservoir and production uncertainties in the production operation podhoretz and valko 2014 highlighting another practical implication of the proposed modeling strategy groundwater contamination is a health related and environmental issue that may arise from various contaminants with different sources guerin et al 2002 obiri nyarko et al 2014 wiafe et al 2014 the remediation is a time consuming costly and large scale process particularly when the groundwater resources are low permeable and unconventional in terms of formation characteristics based on the national research council report at least 126 000 contaminated sites in the united states require continuous management in terms of contaminant detection characterization and mitigation while the cost of cleanup is estimated to exceed 110 127 billion council 2013 mfhw can be an appropriate option to decrease the capital and operating costs at large scales 4 summary and conclusions a new mathematical model is derived to investigate the finite infinite conductivity performance of the multi fractured horizontal well mfhw in dual porosity reservoirs the position of the hydraulic fracture is determined by two heaviside functions using the two dimensional diffusivity equation the laplace transform lt with respect to time and finite fourier cosine transform ffct with respect to both spatial directions are applied to obtain the semi analytical solution of the unsteady steady state diffusivity equation in a bounded domain the proposed model can be employed to calculate the mfhw productivity and obtain the optimal production in terms of economic prospective the accuracy of the proposed solution is verified by the solution which is developed by the separation of variables method in the single porosity reservoir case the gibbs phenomenon impact is emphasized to show the importance of choosing the proper number of sentences terms in the solution by considering the infinite fracture conductivity different flow regimes are observed where the dimensionless pressure and its derivative versus time are plotted the determined flow regimes include early linear flow with a half slope line in the log log plot of d p wd d l n t d versus t d volumetric depletion of the natural fracture with a unit slope line in the log log plot of p wd versus t d natural fracture radial flow transition of natural fracture radial flow to total matrix and fracture radial flow and pseudo steady state flow with a unit slope line for both dimensionless pressure p wd and its derivative d p wd d l n t d versus t d to study the productivity of the finite conductivity fracture case first the accuracy of the solution is examined by comparing the corresponding outputs with the results of separation of variables in the single porosity case then a sensitivity analysis is carried out on the dual porosity case to investigate the productivity index at various conditions the storativity ratio has more effect on the productivity index at the transient flow condition compared to the pseudo steady state flow condition the storativity ratio affects the flow regimes onset time except the characteristic time for the pseudo steady state on the other hand the interporosity coefficient has a greater impact on the productivity index of the pseudo steady state flow regime compared to other regimes lower interporosity coefficient causes that the pseudo steady state regime happens later sensitivity analysis of the storativity ratio and interporosity coefficient show the high prominence of dual porosity reservoir parameters in the magnitude of the productivity index it is proven that the optimum fractured design based on the pseudo steady state has the maximum productivity in all flow regimes this confirms that the optimum fracture geometry on the basis of the pseudo steady state can be considered as the optimum fracture design for all flow regimes thus it can be used for estimation of production in dual porosity reservoirs the economic assessment is conducted to determine the optimum proppant mass as a decision variable using the net present value or npv as the objective function the reservoir properties are assumed homogenous in the current study it is expected that assessment of induced permeability and pressure stress sensitive properties in the dual porosity reservoirs is a promising future research declaration of

each segment and the reference wellbore pressure can be calculated by darcy s law for instance the fracture in fig b 1 is discretized into six segments and the wellbore reference point is located in the middle of the fracture between segments 3 and 4 the pressure drop is obtained as follows b1 p i p wf μ 2 w y h k hf x i x wf q d x where p wf represents the pressure at the wellbore and x wf determines the wellbore location the flow rate at each segment is considered as a linear function of length because each segment is assumed to be a uniform flux source the calculation points are at

warren and root 1963 zeng et al 2019 zimmerman et al 1993 warren and root 1963 were the pioneer researchers to characterize dual porosity reservoirs general review of the dual porosity reservoirs can be found in the literature hassanzadeh et al 2009 zendehboudi and bahadori 2016 the extraction of stored fluid from such low permeable reservoirs has not been economically feasible without developing new techniques such as horizontal wells and multi fractured horizontal wells mfhws through the hydraulic fracturing productivity is increased by increasing the contact area between the wellbore and the reservoir and decreasing the pressure drop during the production operation conventionally the decision making procedure of mfhws design is based on successful former practices however the hydraulic fracturing design is hard to be based on previous experiences in new fields with new rock and fluid properties many two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d numerical simulation attempts have been carried out to find the optimum design of hydraulic fractures lolon et al 2007 olorode et al 2013 due to the existence of local optimal points and high computational costs of the numerical methods a robust systematic and reliable strategy is required the impact of fracture penetration ratio and conductivity was evaluated by mcguire and sikora 1960 prats et al 1962 demonstrated that the infinite conductivity fracture is not a successful design to obtain the maximum productivity all the times based on the achieved results economides et al 2002 introduced the concept of unified fracture design ufd the ufd approach presents two main notations first both high and low permeability reservoirs are the same in the term of fracturing benefits long hydraulic fractures provide production access to distant parts of low permeable reservoirs in high permeable reservoirs high conductivity fractures prevent the extra pressure drop near the wellbore due to non darcy flow second for any specified design parameters such as proppant mass and type fracturing fluid rheology behavior number of fracturing stages number of hydraulic fractures and injection flow rate there is only one optimum fracture geometry the practical capability of the ufd approach was reported by diyashev and economides 2006 in a field study a square drainage area was assumed in the original ufd rectangular drainage area was modelled by ufd later bhattacharya et al 2012 daal and economides 2006 based on the results of the rectangular drainage area case wei and economides 2005 presented an optimization method for mfhw the optimum decision parameter was determined by considering the practical constraints where productivity was the objective function demarchos et al 2004 during the fracturing process a part of fracturing fluid invades the reservoir formation which may cause the fracture face skin ffs the impact of ffs on the productivity and pressure response of fractured wells were also studied as a practical consideration of hydraulic fracture design zeng et al 2019 asadi et al 2018 romero 2001 based on the ufd concept as a physical optimization method marongiu porcu et al 2013 introduced an economic and physical optimization technique for hydraulic fracture design they estimated the production based on physical optimum fracture geometry obtained by ufd and also considered the net present value npv to optimize the proppant mass as a decision variable bhattacharya and nikolaou 2016 optimized a multi decision variable fracture design by applying the global optimization method amini and valkó 2010 introduced the distributed volumetric sources dvs method to increase the accuracy of fracture design by considering both the pseudo steady state and transient flow regimes which was extended for different boundary conditions by asadi and zendehboudi 2019 all of the aforementioned production evaluation studies were carried out under the single porosity reservoir assumption dejam et al 2018 developed a new solution for the pressure response of a vertical fractured well in a dual porosity bounded reservoir they applied the laplace transform lt with respect to time and finite fourier cosine transform ffct with respect to spatial coordinates in their work they successfully modeled all possible flow regimes however their study was conducted under the infinite conductivity assumption in order to assess the performance and the design of hydraulic fractures in dual porosity reservoirs the finite conductivity hydraulic fracture should be taken into account this study aims to evaluate hydraulically fractured well performance and to update the optimum fracture design in dual porosity reservoirs therefore a new solution for hydraulic fracture pressure response in a dual porosity reservoir case is developed the fracture position is determined by two heaviside step functions and the dvs method is implemented to consider the pressure drop inside the finite conductivity fracture finally an economic evaluation is performed to optimize the decision variables the rest of the paper is organized as follows first the physical model and assumptions are presented the governing equations are solved for the infinite conductivity case and the model is extended to a finite case by using the dvs approach then the results of the presented methods are discussed finally the conclusions of the current study are summarized 2 theoretical modeling in this section the physical model is clarified and the derivation method of the governing equations is explained additionally the well pressure solution for a two dimensional dual porosity bounded reservoir with a multi fractured horizontal well is presented first the fracture is assumed to be as an infinite conductive source then the solution of a finite conductive fracture is presented in the subsection attributed to the distributed volumetric sources dvs technique from the mathematical modeling prospect the existing model is improved by considering the fracture width therefore the pressure drop inside the fracture can be incorporated in the modeling approach which plays an important role in fluid flow in the fracture and from the fracture to matrix the pressure drop inside the fracture is evaluated by dividing the hydraulic fracture into several segments and applying darcy s law through employing the dvs technique further highlighting the practical feature of this study the hydraulic fracture productivity can be assessed at the finite conductivity condition which helps to select more appropriate and precise hydraulic fracture design in dual porosity reservoirs 2 1 physical model and assumptions a horizontal well with multiple fractures which are uniform and spaced equally producing from a dual porosity formation is considered for the problem under study the top view of a horizontal well with four transverse hydraulic fractures is demonstrated in fig 1 fractures are assumed to be fully penetrated in the vertical direction all properties are homogeneous in x and y directions the dual porosity reservoir contains anisotropic natural fractures and isotropic matrix no flow boundaries are assumed for the boundaries of the reservoir which is acceptable in low permeable shale gas reservoirs the dimensions of the reservoir are x e y e and h as the length width and thickness of the reservoir respectively as mentioned before the fractures are assumed to be uniform and equally spaced in the drainage area therefore one can consider that the entire drainage area is divided between the fractures equally the production of one fracture can be multiplied by the number of fractures to calculate the overall production by all fractures the length and width of the drainage area of each fracture are x e and y e respectively hydraulic fractures are assumed to have infinite finite conductivity with two wings the wings of the hydraulic fractures are propagated along the x direction in the case of the finite conductivity the permeability of hydraulic fracture is k hf the length of each wing is 2 x f and its width is 2 w y fluid flow in the matrix and fractures follows the darcy s law and the fluid is considered to be a slightly compressible single phase with a constant viscosity it is also assumed that all the fluid is produced through the hydraulic fractures amini and valkó 2010 concluded that as the number of hydraulic fractures increases the contribution of horizontal well in the production will decrease hence the fluid production through the horizontal well can be neglected in spite of the vertical fractured well in which the fluid flows linearly toward the well through the hydraulic fractures the fluid flow converges toward the horizontal well in the mfhw causing an additional pressure drop in the transverse fractures the extra pressure drop due to flow convergence in the transvers fractures can be taken into account through employing the mukherjee and economides method wei and economides 2005 mukherjee and economides 1991 the ffs and chock skin which are resulted from embedding a part of the proppant or producing proppant during the clean up and production phases were not considered zeng et al 2019 asadi et al 2018 romero 2001 the natural fracture permeability is changed during the fracturing process the injection of high pressure fracturing fluid may induce an extra natural fracture permeability near the hydraulic fracture the natural fracture permeability is assumed to be homogeneous which is not dependent on pressure and stresses the transfer rate between the matrix and natural fractures is modeled by the pseudo steady state formulation in the dual porosity reservoir the pseudo steady state flow behavior assumes that the rate of pressure change in the matrix is constant this approach is widely used in the literature to model the fluid transfer between the matrix and natural fractures warren and root 1963 2 2 governing equations as mentioned in the previous subsection to study fluid flow in the entire drainage area the fluid flow for one fracture in its own drainage area will be

reservoir response to the hydraulic fracture as a source the heaviside functions are used to determine the location of hydraulic fractures in the dual porosity reservoir the transfer rate from the matrix to the natural fractures can be formulated at the pseudo steady state condition as follows warren and root 1963 2 c m ϕ m p m t σ k m μ p m p f in which σ and k m represent the shape factor

2 5 distributed volumetric sources dvs method and optimal fracture design valko and amini introduced the dvs method valko and amini 2007 the reservoir considered in their study was single porosity and the source function was instantaneous in which a numerical integral over time is needed to calculate the continuous behavior of the source term while in the current study the reservoir is dual porosity and the source term is not instantaneous if the fracture is assumed to be an infinite conductive source the pressure drop inside the fracture is neglected the fracture is divided into n uniform flux sources as depicted in fig 3 cinco et al 1978 cinco ley and meng 1988 gringarten et al 1974 based on the superposition of pressure effect the pressure at each segment is determined as the summation of the pressure drop by itself and other segments as expressed below 13 p fdi σ j 1 n q dj p fdi j where q dj represents the source strength of segment j and p fdi j refers to the dimensionless pressure at the center of segment i when the source is placed at segment j see eq 11 eq 13 or dimensionless pressure can be rewritten in the matrix form as 14 a q b 0 where matrix a denotes a n n matrix that contains p fdi j as its elements q represents the vector of source strength and b is a vector where all elements of the vector equal the dimensionless pressure at the wellbore p fd w f when the fracture is assumed to be a finite conductivity source the same procedure as the infinite conductivity fracture case is followed while the additional pressure drop between the segments due to the finite conductivity of the fracture is considered the matrix notation for the finite conductivity case is expressed below 15 a c q b 0 where c symbolizes a matrix which describes the pressure drop between the source segments elements of the matrix c are obtained in details as described in appendix b fig 4 represents the workflow of the optimum fracture design optimal fracture design contains two parts economic and physical marongiu porcu et al 2013 ufd can be used to determine the optimum fracture geometry e g physical optimization based on both design parameters including drainage area a r and decision variable such as proppant mass m p then the production is estimated by the introduced lt ffct method and an economic evaluation is conducted to calculate npv the procedure is continued by changing the decision variable until the maximum npv is achieved appendix c provides more information on the ufd dimensionless parameters 3 results and discussion in this section the proposed solution is validated by comparing with the solution obtained by the separation of variables technique the impact of the number of sentences terms in eq 11 on the accuracy of the solution is assessed also different flow regimes for an infinite conductivity single fracture case are identified the accuracy of the model applied to the finite fracture conductivity case is compared to that of the separation of variables method finally a sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the influence of the dual porosity reservoir parameters e g storativity ratio and interporosity coefficient on the productivity index an economic optimization strategy is also employed for conducting mfhw design 3 1 solution validation in this section the solution presented by eq 11 confirms the results of previous studies valko and amini 2007 provided a solution for performance evaluation of both infinite and finite conductivity cases in a single porosity reservoir case by using the technique of separation of variables fig 5 compares the solutions obtained by the separation of variables and lt ffct techniques a 0 01 0 01 source is placed in the middle of the domain to enable comparison with the separation of variables method the reservoir is assumed to be single porosity as mentioned previously the solution presented by eq 11 e g lt ffct technique will converge to the single porosity case when f s 1 responses are duplicated at t d 1 10 4 where y d 0 5 fig 5 reveals a good agreement between both solution methods verifying the accuracy of the proposed model as the number of terms in eq 11 is reduced the accuracy of the solution will decrease more fluctuations for the cases with a low number of sentences are due to the gibbs phenomenon eq 11 with a high number of terms sentences approximates the accurate pressure behaviours within the entire area but the small fluctuations will remain in the discontinuous points e g at the boundary of the source 3 2 flow regimes of infinite conductivity single fracture for flow regime identification in the case of infinite conductivity the dimensionless hydraulic fractured well pressure in a dual porosity reservoir p wd and its derivative d p wd d l n t d versus dimensionless time are illustrated in fig 6 by using eqs 11 and 12 a fracture with a dimensionless length of 0 4 and a dimensionless width of 0 02 is placed in a dual porosity reservoir with a storativity ratio of ω 0 01 and an interporosity flow coefficient of λ 0 01 to show the impact of the reservoir anisotropy the diffusivity coefficient in the x direction is η x 1 while it is η y 0 1 i n t h e y d i r e c t i o n in agreement with the results obtained by dejam et al 2018 the early linear flow volumetric depletion of natural fractures natural fracture radial flow transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fractures and matrix radial flow and pseudo steady state flow are observed at the early stages of production for infinite fracture conductivity cases without skin and wellbore storage effects the fluid flows linearly from the formation to the hydraulic fracture kuchuk and biryukov 2015 this flow regime is recognized by a linear relationship between p wd and t d 1 2 in the cartesian coordinates and a straight line is obtained with a slope of 1 2 in the log log plot p wd versus t d after the early linear flow regime the fluid in the natural fractures is depleted volumetrically the volumetric depletion of the natural fractures is indicated by a linear behavior with a unit slope for both dimensionless pressure and its derivative e g p wd and d p wd d l n t d versus dimensionless time t d naturally fractured reservoirs are characterized by the interporosity flow coefficient λ and the storativity ratio ω warren and root 1963 the interporosity flow coefficient represents how easily fluid is transferred from the matrix to the natural fractures it is controlled by the ratio of the matrix permeability to the natural fracture permeability see eq 5i the storativity ratio is used to represent the ratio of natural fractures fluid capacitance to the total fluid capacitance see eq 5h the dual porosity reservoirs behavior will approach the single porosity reservoir when ω 1 or λ after the volumetric depletion of natural fracture flow regime the radial flow through the natural fractures is observed since the pseudo steady state formulation is used as the transfer rate from the matrix to the natural fractures in the current study see eq 2 the flow regime transition from the natural fracture radial flow to the total both natural fractures and matrix radial flow is indicated by a sharp dip in the derivative plot d p wd d l n t d versus t d in the log log scale the reservoir is assumed to act bounded therefore the pseudo steady state flow regime appears instead of total radial flow at the late time this flow regime is demonstrated by a straight line with a unit slope for both p wd and d p wd d l n t d versus t d in the log log plot 3 3 productivity behavior and physical optimization of finite conductivity hydraulic fracture due to the pressure drop along the length of hydraulic fractures the finite conductivity hydraulic fracture assumption is reasonable the dvs method is used to study the pressure and production behaviours in the finite hydraulic fracture a single fracture in a single porosity reservoir with a fixed proppant number n p 0 01 is considered and the fracture is discretized into 8 segments fig 7 illustrates the dimensionless productivity index j d values versus dimensionless fracture conductivity c fd based on the outputs obtained by the separation of variables and the lt ffct solution approaches in fig 7 there is a good match between both methods of solution at the pseudo steady state flow condition the inflection behavior at low dimensionless fracture conductivity c fd conditions is due to the low number of segments romero 2001 the insufficient number of sentences of lt ffct and gibbs phenomenon may cause small mismatching when the dimensionless fracture conductivity c fd is h i g h however the optimum points of both methods are the same confirming the capability of the lt ffct to achieve the optimized hydraulic fracture design when the optimum dimensionless fracture conductivity is determined the optimum fracture geometry can be identified and the physical optimization of hydraulic fracture design is completed marongiu porcu et al 2013 now the accuracy reliability of the lt ffct to evaluate the hydraulic fracture design performance is verified by comparing the results of this study with the outputs of the separation of variables method in the single porosity case next step is the evaluation of fracture performance in the dual porosity reservoir first the effect of storativity ratio on the productivity index is discussed storativity ratio quantifies the relative natural fracture storage capacity of a dual porosity reservoir the storativity ratio affects the depth of generated dip in the derivative pressure during the transition from natural fracture radial flow to total natural fracture and matrix radial flow this parameter is normally in the range of 0 01 ω 0 1 dejam et al 2013 which is also examined in the current study fig 8 demonstrates the effects of storativity ratio ω on the dimensionless productivity index of a hydraulic fracture j d versus dimensionless time t d in a dual porosity reservoir in this case the proppant number is n p 0 01 the dimensionless conductivity of the fracture is assumed to be c fd 1 6 which is the optimum point in the former case see the maximum point in fig 7 and the reservoir is considered at the isotropic condition η x η y 1 with λ 10 to increase the accuracy of the results the hydraulic fracture is discretized into 16 segments the single porosity case has a higher dimensionless productivity compared to dual porosity cases as the storativity ratio decreases the dimensionless productivity index decreases when all the other parameters are the same decreasing the storativity ratio leads to a decrease in the available storage capacity to produce this causes a reduction in the dimensionless productivity index dejam et al 2018 showed that a higher storativity ratio results in a lower dimensionless pressure before the pseudo steady state flow regime starts similarly a higher storativity ratio causes a greater dimensionless productivity index the inner plot in fig 8 is used to magnify a part of the plot as it is shown in the inner plot the earlier natural fracture radial flow is observed in the lower storativity ratio cases the lower storativity ratio results in a longer transition time between the natural fracture radial flow and total radial flow and consequently a longer time between the natural fracture radial flow and pseudo steady state flow regimes however the onset time of pseudo steady state where the dimensionless productivity index does not change with time is independent of the storativity ratio the ability of the matrix for directing fluid flow toward the natural fracture network is represented by the interporosity flow coefficient λ which depends on the shape factor matrix to fracture permeability ratio and the square of the dimensionless length scale l see eq 5i the beginning time of transition between the natural fracture radial flow to total matrix and natural fracture radial flow is controlled by the interporosity flow coefficient this coefficient shows the promptness of the matrix response to the pressure changes the range of 0 01 λ 100 was used by dejam et al 2018 to study the impact of infinite conductivity hydraulic fracture on the transient pressure behavior of a vertical well in a dual porosity reservoir the same range is also considered in the current case study fig 9 represents the impact of interporosity flow coefficient λ on the dimensionless productivity index j d at various dimensionless times t d in a dual porosity reservoir like the previous case the proppant number dimensionless conductivity of the fracture and diffusivity coefficients are fixed at n p 0 01 c fd 1 6 and η x η y 1 respectively the storativity ratio is equal for all cases which is ω 0 01 to keep the accuracy of the model at an acceptable level the fracture is discretized into 16 segments in the dvs method the results presented in fig 9 reveal that increasing interporosity flow coefficient increases the dimensionless productivity index the speed of matrix response to pressure change is thus increased leading to a faster support of producing flow by matrix since the storativity ratios of all dual porosity cases are the same the same performance is observed at the beginning before the early linear flow is terminated the duration of volumetric depletion decreases as the interporosity flow coefficient increases the pseudo steady state flow regime where the dimensionless productivity index is invariant with dimensionless time occurs earlier a higher interporosity flow coefficient can be interpreted as a higher matrix permeability therefore faster response to the pressure variations in the natural fracture network might be the reason for earlier flow regime changes in the higher interporosity cases figs 8 and 9 clearly show that the dual porosity reservoir parameters can affect the productivity index hence the proposed solution in eq 11 should be used to estimate the productivity index of the dual porosity reservoirs asadi et al 2018 concluded that the optimum fracture design in the pseudo steady state flow regime is the optimal case for all flow regimes before pseudo steady state in the single porosity reservoirs the same conclusion should be made for the dual porosity reservoirs as well fig 10 depicts the dimensionless productivity index j d for different dimensionless fracture conductivities c fd versus dimensionless time t d for a dual porosity reservoir system the proppant number interporosity coefficient storativity ratio and diffusivity coefficients are assumed to be fixed for all cases where n p 0 01 ω 0 01 λ 10 and η x η y 1 respectively the inner plot in fig 10 demonstrates the fractured well performance at the pseudo steady state flow regime as it is evident from fig 10 any design which has the maximum productivity at the pseudo steady state has the highest productivity for all flow regimes before the pseudo steady state condition therefore the physical or dimensional optimization of hydraulic fracture design can be conducted based on the pseudo steady state flow regime results 3 4 economic optimization as mentioned earlier every hydraulic fracturing design has two types of parameters namely decision variables and design parameters design parameter does not change for each fracture design whereas the decision variable can change while optimizing the hydraulic fracturing design to find the optimum decision parameter an economic evaluation should be performed the production is estimated based on the physical optimization of the hydraulic fracture design the net present value npv is selected as an objective function for the economic optimization analysis npv is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash inflow and the present value of the cash outflow during a specified time period fig 11 illustrates the economic evaluation of a hydraulic fracture design of an mfhw case when proppant mass is selected as a decision variable a horizontal well with 4 stages of fracturing e g 4 hydraulic fractures is considered in a dual porosity reservoir the reservoir properties and economic data are the same as provided by asadi et al 2018 as the main parameters the values for the interporosity coefficient and storativity ratio are assumed to be λ 10 and ω 0 01 respectively the maximum value of the npv determines the optimum magnitude of the proppant mass and also identifies the optimum fracture geometries the calculated optimum dimensionless fracture conductivity c f d opt can be used to obtain the optimum fracture length and width see ref asadi et al 2018 other variables such as the number of fractures proppant type and flow injection rate can be also selected as the decision variable bhattacharya and nikolaou 2016 conducted a global optimization of hydraulic fracture design so that they optimized multi decision variables furthermore multi objective optimization can be performed to optimize other objectives such as reservoir and production uncertainties in the production operation podhoretz and valko 2014 highlighting another practical implication of the proposed modeling strategy groundwater contamination is a health related and environmental issue that may arise from various contaminants with different sources guerin et al 2002 obiri nyarko et al 2014 wiafe et al 2014 the remediation is a time consuming costly and large scale process particularly when the groundwater resources are low permeable and unconventional in terms of formation characteristics based on the national research council report at least 126 000 contaminated sites in the united states require continuous management in terms of contaminant detection characterization and mitigation while the cost of cleanup is estimated to exceed 110 127 billion council 2013 mfhw can be an appropriate option to decrease the capital and operating costs at large scales 4 summary and conclusions a new mathematical model is derived to investigate the finite infinite conductivity performance of the multi fractured horizontal well mfhw in dual porosity reservoirs the position of the hydraulic fracture is determined by two heaviside functions using the two dimensional diffusivity equation the laplace transform lt with respect to time and finite fourier cosine transform ffct with respect to both spatial directions are applied to obtain the semi analytical solution of the unsteady steady state diffusivity equation in a bounded domain the proposed model can be employed to calculate the mfhw productivity and obtain the optimal production in terms of economic prospective the accuracy of the proposed solution is verified by the solution which is developed by the separation of variables method in the single porosity reservoir case the gibbs phenomenon impact is emphasized to show the importance of choosing the proper number of sentences terms in the solution by considering the infinite fracture conductivity different flow regimes are observed where the dimensionless pressure and its derivative versus time are plotted the determined flow regimes include early linear flow with a half slope line in the log log plot of d p wd d l n t d versus t d volumetric depletion of the natural fracture with a unit slope line in the log log plot of p wd versus t d natural fracture radial flow transition of natural fracture radial flow to total matrix and fracture radial flow and pseudo steady state flow with a unit slope line for both dimensionless pressure p wd and its derivative d p wd d l n t d versus t d to study the productivity of the finite conductivity fracture case first the accuracy of the solution is examined by comparing the corresponding outputs with the results of separation of variables in the single porosity case then a sensitivity analysis is carried out on the dual porosity case to investigate the productivity index at various conditions the storativity ratio has more effect on the productivity index at the transient flow condition compared to the pseudo steady state flow condition the storativity ratio affects the flow regimes onset time except the characteristic time for the pseudo steady state on the other hand the interporosity coefficient has a greater impact on the productivity index of the pseudo steady state flow regime compared to other regimes lower interporosity coefficient causes that the pseudo steady state regime happens later sensitivity analysis of the storativity ratio and interporosity coefficient show the high prominence of dual porosity reservoir parameters in the magnitude of the productivity index it is proven that the optimum fractured design based on the pseudo steady state has the maximum productivity in all flow regimes this confirms that the optimum fracture geometry on the basis of the pseudo steady state can be considered as the optimum fracture design for all flow regimes thus it can be used for estimation of production in dual porosity reservoirs the economic assessment is conducted to determine the optimum proppant mass as a decision variable using the net present value or npv as the objective function the reservoir properties are assumed homogenous in the current study it is expected that assessment of induced permeability and pressure stress sensitive properties in the dual porosity reservoirs is a promising future research declaration of

flow direction in the hydraulic fracture pseudo steady state flow condition is considered for the fluid flow inside the fracture hence the pressure drop inside the fracture between the center point of each segment and the reference wellbore pressure can be calculated by darcy s law for instance the fracture in fig b 1 is discretized into six segments and the wellbore reference point is located in the middle of the fracture between segments 3 and 4 the pressure drop is obtained as follows b1 p i p wf μ 2 w y h k hf x i x wf q d x where p wf represents the pressure at the wellbore and x wf determines the wellbore location the flow rate at each segment is considered as a linear function of length because each segment is assumed to be a uniform flux source the calculation points are at

5876,semi distributed models such as swmm have become effective tools for quantifying the urban nonpoint source nps pollution however these models could not provide detailed overland routing simulations and often face the difficulty in collecting data of municipal drainage network due to confidentiality requirements in this study the cellular automate ca based overland routing algorithm was coupled to the swmm for providing reliable nps pollution simulations the ca swmm was validated in a typical small urban catchment with scarce municipal drainage data the results indicated a significant improvement of performances could be obtained by the ca swmm in both rainfall runoff and nps pollution simulations compared to the swmm as a distributed model the scale effect exists for the ca swmm where the appropriate cell resolution should guarantee most of the cells to be homogeneous in land cover configuration and the heterogeneous cells to be configured just by roofs and ground land covers the input data could be used as references for choosing cell resolution because the ca would seldom work in tracking the inner routing between land uses when the cell size is larger than most of the sewer inlet intervals the results of this study provide reliable tool for advanced overland routing simulations of nps pollution as well as the optimal design of low development practices especially for those data scarce regions keywords urban nonpoint source pollution cellular automata swmm data scarcity scale effect sponge city 1 introduction semi distributed models are the most widely adopted methods for simulating rainfall runoff predicting the spatial and temporal distributions and quantifying the emission loads of nonpoint source nps pollution chang and li 2017 shin et al 2017 chen et al 2018 with the fast urbanization urban inundation and nps pollution are becoming more and more serious due to the expansive impervious lands dense municipal drainage network and intensive human activities ullah et al 2018 in this context semi distributed models have been widely used to evaluate the effects of storm water and nps pollution management measures and aid the design of measures such as low impact development lid green infrastructure gi and sponge city construction li et al 2018 hamouz and muthanna 2019 luan et al 2019 semi distributed models usually use the sub catchment as the calculation unit for overland processes and require detailed spatial information including topography land use land cover soil type and details about municipal drainage network as essential input data to represent the spatial heterogeneity and provide parameter values xu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 however data scarcity often hinders the effective applications of these models for example in urban catchments the municipal drainage network data exert a significant influence on the simulation of nps pollution by determining parameter values for pipe routing calculations and providing a major reference for sub catchment delineation peterson and wicks 2006 zhou et al 2019 however due to the high human resource costs for field investigations the lack of records in some older catchments or confidentiality requirements detailed municipal drainage data are difficult to collect typically drainage data are often available for trunk roads but are deficient for pipelines with smaller diameters and have limited spatial resolutions some previous studies have manifested the impacts of the resolution of municipal drainage network data on urban hydrology for example krebs et al 2014 and ghosh 2010 both reported that peak flows could be affected by the spatial resolution of model subdivision park et al 2008 reported that the accumulated bod loads at the surface could be underestimated if several sub catchments with various land covers were aggregated our previous research dai et al 2018 also found the predicted nps pollution load responded sensitively to the spatial resolution of input data however few studies have investigated how to improve the simulation performance when only coarse municipal drainage data was available the storm water management model swmm is one of the most commonly used semi distributed models rosa et al 2015 johannessen et al 2019 and was took as an example as a model customized for urban catchment swmm boasts powerful capabilities in the sewer network routing simulations however as a semi distributed model the sub catchment based routing algorithm for the runoff component could limit the spatial heterogeneity presented in the overland routing simulations especially when the drainage data is insufficient to delineate high resolution sub catchments in this study we aimed to construct ca swmm by integrating the swmm with the cellular automata ca method retaining the powerful pipe routing module of swmm but replacing its overland routing module by a ca based algorithm the ca method was firstly proposed in the 1950s as a system with discretized temporal and spatial dimensions the ca allows to represent the evolution of a complex phenomenon from simple local transition to the global dynamic change therefore the ca has been usually applied as an efficient simulation model for many natural phenomena murray and paola 1994 folino et al 2006 zhang and kwok 2013 abbasizadeh et al 2018 liu et al 2014 in recent years there also emerged some studies that applied the ca to simulate overland such as the runca model by shao et al 2015 the hillslope scale ecohydrological model by mendicino et al 2013 and the ca based unsteady flow model by parsons and fonstad 2010 the ca based algorithm used in this study has been developed in our previous study which constructed a ca based urban hydrology and nps pollution model ca hnpsm dai et al 2019 by a fully distributed overland routing and simplified sewer routing algorithm the ca hnpsm could describe detailed overland routing process along the land covers and effectively reduce the model s dependence on sewer network data in this study the integration of ca hnpsm with swmm and the performance of the integrated model ca swmm were focused on in addition as the calculation unit of the ca based algorithm the spatial resolution of the cell grids critically affects the simulation results theoretically a higher resolution could lead to a more accurate simulation but would consume more computing resources therefore we also focused on the appropriate spatial resolution domain when applying the ca to improve swmm performance the specific objectives of this study are 1 constructing the ca swmm for those catchments with scarce municipal drainage data 2 identifying the spatial scale effect of ca swmm 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection a typical urban catchment located in beijing normal university beijing china was selected as the study area this catchment drains an area of 43 52 ha with a high imperviousness of approximately 65 the land covers can be categorized into eight types including road concrete block pavement roof asphalt surfaces green lands sports fields with natural turf sports fields with artificial turf and mixed land use the overall terrain of the study area is characterized by flatness and an average surface slope of 1 7 the catchment belongs to a warm and semi humid continental monsoon climate zone with annual mean temperatures of 10 12 c and average annual rainfall of 500 600 mm the rainy season generally lasts from june to august and contributes almost 80 of the annual rainfall shen et al 2015 separate municipal drainage systems for rain and sewage were implemented for this catchment the storm water network consists of circular pipes with diameters ranging from 100 to 900 mm and this network drains runoff to an outfall that connects the municipal network the basic data required for this study including the land cover data 5 m 5 m dem data 5 m 5 m and the sewer inlet locations provided by the local logistics department the rainfall data recorded by a hobo automated meteorological station onset bourne ma usa the discharge flows recorded at five minute interval during july september 2014 by a current metre combined with a water level sensor hach fl900 installed at the outfall the pollution concentrations of the discharge flows sampled manually and analysed during five independent rainfall events table 1 the above data were essential for modelling the ca based overland module and the module s calibration and validation as for the sewer pipe module detailed drainage data including the pipes physical and geometry parameters and the spatial topology for the entire pipe network were also required 2 2 the construction of ca swmm 2 2 1 swmm with drainage data at different levels of detail swmm consists of two major components including the runoff component and the routing component the runoff component treats sub catchments as calculation units when simulating the generation of runoff and nps pollution then the runoff and pollutant loads are transported by the routing component through a municipal drainage system until the outfalls gironás et al 2010 in this study only the routing component were integrated into the ca swmm as the sewer routing module the dynamic wave theory was selected to analyse the routing process in the sewer conveyance system by solving the complete form of one dimensional st venant equations the dynamic wave analysis account for most of the flow conditions making the solution appropriate for any general network layout but highly dependent on detailed municipal drainage data the pollution constituents transported simultaneously following a first order decay caused by advection transport longitudinal dispersion and reactions martin and mccutcheon 1999 a commercial software program pcswmm was adopted as the platform to run the swmm engine smith and banting 2005 the swmm models with two sets of municipal drainage data at different levels of detail were both used the two models named as swmm dd swmm model with detailed drainage data and swmm sd swmm model with scarce drainage data have already been developed and calibrated in our previous study dai et al 2018 the swmm dd delineated the study area into 749 sub catchments and was regarded as a high resolution model to provide the reference for satisfying simulation performances while the swmm sd only delineated 22 subcatchments and its sewer routing module was derived to integrate with ca hnpsm the maps of catchment discretization for swmm dd and swmm sd were also shown in figure s 1 in the supplementary material for the readability of this study 2 2 2 ca setup with different spatial resolutions the ca based overland component has been developed in our previous study dai et al 2019 and was derived to be coupled with swmm in this study the ca delineates the study area into grid cells as the calculation units for overland flow simulations in each grid cell the runoff generation mechanism was similar to that of swmm which forms excess runoff after deducting the rainfall losses caused by ponding interception and infiltration however the overland flow routing was simulated by an evolution from the local interactions between cells within a neighbourhood to the global dynamic which is different from the sub catchment based algorithm in the swmm specifically in each von neumann neighbourhood the minimum difference algorithm mda gregorio and serra 1999 was designed to automatically identify the flow directions from the central cell to its neighbours in four cardinal directions by comparing the water surface elevation on this basis manning s equation was used to calculate the exchange runoff volumes and the exponential pollutant wash off equation used for calculating the washed off pollution loads in addition to the newly washed off loads the pollution outflow also include the pollutants contained in the current runoff then the runoff depth and nps pollution loads in each cell evolved globally by considering both outflows and inflows based on the fact that each central cell could also be a neighbour cell in other neighbourhood compared to the semi distributed overland algorithm of swmm the ca treated each cell as a calculation unit and thus could track the hydrology and nps pollution interactions between different land covers even if they were delineated into one sub catchment therefore integrating the ca with the swmm sd is expected to compensate for the deficiency in the inner routing simulation and improve the model performance the exchange volume of runoff water between neighboring cells is calculated using the manning equation 1 q 1 49 r e 2 3 s 1 2 n r e t s b where q represents the outflow runoff rate per unit area from the central cell to a specific neighboring cell at a timestep mm b represents the side length of a square cell mm n is the manning coefficient and s represents the water surface slope the washed off pollutant loads in each cell during a given timestep are calculated by the most oft cited exponential function which was first proposed by sartor and boyd sartor et al 1974 2 w k w q n w m b t s where w represents the washed off mass load mg k w is the wash off coefficient mm h nw h 1 n w represents the wash off exponent m b represents the remaining pollutant accumulation in a cell mg which is initially calculated by a saturated function partially removed by street sweeping during dry periods and gradually reduced with the wash off process butcher 2003 3 m b b max a d k b a d a 1 s s e w t 1 where m b represents the remaining pollutant accumulation on a cell surface mg b max represents the maximum possible cumulative load of a pollutant per area mg mm2 k b is a semisaturated accumulation constant which is equal to the days required to reach half of b max ad represents the antecedent number of dry days d sse represents the removal ratio of accumulated pollutants via street sweeping and w t 1 represents the washed off mass loads in the last timestep mg the total pollution load outflow from a single cell is calculated as 4 l q t s a 10 6 c w where l represents the discharged pollutant load from the central cell to a specific neighboring cell during a timestep mg and c represents the pollutant concentration in the current runoff discharge mg l the net inflow into each cell is calculated by the difference between the total inflow from neighboring cells and the total outflow into neighboring cells 5 q i j q i 1 j q i j 1 q i j 1 q i 1 j q i j 6 l i j l i 1 j l i j 1 l i j 1 l i 1 j l i j to analyse the spatial scale effect of the ca method eight spatial resolutions were designed for grid cells 5 5 m 10 10 m 20 20 m 30 30 m 40 40 m 50 50 m 60 60 m and 80 80 m these models were named as cr 5 cr 10 cr 20 cr 30 cr 40 cr 50 cr 60 and cr 80 respectively the highest resolution 5 5 m was designed to match with the raster resolution of the input data thus guaranteeing the spatial attributes such as the land cover surface elevation of each cell grid to be homogeneous and fully representing the spatial heterogeneity of the input data in the model then the spatial resolution was designed to decrease gradually based on the highest resolution considering the possible more sensitive response 5 m cell size interval were firstly set for the higher resolution range and then the cell size increased step by step by 10 m cell size interval to detect the turning point of the change trend of simulation results when the resolution decreases to be 80 80 m the sewer inlets covered most the cells and make almost each cell to be an independent sub catchment while few hydrological connection exist between adjacent cells therefore 80 80 m was set to be the lowest resolution in this study as the model with furtherly degraded resolution could be regarded as the equivalent of a semi distributed model with the increase in the cell size the spatial attributes of each grid consequently transferred from being homogeneous to be heterogeneous the land cover allocations in cells and the cell attribute with different spatial resolutions are listed in table 2 for heterogeneous cells especially when the impervious and pervious lands were included in one cell the runoff and nps pollution generation mechanisms varied for subareas of different land covers in one cell the inner routing between different land covers within a heterogeneous cell also exerts influence on the total runoff and nps pollution generation for the cell in addition the allocation of inflow from neighbour cells to each subarea of a central cell became more complicated therefore more assumptions were supplemented on the basis of the constructed ca based overland routing algorithm dai et al 2019 to adapt to the lower spatial resolution specifically the supplementary assumptions are as follows first the subarea ratio was introduced into the ca algorithm as a parameter depicting the area proportion of different land covers of each cell this parameter could be obtained by analysing the land use input data using the zonal statistics tool of arcmap the runoff and nps pollution generated in the subareas of each cell were calculated according to their land use type and then summed as the total quantity generated in a cell formulas 7 and 8 7 re i 1 n r i p i e i i i ds i d i where i represents the subarea number in a cell n represents the number of subareas in a cell re represents the total runoff depth of a cell mm r i represents the discrete rainfall on subarea i mm p i represents the rainwater intercepted by vegetation on subarea i mm e i represents the evapotranspiration from subarea the i mm i i represents the infiltrated rainwater on pervious subarea i mm ds i represents the rainwater stored in depressions on the land surface of subarea i mm and d i represents the rainwater of subarea i drained by roof downspouts or sewer system inlets 8 l i 1 n q i t s a i 10 6 c i w i where l represents the total nps pollution loads generated in a cell mg q i represents the outflow runoff rate per unit area from the subarea i in the central cell to a specific neighbouring cell at a timestep mm ts represents the time step size s a i is the area of subarea i mm2 c i represents the nps pollution concentration of the runoff outflow from subarea i and w i represents the washed off pollutant loads from subarea i second when a cell contained roof and other land cover types simultaneously and there were also downspouts allocated in the cell the inner routing from the roof top to the land surfaces would be simulated for the cell the outflows from the roof subarea were assumed to be distributed to other surficial subareas according to their area proportion however when only surficial land cover types were contained in a cell the possible inner routing between the subareas was not considered third when using the mda to identify the routing direction the minimum water surface elevation of the subareas was regarded to represent the water surface elevation of the whole cell and used to determine the routing directions finally the inflow from upstream cells was distributed to each subarea according their area proportions 2 2 3 integrated model the construction framework of the ca swmm is shown in fig 1 the sub catchment was first delineated in pcswmm according to the municipal drainage data the sub catchment layer was then transferred from a shapefile to a raster data carrying the numbering information of sub catchment polygons and then imported into the ca hnpsm in the ca hnpsm the overland area of the study catchment was generalized into a two dimensional grid lattice by overlaying the grid lattice with the sub catchment layer the grid cells within a scope of each sub catchment were assigned with the corresponding sub catchment number thus categorizing the overland cells into different sub catchments the coupling interface of the integrated model was the sewer junction of each sub catchment in swmm which were treated by the ca hnpsm as the outfall for sewer inlets within the corresponding sub catchment scope to be specific in ca module the overland routing process was simulated for each sub catchment respectively to obtain the time series data of runoff and pollution inflows for sewer inlets then the manhattan distances of the sewer inlets to their corresponding sub catchment outfalls were calculated as the routing distances which were generalized as a set of separate 1d lattice spaces for the simulation of subsurface pipe routing from the sewer inlets to outfalls dai et al 2019 for each sub catchment the hydrographs and pollute graphs at the end of its 1d spaces were summed up by the time area method her and heatwol 2016 to be the total inflows of the sub catchment s outfall thus minimize the dependence on detailed drainage network data the time series data of the total inflows of each sub catchment outfall were automatically saved as an external file in a compatible format with pcswmm the saving path was set to be the same as the external file path for the sewer junction inflows in pcswmm thus implementing the direct call of the simulation results from the ca module when running the swmm module the model parameters such as the rainfall intensity land surface elevations land cover type code and the physical and geometrical parameters of sewer pipes were derived from the input data directly while other critical parameters were determined by calibration and validation table 3 the overland hydrological and water quality parameters were set according to land cover type for the ca module to represent the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall runoff and nps pollution process as for the simulation conditions a fixed timestep was set for the ca based overland routing algorithm while a variable time step for the dynamic wave algorithm of the pipe routing module in swmm to guarantee the simulation continuity and numerical stability as much as possible the timestep size should be lower than the minimum transition time between neighboring cells for the ca module and be no longer than the time it takes for a dynamic wave to travel the length of the conduit for the swmm module cunge et al 1980 as the time series inflow results at 1 min interval simulated by ca were the only driven data for the pipe routing module of swmm the time step size of swmm were also set according to the temporal scale of the output of ca module a test of different timestep sizes was conducted to seek for the appropriate ones based on an overall consideration of both the model performance and the simulation efficiency the timestep size was set as 1 s for the overland routing simulation and 0 5 s for the pipe routing simulation 2 2 4 calibration of the integrated model ideally a two steps calibration could be conducted for the integrated model including the calibration of the ca hnpsm and then the calibration of the pipe routing module of the swmm when calibrating the ca hnpsm the observations at the outfalls of each sub catchment would provide an ideal reference for optimizing the model parameters however this method would undoubtedly increase the field monitoring workload considering that the design and construction of urban land covers usually follow certain standards or specifications the parameters for a specific land cover type even those located in different sub catchments could be regarded as being highly consistent therefore our study regards the same kind of land cover to be consistent in parameters and only calibrates the ca hnpsm based on the simulation and observation results at the catchment outfall the model performances were evaluated by the matching degrees between the simulated and observed results which were quantified by indicators including the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the coefficient of determination r2 based on the calibrated ca module the parameter for the pipe routing module of the swmm was further adjusted by the sensitivity based radio tuning calibration srtc tool which is a built in function of pcswmm the srtc set the uncertainty for each parameter to be calibrated and calculated the parameter value range using formula 11 and formula 12 based on the initial value the simulation results were then obtained for the upper limit and the lower limit of the parameter values by changing the parameter value within the value range the corresponding change in the simulation results in the form of a hydrograph and pollution concentration graph could be visualized when a good fitness between the simulated and observed values was achieved the optimized parameter value could be determined 9 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 10 r 2 c o v o i p i v a r o i v a r p i 2

ca swmm the calibration results are listed in table 3 the calibrated parameters and their values are listed in table 4 the simulation results for the five monitored rainfall events are shown in fig 2 for the runoff flow the ca swmm tended to overestimate the peak flow in the torrential rainfall 0831 in addition the simulated hydrographs in the light rainfall 0804 and 0926 lagged slightly compared with the observed time series data despite these differences the performances of the ca swmm were generally satisfactory as the nse and r2 values exceeded 0 5 and 0 7 respectively for all rainfall events except the 0831 rainfall for the water quality the ca swmm performed better for the cod simulation which was indicated by the nse and r2 values being larger than 0 5 and 0 7 respectively for most of the rainfall events except for rainfall 0804 and 0926 the performances of the nh4n simulations were inferior to those of cod but were also acceptable with positive nse values except for that of the 0830 rainfall the performances of the tp simulation were also satisfactory during the calibrated events 0729 0830 and 0926 as the nse and r2 values exceeded 0 5 and acceptable for the validated events 0804 0831 regarding the positive nse values compared with the observations the performance of the ca swmm could be judged as being good especially for heavy rainfall events however the model performance was relatively poor for light rainfall events 0804 which was supposed to be due to the following reasons first the overland flow process during a light rainfall event was more sensitive to some local micro topography features which are difficult to measure and quantify melesse et al 2007 in addition the details of the secondary sewer network structures such as the ponding capacity of manholes were not considered due to data availability which would have more impact on the model performance during light rainfall events dirksen et al 2014 overall the integrated model showed good performance in simulating hydrographs and pollution graphs at the catchment outlet 3 2 simulation results comparison between the ca swmm and swmm the swmm dd and swmm sd have been calibrated in our previous study and their model performances are list in fig 3 for comparison purposes compared to the swmm dd the performances of the ca swmm with scarce drainage data generally remained at a satisfactory level however for the swmm sd the model performance was significantly degraded and caused an over estimation of runoff flow and an under estimation of pollution concentrations the comparisons indicate an obvious effect of the ca module in improving the model performance of the swmm sd by refining the simulation of the overland routing process as a fully distributed algorithm ca identifies the routing process between different land cover cells automatically the accuracy of the overland routing simulation by ca mainly depends on the resolution of the input land use data and dem data but seldom influenced by the resolution of drainage network data therefore in the ca swmm with scarce drainage data but higher resolution land use data the overland routing between different land uses especially from impervious to pervious lands could still be captured which is critical for the simulation of infiltration losses and significantly influences the final simulation results three rainfall events 0729 0831 and 0926 were took as examples as they had relatively better model performances and represented different rainfall types their simulated infiltration losses for runoff and nps pollutants are shown in table 5 as shown the infiltration losses of swmm sd decreased considerably compared to those of the swmm dd but increased to return to values near those of the swmm dd after coupling with ca in the ca swmm indicating a better model performance in simulating the overland routing process as an aiding tool for lid the underestimated infiltration loss due to the resolution degradation of swmm sd would lead to the overestimation of lid inflows and influence the prediction of the lid performances in controlling the peak flow runoff volume and nps pollution loads rossman and huber 2016 xu et al 2019 by coupling the ca module to adjust overland flow simulation more accurate simulations of both runoff flow and water quality could be expected to provide a more realistic reference for lid design and a more accurate effect evaluation 3 3 the determination of proper data resolution in this section the rainfall events 0729 and 0926 were used to represent the heavy rainfall and light rainfall conditions respectively for the spatial scale effect analysis the simulated hydrographs and pollution concentration graphs at the catchment outfall by the ca swmm models with different spatial resolutions are shown in fig 4 the corresponding statistical results such as the runoff ratio the lag time of pick value the event mean concentration and the washed off ratio of pollutant accumulation were listed in table 6 as shown the hydrology simulation results including peak flows average flows and rainfall runoff ratio all increased especially when the spatial resolution degraded to be lower than 10 10 m while the lag time of the peak flow gradually declined as for nps pollution the change of peak concentrations with the degradation of spatial resolutions was not in a regular way taking the cod simulation of rainfall 0729 as an example the statistical results indicated that the pollutant wash off ratio and infiltration ratio of cod decreased from 61 89 to 24 44 and 61 32 to 9 46 respectively as the spatial resolution degraded table 6 the more significant scale effect also appeared after the spatial resolution degraded to be lower than 10 m 10 m the above results showed a threshold for the scale effect through a further analysis of nse and r2 fig 5 the results indicated that the model performances generally responded more significantly when the cell resolution degraded from 20 20 m to 40 40 m but stayed relatively stable within the resolution range of 5 5 m to 10 10 m and 50 50 m to 80 80 m by an overall consideration of the model performances in different rainfall conditions the 10 10 m could be regarded as the threshold scale as the cr model performances were generally acceptable with cell resolution equal or higher than it the change in the land use configuration was supposed to be the main reason for the scale effect in cr 5 and cr 10 the cells with single land cover still occupied most of the cells and only 24 7 of the cr 10 s cells were heterogeneous in land cover table 2 these few heterogeneous cells mainly consisted of roofs and ground land covers between which the inner routing was also considered in lower resolution models this fact indicated the standard of cell resolution for satisfying ca swmm performances in an urban catchment with a fragmented land use configuration as the resolution furtherly degraded increasing cell size could lead to more complicated land cover compositions in one cell and make the inner routing from the impervious lands to pervious lands tend to be easily neglected thus leading to the underestimation of infiltration loss and overestimation of the results for nps pollution the scale effect was also concerned with the pollutant wash off process as well as the neglected infiltration losses the land covers at lower elevations such as the road and impervious pavement were usually the main areas for pollutant accumulation during dry days when their inflow runoff was underestimated as the inner routing from higher elevation was neglected in lower resolution model the pollutant loads generated by washing off would corresponding decrease hur et al 2018 the influences on both the wash off process and the infiltration process made the scale effect of nps pollution manifest the flattening pollution concentration graph decreasing and lagging peak concentration as the spatial resolution degraded compared to the scale effects on the hydrology simulations the nps pollution simulation responded more significantly however the influences of inner routing between different land covers was just within a certain spatial scale in urban catchments with a dense distribution of sewer inlets the inner routing length is usually limited by the distribution interval of sewer inlets in this study when the spatial resolution was degraded to 50 m 50 m over 80 of the cells were covered by sewer inlets and became independent drainage units then the hydrological connection existed only between minorities of cells and resulted in less influence of further resolution degradation on the simulation results 4 conclusion in this study ca swmm was constructed to provide a reliable method for urban nps pollution simulations with scarce drainage network data only for trunk roads by coupling ca based overland routing model and the swmm with scarce drainage data swmm sd the ca swmm was tested in a typical small urban catchment and indicated a significant improvement of performances in both rainfall runoff and nps pollution simulations compared to the swmm sd the performance improvement was mainly attributed to the better depiction of the inner routing between different land covers as a distributed model the scale effect exists for the ca swmm where the appropriate cell resolution should guarantee most of the cells to be homogeneous in land cover configuration and the heterogeneous cells to be configured just by roofs and ground land covers when the cell size is larger than most of the sewer inlet intervals the ca would seldom work in tracking the inner routing between land uses based on the results the ca swmm provide reliable

5876,semi distributed models such as swmm have become effective tools for quantifying the urban nonpoint source nps pollution however these models could not provide detailed overland routing simulations and often face the difficulty in collecting data of municipal drainage network due to confidentiality requirements in this study the cellular automate ca based overland routing algorithm was coupled to the swmm for providing reliable nps pollution simulations the ca swmm was validated in a typical small urban catchment with scarce municipal drainage data the results indicated a significant improvement of performances could be obtained by the ca swmm in both rainfall runoff and nps pollution simulations compared to the swmm as a distributed model the scale effect exists for the ca swmm where the appropriate cell resolution should guarantee most of the cells to be homogeneous in land cover configuration and the heterogeneous cells to be configured just by roofs and ground land covers the input data could be used as references for choosing cell resolution because the ca would seldom work in tracking the inner routing between land uses when the cell size is larger than most of the sewer inlet intervals the results of this study provide reliable tool for advanced overland routing simulations of nps pollution as well as the optimal design of low development practices especially for those data scarce regions keywords urban nonpoint source pollution cellular automata swmm data scarcity scale effect sponge city 1 introduction semi distributed models are the most widely adopted methods for simulating rainfall runoff predicting the spatial and temporal distributions and quantifying the emission loads of nonpoint source nps pollution chang and li 2017 shin et al 2017 chen et al 2018 with the fast urbanization urban inundation and nps pollution are becoming more and more serious due to the expansive impervious lands dense municipal drainage network and intensive human activities ullah et al 2018 in this context semi distributed models have been widely used to evaluate the effects of storm water and nps pollution management measures and aid the design of measures such as low impact development lid green infrastructure gi and sponge city construction li et al 2018 hamouz and muthanna 2019 luan et al 2019 semi distributed models usually use the sub catchment as the calculation unit for overland processes and require detailed spatial information including topography land use land cover soil type and details about municipal drainage network as essential input data to represent the spatial heterogeneity and provide parameter values xu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 however data scarcity often hinders the effective applications of these models for example in urban catchments the municipal drainage network data exert a significant influence on the simulation of nps pollution by determining parameter values for pipe routing calculations and providing a major reference for sub catchment delineation peterson and wicks 2006 zhou et al 2019 however due to the high human resource costs for field investigations the lack of records in some older catchments or confidentiality requirements detailed municipal drainage data are difficult to collect typically drainage data are often available for trunk roads but are deficient for pipelines with smaller diameters and have limited spatial resolutions some previous studies have manifested the impacts of the resolution of municipal drainage network data on urban hydrology for example krebs et al 2014 and ghosh 2010 both reported that peak flows could be affected by the spatial resolution of model subdivision park et al 2008 reported that the accumulated bod loads at the surface could be underestimated if several sub catchments with various land covers were aggregated our previous research dai et al 2018 also found the predicted nps pollution load responded sensitively to the spatial resolution of input data however few studies have investigated how to improve the simulation performance when only coarse municipal drainage data was available the storm water management model swmm is one of the most commonly used semi distributed models rosa et al 2015 johannessen et al 2019 and was took as an example as a model customized for urban catchment swmm boasts powerful capabilities in the sewer network routing simulations however as a semi distributed model the sub catchment based routing algorithm for the runoff component could limit the spatial heterogeneity presented in the overland routing simulations especially when the drainage data is insufficient to delineate high resolution sub catchments in this study we aimed to construct ca swmm by integrating the swmm with the cellular automata ca method retaining the powerful pipe routing module of swmm but replacing its overland routing module by a ca based algorithm the ca method was firstly proposed in the 1950s as a system with discretized temporal and spatial dimensions the ca allows to represent the evolution of a complex phenomenon from simple local transition to the global dynamic change therefore the ca has been usually applied as an efficient simulation model for many natural phenomena murray and paola 1994 folino et al 2006 zhang and kwok 2013 abbasizadeh et al 2018 liu et al 2014 in recent years there also emerged some studies that applied the ca to simulate overland such as the runca model by shao et al 2015 the hillslope scale ecohydrological model by mendicino et al 2013 and the ca based unsteady flow model by parsons and fonstad 2010 the ca based algorithm used in this study has been developed in our previous study which constructed a ca based urban hydrology and nps pollution model ca hnpsm dai et al 2019 by a fully distributed overland routing and simplified sewer routing algorithm the ca hnpsm could describe detailed overland routing process along the land covers and effectively reduce the model s dependence on sewer network data in this study the integration of ca hnpsm with swmm and the performance of the integrated model ca swmm were focused on in addition as the calculation unit of the ca based algorithm the spatial resolution of the cell grids critically affects the simulation results theoretically a higher resolution could lead to a more accurate simulation but would consume more computing resources therefore we also focused on the appropriate spatial resolution domain when applying the ca to improve swmm performance the specific objectives of this study are 1 constructing the ca swmm for those catchments with scarce municipal drainage data 2 identifying the spatial scale effect of ca swmm 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data collection a typical urban catchment located in beijing normal university beijing china was selected as the study area this catchment drains an area of 43 52 ha with a high imperviousness of approximately 65 the land covers can be categorized into eight types including road concrete block pavement roof asphalt surfaces green lands sports fields with natural turf sports fields with artificial turf and mixed land use the overall terrain of the study area is characterized by flatness and an average surface slope of 1 7 the catchment belongs to a warm and semi humid continental monsoon climate zone with annual mean temperatures of 10 12 c and average annual rainfall of 500 600 mm the rainy season generally lasts from june to august and contributes almost 80 of the annual rainfall shen et al 2015 separate municipal drainage systems for rain and sewage were implemented for this catchment the storm water network consists of circular pipes with diameters ranging from 100 to 900 mm and this network drains runoff to an outfall that connects the municipal network the basic data required for this study including the land cover data 5 m 5 m dem data 5 m 5 m and the sewer inlet locations provided by the local logistics department the rainfall data recorded by a hobo automated meteorological station onset bourne ma usa the discharge flows recorded at five minute interval during july september 2014 by a current metre combined with a water level sensor hach fl900 installed at the outfall the pollution concentrations of the discharge flows sampled manually and analysed during five independent rainfall events table 1 the above data were essential for modelling the ca based overland module and the module s calibration and validation as for the sewer pipe module detailed drainage data including the pipes physical and geometry parameters and the spatial topology for the entire pipe network were also required 2 2 the construction of ca swmm 2 2 1 swmm with drainage data at different levels of detail swmm consists of two major components including the runoff component and the routing component the runoff component treats sub catchments as calculation units when simulating the generation of runoff and nps pollution then the runoff and pollutant loads are transported by the routing component through a municipal drainage system until the outfalls gironás et al 2010 in this study only the routing component were integrated into the ca swmm as the sewer routing module the dynamic wave theory was selected to analyse the routing process in the sewer conveyance system by solving the complete form of one dimensional st venant equations the dynamic wave analysis account for most of the flow conditions making the solution appropriate for any general network layout but highly dependent on detailed municipal drainage data the pollution constituents transported simultaneously following a first order decay caused by advection transport longitudinal dispersion and reactions martin and mccutcheon 1999 a commercial software program pcswmm was adopted as the platform to run the swmm engine smith and banting 2005 the swmm models with two sets of municipal drainage data at different levels of detail were both used the two models named as swmm dd swmm model with detailed drainage data and swmm sd swmm model with scarce drainage data have already been developed and calibrated in our previous study dai et al 2018 the swmm dd delineated the study area into 749 sub catchments and was regarded as a high resolution model to provide the reference for satisfying simulation performances while the swmm sd only delineated 22 subcatchments and its sewer routing module was derived to integrate with ca hnpsm the maps of catchment discretization for swmm dd and swmm sd were also shown in figure s 1 in the supplementary material for the readability of this study 2 2 2 ca setup with different spatial resolutions the ca based overland component has been developed in our previous study dai et al 2019 and was derived to be coupled with swmm in this study the ca delineates the study area into grid cells as the calculation units for overland flow simulations in each grid cell the runoff generation mechanism was similar to that of swmm which forms excess runoff after deducting the rainfall losses caused by ponding interception and infiltration however the overland flow routing was simulated by an evolution from the local interactions between cells within a neighbourhood to the global dynamic which is different from the sub catchment based algorithm in the swmm specifically in each von neumann neighbourhood the minimum difference algorithm mda gregorio and serra 1999 was designed to automatically identify the flow directions from the central cell to its neighbours in four cardinal directions by comparing the water surface elevation on this basis manning s equation was used to calculate the exchange runoff volumes and the exponential pollutant wash off equation used for calculating the washed off pollution loads in addition to the newly washed off loads the pollution outflow also include the pollutants contained in the current runoff then the runoff depth and nps pollution loads in each cell evolved globally by considering both outflows and inflows based on the fact that each central cell could also be a neighbour cell in other neighbourhood compared to the semi distributed overland algorithm of swmm the ca treated each cell as a calculation unit and thus could track the hydrology and nps pollution interactions between different land covers even if they were delineated into one sub catchment therefore integrating the ca with the swmm sd is expected to compensate for the deficiency in the inner routing simulation and improve the model performance the exchange volume of runoff water between neighboring cells is calculated using the manning equation 1 q 1 49 r e 2 3 s 1 2 n r e t s b where q represents the outflow runoff rate per unit area from the central cell to a specific neighboring cell at a timestep mm b represents the side length of a square cell mm n is the manning coefficient and s represents the water surface slope the washed off pollutant loads in each cell during a given timestep are calculated by the most oft cited exponential function which was first proposed by sartor and boyd sartor et al 1974 2 w k w q n w m b t s where w represents the washed off mass load mg k w is the wash off coefficient mm h nw h 1 n w represents the wash off exponent m b represents the remaining pollutant accumulation in a cell mg which is initially calculated by a saturated function partially removed by street sweeping during dry periods and gradually reduced with the wash off process butcher 2003 3 m b b max a d k b a d a 1 s s e w t 1 where m b represents the remaining pollutant accumulation on a cell surface mg b max represents the maximum possible cumulative load of a pollutant per area mg mm2 k b is a semisaturated accumulation constant which is equal to the days required to reach half of b max ad represents the antecedent number of dry days d sse represents the removal ratio of accumulated pollutants via street sweeping and w t 1 represents the washed off mass loads in the last timestep mg the total pollution load outflow from a single cell is calculated as 4 l q t s a 10 6 c w where l represents the discharged pollutant load from the central cell to a specific neighboring cell during a timestep mg and c represents the pollutant concentration in the current runoff discharge mg l the net inflow into each cell is calculated by the difference between the total inflow from neighboring cells and the total outflow into neighboring cells 5 q i j q i 1 j q i j 1 q i j 1 q i 1 j q i j 6 l i j l i 1 j l i j 1 l i j 1 l i 1 j l i j to analyse the spatial scale effect of the ca method eight spatial resolutions were designed for grid cells 5 5 m 10 10 m 20 20 m 30 30 m 40 40 m 50 50 m 60 60 m and 80 80 m these models were named as cr 5 cr 10 cr 20 cr 30 cr 40 cr 50 cr 60 and cr 80 respectively the highest resolution 5 5 m was designed to match with the raster resolution of the input data thus guaranteeing the spatial attributes such as the land cover surface elevation of each cell grid to be homogeneous and fully representing the spatial heterogeneity of the input data in the model then the spatial resolution was designed to decrease gradually based on the highest resolution considering the possible more sensitive response 5 m cell size interval were firstly set for the higher resolution range and then the cell size increased step by step by 10 m cell size interval to detect the turning point of the change trend of simulation results when the resolution decreases to be 80 80 m the sewer inlets covered most the cells and make almost each cell to be an independent sub catchment while few hydrological connection exist between adjacent cells therefore 80 80 m was set to be the lowest resolution in this study as the model with furtherly degraded resolution could be regarded as the equivalent of a semi distributed model with the increase in the cell size the spatial attributes of each grid consequently transferred from being homogeneous to be heterogeneous the land cover allocations in cells and the cell attribute with different spatial resolutions are listed in table 2 for heterogeneous cells especially when the impervious and pervious lands were included in one cell the runoff and nps pollution generation mechanisms varied for subareas of different land covers in one cell the inner routing between different land covers within a heterogeneous cell also exerts influence on the total runoff and nps pollution generation for the cell in addition the allocation of inflow from neighbour cells to each subarea of a central cell became more complicated therefore more assumptions were supplemented on the basis of the constructed ca based overland routing algorithm dai et al 2019 to adapt to the lower spatial resolution specifically the supplementary assumptions are as follows first the subarea ratio was introduced into the ca algorithm as a parameter depicting the area proportion of different land covers of each cell this parameter could be obtained by analysing the land use input data using the zonal statistics tool of arcmap the runoff and nps pollution generated in the subareas of each cell were calculated according to their land use type and then summed as the total quantity generated in a cell formulas 7 and 8 7 re i 1 n r i p i e i i i ds i d i where i represents the subarea number in a cell n represents the number of subareas in a cell re represents the total runoff depth of a cell mm r i represents the discrete rainfall on subarea i mm p i represents the rainwater intercepted by vegetation on subarea i mm e i represents the evapotranspiration from subarea the i mm i i represents the infiltrated rainwater on pervious subarea i mm ds i represents the rainwater stored in depressions on the land surface of subarea i mm and d i represents the rainwater of subarea i drained by roof downspouts or sewer system inlets 8 l i 1 n q i t s a i 10 6 c i w i where l represents the total nps pollution loads generated in a cell mg q i represents the outflow runoff rate per unit area from the subarea i in the central cell to a specific neighbouring cell at a timestep mm ts represents the time step size s a i is the area of subarea i mm2 c i represents the nps pollution concentration of the runoff outflow from subarea i and w i represents the washed off pollutant loads from subarea i second when a cell contained roof and other land cover types simultaneously and there were also downspouts allocated in the cell the inner routing from the roof top to the land surfaces would be simulated for the cell the outflows from the roof subarea were assumed to be distributed to other surficial subareas according to their area proportion however when only surficial land cover types were contained in a cell the possible inner routing between the subareas was not considered third when using the mda to identify the routing direction the minimum water surface elevation of the subareas was regarded to represent the water surface elevation of the whole cell and used to determine the routing directions finally the inflow from upstream cells was distributed to each subarea according their area proportions 2 2 3 integrated model the construction framework of the ca swmm is shown in fig 1 the sub catchment was first delineated in pcswmm according to the municipal drainage data the sub catchment layer was then transferred from a shapefile to a raster data carrying the numbering information of sub catchment polygons and then imported into the ca hnpsm in the ca hnpsm the overland area of the study catchment was generalized into a two dimensional grid lattice by overlaying the grid lattice with the sub catchment layer the grid cells within a scope of each sub catchment were assigned with the corresponding sub catchment number thus categorizing the overland cells into different sub catchments the coupling interface of the integrated model was the sewer junction of each sub catchment in swmm which were treated by the ca hnpsm as the outfall for sewer inlets within the corresponding sub catchment scope to be specific in ca module the overland routing process was simulated for each sub catchment respectively to obtain the time series data of runoff and pollution inflows for sewer inlets then the manhattan distances of the sewer inlets to their corresponding sub catchment outfalls were calculated as the routing distances which were generalized as a set of separate 1d lattice spaces for the simulation of subsurface pipe routing from the sewer inlets to outfalls dai et al 2019 for each sub catchment the hydrographs and pollute graphs at the end of its 1d spaces were summed up by the time area method her and heatwol 2016 to be the total inflows of the sub catchment s outfall thus minimize the dependence on detailed drainage network data the time series data of the total inflows of each sub catchment outfall were automatically saved as an external file in a compatible format with pcswmm the saving path was set to be the same as the external file path for the sewer junction inflows in pcswmm thus implementing the direct call of the simulation results from the ca module when running the swmm module the model parameters such as the rainfall intensity land surface elevations land cover type code and the physical and geometrical parameters of sewer pipes were derived from the input data directly while other critical parameters were determined by calibration and validation table 3 the overland hydrological and water quality parameters were set according to land cover type for the ca module to represent the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall runoff and nps pollution process as for the simulation conditions a fixed timestep was set for the ca based overland routing algorithm while a variable time step for the dynamic wave algorithm of the pipe routing module in swmm to guarantee the simulation continuity and numerical stability as much as possible the timestep size should be lower than the minimum transition time between neighboring cells for the ca module and be no longer than the time it takes for a dynamic wave to travel the length of the conduit for the swmm module cunge et al 1980 as the time series inflow results at 1 min interval simulated by ca were the only driven data for the pipe routing module of swmm the time step size of swmm were also set according to the temporal scale of the output of ca module a test of different timestep sizes was conducted to seek for the appropriate ones based on an overall consideration of both the model performance and the simulation efficiency the timestep size was set as 1 s for the overland routing simulation and 0 5 s for the pipe routing simulation 2 2 4 calibration of the integrated model ideally a two steps calibration could be conducted for the integrated model including the calibration of the ca hnpsm and then the calibration of the pipe routing module of the swmm when calibrating the ca hnpsm the observations at the outfalls of each sub catchment would provide an ideal reference for optimizing the model parameters however this method would undoubtedly increase the field monitoring workload considering that the design and construction of urban land covers usually follow certain standards or specifications the parameters for a specific land cover type even those located in different sub catchments could be regarded as being highly consistent therefore our study regards the same kind of land cover to be consistent in parameters and only calibrates the ca hnpsm based on the simulation and observation results at the catchment outfall the model performances were evaluated by the matching degrees between the simulated and observed results which were quantified by indicators including the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the coefficient of determination r2 based on the calibrated ca module the parameter for the pipe routing module of the swmm was further adjusted by the sensitivity based radio tuning calibration srtc tool which is a built in function of pcswmm the srtc set the uncertainty for each parameter to be calibrated and calculated the parameter value range using formula 11 and formula 12 based on the initial value the simulation results were then obtained for the upper limit and the lower limit of the parameter values by changing the parameter value within the value range the corresponding change in the simulation results in the form of a hydrograph and pollution concentration graph could be visualized when a good fitness between the simulated and observed values was achieved the optimized parameter value could be determined 9 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 10 r 2 c o v o i p i v a r o i v a r p i 2

ca swmm the calibration results are listed in table 3 the calibrated parameters and their values are listed in table 4 the simulation results for the five monitored rainfall events are shown in fig 2 for the runoff flow the ca swmm tended to overestimate the peak flow in the torrential rainfall 0831 in addition the simulated hydrographs in the light rainfall 0804 and 0926 lagged slightly compared with the observed time series data despite these differences the performances of the ca swmm were generally satisfactory as the nse and r2 values exceeded 0 5 and 0 7 respectively for all rainfall events except the 0831 rainfall for the water quality the ca swmm performed better for the cod simulation which was indicated by the nse and r2 values being larger than 0 5 and 0 7 respectively for most of the rainfall events except for rainfall 0804 and 0926 the performances of the nh4n simulations were inferior to those of cod but were also acceptable with positive nse values except for that of the 0830 rainfall the performances of the tp simulation were also satisfactory during the calibrated events 0729 0830 and 0926 as the nse and r2 values exceeded 0 5 and acceptable for the validated events 0804 0831 regarding the positive nse values compared with the observations the performance of the ca swmm could be judged as being good especially for heavy rainfall events however the model performance was relatively poor for light rainfall events 0804 which was supposed to be due to the following reasons first the overland flow process during a light rainfall event was more sensitive to some local micro topography features which are difficult to measure and quantify melesse et al 2007 in addition the details of the secondary sewer network structures such as the ponding capacity of manholes were not considered due to data availability which would have more impact on the model performance during light rainfall events dirksen et al 2014 overall the integrated model showed good performance in simulating hydrographs and pollution graphs at the catchment outlet 3 2 simulation results comparison between the ca swmm and swmm the swmm dd and swmm sd have been calibrated in our previous study and their model performances are list in fig 3 for comparison purposes compared to the swmm dd the performances of the ca swmm with scarce drainage data generally remained at a satisfactory level however for the swmm sd the model performance was significantly degraded and caused an over estimation of runoff flow and an under estimation of pollution concentrations the comparisons indicate an obvious effect of the ca module in improving the model performance of the swmm sd by refining the simulation of the overland routing process as a fully distributed algorithm ca identifies the routing process between different land cover cells automatically the accuracy of the overland routing simulation by ca mainly depends on the resolution of the input land use data and dem data but seldom influenced by the resolution of drainage network data therefore in the ca swmm with scarce drainage data but higher resolution land use data the overland routing between different land uses especially from impervious to pervious lands could still be captured which is critical for the simulation of infiltration losses and significantly influences the final simulation results three rainfall events 0729 0831 and 0926 were took as examples as they had relatively better model performances and represented different rainfall types their simulated infiltration losses for runoff and nps pollutants are shown in table 5 as shown the infiltration losses of swmm sd decreased considerably compared to those of the swmm dd but increased to return to values near those of the swmm dd after coupling with ca in the ca swmm indicating a better model performance in simulating the overland routing process as an aiding tool for lid the underestimated infiltration loss due to the resolution degradation of swmm sd would lead to the overestimation of lid inflows and influence the prediction of the lid performances in controlling the peak flow runoff volume and nps pollution loads rossman and huber 2016 xu et al 2019 by coupling the ca module to adjust overland flow simulation more accurate simulations of both runoff flow and water quality could be expected to provide a more realistic reference for lid design and a more accurate effect evaluation 3 3 the determination of proper data resolution in this section the rainfall events 0729 and 0926 were used to represent the heavy rainfall and light rainfall conditions respectively for the spatial scale effect analysis the simulated hydrographs and pollution concentration graphs at the catchment outfall by the ca swmm models with different spatial resolutions are shown in fig 4 the corresponding statistical results such as the runoff ratio the lag time of pick value the event mean concentration and the washed off ratio of pollutant accumulation were listed in table 6 as shown the hydrology simulation results including peak flows average flows and rainfall runoff ratio all increased especially when the spatial resolution degraded to be lower than 10 10 m while the lag time of the peak flow gradually declined as for nps pollution the change of peak concentrations with the degradation of spatial resolutions was not in a regular way taking the cod simulation of rainfall 0729 as an example the statistical results indicated that the pollutant wash off ratio and infiltration ratio of cod decreased from 61 89 to 24 44 and 61 32 to 9 46 respectively as the spatial resolution degraded table 6 the more significant scale effect also appeared after the spatial resolution degraded to be lower than 10 m 10 m the above results showed a threshold for the scale effect through a further analysis of nse and r2 fig 5 the results indicated that the model performances generally responded more significantly when the cell resolution degraded from 20 20 m to 40 40 m but stayed relatively stable within the resolution range of 5 5 m to 10 10 m and 50 50 m to 80 80 m by an overall consideration of the model performances in different rainfall conditions the 10 10 m could be regarded as the threshold scale as the cr model performances were generally acceptable with cell resolution equal or higher than it the change in the land use configuration was supposed to be the main reason for the scale effect in cr 5 and cr 10 the cells with single land cover still occupied most of the cells and only 24 7 of the cr 10 s cells were heterogeneous in land cover table 2 these few heterogeneous cells mainly consisted of roofs and ground land covers between which the inner routing was also considered in lower resolution models this fact indicated the standard of cell resolution for satisfying ca swmm performances in an urban catchment with a fragmented land use configuration as the resolution furtherly degraded increasing cell size could lead to more complicated land cover compositions in one cell and make the inner routing from the impervious lands to pervious lands tend to be easily neglected thus leading to the underestimation of infiltration loss and overestimation of the results for nps pollution the scale effect was also concerned with the pollutant wash off process as well as the neglected infiltration losses the land covers at lower elevations such as the road and impervious pavement were usually the main areas for pollutant accumulation during dry days when their inflow runoff was underestimated as the inner routing from higher elevation was neglected in lower resolution model the pollutant loads generated by washing off would corresponding decrease hur et al 2018 the influences on both the wash off process and the infiltration process made the scale effect of nps pollution manifest the flattening pollution concentration graph decreasing and lagging peak concentration as the spatial resolution degraded compared to the scale effects on the hydrology simulations the nps pollution simulation responded more significantly however the influences of inner routing between different land covers was just within a certain spatial scale in urban catchments with a dense distribution of sewer inlets the inner routing length is usually limited by the distribution interval of sewer inlets in this study when the spatial resolution was degraded to 50 m 50 m over 80 of the cells were covered by sewer inlets and became independent drainage units then the hydrological connection existed only between minorities of cells and resulted in less influence of further resolution degradation on the simulation results 4 conclusion in this study ca swmm was constructed to provide a reliable method for urban nps pollution simulations with scarce drainage network data only for trunk roads by coupling ca based overland routing model and the swmm with scarce drainage data swmm sd the ca swmm was tested in a typical small urban catchment and indicated a significant improvement of performances in both rainfall runoff and nps pollution simulations compared to the swmm sd the performance improvement was mainly attributed to the better depiction of the inner routing between different land covers as a distributed model the scale effect exists for the ca swmm where the appropriate cell resolution should guarantee most of the cells to be homogeneous in land cover configuration and the heterogeneous cells to be configured just by roofs and ground land covers when the cell size is larger than most of the sewer inlet intervals the ca would seldom work in tracking the inner routing between land uses based on the results the ca swmm provide reliable tool for advanced overland routing simulations of nps pollution as well as the optimal design of low development practices especially for those data scarce regions however as with any model based study the presented work is subject to considerable uncertainties originating from model inputs calibration and model structure deletic et al 2012 in addition regional differences should also be noted when extrapolating this site specific study on the scale effect for future studies more frequent monitoring and more case studies in different catchments are suggested to reduce uncertainties as much as possible and obtain a more reliable result author contributions section ying dai did most research tasks and wrote the paper lei chen organize the research and analyzed the data zhenyao shen gave

introduction the chinese loess plateau clp is characterized by thick loess deposits and the average thickness of the loess coverage ranges from 50 to 100 m a maximum thickness of 399 m has been reported shi and shao 2000 soil water resources for the 3 10 m soil layer are equivalent to about twice the local average annual precipitation wang et al 2012 the loess plateau is a huge soil reservoir plants depend on water for their growth and available soil water is practically the only source of water for plants in these regions the available water holding capacity awhc refers to the difference in root zone soil water content between the field capacity θfc and permanent wilting point θwp the awhc is the maximum water storage capacity available for plants in the soil that is considered part of the root zone while the plant available water storage paws is the amount of soil water that can be used by the plants laio et al 2001 li et al 2016 seyfried et al 2005 information on the awhc and paws variability in root zone soil is used in ecological restoration and agricultural production hydrological modeling and water resource management many studies have shown that root water uptake accounts for a large proportion of the total soil water resources in the profiles li et al 2018 wang et al 2009 the available water holding capacity was most limited by the rootable depth because this depth is considered to contain a large proportion of the plant roots leenaars et al 2018 majority of studies have concentrated on a relatively shallow soil layer for example fan et al 2010 reported that roots were concentrated within the 0 50 cm soil layer and for a high yield cropland maximum rooting depth is less than 2 m leenaars et al 2018 estimated mean root zone plant available water holding capacity in sub saharan africa is 74 mm and the associated average root zone depth is 96 cm however the widespread planting of perennial plants which are capable of developing deep root systems increases the utilization of available water resources from the maximum possible depth fan et al 2017 wang et al 2013b zhang et al 2017b reported that the maximum rooting depth for an apple orchard planted in 1998 was 15 2 m a massive planted forest has a deep root system which influences soil water plant interactions in water limited regions gates et al 2011 markewitz et al 2010 tan et al 2016 wang et al 2017a jia et al 2017a showed that the deep rooted robinia pseudoacacia trees extract soil water from depths of over 5 m the active roots of some plant species may be present at greater depths in arid and semi arid regions due to difference in rootability and rootable depth the available water holding capacity under different climatic regions showed large variability especially across the whole loess plateau for example r pseudoacacia p tabulaeformis and c korshinskii are widely planted on the clp and their rooting depths can reach 21 5 17 0 and 22 4 m respectively li et al 2018 wang et al 2013b nevertheless previous reviews have shown that most studies on rooting depth have focused on shallow soil layers generally the upper 2 m layer especially those based on specific field and the effects of roots in deep profiles 2 m are seldom considered on the clp where large scale ecological projects have been implemented available awhc and paws pattern in deep profiles rarely provide precise estimates for evaluating the water status and soil water resources from field to regional scales the delimitation of awhc is that it is highly uncertain because soil water content at the field capacity θfc and that at the permanent wilting point θwp vary with climatic conditions plant species soil types or developmental status leenaars et al 2018 silva et al 2014 jia et al 2015 reported that lower awhc in deep profiles controls soil water recovery awhc is a relevant soil property referring to the water remaining in the soil which indicates scale and location specific variations among different soil textures blöschl and sivapalan 1995 hu et al 2012 however various geomorphic units in the clp are covered by a loess paleosol sequence of different thickness that determine the differences of awhc hahm et al 2019 lu et al 2019 the depth and extent of loess with associated porosity control the potential for water storage capacity the root system and depth can affect soil infiltration characteristics soil structure and water holding capacity the amount of plant available water used by plants varies greatly depending on the vegetation type growth quality and planting density hu et al 2012 jia et al 2015 the profile variability of paws is mainly related to land use and topography recently large scale ecological restoration projects including the grain for green project and the natural forest conservation project have been implemented on the clp there has been an increase in the deep rooting vegetation associated with these projects which means a relatively larger volume of soil water can be used for plant growth this induced soil water redistribution throughout the soil profile changes distribution pattern of paws the impact of rootable depth on awhc and paws in the clp where vegetation types have changed dramatically has received little attention thus far comparison of the functions of awhc and paws under different vegetation types is therefore essential the saturation of available soil water sasw for plants quantified as the ratio of paws and awhc is highly variable in space and time information on the sasw in deep profiles is indispensable for understanding soil plant interactions and vegetation recovery in the region the effect of environmental variables on sasw has recently been studied li et al 2017 investigated the 0 60 cm soil layers and found that the sasw of gully collapse and scarp increased significantly different micro topographies controlled sasw variability similarly zhao et al 2019 estimated the degree of soil drying using sasw value and compared the severity of desiccation in different precipitation regions vegetation types as well as rainfall amounts were key factors affecting paws especially in the 550 mm precipitation zone which play an important role in sasw jia et al 2017c similarly decrease in paws following the conversion of agricultural land to forests on the clp influenced sasw variability overall slope gradient precipitation tree age and initial soil water content as the main factors contribute to changes in the paws throughout the soil profile li and huang 2008 the spatial variation of sasw synthesizes the effects of various controls which leads to complex variations from field to regional scales laio et al 2001 wang et al 2017b western et al 2003 a plethora of studies have been devoted to elucidating precipitation controls on the sasw at a plot or a field scale but few studies have evaluated the effect of revegetation on sasw at a large scale because the plant available water pattern might be largely independent of soil water storage given a regional vegetation change transect fan et al 2017 guillod et al 2015 rewald et al 2012 how land use change and resulting plant available water alter soil water gradient remains poorly understood understanding the characteristics of awhc paws and sasw is needed to guide vegetation restoration strategies in practice this information will help improve the effective management of soil water resources on the clp thus the specific objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the characteristics of awhc and paws in deep profiles 2 evaluate the effect of different precipitation soil and vegetation types on the spatial variations in awhc and paws at a regional scale and 3 provide insights into the characteristics of sasw under different vegetation types 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted on the clp covering a total area of 620 000 km2 which is about 6 5 of china s total land area fig 1 a the climate is an arid and semi arid continental monsoon temperate climate the study area has complex topography including plains sub plateaus hills and gullies with altitudes between 380 and 1600 m above sea level the mean annual precipitation map ranges from 150 to 750 mm decreasing gradually from the southeast to the northwest the rainfall in the region is characterized by uneven annual and seasonal distribution mainly concentrated in july to september which is when 60 80 of the rainfall occurs the mean annual temperature mat ranges from 3 6 c to 14 3 c the potential evaporation is generally higher than the precipitation and the annual evaporation varies from 1400 to 2000 mm yr 1 the aridity index ai the ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation from 1951 to 2013 ranges from 1 42 to 15 88 increasing from the southeast to the northwest the total annual radiation amount is 50 2 67 0 104 j cm 2 increasing from the southeast to the northwest wang et al 2018 this study area is subject to severe soil and water erosion most of the natural vegetation has been destroyed by deforestation and farming causing land degradation desertification and loss of soil fertility fig 1a to control soil and water erosion and restore ecosystems a large scale revegetation project grain for green was implemented by the chinese government in 1999 chen et al 2015 non native tree species including apple malus pumila mill apricot armeniaca sibirica l jujube zizyphus jujube mill black locust robinia pseudoacacia l chinese pine pinus tabuliformis carr platycladus orientalis firmiana platanifolia and korshinsk peashrub caragana korshinski kom have been planted the grasslands are mainly comprised of purple alfalfa medicago sativa l and natural non afforested lands are comprised of stipa bungeana lespedeza davurica and heteropappus altaicu soil erosion has decreased and the ecological environment has improved progressively in recent large scale grain for green implementation on the clp fig 1b 2 2 experimental design and measurements to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the available soil water characteristics a regional transect was investigated in detail a total of 86 soil sampling sites were investigated at intervals of 10 km along a cropland forest shrubland grassland transect zone on the loess plateau fig 1b the sampling sites were concentrated in the main areas where vegetation was restored which were selected to represent the local precipitation characteristics and vegetation types the vegetation types included cropland cl bunge needlegrass bn sea buckthorn sb alfalfa grassland ag apple orchard ao black locust bl and caragana korshinskii ck detailed records of vegetation type vegetation coverage and plant density at every site were compiled zhang et al 2017a along with the vegetation data slope position slope aspect slope gradation was also recorded and geographic coordinates latitude longitude and elevation were determined using rtk gps with 5 m location precision 2 2 1 soil properties for each site soil samples were collected to a depth of 5 m in 11 layers 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 150 150 200 200 300 300 400 and 400 500 cm and then each sample was subdivided into two samples a portion of the disturbed soil samples was used to measure the gravimetric soil water content 105 8 10 h in the laboratory another part was used to measure the soil particle composition and organic carbon oc g kg 1 after being air dried and sieved the corresponding particle size ranges of soil clay silt and sand were 0 002 mm 0 002 0 05 mm and 0 05 mm respectively near each sample point a 40 cm deep soil core and three layers of undisturbed soil cores 0 10 10 20 and 20 40 cm were excavated using cutting rings 5 cm in diameter the undisturbed soil samples were taken to the laboratory to determine the soil physical properties including bulk density bd g cm 3 θfc and permanent θwp the bds in the 0 40 cm layers were determined from the volume dry mass relationship for each core sample the θfc soil water content at 33 kpa and θwp soil water content at 1 5 mpa grassini et al 2010 were estimated using a soil water retention curve this method involved the centrifugation of undisturbed soil cores hitachi cr21g centrifuge 20 c for each layer which has been described in more detail in ghanbarian alavijeh and millan 2009 jipp et al 1998 2 2 2 meteorological and topographic variables mean annual precipitation map in mm was extracted from a continuous dataset via kriging using data from meteorological stations distributed throughout the clp http data cma cn the other meteorological variables derived for each sampling site included the mat ai and precipitation seasonal distribution which are processed in the same way as map the precipitation seasonal distribution psd in the growing season may to september was quantified as the coefficient of variation of the monthly precipitation cv mp 1 cv mp 1 5 i 5 9 m i m 2 m 2 m 1 5 i 5 9 m i where mi is the mean monthly precipitation i is may to september and m is the average precipitation for the five months may september topographic variables at each site including elevation el m slope aspect sa and slope gradient sg were measured with a geological compass a total of twelve environmental variables were collected at each sampling site 2 3 calculation of awhc and paws soil water deficit mm was expressed in terms of the differences between the awhc and paws in each soil layer we regarded the available soil water as zero when soil water content was less than θwp the calculation of awhc and paws for the entire 0 500 cm profile required the determination of bd θfc and θwp in the deep profiles 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 150 150 200 200 300 300 400 400 500 cm considering that it is a practical challenge to directly measure bd θfc and θwp in the deep profiles we indirectly derived these values by using representative established pedotransfer functions ptf a robust pedotransfer function ptf was determined in the following steps wang et al 2013b 1 finding four established ptfs for each of the three parameters published in scientific literature supplementary table s1 2 evaluating their performance by using measured data in the 0 40 cm layers according to the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean squared error rmse and the mean error me supplementary table s2 3 selecting the ptf with the best performance for each parameter based on the performance of the four established ptfs and 4 comparing the measured bd θfc and θwp in the deep profile 40 500 cm with the simulation result of the selected best ptf respectively supplementary fig s1 consequently the ptfs developed by balland et al 2008 were selected to estimate each value of bd θfc and θwp in the current study by using the measured soil oc and soil particle composition data of the soil samples collected from the soil layers of 40 500 cm awhc and paws were then calculated using the following equations cheng et al 2009 leenaars et al 2018 3 sasw 5 m pawawhc i bd i ρ w θ fci θ wpi is 5 m awhc 5 m 100 4 paws i bd i ρ w θ i θ wpi i where awhci and pawsi are the available water holding capacity and plant available water storage mm respectively in soil layer i cm and bdi θfci and θwpi are the soil bulk density g cm 3 field capacity and wilting point in i soil layer cm respectively ρ w is the water density the value is 1 g cm 3 and θi is the gravimetric soil water content in the soil layer i cm the awhc 5 m and paws5 m were evaluated by calculating awhci and pawsi for the entire 0 5 m profile these were calculated per the following equations 5 awhc 5 m i 1 11 awhc i 6 paws 5 m i 1 11 paws i the sasw5 m was calculated using the following equation 7 sasw 5 m paws 5 m awhc 5 m 100 2 4 statistical analysis basic statistical parameters such as the minimum maximum mean and standard deviation were calculated for awhc and paws a total of twelve environmental variables including map mat psd ai el sa sg sand silt clay oc and bd were collected in the study the soil texture of all soil samples was classified based on the relative proportions of clay silt and sand using the textural triangle one way analysis of variance was used to evaluate the differences in the awhc and paws among different vegetation species precipitation zones and soil textures and for changing awhc and paws values under the same vegetation type to simplify the statistical analysis and to avoid confounding influences the soils were divided by soil type for analysis i e loam silt loam and sandy loam soils partial correlation analysis was used to determine the correlation between awhc and paws in each layer to further evaluate the relationship between sasw5 m and the selected environmental variables a linear mixed effect model lme was used as detailed by cafarelli et al 2015 3 results 3 1 comparison of awhc and paws along the transect the spatial heterogeneity of the awhc5 m and paws5 m across the transect differed among the sites fig 2 awhc5 m decreased along the revegetation and precipitation gradient while paws5 m decreased initially and then increased fig 2a b the awhc5 m values ranged from 357 0 to 1246 5 mm and the mean awhc5 m was 762 9 mm table 1 the awhc5 m fluctuated between soil layers but showed minimal variability cv 23 8 the paws5 m values ranged from 0 to 810 1 mm and mean paws5 m was 257 3 mm it showed relatively high variation cv 88 0 indicating that the paws was more variable at a large scale than was the awhc pearson correlations between awhc5 m and all environmental variables were statistically significant p 0 05 except for with respect to topographic variables i e sa and sg paws5 m was not significantly correlated with sa and silt table 2 3 2 factors influencing awhc and paws at the regional scale 3 2 1 vegetation types differences in vegetation species greatly influenced the variation in awhc5 m and paws5 m the awhc5 m was significantly higher than paws5 m under cl bn ag ao bl and ck but not sb fig 3 the statistical analysis also showed significant differences in awhc5 m and paws5 m among the vegetation types p 0 05 the highest soil water deficit existed in bl and the lowest was found in sb the soil water deficit decreased as follows bl ag ck ao bn cl sb root traits of all 86 sampling sites for the selected vegetation species in this study were divided into shallow and deep root systems an obvious difference in root distribution traits and maximum rooting depth under different vegetation types is presented in table 3 the shallow root distribution ranged from 0 to 160 cm soil layers and the maximum rooting depth under sb reached 3 m while the maximum root depth of deep rooted vegetation i e apple trees reached 23 2 m sizable differences in map sg and soil particle composition were evident when comparing the environmental variables between shallow and deep root vegetation as shown in table 4 the map mat clay and oc values in cl were higher than those for deep rooted vegetation while psd el sg and sand values were lower than those of other vegetation types vertical distributions of soil water conditions within the soil profile 0 500 cm varied between the shallow and deep vegetation types fig 4 the available water resources for shallow rooted vegetation generally increased with increasing soil depth below 2 m fig 4a paws for deep rooted vegetation in the 40 cm soil layer was consumed and the soil available water values in the deeper layers were only 10 thus we can conclude that fewer water resources were available for plant water use with increasing soil depth fig 4b 3 2 2 precipitation zones the awhc5 m and paws5 m displayed different characteristics in different precipitation zones fig 5 the awhc5 m was significantly higher than paws5 m in each precipitation zone paws5 m decreased in the 450 550 mm precipitation zone while the awhc5 m values were 921 718 and 587 mm in the 550 450 500 and 450 mm precipitation zones respectively the mean awhc5 m was 763 mm in the entire region and the awhc5 m was 412 137 and 216 mm in the 550 450 500 and 450 mm precipitation zones respectively the 450 550 mm precipitation zone has the lowest paws5 m which totaled 135 7 mm the difference between awhc5 m and paws5 m was 581 mm in the 450 550 mm precipitation zone 351 mm in the 550 precipitation zone and 371 mm in the 450 mm precipitation zone the awhc5 m and paws5 m had significant differences under different vegetation types in each precipitation zone fig 6 the deep rooted plants consumed more soil water resources compared to shallow rooted plants in the 450 mm precipitation zone fig 6a and b indicating that rainfall can replenish soil water resources in these regions however the 450 mm precipitation zone had limited soil water resources available for deep rooted vegetation and the soil water deficit was greater in this region for deep rooted plants than for shallow rooted vegetation fig 6c 3 2 3 soil particle composition soil physical and chemical properties had different effects on the vertical distribution of awhc and paws which showed a high degree of variability in each soil layer tables 2 and 5 all soil properties except for clay influenced the awhc in shallow soil layers of 0 2 m table 5 a partial correlation analysis found that awhc was positively correlated with silt and oc and negatively correlated with sand and bd at each depth 0 2 m p 0 05 there were significant positive relationships between the paws in each soil layer and clay bd and oc respectively p 0 05 in loam soils there was no significant difference between awhc and paws in each layer and paws gradually decreased with increasing soil depth fig 7 a in the silt loam and sandy loam soil awhc was significantly higher than paws in each layer fig 7b and c compared with different soil textures the total amount of water storage was higher in the silt loam soil than in the loam and sandy loam soil paws however was relatively higher in loam soil 3 3 characteristic of the sasw under different vegetation types sasw5 m differed significantly between the shallow and deep root vegetation f 4 276 p 0 05 with values of 42 6 and 30 2 respectively fig 8 correlation analysis showed that sasw5 m was positively correlated to clay and bd and negatively correlated with sg table 1 these correlated covariates were then included in the lme table 6 presents the selected covariables except for sg significant impacts on sasw5 m between the shallow and deep root vegetation the characteristics of sasw5 m were largely explained in terms of changes in clay and bd at all sampling sites the coefficient of bd was 80 4 which had more effect than clay coefficient 1 6 on variation in sasw this was observed because conversion from shallow rooted to deep rooted vegetation resulted in a significant reduction in paws rooting depth controls paws in deep profiles the paws is the amount of water in the soil layer that is involved in the exchange of soil water indicating that deep root vegetation consumed more available soil water in deep soils 4 discussion 4 1 sources of variation in the awhc and paws at a regional scale soil water varies considerably across both space and time deng et al 2016 factors affecting the spatial variation of awhc and paws are nonlinear climate change ecohydrological processes and regional water redistribution can be elucidated at a continuous transect of observation sites the specific scale effects i e slope vegetation type and topographic factors on awhc and paws are captured at high density sample data gao et al 2013 regional scale studies provide specific information on the response of the awhc and paws to various controls as shown in fig 2 awhc and paws did not correspond the spatial pattern of paws5 m presented that relatively similar vegetation types initially decreased from sampling site 11 to site 56 which provides an excellent basis for comparing vegetation features at a local scale fig 2b and 3 vegetation coverage in the loess plateau increased from 31 6 in 1999 to 59 6 in 2013 chen et al 2015 the grain for green project which involved removing shallow root vegetation cl and planting deep root vegetation e g ck bl and ag was implemented the portion of afforestation and returning cropland to forest grassland were found almost in the middle clp fig 1 this study shows that the paws and vegetation pattern display similar trends fig 2b the variation in paws can be used to characterize the water available for plants at a local scale as the measurement scale increases the magnitude of influence of the spatial and temporal fields e g soil topography and meteorology on the awhc and paws responses constantly changes gao et al 2016 hu et al 2017 yang et al 2012 as shown in figs 5 and 7 the impact of precipitation and soil types on awhc5 m and paws5 m variations showed significant differences the source of variation in different precipitation zones and soil types means the awhc and paws showed significant differentiation and diversity this study explored regional scale links among climate soil and vegetation for limited soil resources which is helpful for highlighting the effects of different factors on soil water resources over large areas 4 2 depth dependence as affected by rooting depth root distribution characteristics and rooting depth can differ greatly among vegetation types as shown in table 3 there is strong evidence that some plant species are able to extend roots in deep soils schenk and jackson 2002 silva and rego 2003 stoeckeler and kluender 1938 for example canadell et al 1996 reported that the global rooting depths of herbaceous plants shrubs and trees are 2 6 0 1 m 5 1 0 8 m and 7 0 1 2 m mean standard deviation respectively a number of tree species in evergreen tropical forests can have root systems that extend 8 m deep fan et al 2017 in semi arid regions the apple orchard has the deepest recorded root system and its average rooting depth is 23 2 m li et al 2019 many trees and shrubs have deeper roots table 3 rewald et al 2012 found six tree species that grew roots below 5 m and at least four of the six reached a depth of 18 m in arid areas acacia and prosopis are found to have roots reaching a depth of 20 m and 50 60 m respectively canadell et al 1996 fan et al 2017 stone and kalisz 1991 in addition there have been direct observations of roots at depths below 2 3 m in caves road cuts mine shafts and trenches in arid and semi arid regions tree species with deep rooting depths suggest that plants find deep soil water resources to grow and are evidence of water consumption by plants that grow for years with minimal or no rainfall therefore deep roots allow plants to access water from deeper soils on the clp the average cover thickness of loess is 50 100 m and the maximum thickness is 399 m the soil reservoir below 1 m is an important component of soil water resources a deeper rooting depth means there is more water stored and available in the soil for that plant which is critical to plant survival where water is limited however studies on root depth remain mostly confined to the uppermost 2 m soil layers research on deep profiles is scarce and there have been few studies on processes in the deep soil layers on the clp it has been found that some plant species can have root depths of up to 18 m in the regions moreover artificial plants are on average more deeply rooted than native plants wang et al 2013b in the study regions wang et al 2010 found that the maximum root depths under the artificial grasslands alfalfa artificial shrublands ck and woodlands pinus tabuliformis were 15 5 m 22 4 m and 21 5 m respectively the root depth of grasslands alfalfa can reach 5 m after 2 5 years of growth the average root depth of 23 kinds of artificial vegetation on the clp exceeded 10 m and even reached deeper soil layers table 3 these results indicate that awhc5 m gradually increased between sampling sites 11 56 and the paws5 m initially decreased with the introduction of deep rooted vegetation before increasing under shallow rooted vegetation the deep rooted vegetation has a critical effect on the balance of water nutrients and carbon in the deep soils the plant rooting depth has strong ecological plasticity heterogenous environmental conditions determine the ecological plasticity of rooting depth which can change with changes to habitats in water limited regions canadell et al 1999 fan et al 2017 fan et al 2017 summarized 2200 root observations of 1000 species along biotic and abiotic gradients and their results showed that the rooting depth was strongly sensitive to the local soil water deep roots are highly adaptive to local soil environments on the clp hodge 2004 which demonstrates the depth dependence of paws as affected by plant roots 4 3 implication of sasw for evaluating soil drying soil drying occurs even in intermediate soil layers and this impacts the water cycle by blocking water transport between the upper and deeper soil layers chen et al 2008 due to soil drying soil degradation as well as regional microclimate environment aridity may increase causing greater loss of land productivity wang et al 2010 soil drying has been noted in other regions of the world and has been the focus of some historical research it is also reported that soil drying in the deep soils led to the death of a forest which led to ecosystem degradation in russia wang et al 2010 soil drying resulted in vegetation biomass or stunted growth and localized and or regional vegetation die off on the clp wang et al 2015 similarly there have been many studies on soil drying in eastern amazonia available soil water was depleted from 4 to 8 m by plant water uptake during the dry season and deep soils were not recharged to previous levels due to an el niño southern oscillation event deep available soil water uptake not only took place during the dry season but also occurred during the wet season oliveira et al 2005 sarris et al 2007 seyfried et al 2005 zhao et al 2019 showed a similar result for a large scale soil drying sasw is highly variable and complex and it does not increase with precipitation therefore the sasw value has important implications for arid and semi arid ecosystems soil water balance the variation in sasw in the deep profiles are closely related to soil properties and plant traits the negative balance of soil water resources caused by overconsumption by deep root vegetation and soil drying occurred in deep profiles large scale implementation of revegetation changed land use and land cover on the clp which changed the vegetation distribution pattern the differences in sasw quantify the effects of large scale patterns of vegetation type on soil drying the introduction of deep rooted plants can aggravate soil drying over time and soil water deficits can reach a significant long term level deng et al 2016 wang et al 2013a yang et al 2012 for example huang and gallichand 2006 showed that 32 year old apple trees with robust deep roots could deplete most paws down to 10 m the recovery time back to the initial soil water content for the 0 10 m soil layer varied from 6 5 to 19 5 years with an average of 13 7 years jia et al 2015 also reported that available soil water cannot be replenished in deep profiles from rainfall therefore the circulation path of soil water is random and shallow li et al 2016 previous studies have characterized soil drying in the context of global warming and drought the underlying importance of global change may mask or buffer the local vegetation influences our research provides important information about the evolution of available soil water along the transect and this saturation during the non growing season and growing season is becoming more common the sasw value is a good indicator of whether deep soil environment to deteriorate over time in these regions to monitor and evaluate the sasw5 m in intermediate soil layers along the precipitation and revegetation gradient is an event of great significance 5 conclusions a large reservoir of stored water is readily available to plants in the deep soils on the chinese loess plateau in this study we investigated awhc paws and sasw to a depth of 5 m at a regional scale awhc5 m generally decreased from the south to the north paws5 m initially exhibited a decreasing trend and then increased and these trends were related to differences in vegetation types awhc5 m and paws5 m did differ significantly among different vegetation species with high amounts of variation bl showed the greatest water consumption among the introduced vegetation types the selected vegetation types could be divided into shallow and deep rooting vegetation types the soil available water for shallow rooted vegetation increased below depths of 2 m while deep rooted vegetation consumed soil available water in deeper layers leaving only 10 of the soil water remaining the variation in awhc5 m and paws5 m was greater in the 450 550 mm precipitation zone compared to the variation in rainfall among other precipitation zones partial correlation analysis showed that the soil particle composition is an important variable for explaining the awhc5 m and paws5 m in each layer the amount of awhc5 m and paws5 m differed among the different soil textures in addition sasw5 m differed significantly among the different vegetation types as a result of differences in the vegetation root distribution and maximum root depth the sasw5 m values for shallow rooted vegetation were significantly higher than for deep rooted vegetation suggesting that introduced vegetation with robust roots can extract stored water from deeper soil thereby minimizing water stress information about the variations in awhc5 m and paws5 m along a revegetation and precipitation gradient will be useful for preventing soil drying by regulating the

5877,knowledge of regional characteristics and variability in available soil water is important for water resource management and vegetation restoration in arid and semi arid regions however few studies have evaluated the available water holding capacity awhc and plant available water storage paws for plant growth or determined the saturation of available soil water sasw in deep profiles 2 m this study investigated characteristics of awhc and paws to a depth of 5 m along a revegetation and precipitation gradient on the chinese loess plateau clp the results showed that awhc5 m exhibited a decreasing trend along the transect with a mean value of 762 9 mm paws5 m first decreased then increased following changes in vegetation types with a mean value of 257 3 mm the paws5 m significantly differed under different soil layers and showed high variation coefficient of variation 88 0 in its profile awhc5 m was significantly correlated with all environmental factors except slope aspect and slope gradient a comparative analysis showed that paws5 m had a small portion of awhc5 m both of which varied among different vegetation species variations in paws5 m and awhc5 m were higher in the 450 550 mm precipitation zone and silt loam soil planted forests with deep root systems introduced in the 450 550 mm precipitation zone had lower sasw5 m values than the areas with shallow root vegetation a complete understanding of the spatial variations of paws awhc and sasw along the revegetation and precipitation gradient will be helpful in assessing regional water resources and optimizing vegetation species on the clp and possibly in other water limited regions around the world keywords plant available water regional transect root depth soil drying loess plateau 1 introduction the chinese loess plateau clp is characterized by thick loess deposits and the average thickness of the loess coverage ranges from 50 to 100 m a maximum thickness of 399 m has been reported shi and shao 2000 soil water resources for the 3 10 m soil layer are equivalent to about twice the local average annual precipitation wang et al 2012 the loess plateau is a huge soil reservoir plants depend on water for their growth and available soil water is practically the only source of water for plants in these regions the available water holding capacity awhc refers to the difference in root zone soil water content between the field capacity θfc and permanent wilting point θwp the awhc is the maximum water storage capacity available for plants in the soil that is considered part of the root zone while the plant available water storage paws is the amount of soil water that can be used by the plants laio et al 2001 li et al 2016 seyfried et al 2005 information on the awhc and paws variability in root zone soil is used in ecological restoration and agricultural production hydrological modeling and water resource management many studies have shown that root water uptake accounts for a large proportion of the total soil water resources in the profiles li et al 2018 wang et al 2009 the available water holding capacity was most limited by the rootable depth because this depth is considered to contain a large proportion of the plant roots leenaars et al 2018 majority of studies have concentrated on a relatively shallow soil layer for example fan et al 2010 reported that roots were concentrated within the 0 50 cm soil layer and for a high yield cropland maximum rooting depth is less than 2 m leenaars et al 2018 estimated mean root zone plant available water holding capacity in sub saharan africa is 74 mm and the associated average root zone depth is 96 cm however the widespread planting of perennial plants which are capable of developing deep root systems increases the utilization of available water resources from the maximum possible depth fan et al 2017 wang et al 2013b zhang et al 2017b reported that the maximum rooting depth for an apple orchard planted in 1998 was 15 2 m a massive planted forest has a deep root system which influences soil water plant interactions in water limited regions gates et al 2011 markewitz et al 2010 tan et al 2016 wang et al 2017a jia et al 2017a showed that the deep rooted robinia pseudoacacia trees extract soil water from depths of over 5 m the active roots of some plant species may be present at greater depths in arid and semi arid regions due to difference in rootability and rootable depth the available water holding capacity under different climatic regions showed large variability especially across the whole loess plateau for example r pseudoacacia p tabulaeformis and c korshinskii are widely planted on the clp and their rooting depths can reach 21 5 17 0 and 22 4 m respectively li et al 2018 wang et al 2013b nevertheless previous reviews have shown that most studies on rooting depth have focused on shallow soil layers generally the upper 2 m layer especially those based on specific field and the effects of roots in deep profiles 2 m are seldom considered on the clp where large scale ecological projects have been implemented available awhc and paws pattern in deep profiles rarely provide precise estimates for evaluating the water status and soil water resources from field to regional scales the delimitation of awhc is that it is highly uncertain because soil water content at the field capacity θfc and that at the permanent wilting point θwp vary with climatic conditions plant species soil types or developmental status leenaars et al 2018 silva et al 2014 jia et al 2015 reported that lower awhc in deep profiles controls soil water recovery awhc is a relevant soil property referring to the water remaining in the soil which indicates scale and location specific variations among different soil textures blöschl and sivapalan 1995 hu et al 2012 however various geomorphic units in the clp are covered by a loess paleosol sequence of different thickness that determine the differences of awhc hahm et al 2019 lu et al 2019 the depth and extent of loess with associated porosity control the potential for water storage capacity the root system and depth can affect soil infiltration characteristics soil structure and water holding capacity the amount of plant available water used by plants varies greatly depending on the vegetation type growth quality and planting density hu et al 2012 jia et al 2015 the profile variability of paws is mainly related to land use and topography recently large scale ecological restoration projects including the grain for green project and the natural forest conservation project have been implemented on the clp there has been an increase in the deep rooting vegetation associated with these projects which means a relatively larger volume of soil water can be used for plant growth this induced soil water redistribution throughout the soil profile changes distribution pattern of paws the impact of rootable depth on awhc and paws in the clp where vegetation types have changed dramatically has received little attention thus far comparison of the functions of awhc and paws under different vegetation types is therefore essential the saturation of available soil water sasw for plants quantified as the ratio of paws and awhc is highly variable in space and time information on the sasw in deep profiles is indispensable for understanding soil plant interactions and vegetation recovery in the region the effect of environmental variables on sasw has recently been studied li et al 2017 investigated the 0 60 cm soil layers and found that the sasw of gully collapse and scarp increased significantly different micro topographies controlled sasw variability similarly zhao et al 2019 estimated the degree of soil drying using sasw value and compared the severity of desiccation in different precipitation regions vegetation types as well as rainfall amounts were key factors affecting paws especially in the 550 mm precipitation zone which play an important role in sasw jia et al 2017c similarly decrease in paws following the conversion of agricultural land to forests on the clp influenced sasw variability overall slope gradient precipitation tree age and initial soil water content as the main factors contribute to changes in the paws throughout the soil profile li and huang 2008 the spatial variation of sasw synthesizes the effects of various controls which leads to complex variations from field to regional scales laio et al 2001 wang et al 2017b western et al 2003 a plethora of studies have been devoted to elucidating precipitation controls on the sasw at a plot or a field scale but few studies have evaluated the effect of revegetation on sasw at a large scale because the plant available water pattern might be largely independent of soil water storage given a regional vegetation change transect fan et al 2017 guillod et al 2015 rewald et al 2012 how land use change and resulting plant available water alter soil water gradient remains poorly understood understanding the characteristics of awhc paws and sasw is needed to guide vegetation restoration strategies in practice this information will help improve the effective management of soil water resources on the clp thus the specific objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the characteristics of awhc and paws in deep profiles 2 evaluate the effect of different precipitation soil and vegetation types on the spatial variations in awhc and paws at a regional scale and 3 provide insights into the characteristics of sasw under different vegetation types 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted on the clp covering a total area of 620 000 km2 which is about 6 5 of china s total land area fig 1 a the climate is an arid and semi arid continental monsoon temperate climate the study area has complex topography including plains sub plateaus hills and gullies with altitudes between 380 and 1600 m above sea level the mean annual precipitation map ranges from 150 to 750 mm decreasing gradually from the southeast to the northwest the rainfall in the region is characterized by uneven annual and seasonal distribution mainly concentrated in july to september which is when 60 80 of the rainfall occurs the mean annual temperature mat ranges from 3 6 c to 14 3 c the potential evaporation is generally higher than the precipitation and the annual evaporation varies from 1400 to 2000 mm yr 1 the aridity index ai the ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation from 1951 to 2013 ranges from 1 42 to 15 88 increasing from the southeast to the northwest the total annual radiation amount is 50 2 67 0 104 j cm 2 increasing from the southeast to the northwest wang et al 2018 this study area is subject to severe soil and water erosion most of the natural vegetation has been destroyed by deforestation and farming causing land degradation desertification and loss of soil fertility fig 1a to control soil and water erosion and restore ecosystems a large scale revegetation project grain for green was implemented by the chinese government in 1999 chen et al 2015 non native tree species including apple malus pumila mill apricot armeniaca sibirica l jujube zizyphus jujube mill black locust robinia pseudoacacia l chinese pine pinus tabuliformis carr platycladus orientalis firmiana platanifolia and korshinsk peashrub caragana korshinski kom have been planted the grasslands are mainly comprised of purple alfalfa medicago sativa l and natural non afforested lands are comprised of stipa bungeana lespedeza davurica and heteropappus altaicu soil erosion has decreased and the ecological environment has improved progressively in recent large scale grain for green implementation on the clp fig 1b 2 2 experimental design and measurements to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the available soil water characteristics a regional transect was investigated in detail a total of 86 soil sampling sites were investigated at intervals of 10 km along a cropland forest shrubland grassland transect zone on the loess plateau fig 1b the sampling sites were concentrated in the main areas where vegetation was restored which were selected to represent the local precipitation characteristics and vegetation types the vegetation types included cropland cl bunge needlegrass bn sea buckthorn sb alfalfa grassland ag apple orchard ao black locust bl and caragana korshinskii ck detailed records of vegetation type vegetation coverage and plant density at every site were compiled zhang et al 2017a along with the vegetation data slope position slope aspect slope gradation was also recorded and geographic coordinates latitude longitude and elevation were determined using rtk gps with 5 m location precision 2 2 1 soil properties for each site soil samples were collected to a depth of 5 m in 11 layers 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 150 150 200 200 300 300 400 and 400 500 cm and then each sample was subdivided into two samples a portion of the disturbed soil samples was used to measure the gravimetric soil water content 105 8 10 h in the laboratory another part was used to measure the soil particle composition and organic carbon oc g kg 1 after being air dried and sieved the corresponding particle size ranges of soil clay silt and sand were 0 002 mm 0 002 0 05 mm and 0 05 mm respectively near each sample point a 40 cm deep soil core and three layers of undisturbed soil cores 0 10 10 20 and 20 40 cm were excavated using cutting rings 5 cm in diameter the undisturbed soil samples were taken to the laboratory to determine the soil physical properties including bulk density bd g cm 3 θfc and permanent θwp the bds in the 0 40 cm layers were determined from the volume dry mass relationship for each core sample the θfc soil water content at 33 kpa and θwp soil water content at 1 5 mpa grassini et al 2010 were estimated using a soil water retention curve this method involved the centrifugation of undisturbed soil cores hitachi cr21g centrifuge 20 c for each layer which has been described in more detail in ghanbarian alavijeh and millan 2009 jipp et al 1998 2 2 2 meteorological and topographic variables mean annual precipitation map in mm was extracted from a continuous dataset via kriging using data from meteorological stations distributed throughout the clp http data cma cn the other meteorological variables derived for each sampling site included the mat ai and precipitation seasonal distribution which are processed in the same way as map the precipitation seasonal distribution psd in the growing season may to september was quantified as the coefficient of variation of the monthly precipitation cv mp 1 cv mp 1 5 i 5 9 m i m 2 m 2 m 1 5 i 5 9 m i where mi is the mean monthly precipitation i is may to september and m is the average precipitation for the five months may september topographic variables at each site including elevation el m slope aspect sa and slope gradient sg were measured with a geological compass a total of twelve environmental variables were collected at each sampling site 2 3 calculation of awhc and paws soil water deficit mm was expressed in terms of the differences between the awhc and paws in each soil layer we regarded the available soil water as zero when soil water content was less than θwp the calculation of awhc and paws for the entire 0 500 cm profile required the determination of bd θfc and θwp in the deep profiles 40 60 60 80 80 100 100 150 150 200 200 300 300 400 400 500 cm considering that it is a practical challenge to directly measure bd θfc and θwp in the deep profiles we indirectly derived these values by using representative established pedotransfer functions ptf a robust pedotransfer function ptf was determined in the following steps wang et al 2013b 1 finding four established ptfs for each of the three parameters published in scientific literature supplementary table s1 2 evaluating their performance by using measured data in the 0 40 cm layers according to the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean squared error rmse and the mean error me supplementary table s2 3 selecting the ptf with the best performance for each parameter based on the performance of the four established ptfs and 4 comparing the measured bd θfc and θwp in the deep profile 40 500 cm with the simulation result of the selected best ptf respectively supplementary fig s1 consequently the ptfs developed by balland et al 2008 were selected to estimate each value of bd θfc and θwp in the current study by using the measured soil oc and soil particle composition data of the soil samples collected from the soil layers of 40 500 cm awhc and paws were then calculated using the following equations cheng et al 2009 leenaars et al 2018 3 sasw 5 m pawawhc i bd i ρ w θ fci θ wpi is 5 m awhc 5 m 100 4 paws i bd i ρ w θ i θ wpi i where awhci and pawsi are the available water holding capacity and plant available water storage mm respectively in soil layer i cm and bdi θfci and θwpi are the soil bulk density g cm 3 field capacity and wilting point in i soil layer cm respectively ρ w is the water density the value is 1 g cm 3 and θi is the gravimetric soil water content in the soil layer i cm the awhc 5 m and paws5 m were evaluated by calculating awhci and pawsi for the entire 0 5 m profile these were calculated per the following equations 5 awhc 5 m i 1 11 awhc i 6 paws 5 m i 1 11 paws i the sasw5 m was calculated using the following equation 7 sasw 5 m paws 5 m awhc 5 m 100 2 4 statistical analysis basic statistical parameters such as the minimum maximum mean and standard deviation were calculated for awhc and paws a total of twelve environmental variables including map mat psd ai el sa sg sand silt clay oc and bd were collected in the study the soil texture of all soil samples was classified based on the relative proportions of clay silt and sand using the textural triangle one way analysis of variance was used to evaluate the differences in the awhc and paws among different vegetation species precipitation zones and soil textures and for changing awhc and paws values under the same vegetation type to simplify the statistical analysis and to avoid confounding influences the soils were divided by soil type for analysis i e loam silt loam and sandy loam soils partial correlation analysis was used to determine the correlation between awhc and paws in each layer to further evaluate the relationship between sasw5 m and the selected environmental variables a linear mixed effect model lme was used as detailed by cafarelli et al 2015 3 results 3 1 comparison of awhc and paws along the transect the spatial heterogeneity of the awhc5 m and paws5 m across the transect differed among the sites fig 2 awhc5 m decreased along the revegetation and precipitation gradient while paws5 m decreased initially and then increased fig 2a b the awhc5 m values ranged from 357 0 to 1246 5 mm and the mean awhc5 m was 762 9 mm table 1 the awhc5 m fluctuated between soil layers but showed minimal variability cv 23 8 the paws5 m values ranged from 0 to 810 1 mm and mean paws5 m was 257 3 mm it showed relatively high variation cv 88 0 indicating that the paws was more variable at a large scale than was the awhc pearson correlations between awhc5 m and all environmental variables were statistically significant p 0 05 except for with respect to topographic variables i e sa and sg paws5 m was not significantly correlated with sa and silt table 2 3 2 factors influencing awhc and paws at the regional scale 3 2 1 vegetation types differences in vegetation species greatly influenced the variation in awhc5 m and paws5 m the awhc5 m was significantly higher than paws5 m under cl bn ag ao bl and ck but not sb fig 3 the statistical analysis also showed significant differences in awhc5 m and paws5 m among the vegetation types p 0 05 the highest soil water deficit existed in bl and the lowest was found in sb the soil water deficit decreased as follows bl ag ck ao bn cl sb root traits of all 86 sampling sites for the selected vegetation species in this study were divided into shallow and deep root systems an obvious difference in root distribution traits and maximum rooting depth under different vegetation types is presented in table 3 the shallow root distribution ranged from 0 to 160 cm soil layers and the maximum rooting depth under sb reached 3 m while the maximum root depth of deep rooted vegetation i e apple trees reached 23 2 m sizable differences in map sg and soil particle composition were evident when comparing the environmental variables between shallow and deep root vegetation as shown in table 4 the map mat clay and oc values in cl were higher than those for deep rooted vegetation while psd el sg and sand values were lower than those of other vegetation types vertical distributions of soil water conditions within the soil profile 0 500 cm varied between the shallow and deep vegetation types fig 4 the available water resources for shallow rooted vegetation generally increased with increasing soil depth below 2 m fig 4a paws for deep rooted vegetation in the 40 cm soil layer was consumed and the soil available water values in the deeper layers were only 10 thus we can conclude that fewer water resources were available for plant water use with increasing soil depth fig 4b 3 2 2 precipitation zones the awhc5 m and paws5 m displayed different characteristics in different precipitation zones fig 5 the awhc5 m was significantly higher than paws5 m in each precipitation zone paws5 m decreased in the 450 550 mm precipitation zone while the awhc5 m values were 921 718 and 587 mm in the 550 450 500 and 450 mm precipitation zones respectively the mean awhc5 m was 763 mm in the entire region and the awhc5 m was 412 137 and 216 mm in the 550 450 500 and 450 mm precipitation zones respectively the 450 550 mm precipitation zone has the lowest paws5 m which totaled 135 7 mm the difference between awhc5 m and paws5 m was 581 mm in the 450 550 mm precipitation zone 351 mm in the 550 precipitation zone and 371 mm in the 450 mm precipitation zone the awhc5 m and paws5 m had significant differences under different vegetation types in each precipitation zone fig 6 the deep rooted plants consumed more soil water resources compared to shallow rooted plants in the 450 mm precipitation zone fig 6a and b indicating that rainfall can replenish soil water resources in these regions however the 450 mm precipitation zone had limited soil water resources available for deep rooted vegetation and the soil water deficit was greater in this region for deep rooted plants than for shallow rooted vegetation fig 6c 3 2 3 soil particle composition soil physical and chemical properties had different effects on the vertical distribution of awhc and paws which showed a high degree of variability in each soil layer tables 2 and 5 all soil properties except for clay influenced the awhc in shallow soil layers of 0 2 m table 5 a partial correlation analysis found that awhc was positively correlated with silt and oc and negatively correlated with sand and bd at each depth 0 2 m p 0 05 there were significant positive relationships between the paws in each soil layer and clay bd and oc respectively p 0 05 in loam soils there was no significant difference between awhc and paws in each layer and paws gradually decreased with increasing soil depth fig 7 a in the silt loam and sandy loam soil awhc was significantly higher than paws in each layer fig 7b and c compared with different soil textures the total amount of water storage was higher in the silt loam soil than in the loam and sandy loam soil paws however was relatively higher in loam soil 3 3 characteristic of the sasw under different vegetation types sasw5 m differed significantly between the shallow and deep root vegetation f 4 276 p 0 05 with values of 42 6 and 30 2 respectively fig 8 correlation analysis showed that sasw5 m was positively correlated to clay and bd and negatively correlated with sg table 1 these correlated covariates were then included in the lme table 6 presents the selected covariables except for sg significant impacts on sasw5 m between the shallow and deep root vegetation the characteristics of sasw5 m were largely explained in terms of changes in clay and bd at all sampling sites the coefficient of bd was 80 4 which had more effect than clay coefficient 1 6 on variation in sasw this was observed because conversion from shallow rooted to deep rooted vegetation resulted in a significant reduction in paws rooting depth controls paws in deep profiles the paws is the amount of water in the soil layer that is involved in the exchange of soil water indicating that deep root vegetation consumed more available soil water in deep soils 4 discussion 4 1 sources of variation in the awhc and paws at a regional scale soil water varies considerably across both space and time deng et al 2016 factors affecting the spatial variation of awhc and paws are nonlinear climate change ecohydrological processes and regional water redistribution can be elucidated at a continuous transect of observation sites the specific scale effects i e slope vegetation type and topographic factors on awhc and paws are captured at high density sample data gao et al 2013 regional scale studies provide specific information on the response of the awhc and paws to various controls as shown in fig 2 awhc and paws did not correspond the spatial pattern of paws5 m presented that relatively similar vegetation types initially decreased from sampling site 11 to site 56 which provides an excellent basis for comparing vegetation features at a local scale fig 2b and 3 vegetation coverage in the loess plateau increased from 31 6 in 1999 to 59 6 in 2013 chen et al 2015 the grain for green project which involved removing shallow root vegetation cl and planting deep root vegetation e g ck bl and ag was implemented the portion of afforestation and returning cropland to forest grassland were found almost in the middle clp fig 1 this study shows that the paws and vegetation pattern display similar trends fig 2b the variation in paws can be used to characterize the water available for plants at a local scale as the measurement scale increases the magnitude of influence of the spatial and temporal fields e g soil topography and meteorology on the awhc and paws responses constantly changes gao et al 2016 hu et al 2017 yang et al 2012 as shown in figs 5 and 7 the impact of precipitation and soil types on awhc5 m and paws5 m variations showed significant differences the source of variation in different precipitation zones and soil types means the awhc and paws showed significant differentiation and diversity this study explored regional scale links among climate soil and vegetation for limited soil resources which is helpful for highlighting the effects of different factors on soil water resources over large areas 4 2 depth dependence as affected by rooting depth root distribution characteristics and rooting depth can differ greatly among vegetation types as shown in table 3 there is strong evidence that some plant species are able to extend roots in deep soils schenk and jackson 2002 silva and rego 2003 stoeckeler and kluender 1938 for example canadell et al 1996 reported that the global rooting depths of herbaceous plants shrubs and trees are 2 6 0 1 m 5 1 0 8 m and 7 0 1 2 m mean standard deviation respectively a number of tree species in evergreen tropical forests can have root systems that extend 8 m deep fan et al 2017 in semi arid regions the apple orchard has the deepest recorded root system and its average rooting depth is 23 2 m li et al 2019 many trees and shrubs have deeper roots table 3 rewald et al 2012 found six tree species that grew roots below 5 m and at least four of the six reached a depth of 18 m in arid areas acacia and prosopis are found to have roots reaching a depth of 20 m and 50 60 m respectively canadell et al 1996 fan et al 2017 stone and kalisz 1991 in addition there have been direct observations of roots at depths below 2 3 m in caves road cuts mine shafts and trenches in arid and semi arid regions tree species with deep rooting depths suggest that plants find deep soil water resources to grow and are evidence of water consumption by plants that grow for years with minimal or no rainfall therefore deep roots allow plants to access water from deeper soils on the clp the average cover thickness of loess is 50 100 m and the maximum thickness is 399 m the soil reservoir below 1 m is an important component of soil water resources a deeper rooting depth means there is more water stored and available in the soil for that plant which is critical to plant survival where water is limited however studies on root depth remain mostly confined to the uppermost 2 m soil layers research on deep profiles is scarce and there have been few studies on processes in the deep soil layers on the clp it has been found that some plant species can have root depths of up to 18 m in the regions moreover artificial plants are on average more deeply rooted than native plants wang et al 2013b in the study regions wang et al 2010 found that the maximum root depths under the artificial grasslands alfalfa artificial shrublands ck and woodlands pinus tabuliformis were 15 5 m 22 4 m and 21 5 m respectively the root depth of grasslands alfalfa can reach 5 m after 2 5 years of growth the average root depth of 23 kinds of artificial vegetation on the clp exceeded 10 m and even reached deeper soil layers table 3 these results indicate that awhc5 m gradually increased between sampling sites 11 56 and the paws5 m initially decreased with the introduction of deep rooted vegetation before increasing under shallow rooted vegetation the deep rooted vegetation has a critical effect on the balance of water nutrients and carbon in the deep soils the plant rooting depth has strong ecological plasticity heterogenous environmental conditions determine the ecological plasticity of rooting depth which can change with changes to habitats in water limited regions canadell et al 1999 fan et al 2017 fan et al 2017 summarized 2200 root observations of 1000 species along biotic and abiotic gradients and their results showed that the rooting depth was strongly sensitive to the local soil water deep roots are highly adaptive to local soil environments on the clp hodge 2004 which demonstrates the depth dependence of paws as affected by plant roots 4 3 implication of sasw for evaluating soil drying soil drying occurs even in intermediate soil layers and this impacts the water cycle by blocking water transport between the upper and deeper soil layers chen et al 2008 due to soil drying soil degradation as well as regional microclimate environment aridity may increase causing greater loss of land productivity wang et al 2010 soil drying has been noted in other regions of the world and has been the focus of some historical research it is also reported that soil drying in the deep soils led to the death of a forest which led to ecosystem degradation in russia wang et al 2010 soil drying resulted in vegetation biomass or stunted growth and localized and or regional vegetation die off on the clp wang et al 2015 similarly there have been many studies on soil drying in eastern amazonia available soil water was depleted from 4 to 8 m by plant water uptake during the dry season and deep soils were not recharged to previous levels due to an el niño southern oscillation event deep available soil water uptake not only took place during the dry season but also occurred during the wet season oliveira et al 2005 sarris et al 2007 seyfried et al 2005 zhao et al 2019 showed a similar result for a large scale soil drying sasw is highly variable and complex and it does not increase with precipitation therefore the sasw value has important implications for arid and semi arid ecosystems soil water balance the variation in sasw in the deep profiles are closely related to soil properties and plant traits the negative balance of soil water resources caused by overconsumption by deep root vegetation and soil drying occurred in deep profiles large scale implementation of revegetation changed land use and land cover on the clp which changed the vegetation distribution pattern the differences in sasw quantify the effects of large scale patterns of vegetation type on soil drying the introduction of deep rooted plants can aggravate soil drying over time and soil water deficits can reach a significant long term level deng et al 2016 wang et al 2013a yang et al 2012 for example huang and gallichand 2006 showed that 32 year old apple trees with robust deep roots could deplete most paws down to 10 m the recovery time back to the initial soil water content for the 0 10 m soil layer varied from 6 5 to 19 5 years with an average of 13 7 years jia et al 2015 also reported that available soil water cannot be replenished in deep profiles from rainfall therefore the circulation path of soil water is random and shallow li et al 2016 previous studies have characterized soil drying in the context of global warming and drought the underlying importance of global change may mask or buffer the local vegetation influences our research provides important information about the evolution of available soil water along the transect and this saturation during the non growing season and growing season is becoming more common the sasw value is a good indicator of whether deep soil environment to deteriorate over time in these regions to monitor and evaluate the sasw5 m in intermediate soil layers along the precipitation and revegetation gradient is an event of great significance 5 conclusions a large reservoir of stored water is readily available to plants in the deep soils on the chinese loess plateau in this study we investigated awhc paws and sasw to a depth of 5 m at a regional scale awhc5 m generally decreased from the south to the north paws5 m initially exhibited a decreasing trend and then increased and these trends were related to differences in vegetation types awhc5 m and paws5 m did differ significantly among different vegetation species with high amounts of variation bl showed the greatest water consumption among the introduced vegetation types the selected vegetation types could be divided into shallow and deep rooting vegetation types the soil available water for shallow rooted vegetation increased below depths of 2 m while deep rooted vegetation consumed soil available water in deeper layers leaving only 10 of the soil water remaining the variation in awhc5 m and paws5 m was greater in the 450 550 mm precipitation zone compared to the variation in rainfall among other precipitation zones partial correlation analysis showed that the soil particle composition is an important variable for explaining the awhc5 m and paws5 m in each layer the amount of awhc5 m and paws5 m differed among the different soil textures in addition sasw5 m differed significantly among the different vegetation types as a result of differences in the vegetation root distribution and maximum root depth the sasw5 m values for shallow rooted vegetation were significantly higher than for deep rooted vegetation suggesting that introduced vegetation with robust roots can extract stored water from deeper soil thereby minimizing water stress information about the variations in awhc5 m and paws5 m along a revegetation and precipitation gradient will be useful for preventing soil drying by regulating the

5878,available high quality precipitation datasets generally cover only recent periods to extend these datasets back in time is challenging due to historically lower rain gauge network density or poorer remote sensing in this study a bayesian joint probability method is presented to extend the temporal coverage of high quality precipitation datasets by calibrating reanalysis estimates relationships between precipitation estimates from a high quality dataset and precipitation estimates from a reanalysis dataset are established by using data from the overlapping period of the two datasets the relationships are then used to calibrate reanalysis estimates for the period when only reanalysis data is available rain gauge observations are also used to enhance the calibration the method brings the reanalysis dataset to the same spatial resolution as the high quality dataset corrects bias and makes the reanalysis data more consistent with the high quality dataset the calibrated estimates generated are presented in the form of ensembles to represent uncertainty the method is applied to the han river basin in china using the cmpa high quality dataset and the era interim reanalysis dataset the method is shown to be highly effective in improving the quality of era interim keywords bayesian joint probability method precipitation estimates temporal coverage reanalysis dataset uncertainty 1 introduction in recent times there has been significant improvement in the monitoring of precipitation in many parts of the world in china the rain gauge network has grown considerably over the last few decades the automatic rain gauge network set up in 2006 by the china meteorological administration cma now consists of more than 57 000 stations http www observation cma com in southeastern china the mean distance between two nearest automatic rain gauges is approximately 9 6 km shen et al 2018 while rain gauges provide the most accurate point measurement of precipitation remote sensing can provide better spatial coverage in precipitation estimation across the globe the noaa ncep climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph uses motion vectors derived from half hourly interval geostationary satellite ir imagery to propagate relatively high quality precipitation estimates over the globe the global precipitation measurement gpm mission is also expected to provide higher quality precipitation estimates resulting from better orbital inclination radar frequencies and channels of the passive microwave imager huffman et al 2014 high quality precipitation datasets have been developed by taking advantage of both high density rain gauge network and advanced remote sensing the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg is intended to intercalibrate merge and interpolate all satellite microwave precipitation estimates together with infrared satellite estimates and rain gauge analyses at high spatial 0 1 and temporal 30 min resolutions over the entire globe gaona et al 2016 the china merge precipitation analysis hourly v1 0 product cmpa used an improved probability density function optimal interpolation pdf oi method to generate 0 1 and hourly precipitation estimates over china by merging the satellite precipitation estimates from the cmorph and more than 30 000 automatic rain gauges shen et al 2014 owing to the high density rain gauge network and rigorous quality control the cmpa dataset for precipitation is of relatively high quality wang et al 2016 evaluated the cmpa dataset against a dense rain gauge network that was not incorporated in the interpolation process of the cmpa estimates their results indicated that the cmpa estimates capture the spatial patterns of typhoon related rain depth and are in agreement with the spatiotemporal evolutions of hourly gauge observations by correlation coefficients from 0 93 to 0 99 a drawback of these high quality precipitation datasets is that they are available only for relatively recent periods the gpm imerg product only covers the period following the launch of the gpm satellite in 2014 the cmpa product is only available after 2008 when the rain gauge network density became relatively high for many applications precipitation datasets of much longer temporal coverage are required extending the high quality datasets further back in time is challenging due to low rain gauge network density or limitations of remote sensing the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm which was launched in 1997 provided 3 hourly precipitation analysis at a spatial resolution of 0 25 for over 17 years huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 however the accuracy of trmm precipitation estimates left much to be desired huang et al 2014 suggested that the trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa products should be used with caution for extreme precipitation events reanalysis data is an alternative source of precipitation estimates physically based numerical models are able to generate precipitation estimates at various spatial and temporal resolutions and the temporal coverage could be longer than both rain gauges and remote sensing studies have indicated that reanalysis datasets are able to give reasonable monthly averaged surface temperature radiation fluxes and wind speed lindsay et al 2014 however the accuracy of the reanalysis precipitation estimates still needs to be improved due to the imperfect description of small scale physical processes of the numerical models leeuw et al 2015 nkiaka et al 2017 one way of improving the reanalysis data is to calibrate the reanalysis data against rain gauge observations however this requires the availability of high density rain gauge networks which are often not available in this study we introduce a method to calibrate the reanalysis data by taking advantage of the availability of high quality datasets such as cmpa for recent times using the period when both datasets are available we establish relationships between precipitation estimates of the high quality dataset and precipitation estimates of the reanalysis dataset the relationships can then be applied to calibrate the reanalysis estimates for the period when only reanalysis data is available the method brings the reanalysis dataset to the same spatial resolution as the high quality dataset corrects bias and makes the reanalysis data more consistent with the high quality dataset the calibrated estimates generated from our calibration method are presented in the form of ensembles to represent uncertainty the particular method we use is based on the bayesian joint probability bjp approach the bjp approach first developed for flood record augmentation has found wide applications robertson and wang 2012 schepen et al 2018 strazzo et al 2019 wang 2001 wang et al 2009 zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2019b zhao et al 2016 in bjp data normalization is used to handle skewed variables wang et al 2012 missing values are permitted and zero values are treated as censored data in addition multiple data sources are allowed due to their multivariate formulation in previous studies the bjp method is always used to establish relationships between predictors and predictand for each grid cell however the intersite correlations have never been considered before in this study the bjp method is used as a spatial model to quantifying intersite correlations between grid cells and rain gauges from different locations the efficacy of this calibration method for extending the temporal coverage of the cmpa precipitation dataset by calibrating the era interim reanalysis over the han river basin in china is evaluated in this study the han river basin is the water source of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project snwdp in china therefore availability of accurate precipitation estimates of long temporal coverage over this region is important the remainder of the paper is structured as follows the study area and data sources are introduced in section 2 an introduction of the bjp modelling method is provided and the evaluation methods are introduced in section 3 section 4 presents the evaluation results of the ensemble mean and ensemble distribution of calibrated precipitation estimates conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 study area and data the han river basin is located between 106 and 114 e and 29 34 n with an area of nearly 170 400 km2 fig 1 the basin is subject to sub tropical monsoon climate and its topography is highly complex the elevation of western han river basin is over 3000 m while the eastern han river basin is composed of recent alluvial plains li et al 2017 fig 2 illustrates the spatial characteristics of daily precipitation for each month it is clear that the precipitation shows high spatial and temporal variability over the han river basin especially in the wet months from may to september in july the daily mean precipitation is greater than 5 mm day with a standard deviation of greater than 10 mm day in the upper and lower sub basins over the period of 2008 2016 both the era interim and the cmpa datasets are used in this study a brief introduction of these two datasets has been presented in previous section in addition rain gauge observations of long temporal coverage are also used as inputs to bring additional information to the calibration the rain gauge observations are extracted from the daily surface climate variables of china dataset surf cli chn mul day v3 0 it was released by the china meteorological administration cma with high quality control out of the 756 long term national rain gauges 48 rain gauges are located in or around the han river basin and are used in this study fig 1 the daily era interim reanalysis precipitation hereafter original era daily is accumulated from two forecasts at 00 00 and 12 00 of 12 h precipitation each the cmpa daily precipitation hereafter cmpa daily is accumulated from hourly values the rain gauge observations hereafter gauge daily are already daily details of the final datasets used in this study are summarized in table 1 3 methods 3 1 the bjp method 3 1 1 model formulation in this study the bjp method is applied to calibrate the era daily using the cmpa daily the cmpa daily is treated as the most accurate owing to the high rain gauge network density and advanced remote sensing technique we denote the value of the given 0 1 cmpa daily grid cell as the predictand y the corresponding value of the nearest era daily as the predictor x 1 to enhance the calibration rain gauge observations are also used for calibration as well the distances from each 0 1 cmpa daily grid cell to the rain gauges are presented in fig 3 the mean distance between cmpa grid cells and the corresponding nearest gauge is approximately 30 km while the corresponding second nearest rain gauge is nearly 60 km thus only the two nearest rain gauges are selected as predictors x 2 and x 3 for the given cmpa daily grid cell here the probability distribution of daily precipitation is always highly skewed which makes it difficult for parameter inference to over this problem we transform both the predictand y and the predictors x t x 1 x 2 x 3 to normal distributions first the box cox transformation has been widely used for transformation however the one parameter box cox transformation is not always able to achieve variance stabilization while the two parameter box cox transformation leads to unrealistically large uncertainty the log sinh transformation is able to stabilize the variance and normalize the variable it has been proved to outperform both the one parameter and two parameter box cox transformations wang et al 2012 this transformation has also been tested on a wide range of hydrological data including hydrological extremes bennett et al 2014a bennett et al 2014b in this study the predictors x t the matrix of the three datasets are normalized to u t u 1 u 2 u 3 and the predictand y is normalized to v using the log sinh transformation 1 u i β x i 1 ln sinh α x i β x i x i 2 v β y 1 ln sinh α y β y y where α x i β x i α y a n d β y are unknown transformation parameters for predictors and predictand i 1 3 the matrix z t u 1 u 2 u 3 v is then assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution 3 z n μ where μ and are the mean vector and covariance matrices to be estimated 4 μ t μ u 1 μ u 2 μ u 3 μ v 5 σ r σ t where σ and r are the standard deviation vector and correlation coefficient matrix respectively 6 σ t σ u 1 σ u 2 σ u 3 σ v 7 r 1 r u 1 u 2 r u 1 u 3 r u 1 v r u 2 u 1 1 r u 2 u 3 r u 2 v r u 3 u 1 r u 3 u 2 1 r u 3 v r v u 1 r v u 2 r v u 3 1 note that the correlation coefficient matrix r is symmetric thus the joint distribution of predictand and predictors has a total of 14 unknown parameters zero values occasionally occur in dry months for both predictors and predictand over the han river basin this always leads to a mixed discrete continuous multivariate distribution which is difficult to formulate in this study we follow wang and robertson 2011 and treat zero values as censored data with unknown values below or equal to zero in this way the predictors and the predictand are considered to follow continuous multivariate distributions this treatment allows us to simplify the problem of mixed discrete continuous multivariate distribution and to deal with zero values 3 1 2 parameter inference the transformation parameters and the joint distribution parameters are estimated when the era daily gauge daily and cmpa daily are concurrently available the choice of training data is still debated as parameter inference is affected by seasonality effects pooling all data from different months is not suitable one way to solve this problem is to pre deseasonalize data before parameter inference studies have proved that deseasonalizing data could potential improve forecast skills when using neural network forecasting models nelson et al 1999 zhang and kline 2007 a more direct approach is to pool data with similar seasonality hamill 2007 suggested that including days from the same season would expand the training period and would likely improve the performance of the model as shown in fig 2 the characteristics of daily precipitation vary from month to month thus the daily values of each month are pooled together for each variable there are approximately 270 days in total that are selected to make parameter inferences for a given grid cell of cmpa daily in each month given a data series d x i of each predictor x i d x i x i t t 1 n i 1 2 3 the transformation parameters of α x i a n d β x i are estimated using a bayesian maximum a posteriori map solution the resulting parameter values of α x i a n d β x i are taken as point estimates parameter uncertainty is not considered for these parameters the transformation parameters of α y a n d β y are estimated using the same strategy as the predictors given a data series d y y t t 1 n the joint distribution parameters are then estimated using transformed data series of both predictors and predictand d u 1 u 2 u 3 v u 1 t u 2 t u 3 t v t t 1 n here we denote the 14 unknown parameters of the joint distribution as θ μ the posterior distribution of θ is estimated using a bayesian framework 8 p θ d u 1 u 2 u 3 v p θ p d u 1 u 2 u 3 v θ where p θ is the prior distribution of parameters and p d u 1 u 2 u 3 v θ is the likelihood in this study non informative distributions are used as priors of parameters θ p θ 1 as the posterior distributions of parameters θ are not standard distributions analytical integration is not appropriate to overcome this problem we use the markov chain monte carlo technique to draw a sample of parameter values which represent the joint posterior distribution of parameters θ specifically we use the gibbs sampling algorithm to draw 1000 samples from the conditional posterior distributions to diminish the influence of the starting values we discard the first 5000 iterations in markov chain simulation as burn in period we also set the length of the markov chain as 30 000 which is proportional to the number of variables to obtain sufficient number of representative samples of the posterior distribution zhao et al 2016 a visual inspection of the sampled parameter chains is made to monitor the convergence of the sample cowles and carlin 1996 3 1 3 model use for calibration once the parameters are sampled the bjp model can be used to calibrate the era daily when the cmpa daily is not available given a new set of predictor values d x i x i t t 1 n transformed values d u i u i t t 1 n can be found using the estimated transformation parameters α x i a n d β x i the posterior predictive distribution of v t is given by 9 f v v t p v t u 1 t u 2 t u 3 t θ p θ p d u 1 u 2 u 3 v θ d θ again the gibbs sampling algorithm is used to obtain samples of f v v t by giving each of the 1000 sets of parameter values θ the samples are then back transformed to produce a calibrated precipitation estimates of y t using parameters α y a n d β y finally we develop the bjp model for each grid cell of the cmpa daily and each month separately 3 2 evaluation methods 3 2 1 cross validation to assess the performance of the bjp calibration method a ten fold cross validation scheme is used here the daily values of both the predictors and the predictand in each month from 2008 to 2016 are pooled together both the predictors and the predictand are then partitioned into ten equal sized subsamples of the ten subsamples nine subsamples of approximately 240 daily values are used for training while the remaining one single subsample of nearly 30 daily values are used for validation this process is then repeated ten times with each of the ten subsamples used exactly once as the validation data the independently calibrated era daily estimates hereafter calibrated era daily for all the 10 sub samples are pooled together and compared against the cmpa daily estimates 3 2 2 evaluation of ensemble mean the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily for each 0 1 cmpa grid cell is calculated and evaluated for absolute value of relative bias rb root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse 10 r b t 1 t y t o t t 1 t o t 100 11 r m s e 1 t t 1 t y t o t 2 12 n s e 1 t 1 t y t o t 2 t 1 t o o t 2 where y t is the ensemble mean of the calibrated era daily precipitation for day t t 1 2 t o t is the cmpa daily precipitation which is treated as the most accurate precipitation estimates in this study o is the averaged cmpa daily precipitation over the period of analysis the rb is used to evaluate the agreement between the averaged value of ensemble mean of calibrated era daily and the cmpa daily while the rmse is used to evaluate the average error magnitude the nse is selected to evaluate the relative magnitude of the residual variance of the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily compared to the cmpa daily variance 3 2 3 evaluation of ensemble distribution the continuous ranked probability score matheson and winkler 1976 and the α index renard et al 2010 are used to evaluate the accuracy and the reliability of the fit of distribution in this study the continuous ranked probability score crps is used to provide an overall evaluation of the calibrated era daily for each 0 1 cmpa grid cell 13 c r p s 1 t t 1 t f y t h y t o t 2 d y where y t is the daily precipitation to be estimated for day t f is the cumulative distribution function of the calibrated era daily ensemble as represented by the sampled 1000 values and h is the heaviside step function defined as 14 h y t o t 0 y t o t 1 y t o t where o t is the cmpa daily precipitation which is treated as the actual precipitation when f is replaced by a step distribution based on a deterministic value such as the original era daily the crps is reduced to the mean absolute error mae a crps skill score is then calculated by comparing the crps of the calibrated era daily with the crps of a reference distribution for estimating precipitation 15 c r p s s s c r p s r e f c r p s c r p s r e f 100 in this study a cross validated climatology of cmpa daily is used as the reference a skill score of 100 indicates that the calibrated era daily ensemble is the same as the cmpa daily observation whereas a skill score of 0 suggests that the calibrated era daily ensemble shows no improvement over the cross validated climatology a negative skill score means that the calibrated era daily ensemble is inferior to the cross validated climatology the reliability of calibrated era daily is evaluated by the probability integral transforms pits of cmpa daily the pit of o t is given by 16 π t f o t where f is the cumulative distribution function of the calibrated era daily ensemble when o t is equal to zero the precise value for π t cannot be found from equation 16 instead a pseudo pit value is sampled from a uniform distribution with a range of 0 π t and subsequently using it with other real π t values to construct the pit plots schepen et al 2018 wang and robertson 2011 if the calibrated era daily ensemble is reliable π t should be uniformly distributed the π t values are then summarized into an α index 17 α 1 0 2 t t 1 t π t t t 1 where π t is the sorted π t in increasing order the α index ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the total deviation of π t from corresponding uniform quantile a higher α index indicates higher reliability 3 3 further analysis in this study an important assumption is made that the cmpa precipitation estimates are of high quality as such they can be used to calibrate the era reanalysis estimates it is not right to directly verify assumption as follows by comparing cmpa precipitation estimates with observations at gauges as the observations are likely to have been used in deriving the cmpa precipitation estimates here we indirectly evaluate the assumption as follows we use the 2008 2016 data to establish models to calibrate era reanalysis estimates against the cmpa precipitation estimates only unlike the models used in section 3 1 gauged observations are not used here the new calibration models are then used to calibrate the era reanalysis estimates for 1979 2007 the calibrated era reanalysis estimates are compared with gauged observations for the calibration to lead to improvement over the raw era reanalysis estimates the cmpa precipitation estimates would have to be more accurate than the era reanalysis estimates this further analysis is to ensure that the quality of the cmpa precipitation estimates are high enough that its use adds value to the calibration and does not adversely corrupt the era reanalysis estimates in practical applications the gauged observations are also used as predictors to derive the final estimates 4 results 4 1 ensemble mean the rb and rmse of the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily for each month are plotted and compared with the original era daily in fig 4 and fig 5 the rb and rmse of the original era daily are greatly reduced after the bjp calibration especially in wet months in summer in july the rb of the original era daily is always greater than 150 with rmse values greater than 10 mm day in contrast the calibrated era daily shows much higher accuracy in terms of rb values of lower than 50 and rmse values of lower than 8 mm day in most cmpa daily grid cells the reduction of rb and rmse values are also evident in other months the rb values reduce from nearly 100 to less than 50 while the rmse values reduce from approximately 5 mm day to less than 2 mm day in months in spring and autumn fig 6 compares the nse of the original era daily and the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily the results also suggest that the accuracy of the original era daily has been greatly improved after the bjp calibration in july the nse values of the original era daily are always less than 0 2 in contrast the nse values of the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily are greater than 0 5 for most grid cells the nse values increase from less than 0 4 to more than 0 6 after the bjp calibration in months in spring and autumn as well however we should also note that the nse values are still low from december to februrary owing to the relatively lower precipitation in these months shown in fig 2 4 2 ensemble distribution the crps skill score of original era daily and the crps skill score of calibrated era daily are compared in fig 7 the results suggest that the ensemble distribution of calibrated era daily is more accurate than the original era daily the calibrated era daily usually exhibits positive skill in most areas in july whereas negative skill is observed for original era daily improvement is observed in other months as well in terms of crps skill score the α index of calibrated era daily for each month is presented in fig 8 it is clear that the α index is mostly in the range of 0 9 to 1 0 for all months indicating that the calibrated era daily is of high reliability the pit diagram of a selected grid cell with lowest α index value of 0 825 in february is also given in fig 8 although small departures from the diagonal line are observed the pit values for the selected grid cell lie mostly within the kolmogorov 5 significance bands suggesting that the uncertainty spread is reliable for all months 4 3 calibrated era daily precipitation for 1979 2007 the bjp models are subsequently established based on all available 2008 2016 data of 0 1 cmpa daily precipitation original era daily and gauge daily the models are then used to produce calibrated era daily from the original era daily and gauge daily for 1979 2007 for which 0 1 cmpa daily is not available fig 9 compares the daily precipitation distribution of the original era daily the gauge daily and the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily for an extreme precipitation event in october 1983 beginning on 3 october 1983 and lasting to 5 october 1983 an extreme precipitation event occurred in the han river basin similar to the example shown in section 4 1 the original era daily is too low in spatial variability compared with the gauge daily the high precipitation intensity observed by the gauge daily is greatly underestimated by the original era daily the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily takes guidance from both the original era daily and gauge daily the spatial characteristics of the original era daily are broadly preserved while high precipitation intensity of the gauge daily is well captured by the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily 4 4 further analysis recalling section 3 3 the purpose of this further analysis is to ensure that the quality of the cmpa precipitation estimates is high enough that its use adds value to the calibration and does not adversely corrupt the era reanalysis estimates we use the 2008 2016 data to establish models to calibrate era reanalysis estimates against the cmpa precipitation estimates only unlike the models used in section 3 1 gauged observations are not used here the new calibration models are then used to calibrate the era reanalysis estimates for 1979 2007 we should note that the direct comparison between gauged observations and gridded estimates should be avoided due to the different representativeness of these two datasets currently there are three indirect approaches to compare the gauged observations and gridded estimates zhao and fu 2006 suggested using the kriging technique to upscale gauged observations onto the grids and then compare with the gridded estimates however the upscaling approach will introduce large errors and uncertainties when the gauges are sparsely distributed another approach is downscaling the gridded estimates at each station site using the bilinear interpolation method gao and liu 2012 nevertheless the downscaling approach may smooth extremes from the gridded data accadia et al 2003 the third approach is to compare the gridded estimates and averaged values of gauged observations falling within the corresponding grid cell this approach has been proved to work well with precipitation estimates comparisons blacutt et al 2015 ward et al 2011 however we should note that spatial sampling error exists owing to small spatial scale of rainfall systems compared to rain gauge network density krajewski et al 2000 morrissey et al 1995 therefore it is practically impossible to identify an optimal method applicable for all areas duan et al 2016 in this study the third approach is adapted here to compare the calibrated era daily and the original era daily against the gauged observations the calibrated era daily is at a spatial resolution of 0 1 as is the cmpa daily thus there is only one gauge falling within each 0 1 grid cell of calibrated era daily we directly compare the calibrated era daily and the corresponding gauged observations here for grid cells of the original era daily containing more than one gauge the averaged values of the gauges are calculated the results are then compared against the original era daily the nse of original era daily and ensemble mean of calibrated era daily for the period of 1979 2007 are then presented in fig 10 the nse of the calibrated era daily is much more consistent among gauge stations than the original era daily the latter can be very poor in performance in some locations and months in most months the median nse of the calibrated era daily is better than the original era daily overall the calibration has led to considerable improvement this analysis indicates that the use of the cmpa precipitation estimates as a high quality dataset is reasonable at least for this study case 5 conclusions this paper presents a bayesian joint probability bjp method to extend the temporal coverage of high quality precipitation datasets by calibrating reanalysis estimates the key concept is as follows relationships between precipitation estimates from a high quality dataset and precipitation estimates from a reanalysis dataset can be established by using data from the overlapping period of the two datasets the relationships can then be used to calibrate reanalysis estimates for the period when only reanalysis data is available additionally the method makes use of long records from rain gauges to enhance the calibration the method brings the reanalysis dataset to the same spatial resolution of the high quality dataset corrects bias and makes the reanalysis data more consistent with the high quality dataset the calibrated estimates generated are presented in the form of ensembles to represent uncertainty in this study the bjp method is used to extend the temporal coverage of a high quality precipitation dataset cmpa 2008 2016 by calibrating the era interim reanalysis precipitation estimates 1979 2016 over the han river basin records from a sparsely distributed rain gauge network 1979 2016 are also used to enhance the calibration to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of calibrated precipitation estimates a ten fold cross validation scheme is applied to the overlapping period 2008 2016 of the three datasets the original reanalysis estimates and the calibrated reanalysis estimates are evaluated against the precipitation estimates from the high quality dataset further analysis is performed to ensure that the quality of the cmpa precipitation estimates is high enough that its use adds value to the calibration and does not adversely corrupt the era reanalysis estimates the calibrated reanalysis estimates are shown to be much more accurate than the original reanalysis estimates in terms of rb rmse and crps skill score the uncertainty spread produced from the calibration is shown to be reliable the cmpa dataset is also proved to be effective to calibration we conclude that the method introduced in this study is highly effective in improving the quality of era interim the fifth generation of reanalysis dataset from ecmwf era 5 will be published with a horizontal resolution of nearly 30 km from 1950 to the present by early 2019 brönnimann et al 2018 the application of the calibration method developed in this study to the new

dataset uncertainty 1 introduction in recent times there has been significant improvement in the monitoring of precipitation in many parts of the world in china the rain gauge network has grown considerably over the last few decades the automatic rain gauge network set up in 2006 by the china meteorological administration cma now consists of more than 57 000 stations http www observation cma com in southeastern china the mean distance between two nearest automatic rain gauges is approximately 9 6 km shen et al 2018 while rain gauges provide the most accurate point measurement of precipitation remote sensing can provide better spatial coverage in precipitation estimation across the globe the noaa ncep climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph uses motion vectors derived from half hourly interval geostationary satellite ir imagery to propagate relatively high quality precipitation estimates over the globe the global precipitation measurement gpm mission is also expected to provide higher quality precipitation estimates resulting from better orbital inclination radar frequencies and channels of the passive microwave imager huffman et al 2014 high quality precipitation datasets have been developed by taking advantage of both high density rain gauge network and advanced remote sensing the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg is intended to intercalibrate merge and interpolate all satellite microwave precipitation estimates together with infrared satellite estimates and rain gauge analyses at high spatial 0 1 and temporal 30 min resolutions over the entire globe gaona et al 2016 the china merge precipitation analysis hourly v1 0 product cmpa used an improved probability density function optimal interpolation pdf oi method to generate 0 1 and hourly precipitation estimates over china by merging the satellite precipitation estimates from the cmorph and more than 30 000 automatic rain gauges shen et al 2014 owing to the high density rain gauge network and rigorous quality control the cmpa dataset for precipitation is of relatively high quality wang et al 2016 evaluated the cmpa dataset against a dense rain gauge network that was not incorporated in the interpolation process of the cmpa estimates their results indicated that the cmpa estimates capture the spatial patterns of typhoon related rain depth and are in agreement with the spatiotemporal evolutions of hourly gauge observations by correlation coefficients from 0 93 to 0 99 a drawback of these high quality precipitation datasets is that they are available only for relatively recent periods the gpm imerg product only covers the period following the launch of the gpm satellite in 2014 the cmpa product is only available after 2008 when the rain gauge network density became relatively high for many applications precipitation datasets of much longer temporal coverage are required extending the high quality datasets further back in time is challenging due to low rain gauge network density or limitations of remote sensing the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm which was launched in 1997 provided 3 hourly precipitation analysis at a spatial resolution of 0 25 for over 17 years huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 however the accuracy of trmm precipitation estimates left much to be desired huang et al 2014 suggested that the trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa products should be used with caution for extreme precipitation events reanalysis data is an alternative source of precipitation estimates physically based numerical models are able to generate precipitation estimates at various spatial and temporal resolutions and the temporal coverage could be longer than both rain gauges and remote sensing studies have indicated that reanalysis datasets are able to give reasonable monthly averaged surface temperature radiation fluxes and wind speed lindsay et al 2014 however the accuracy of the reanalysis precipitation estimates still needs to be improved due to the imperfect description of small scale physical processes of the numerical models leeuw et al 2015 nkiaka et al 2017 one way of improving the reanalysis data is to calibrate the reanalysis data against rain gauge observations however this requires the availability of high density rain gauge networks which are often not available in this study we introduce a method to calibrate the reanalysis data by taking advantage of the availability of high quality datasets such as cmpa for recent times using the period when both datasets are available we establish relationships between precipitation estimates of the high quality dataset and precipitation estimates of the reanalysis dataset the relationships can then be applied to calibrate the reanalysis estimates for the period when only reanalysis data is available the method brings the reanalysis dataset to the same spatial resolution as the high quality dataset corrects bias and makes the reanalysis data more consistent with the high quality dataset the calibrated estimates generated from our calibration method are presented in the form of ensembles to represent uncertainty the particular method we use is based on the bayesian joint probability bjp approach the bjp approach first developed for flood record augmentation has found wide applications robertson and wang 2012 schepen et al 2018 strazzo et al 2019 wang 2001 wang et al 2009 zhao et al 2019a zhao et al 2019b zhao et al 2016 in bjp data normalization is used to handle skewed variables wang et al 2012 missing values are permitted and zero values are treated as censored data in addition multiple data sources are allowed due to their multivariate formulation in previous studies the bjp method is always used to establish relationships between predictors and predictand for each grid cell however the intersite correlations have never been considered before in this study the bjp method is used as a spatial model to quantifying intersite correlations between grid cells and rain gauges from different locations the efficacy of this calibration method for extending the temporal coverage of the cmpa precipitation dataset by calibrating the era interim reanalysis over the han river basin in china is evaluated in this study the han river basin is the water source of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project snwdp in china therefore availability of accurate precipitation estimates of long temporal coverage over this region is important the remainder of the paper is structured as follows the study area and data sources are introduced in section 2 an introduction of the bjp modelling method is provided and the evaluation methods are introduced in section 3 section 4 presents the evaluation results of the ensemble mean and ensemble distribution of calibrated precipitation estimates conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 study area and data the han river basin is located between 106 and 114 e and 29 34 n with an area of nearly 170 400 km2 fig 1 the basin is subject to sub tropical monsoon climate and its topography is highly complex the elevation of western han river basin is over 3000 m while the eastern han river basin is composed of recent alluvial plains li et al 2017 fig 2 illustrates the spatial characteristics of daily precipitation for each month it is clear that the precipitation shows high spatial and temporal variability over the han river basin especially in the wet months from may to september in july the daily mean precipitation is greater than 5 mm day with a standard deviation of greater than 10 mm day in the upper and lower sub basins over the period of 2008 2016 both the era interim and the cmpa datasets are used in this study a brief introduction of these two datasets has been presented in previous section in addition rain gauge observations of long temporal coverage are also used as inputs to bring additional information to the calibration the rain gauge observations are extracted from the daily surface climate variables of china dataset surf cli chn mul day v3 0 it was released by the china meteorological administration cma with high quality control out of the 756 long term national rain gauges 48 rain gauges are located in or around the han river basin and are used in this study fig 1 the daily era interim reanalysis precipitation hereafter original era daily is accumulated from two forecasts at 00 00 and 12 00 of 12 h precipitation each the cmpa daily precipitation hereafter cmpa daily is accumulated from hourly values the rain gauge observations hereafter gauge daily are already daily details of the final datasets used in this study are summarized in table 1 3 methods 3 1 the bjp method 3 1 1 model formulation in this study the bjp method is applied to calibrate the era daily using the cmpa daily the cmpa daily is treated as the most accurate owing to the high rain gauge network density and advanced remote sensing technique we denote the value of the given 0 1 cmpa daily grid cell as the predictand y the corresponding value of the nearest era daily as the predictor x 1 to enhance the calibration rain gauge observations are also used for calibration as well the distances from each 0 1 cmpa daily grid cell to the rain gauges are presented in fig 3 the mean distance between cmpa grid cells and the corresponding nearest gauge is approximately 30 km while the corresponding second nearest rain gauge is nearly 60 km thus only the two nearest rain gauges are selected as predictors x 2 and x 3 for the given cmpa daily grid cell here the probability distribution of daily precipitation is always highly skewed which makes it difficult for parameter inference to over this problem we transform both the predictand y and the predictors x t x 1 x 2 x 3 to normal distributions first the box cox transformation has been widely used for transformation however the one parameter box cox transformation is not always able to achieve variance stabilization while the two parameter box cox transformation leads to unrealistically large uncertainty the log sinh transformation is able to stabilize the variance and normalize the variable it has been proved to outperform both the one parameter and two parameter box cox transformations wang et al 2012 this transformation has also been tested on a wide range of hydrological data including hydrological extremes bennett et al 2014a bennett et al 2014b in this study the predictors x t the matrix of the three datasets are normalized to u t u 1 u 2 u 3 and the predictand y is normalized to v using the log sinh transformation 1 u i β x i 1 ln sinh α x i β x i x i 2 v β y 1 ln sinh α y β y y where α x i β x i α y a n d β y are unknown transformation parameters for predictors and predictand i 1 3 the matrix z t u 1 u 2 u 3 v is then assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution 3 z n μ where μ and are the mean vector and covariance matrices to be estimated 4 μ t μ u 1 μ u 2 μ u 3 μ v 5 σ r σ t where σ and r are the standard deviation vector and correlation coefficient matrix respectively 6 σ t σ u 1 σ u 2 σ u 3 σ v 7 r 1 r u 1 u 2 r u 1 u 3 r u 1 v r u 2 u 1 1 r u 2 u 3 r u 2 v r u 3 u 1 r u 3 u 2 1 r u 3 v r v u 1 r v u 2 r v u 3 1 note that the correlation coefficient matrix r is symmetric thus the joint distribution of predictand and predictors has a total of 14 unknown parameters zero values occasionally occur in dry months for both predictors and predictand over the han river basin this always leads to a mixed discrete continuous multivariate distribution which is difficult to formulate in this study we follow wang and robertson 2011 and treat zero values as censored data with unknown values below or equal to zero in this way the predictors and the predictand are considered to follow continuous multivariate distributions this treatment allows us to simplify the problem of mixed discrete continuous multivariate distribution and to deal with zero values 3 1 2 parameter inference the transformation parameters and the joint distribution parameters are estimated when the era daily gauge daily and cmpa daily are concurrently available the choice of training data is still debated as parameter inference is affected by seasonality effects pooling all data from different months is not suitable one way to solve this problem is to pre deseasonalize data before parameter inference studies have proved that deseasonalizing data could potential improve forecast skills when using neural network forecasting models nelson et al 1999 zhang and kline 2007 a more direct approach is to pool data with similar seasonality hamill 2007 suggested that including days from the same season would expand the training period and would likely improve the performance of the model as shown in fig 2 the characteristics of daily precipitation vary from month to month thus the daily values of each month are pooled together for each variable there are approximately 270 days in total that are selected to make parameter inferences for a given grid cell of cmpa daily in each month given a data series d x i of each predictor x i d x i x i t t 1 n i 1 2 3 the transformation parameters of α x i a n d β x i are estimated using a bayesian maximum a posteriori map solution the resulting parameter values of α x i a n d β x i are taken as point estimates parameter uncertainty is not considered for these parameters the transformation parameters of α y a n d β y are estimated using the same strategy as the predictors given a data series d y y t t 1 n the joint distribution parameters are then estimated using transformed data series of both predictors and predictand d u 1 u 2 u 3 v u 1 t u 2 t u 3 t v t t 1 n here we denote the 14 unknown parameters of the joint distribution as θ μ the posterior distribution of θ is estimated using a bayesian framework 8 p θ d u 1 u 2 u 3 v p θ p d u 1 u 2 u 3 v θ where p θ is the prior distribution of parameters and p d u 1 u 2 u 3 v θ is the likelihood in this study non informative distributions are used as priors of parameters θ p θ 1 as the posterior distributions of parameters θ are not standard distributions analytical integration is not appropriate to overcome this problem we use the markov chain monte carlo technique to draw a sample of parameter values which represent the joint posterior distribution of parameters θ specifically we use the gibbs sampling algorithm to draw 1000 samples from the conditional posterior distributions to diminish the influence of the starting values we discard the first 5000 iterations in markov chain simulation as burn in period we also set the length of the markov chain as 30 000 which is proportional to the number of variables to obtain sufficient number of representative samples of the posterior distribution zhao et al 2016 a visual inspection of the sampled parameter chains is made to monitor the convergence of the sample cowles and carlin 1996 3 1 3 model use for calibration once the parameters are sampled the bjp model can be used to calibrate the era daily when the cmpa daily is not available given a new set of predictor values d x i x i t t 1 n transformed values d u i u i t t 1 n can be found using the estimated transformation parameters α x i a n d β x i the posterior predictive distribution of v t is given by 9 f v v t p v t u 1 t u 2 t u 3 t θ p θ p d u 1 u 2 u 3 v θ d θ again the gibbs sampling algorithm is used to obtain samples of f v v t by giving each of the 1000 sets of parameter values θ the samples are then back transformed to produce a calibrated precipitation estimates of y t using parameters α y a n d β y finally we develop the bjp model for each grid cell of the cmpa daily and each month separately 3 2 evaluation methods 3 2 1 cross validation to assess the performance of the bjp calibration method a ten fold cross validation scheme is used here the daily values of both the predictors and the predictand in each month from 2008 to 2016 are pooled together both the predictors and the predictand are then partitioned into ten equal sized subsamples of the ten subsamples nine subsamples of approximately 240 daily values are used for training while the remaining one single subsample of nearly 30 daily values are used for validation this process is then repeated ten times with each of the ten subsamples used exactly once as the validation data the independently calibrated era daily estimates hereafter calibrated era daily for all the 10 sub samples are pooled together and compared against the cmpa daily estimates 3 2 2 evaluation of ensemble mean the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily for each 0 1 cmpa grid cell is calculated and evaluated for absolute value of relative bias rb root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse 10 r b t 1 t y t o t t 1 t o t 100 11 r m s e 1 t t 1 t y t o t 2 12 n s e 1 t 1 t y t o t 2 t 1 t o o t 2 where y t is the ensemble mean of the calibrated era daily precipitation for day t t 1 2 t o t is the cmpa daily precipitation which is treated as the most accurate precipitation estimates in this study o is the averaged cmpa daily precipitation over the period of analysis the rb is used to evaluate the agreement between the averaged value of ensemble mean of calibrated era daily and the cmpa daily while the rmse is used to evaluate the average error magnitude the nse is selected to evaluate the relative magnitude of the residual variance of the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily compared to the cmpa daily variance 3 2 3 evaluation of ensemble distribution the continuous ranked probability score matheson and winkler 1976 and the α index renard et al 2010 are used to evaluate the accuracy and the reliability of the fit of distribution in this study the continuous ranked probability score crps is used to provide an overall evaluation of the calibrated era daily for each 0 1 cmpa grid cell 13 c r p s 1 t t 1 t f y t h y t o t 2 d y where y t is the daily precipitation to be estimated for day t f is the cumulative distribution function of the calibrated era daily ensemble as represented by the sampled 1000 values and h is the heaviside step function defined as 14 h y t o t 0 y t o t 1 y t o t where o t is the cmpa daily precipitation which is treated as the actual precipitation when f is replaced by a step distribution based on a deterministic value such as the original era daily the crps is reduced to the mean absolute error mae a crps skill score is then calculated by comparing the crps of the calibrated era daily with the crps of a reference distribution for estimating precipitation 15 c r p s s s c r p s r e f c r p s c r p s r e f 100 in this study a cross validated climatology of cmpa daily is used as the reference a skill score of 100 indicates that the calibrated era daily ensemble is the same as the cmpa daily observation whereas a skill score of 0 suggests that the calibrated era daily ensemble shows no improvement over the cross validated climatology a negative skill score means that the calibrated era daily ensemble is inferior to the cross validated climatology the reliability of calibrated era daily is evaluated by the probability integral transforms pits of cmpa daily the pit of o t is given by 16 π t f o t where f is the cumulative distribution function of the calibrated era daily ensemble when o t is equal to zero the precise value for π t cannot be found from equation 16 instead a pseudo pit value is sampled from a uniform distribution with a range of 0 π t and subsequently using it with other real π t values to construct the pit plots schepen et al 2018 wang and robertson 2011 if the calibrated era daily ensemble is reliable π t should be uniformly distributed the π t values are then summarized into an α index 17 α 1 0 2 t t 1 t π t t t 1 where π t is the sorted π t in increasing order the α index ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the total deviation of π t from corresponding uniform quantile a higher α index indicates higher reliability 3 3 further analysis in this study an important assumption is made that the cmpa precipitation estimates are of high quality as such they can be used to calibrate the era reanalysis estimates it is not right to directly verify assumption as follows by comparing cmpa precipitation estimates with observations at gauges as the observations are likely to have been used in deriving the cmpa precipitation estimates here we indirectly evaluate the assumption as follows we use the 2008 2016 data to establish models to calibrate era reanalysis estimates against the cmpa precipitation estimates only unlike the models used in section 3 1 gauged observations are not used here the new calibration models are then used to calibrate the era reanalysis estimates for 1979 2007 the calibrated era reanalysis estimates are compared with gauged observations for the calibration to lead to improvement over the raw era reanalysis estimates the cmpa precipitation estimates would have to be more accurate than the era reanalysis estimates this further analysis is to ensure that the quality of the cmpa precipitation estimates are high enough that its use adds value to the calibration and does not adversely corrupt the era reanalysis estimates in practical applications the gauged observations are also used as predictors to derive the final estimates 4 results 4 1 ensemble mean the rb and rmse of the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily for each month are plotted and compared with the original era daily in fig 4 and fig 5 the rb and rmse of the original era daily are greatly reduced after the bjp calibration especially in wet months in summer in july the rb of the original era daily is always greater than 150 with rmse values greater than 10 mm day in contrast the calibrated era daily shows much higher accuracy in terms of rb values of lower than 50 and rmse values of lower than 8 mm day in most cmpa daily grid cells the reduction of rb and rmse values are also evident in other months the rb values reduce from nearly 100 to less than 50 while the rmse values reduce from approximately 5 mm day to less than 2 mm day in months in spring and autumn fig 6 compares the nse of the original era daily and the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily the results also suggest that the accuracy of the original era daily has been greatly improved after the bjp calibration in july the nse values of the original era daily are always less than 0 2 in contrast the nse values of the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily are greater than 0 5 for most grid cells the nse values increase from less than 0 4 to more than 0 6 after the bjp calibration in months in spring and autumn as well however we should also note that the nse values are still low from december to februrary owing to the relatively lower precipitation in these months shown in fig 2 4 2 ensemble distribution the crps skill score of original era daily and the crps skill score of calibrated era daily are compared in fig 7 the results suggest that the ensemble distribution of calibrated era daily is more accurate than the original era daily the calibrated era daily usually exhibits positive skill in most areas in july whereas negative skill is observed for original era daily improvement is observed in other months as well in terms of crps skill score the α index of calibrated era daily for each month is presented in fig 8 it is clear that the α index is mostly in the range of 0 9 to 1 0 for all months indicating that the calibrated era daily is of high reliability the pit diagram of a selected grid cell with lowest α index value of 0 825 in february is also given in fig 8 although small departures from the diagonal line are observed the pit values for the selected grid cell lie mostly within the kolmogorov 5 significance bands suggesting that the uncertainty spread is reliable for all months 4 3 calibrated era daily precipitation for 1979 2007 the bjp models are subsequently established based on all available 2008 2016 data of 0 1 cmpa daily precipitation original era daily and gauge daily the models are then used to produce calibrated era daily from the original era daily and gauge daily for 1979 2007 for which 0 1 cmpa daily is not available fig 9 compares the daily precipitation distribution of the original era daily the gauge daily and the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily for an extreme precipitation event in october 1983 beginning on 3 october 1983 and lasting to 5 october 1983 an extreme precipitation event occurred in the han river basin similar to the example shown in section 4 1 the original era daily is too low in spatial variability compared with the gauge daily the high precipitation intensity observed by the gauge daily is greatly underestimated by the original era daily the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily takes guidance from both the original era daily and gauge daily the spatial characteristics of the original era daily are broadly preserved while high precipitation intensity of the gauge daily is well captured by the ensemble mean of calibrated era daily 4 4 further analysis recalling section 3 3 the purpose of this further analysis is to ensure that the quality of the cmpa precipitation estimates is high enough that its use adds value to the calibration and does not adversely corrupt the era reanalysis estimates we use the 2008 2016 data to establish models to calibrate era reanalysis estimates against the cmpa precipitation estimates only unlike the models used in section 3 1 gauged observations are not used here the new calibration models are then used to calibrate the era reanalysis estimates for 1979 2007 we should note that the direct comparison between gauged observations and gridded estimates should be avoided due to the different representativeness of these two datasets currently there are three indirect approaches to compare the gauged observations and gridded estimates zhao and fu 2006 suggested using the kriging technique to upscale gauged observations onto the grids and then compare with the gridded estimates however the upscaling approach will introduce large errors and uncertainties when the gauges are sparsely distributed another approach is downscaling the gridded estimates at each station site using the bilinear interpolation method gao and liu 2012 nevertheless the downscaling approach may smooth extremes from the gridded data accadia et al 2003 the third approach is to compare the gridded estimates and averaged values of gauged observations falling within the corresponding grid cell this approach has been proved to work well with precipitation estimates comparisons blacutt et al 2015 ward et al 2011 however we should note that spatial sampling error exists owing to small spatial scale of rainfall systems compared to rain gauge network density krajewski et al 2000 morrissey et al 1995 therefore it is practically impossible to identify an optimal method applicable for all areas duan et al 2016 in this study the third approach is adapted here to compare the calibrated era daily and the original era daily against the gauged observations the calibrated era daily is at a spatial resolution of 0 1 as is the cmpa daily thus there is only one gauge falling within each 0 1 grid cell of calibrated era daily we directly compare the calibrated era daily and the corresponding gauged observations here for grid cells of the original era daily containing more than one gauge the averaged values of the gauges are calculated the results are then compared against the original era daily the nse of original era daily and ensemble mean of calibrated era daily for the period of 1979 2007 are then presented in fig 10 the nse of the calibrated era daily is much more consistent among gauge stations than the original era daily the latter can be very poor in performance in some locations and months in most months the median nse of the calibrated era daily is better than the original era daily overall the calibration has led to considerable improvement this analysis indicates that the use of the cmpa precipitation estimates as a high quality dataset is reasonable at least for this study case 5 conclusions this paper presents a bayesian joint probability bjp method to extend the temporal coverage of high quality precipitation datasets by calibrating reanalysis estimates the key concept is as follows relationships between precipitation estimates from a high quality dataset and precipitation estimates from a reanalysis dataset can be established by using data from the overlapping period of the two datasets the relationships can then be used to calibrate reanalysis estimates for the period when only reanalysis data is available additionally the method makes use of long records from rain gauges to enhance the calibration the method brings the reanalysis dataset to the same spatial resolution of the high quality dataset corrects bias and makes the reanalysis data more consistent with the high quality dataset the calibrated estimates generated are presented in the form of ensembles to represent uncertainty in this study the bjp method is used to extend the temporal coverage of a high quality precipitation dataset cmpa 2008 2016 by calibrating the era interim reanalysis precipitation estimates 1979 2016 over the han river basin records from a sparsely distributed rain gauge network 1979 2016 are also used to enhance the calibration to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of calibrated precipitation estimates a ten fold cross validation scheme is applied to the overlapping period 2008 2016 of the three datasets the original reanalysis estimates and the calibrated reanalysis estimates are evaluated against the precipitation estimates from the high quality dataset further analysis is performed to ensure that the quality of the cmpa precipitation estimates is high enough that its use adds value to the calibration and does not adversely corrupt the era reanalysis estimates the calibrated reanalysis estimates are shown to be much more accurate than the original reanalysis estimates in terms of rb rmse and crps skill score the uncertainty spread produced from the calibration is shown to be reliable the cmpa dataset is also proved to be effective to calibration we conclude that the method introduced in this study is highly effective in improving the quality of era interim the fifth generation of reanalysis dataset from ecmwf era 5 will be published with a horizontal resolution of nearly 30 km from 1950 to the present by early 2019 brönnimann et al 2018 the application of the calibration method developed in this study to the new reanalysis products will be straightforward declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

5879,based on 487 event based precipitation samples collected at 4 stations in the fenhe river basin on the eastern chinese loess plateau eclp during 2016 2017 we analyzed the influences of meteorological parameters geographical parameters sub cloud evaporation and recycled moisture on precipitation and its isotopic compositions a strong seasonal variation was observed in δ18o δ2h d excess of precipitation although there are no obviously correlations between precipitation δ18o and meteorological parameters for all precipitation data in the eclp stable isotopic signature on precipitation displayed variability in different temperature or precipitation amount gradient the local meteoric water line was calculated to be δ2h 7 7δ18o 7 0 indicating raindrops have undergone partial evaporation the sub cloud evaporation and the recycled moisture from evapotranspiration have been proven to have strong influence on the isotopic composition precipitation of eclp results show that 12 1 4 7 of precipitation are evaporated before reaching the ground in the eclp during march october the moisture recycling fraction accounted for 28 14 to local precipitation the significant seasonal variation of the remaining fraction f of raindrop mass can be seen in the linfen station and the more significantly seasonal fluctuation of the f can be observed in 2017 the remaining fraction of rainfall is always larger under a lower air temperature larger precipitation amount and higher relative humidity this study will improve the understanding of regional water cycling and have implications for water resource management during water shortages keywords stable isotope precipitation sub cloud evaporation recycled moisture eastern chinese loess plateau 1 introduction as the initial source of terrestrial water atmospheric precipitation is an important part of the natural water cycle the variations in precipitation can directly affect the total amount of regional water resources and play a vital role in industrial and irrigation water management regionally especially in arid and semi arid areas the isotopic composition of precipitation usually contains important information on the regional water cycle and environment and the δ2h δ18o and d excess δ2h 8 δ18o in precipitation have been widely used for hydrological and climatic research projects since the earliest studies in the 1960 s craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 dansgaard et al 1993 based on the isotopic composition of precipitation researchers can a clarify the mechanisms controlling precipitation processes pang et al 2011 kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016a b zwart et al 2016 wang et al 2017 b estimate regional sub cloud evaporation processes wang et al 2016b li et al 2016a c and c trace and determine moisture sources kurita et al 2015 li et al 2016a wang et al 2016c thereby providing scientific evidence for the interactions among precipitation ground water and surface water kong and pang 2012 li et al 2016b tan et al 2016 sun et al 2016a b c d 2017 2018 the values of δ2h and δ18o in precipitation decrease or increase spatially or temporally depending on conditions such as the vapour source topographic factors moisture recycling processes precipitation amounts and air temperatures stumpp et al 2014 sun et al 2017 2018 li et al 2016a b wang et al 2017 these relationships between the environmental controlling factors and precipitation isotopes known as environmental effects can be well observed by measuring the isotopic compositions of both global precipitation johnsen et al 1972 lorius et al 1985 dansgaard et al 1993 and regional precipitation thompson et al 2013 kreutz 2003 according to previous studies dansgaard 1964 pang et al 2011 li et al 2016a precipitation δ18o usually shows a strong positive correlation with temperature t and a negative relationship with precipitation amount p in china the δ18o t and δ18o p relationships tend to show significant spatial variability a significant δ18o t relationship was observed in high mountainous areas sun et al 2019 and arid inland areas kong et al 2013 moreover the δ18o p relationship in the monsoon region has been found to be significantly stronger than that in the inland region zhang and wang 2016 cai et al 2017 in the arid inland areas of northwest china a large number of precipitation δ2h and δ18o observations have been obtained in the tianshan mountains kreutz 2003 sun et al 2016b wang et al 2016a b c 2017 tarim river basin sun et al 2016a c d 2018 kunlun mountains sun et al 2017 qilian mountains li et al 2016b and wushaoling mountains li et al 2016a and these data have been proven to be associated with vapour source conditions and air temperatures at the observation stations geographical latitude and elevation controlling factors are also important factors that can influence precipitation δ18o based on the chnip chinese network of isotopes in precipitation database the regression model δ18o 0 041longitude 0 312latitude 0 002altitude m 8 892 was reported by liu et al 2014 for china and the gradient between precipitation δ18o and latitude was demonstrated to be in the range of 0 24 to 0 22 a significant linear gradient between precipitation and altitude was also reported 0 13 100 m in china liu et al 2014 the sub cloud evaporation process is though to have a strong influence on the stable isotope composition of precipitation during dry and warm conditions salamalikis et al 2016 when raindrops pass through unsaturated air sub cloud evaporation usually leads to enrichment of stable isotopes in falling raindrops especially in arid and semi arid areas pang et al 2011 li et al 2016a during this process the light isotopes 1h and 16o in raindrops are preferentially evaporated while the heavy isotopes 2h and 18o are gradually enriched and the diffusion processes during evaporation can result in a decreasing trend of d excess dansgaard 1964 in rainfall wang et al 2017 in addition to the above controlling factors the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of regional precipitation usually can be modified by the terrestrial recycled moisture the recycled moisture contributed by evapotranspiration including water vapour originating from evaporation and transpiration off the land surface usually plays a very important role in the water cycle especially in continental precipitation zhang and wang 2016 wang et al 2016c li et al 2016a b sun et al 2019 in recent years two three component mixing models have been applied widely for calculations the contributions of locally recycled moisture in china such as for the taiwan island region peng et al 2012 tibetan plateau ma et al 2013 yang and yao 2016 sun et al 2019 qilian mountains li et al 2016a b and the tianshan mountains kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016c the d excess value defined as δ2h 8 δ18o in precipitation is considered to be another useful tracer parameter in studies of regional and global hydrological processes and it is sensitive to several regional meteorological parameters including the relative humidity sea surface air temperature and sub cloud evaporation in recent years an increasing number of studies kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016a b li et al 2016a b sun et al 2019 have focused on quantitative estimations of d excess variations from clouds to the ground surface in order to assess the isotopic fractionation caused by the sub cloud evaporation and the isotopic exchange of rainfall during various conditions in 1975 stewart 1975 established the falling water drop model simple one box stewart model based on the estimation of d excess variation and this model has been used widely to evaluate the variation of precipitation isotopes caused by sub cloud evaporation froehlich et al 2008 kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016b previous studies have indicated that there is an increasing trend of d excess in precipitation from the ground to cloud base in the european alps stewart 1975 and a similar linear relationship between the evaporation fraction and d excess variation was reported in the tianshan mountains and qilian mountains kong et al 2013 li et al 2016a b wang et al 2016a b however this linear correlation between the d excess and sub evaporation fraction usually presents spatial variation due to the changes in the geographical environment therefore observing and measuring the values of δ2h δ18o and d excess in modern precipitation have become powerful and valuable tools for systematic analyses on regional hydrological processes and investigations of past climate and environmental change with the gradual establishment of observation networks in china the observation data have improved our understanding of the regional precipitation processes and have provided some helpful information for a great number of precipitation isotope studies tian et al 2007 2008 yu et al 2015 2016 zhang and wang 2016 however the variations in the isotopic composition of falling raindrops in unsaturated air are still unclear for semi arid regions in the chinese loess plateau and thus quantitative assessment based on precipitation event observations are still needed for regional hydrological studies the eastern chinese loess plateau eclp is located in the transition zone between semi arid region and the semi humid region of china where there are complex climatic conditions and high potential evaporation fig 1 this region is located on the western edge of the asian summer monsoon and the precipitation tends to decrease gradually from southeast to northwest limited isotopic studies of atmospheric precipitation have been performed in the chinese loess plateau clp which have focused mainly on the wei river basin tian and duan 2007 wang et al 2013 huang et al 2015 and the laohequ basin in the southern region tan et al 2016 hao et al 2018 however the characteristics of spatial temporal distributions of precipitation isotopes are not clear especially in the fenhe river basin few researchers have focused on the relationship between the isotopic composition of precipitation and variation controlling factors in semi arid regions of the eastern loess plateau these relatively sparse δ2h and δ18o data in precipitation records have limited our understanding of precipitation processes in this region therefore in this study four observation stations for precipitation isotope covering typical landscapes including mountains loess hilly and gully regions and river channels were established and a total of 487 samples of individual precipitation events were analysed during 2016 2017 in the eastern loess plateau the aims of this paper were as follows 1 to present numerous new data on precipitation isotopes and explore the seasonal and spatial variability of the isotopic composition of precipitation in the fenhe river basin 2 to investigate the meteorological and geographical controls on the regional isotopic composition of precipitation in the eastern chinese loess plateau and 3 to evaluate the influence of sub cloud evaporation and recycled moisture in precipitation and its meteorological controls this is a preliminary study about the eastern loess plateau and its results will give us new horizons for understanding the hydrological processes in typical river basins from semi arid area of the chinese loess plateau 2 study area all samples were collected from the fenhe river basin 110 5 113 5 e 35 3 39 0 n which lies in the shanxi province eastern loess plateau as an important tributary of the yellow river the fenhe river originated from the guancen mountain in the northeast of shanxi province and joined the yellow river in the southwest of shanxi province fig 1 the fenhe river basin has three types of watershed landforms including rocky mountainous area gully region loess hilly and river channel area the study area belongs to mid latitude continental monsoon climate and the climate can be characterized by four distinctive seasons short days and little rain in spring high temperature and more rainstorm in summer warm and little rain in autumn and cold and dry in winter liang et al 2010 wang et al 2018 the average annual air temperature of fenhe river basin ranged from 4 c to 13 c from the northern part to southern part the average annual precipitation amount of fenhe river basin during 1960 2017 is 505 mm and the distribution of precipitation shows an increasing trend from the northwest to the southeast more than 70 of the precipitation is concentrated in the period of june to september four representative rainfall observation stations are established in the fenhe river basin including the lancun station located at the northern mountainous region the yitang station valley basin in the middle reaches the zhaocheng station hilly region in the middle reaches and the linfen station valley in the downstream the location and long term meteorological parameters are shown in the table 1 3 data and methods 3 1 precipitation sampling and data collection a total of 487 individual events samples were collected from the four stations lancun yitang zhaocheng and linfen during 2016 2017 table 1 the snow rainfall samples were collected by the standard chinese precipitation gauges funnel diameter 20 cm sun et al 2019 pre cleaned polyethylene sample bottles were used to store rainfall samples and parafilm was used to prevent evaporation air temperature and relative humidity during precipitation events were observed hourly using automatic weather stations solid samples snow or hail were melted at immediately stored in 4 c in the refrigerator in zip lock ldpe bags before being sealed in bottles before the samples were analyzed all samples should be filtrated the liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research inc with measurement precision is 0 01 and 0 2 for δ18o and δ2h respectively were used measure the δ18o and δ2h values for the precipitation samples at the shanxi normal university the analyzed aliquot volume of measured samples is 1 5 ml each sample was measured six times and the first two values were discarded in order to avoid the memory effect associated with continuous flow methods the measured results were expressed as δ values relative to v smow vienna standard mean ocean water 3 2 the effect of sub cloud evaporation and recycling of continental moisture 3 2 1 calculation of the effect of sub cloud evaporation the sub cloud evaporation of precipitation was investigated by using the model of froehlich et al 2008 which is fully documented by kong et al 2013 and wang et al 2016b in this model we assumed that the sub cloud precipitation and surrounding ambient water vapor are in isotopic equilibrium d excess in collected precipitation variation from that below the cloud base to the near ground determined as the expression 1 δ d d d cloud 1 f 8 18 f where d is d

precipitation δ18o values ranged from 23 09 to 5 23 and the precipitation δ2h values varied from 181 9 to 27 6 d excess fluctuated from 43 6 to 25 7 with a mean value of 6 7 fig 2 the precipitation δ18o values fell within the ranges reported previously for china hao et al 2018 however the range of our data was larger than that of previously reported precipitation δ18o values for the clp which were 19 62 to 5 80 chen et al 2016 hao et al 2018 the larger range of precipitation isotopes indicates that the precipitation processes of the eclp are more complex comparing the two study years the average δ18o δ2h and d excess of all precipitation samples in 2016 were 6 89 49 0 and 6 1 respectively while in 2017 the average δ18o δ2h and d excess of all precipitation samples were 6 90 48 3 and 7 0 respectively obvious seasonal variation was observed in the precipitation δ18o results from 2016 there was a significant increasing trend that appeared in the period of may 2016 to mid july 2016 and then a decreasing trend was observed until september 2016 as for 2017 the precipitation δ18o showed a fluctuating variation trend which corresponding to an obvious sine curve model fig 2 similar fluctuating variation of precipitation δ18o was also reported in the southern clp in the fenhe river basin precipitation d excess tended to show a fluctuating variation trend similar d excess seasonal variation also appeared in the wushaoling mountains li et al 2016b and laohequ basin hao et a 2018 northwest china in the eclp relatively higher d excess values usually appeared in july and mid september with lower δ18o values the advance and retreat of the asian summer monsoon is considered to be a vital controlling factor tian et al 2007 cai et al 2017 hao et al 2018 in july the moisture from the asian summer monsoon with higher d excess and lower δ18o arrives in the loess plateau including at the fenhe river basin and then moves northward this isotope variability caused by the advance and retreat of the asian summer monsoon was most visible at the zhaocheng station fig 2c 4 1 2 spatial isotope variability for the annual precipitation δ18o the maximum 5 23 value was measured on samples collected from the lancun station on june 13 2016 and the minimum 23 10 value appeared at the yitang station on january 5 2018 fig 3 the spatial variation of precipitation isotopes in summer was more significant than that in winter during warmer months april to october the maximum precipitation δ18o value 5 23 was observed at the lancun station on june 13 2016 and the minimum δ18o value sample was collected from the yitang station 19 30 on july 21 2016 during colder months november to march the maximum precipitation δ18o value 3 08 appeared at the yitang station february 21 2017 the precipitation sample from the yitang station in january had the minimum δ18o value of 23 09 the δ2h values of precipitation samples showed similar trends for the monthly annual mean d excess the maximum monthly mean d excess 47 40 was observed in august at the lancun station and the minimum monthly mean 6 38 was observed at the linfen station the average values of d excess at the lancun yitang zhaocheng and linfen stations were 13 06 9 94 8 76 and 7 23 respectively the d excess values showed an increasing trend from the lancun station to the linfen station 4 2 the local meteoric water line lmwl base on all the precipitation samples in this study a local meteoric water line lmwl was established as follows δ2h 7 12δ18o 0 71 r2 0 95 p 0 01 n 487 by using the monthly weighted values of all precipitation samples the lmwl fig 3d was as follows δ2h 7 7δ18o 7 0 r2 0 94 p 0 01 n 82 the lmwl of solid samples not affected by evaporation was as follows δ2h 8 0δ18o 12 1 r2 0 96 p 0 01 n 51 as shown in fig 3 the slope of the lmwl for all solid samples was similar to the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and higher than that of the lmwl of all liquid samples the lower lmwl slope for all liquid samples mainly was associated with the non equilibrium conditions affecting falling raindrops during semi arid conditions thus leading to the potential for significant sub cloud evaporation wang et al 2016a in comparisons of the lmwls of the two years the slope 7 2 of the lmwl for 2017 was larger than the slope 7 0 of the lmwl for 2016 by using the event based values the lmwls for the lancun yitang zhaocheng and linfen stations were fitted for the lmwls of all stations the slope ranged from 7 0 to 7 4 and the intercept varied between 1 4 and 3 3 table s1 the slope of lmwls for the study area displayed a decreasing trend from northwestern to southeastern areas except for the lancun station however there was no significant relationship observed between the landform types mountains hills and valleys and the slope of lmwls for this region both the slope and intercept of lmwls for the whole area and four stations were smaller than that of the gmwl and the regional meteoric water line for china zhang and wang 2016 which indicates that precipitation in this region is affected by the sub cloud evaporation under the warm and dry conditions 4 3 preliminary analysis on the effects of meteorological parameters and geographical parameters on stable isotopes 4 3 1 the relationship between meteorological parameters and the isotopic composition of precipitation the seasonal and spatial variation of the isotopic composition of precipitation usually is related to local meteorological parameters including the temperature precipitation amount vapour pressure relative humidity and altitude and distance to the moisture sources wang et al 2016a b zhang and wang 2016 sun et al 2019 the correlation coefficients between local meteorological factors and δ18o values were estimated and are shown in table 2 significant δ18o t correlation coefficients were only observed in the spring precipitation at the yitang station the autumn precipitation at the zhaocheng station and the winter precipitation at the linfen station the negative correlations between δ18o and precipitation amounts were statistically significant at the 0 05 level for the winter precipitation at the zhangcheng and linfen stations however significant negative correlations between δ18o and vapour pressure only appeared in winter precipitation at the linfen station and the correlations for most stations were not obvious meanwhile δ18o rh relative humidity correlations were not significantly negative for most stations in summary the isotopic composition of winter precipitation at the linfen station was more significantly influenced by the major meteorological factors than that at the other stations in the northwest china a strong temperature effect has usually has been found in the precipitation δ18o zhang and wang 2016 while along the easterncoastofchina the precipitation δ18o shows a significant correlation with the precipitation amount cai et al 2017 however the fenhe river basin is positioned on the transitional zone for the arid semi arid and monsoon region to the non monsoon region in which the seasonal variation in the isotopic composition of precipitaiton is controlled by the combined effects of the temperature precipitation amount and geographical parameters hao et al 2018 we think this is the mainly reason why there is no obvious temperature effect and precipitation amount effect for all precipitation isotope data in the eclp the relationships between the temperature versus δ18o and d excess for precipitation samples were used to describe the precipitation processes although three different precipitation processes adiabatic cooling moisture recycling and sub cloud evaporation have been previously reported in arid and semi arid regions of china pang et al 2011 sun et al 2016a li et al 2016a b these observations typically were collected in the high mountains i e the tianshan mountains qilian mountains and wushaoling mountains presently in the chinese loess plateau it is not clear whether these three different precipitation processes exist in the study region 4 3 2 the relationship between geographical parameters and the isotopic composition of precipitation topographic factors including altitude latitude and longitude are considered to be significantly related to the spatial distribution of the isotopic composition of precipitation in order to assess the relationship between the geographical parameters and isotopic composition of precipitation we fit the relationship between the δ18o and altitude alt in meters and latitude lat in degrees the stepwise regression method has been used widely to define the relationship between precipitation the isotopic composition of precipitation and geographical parameters wang et al 2016a and it can be calculated by a matlab program as follow x altlancun altyitang altzhaocheng altlinfen latlancun latyitang latzhaocheng latlinfen lonlancun

δ18o can be expressed as follows δ18o 0 0005alt 0 62lat 14 78 r2 0 81 p 0 05 n 90 in comparisons of the distributions of the isotopic composition of precipitation for four seasons the results showed that the precipitation isotopes in spring and autumn were affected by the altitude and latitude while the spatial distributions of precipitation isotopes in summer and autumn had no obvious linear relationship with the geographical parameters in spring the regression was δ18o 0 0006alt 1 21lat 38 83 r2 0 78 p 0 05 n 21 and the regression in autumn was δ18o 0 009alt 2 64lat 83 42 r2 0 95 p 0 05 n 30 the altitude effect is generally considered as an important effect that is crucial to both palaeo climatic and palaeo altitude research therefore the δ18o altitude δ2h altitude and d excess altitude gradient were estimated in the fenhe river basin as shown in fig 4 by employing the annual weighted average of δ18o and δ2h values at the lancun yitang zhaocheng and linfen stations negative gradients of 0 2 100 m and 0 4 100 m were obtained respectively fig 4 which were similar to the global values of 0 1 to 0 5 100 m zhang and wang 2016 as shown in fig 4 the lower regression coefficient and larger error bars indicated that the gradient for the δ18o δ2h altitude of the study region was not remarkable however the d excess altitude gradient was significantly different from that of the δ18o δ2h altitude and a positive gradient of 1 1 100 m was obtained by employing an annual weighted average for the d excess values at the four stations this positive d excess altitude gradient indicates that precipitation at higher altitude sites is less influenced by sub cloud evaporation however because of the limited altitude range and the spread of data at each station fig 4 further studies are needed to confirm the main driver for this regional precipitation isotopic variation in precipitation i e to determine whether it is mainly due to the effect of the altitude gradient or the influence of atmospheric circulation 4 4 preliminary analysis on the influence of sub cloud evaporation on the stable isotope composition of precipitation 4 4 1 variation of δ18o and d excess in precipitation from the ground to cloud base due to the fact that precipitation samples with temperatures below 0 c are solid its evaporation can be considered to be negligible for these samples table 3 shows the monthly average values of δ18o and d excess at the ground and cloud base range during march to october the average monthly temperature was above 0 c for each station in the fenhe river basin on an annual basis the δ18o values of precipitation in the cloud base were 7 60 7 31 7 47 and 7 89 in the lancun yitang zhaocheng and linfen station based on the expression 2 and the corresponding values in the ground precipitation were 6 42 5 86 6 07 and 5 73 respectively for the monthly mean d excess variation from the cloud base to ground level d dground dcloud base the mean d value of all stations was 12 0 for the lancun station the δ18o variation from ground to cloud base δ18o δ18oground δ18ocloud base was 1 7 0 8 2 2 0 9 1 1 1 5 and 0 4 in april may june july august september and october respectively and the corresponding d values ranged from 17 3 may to 3 3 october at the yitang station the δ18o values of precipitation varied from 0 75 october to 3 08 may and the corresponding d values ranged from 24 35 may to 5 57 october at the zhaocheng station the δ18o values of precipitation varies from 0 53 october to 2 19 september and the corresponding d valued ranged from 16 6 september to 3 9 october for the linfen station the δ18o values of precipitation varied from 0 43 october to 4 45 april and the corresponding d values ranged from 33 8 april to 3 2 october generally the d during spring was larger than that during summer and autumn and the d of the linfen station was greater than that of the other stations in comparisons with the measured δ18o and d excess in precipitation the results showed that estimated δ18o values at the cloud base had larger spatial variability than that at the ground level meanwhile the d excess values at the cloud base showed smaller spatial variability than that at the ground level this indicates that these four stations may have similar moisture sources at the cloud base and the spatial pattern of d excess is greatly influenced by sub cloud evaporation 4 4 2 characteristics of sub cloud evaporation fig 5 shows the remaining fraction of raindrop mass variation depending on season at the four stations as a whole the sub cloud evaporation has enriched the δ18o composition by 17 4 12 3 15 8 9 7 8 2 11 0 17 8 and 4 3 in march april may june july august september and october respectively over the whole fenhe river basin with a mean of 12 1 4 7 table 4 as for the lancun station the sub cloud evaporation has enriched the isotopic composition of precipitation by about 8 9 4 2 due to the influence of sub cloud evaporation the precipitation δ18o at the yitang station increased by about 11 8 7 6 at the zhaocheng station the remaining fraction f of raindrop mass has accounted for about 88 45 4 83 in precipitation the sub cloud evaporation rate 1 f has accounted for 15 3 8 9 in precipitation at the linfen station generally significant seasonal variation of the remaining fraction f of raindrop mass was seen at the linfen station and the seasonal fluctuation of the f in 2017 was significantly greater than that in 2016 according to the fig 5 the remaining fraction at the lancun station was much lower than that of the other stations while the f of the linfen station was significantly larger than that of the other stations there was an increasing trend for the influence of sub cloud evaporation from the northern to southern parts of the fenhe river basin the values of f in october were generally larger than 95 and those in may and september were less than 90 in comparisons with different seasons the values of f in the spring months march to may were significantly larger than those in the summer months fig 5 the values of f showed a decreasing trend from summer to early autumn in the spring and autumn months under relative higher air temperature and lower relative humidity the f values were relatively lower at some stations especially at the linfen station 4 5 influence of the recycling fraction on the stable isotope composition of precipitation in order to estimate the influence of recycled moisture on the precipitation of the eclp the monthly average recycling fractions of the four stations were calculated during march to october when the average monthly temperature was above 0 c assuming simple mixing between advected and recycled moisture the moisture recycling rate of precipitation was 28 1 14 8 23 6 14 2 31 2 14 1 and 31 3 14 0 in the lancun yitang zhaocheng and linfen stations on an annual basis the precipitation amount weighted mean moisture recycling fraction for precipitation in 2016 and precipitation in 2017 accounted for 26 9 15 7 and 30 5 12 5 respectively for the seasonal variation the contribution of moisture recycling exhibited an increasing trend from may to july and then decreasing trend until september which indicated that the recycled moisture had a strong influence on the summer precipitation in the eclp especially in july fig 6 which is consistent with the reports for arid inland areas in northwest china sun et al 2019 the contribution of the moisture recycling fraction shows a larger spatial variation in spring at most stations the contribution of recycled moisture for precipitation in 2017 was higher than that for precipitation in 2016 except for the lancun station the contribution of moisture recycling for regional precipitation showed an increasing trend from the yitang station to the linfen station 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of lmwls in different regions of china the slope and intercept of lmwls usually reflects the variation of many geographic and meteorological factors comparisons of the lmwls for regional precipitation can be used to study precipitation processes and illustrate the degree of sub cloud evaporation as well as to identify the contribution of different moisture sources to regional precipitation in this study we calculated the local meteoric water line lmwl in six natural areas with different climate backgrounds including the northwest arid region nw the north of southeast monsoon region nsem the south of southeast monsoon region ssem the southwest monsoon region swm zhou and li 2018 the southern chinese loess plateau sclp and the eastern chinese loess plateau eclp in order to compare the differences in precipitation processes in different regions in regard to the lmwl equations fig 7 we can see that the slope and intercept for all samples were greater than those for rainfall samples and smaller than those for snow samples the slopes of lmwls based on all samples snow samples and rainy samples for the ssem were higher than those in other regions which indicates the climate background and moisture sources in the ssem are obviously different from those in other regions as shown in fig 7 the slopes of lmwls for rainfall samples and all samples in the nw nsew sclp and eclp are lower than the gmwl 8 thus indicating that there is a greater dominance of sub cloud evaporation in these regions in contrast the higher lmwl slope of the ssem and swm reflects the contribution of re evaporation from local land and open water in summer wang et al 2016c the slope of the eclp 7 12 was similar to that of the sclp 7 08 and the nsem 7 13 which indicated that the moisture source of the eclp is also close to that of the sclp continental mass dominated hao et al 2018 and nsem monsoon dominated zhu et al 2016 and it is affected by both the monsoon and the continental air masses 5 2 stable isotopic signatures of precipitation in different gradients of temperature and precipitation amounts the eclp is located in the transition zone between the monsoon dominated and continental mass dominated regions complex precipitation processes are associated with various environmental factors previous studies hao et al 2018 have found that stable isotopic signatures of precipitation display variability along gradients of different temperatures or precipitation amounts in order to further systematically analyse the isotopic variation in precipitation in the eclp we divide the data into four temperature groups t 0 c 0 c t 10 c 10 c t 20 c t 20 c and four precipitation groups 0 mm p 5 mm 5 mm p 10 mm 10 mm p 20 mm p 20 mm according to the previous reports hao et al 2018 table s2 presents some parameters for all of the observed samples under different temperature precipitation amount gradients at the four stations the growing set of data for the eclp were calculated as 78 4 t 0 c 50 8 0 c t 10 c 45 8 10 c t 20 c and 45 3 t 20 c in average δ2h and as 11 41 t 0 c 7 43 0 c t 10 c 6 64 10 c t 20 c and 6 17 t 20 c in terms of the average δ18o however the average d excess values showed an opposite trend to the average δ18o as the precipitation gradients increased a decreasing trend in the average δ2h and δ18o was observed the slope and intercept of the local meteoric water line did not present a precise correlation with the temperature precipitation gradient which is inconsistent with the reports in the southern chinese loess plateau relatively larger slopes of lmwls above 8 were observed at the lancun station and linfen station when the temperature ranged from 0 to 10 c which indicates that precipitation with these temperature gradients was strongly affected by the recycled moisture for 10 20 mm the relatively larger slope of the lmwl indicated that precipitation collected from the zhaocheng station and linfen station in this precipitation gradient also was strongly influenced by the moisture recycling in the clp the variability of δ2h and δ18o in precipitation was generated by a combination of factors including the temperature and precipitation amount previous studies have pointed out that the precipitation amount effect and the temperature effect are not very significant for all dates in the sclp hao et al 2018 which is similar to our results for the eclp in this study a positive correlation between δ18o and temperature only was seen in the precipitation samples from the linfen station at below a temperature of 10 c a significant precipitation amount effect was observed in the precipitation samples from the zhaocheng station above 5 mm and the linfen station 10 mm 20 mm the southeastern summer monsoon has been proven to have strong influences on precipitation processes in eastern and central china summer monsoons usually result in continuous precipitation and the vapor becomes progressively depleted in 2h and 18o summer monsoons precipitation shows a statistically negative correlation between the precipitation amount and δ18o in china peng et al 2012 li et al 2016a b c although there was no significant precipitation amount effect for all precipitation events at the four stations during the study period in the eclp some continuous summer precipitation δ18o showed a negative correlation with the precipitation amount in july and september 2016 and july and late august 2017 fig 2 for example a continuous heavy precipitation event occurred in the period during july 3 15 and the δ18o decreased from 4 4 to 16 and the corresponding precipitation increased from 19 mm to 25 mm for the lancun station concurrently at the yitang station the δ18o decreased from 1 35 to 13 15 and the corresponding precipitation increased from 17 mm to 26 mm this was also observed at the zhaocheng station and the linfen station however a similar phenomenon also has been observed at the synoptic scale in the sclp hao et al 2018 the middle qilian mountains li et al 2016b 5 3 meteorological controls on the d f relationship previous studies froehlich et al 2008 kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016b crawford et al 2017 have mentioned that there is an obvious linear relationship between the d and remaining fraction with a slope d f of approximately 1 1 per 1 or 1 2 per 1 under a condition of high f usually 95 which indicates that a 1 increase of evaporation may cause the d excess to decrease by approximately 1 1 1 2 fig 8 shows the correlations between the two parameters which were computed in order to determine whether such a linear relationship exists in the study area however the slope d f of approximately 0 92 per 1 in the fenhe river basin was smaller than that of the average value in the previous studies including in the tianshan moutains and qilian mountains as fig 8 shows a clear relationship between remaining fraction and d always could be observed in the fenhe river basin in an arid and semi arid climate some researches has proven that the remaining fraction of raindrop mass for small raindrops may be much less than 95 and even may disappear salamalikis et al 2016 wang et al 2016b in this study the linear relationship approximately 1 also can be seen from the inset in fig 8 with the decrease in the remaining fraction the relationship between f and d gradually become weaker when the f was less than 60 the scattering around the regression line become stronger the relationship between the d and remaining fraction is considered to be correlated with meteorological conditions such as the surface air temperature precipitation amount and relative humidity as previous studies have shown wang et al 2016b salamalikis et al 2016 the remaining fraction of rainfall is always larger under low air temperatures larger precipitation amount and higher relative humidity under such meteorological conditions the d is close to 0 and a linear correlation with a slightly lower slope between d and f can be observed in contrast relatively smaller f values and larger variations of d will appear in an arid environments with high air temperatures small precipitation amounts and low relative humidities under these conditions the relationship between the f and d may not be linear the variation of d versus f in precipitation at the micro and synoptic scale is useful for tracing local hydrological processes wang et al 2016b when the air temperature is below 0 c the sub cloud evaporation through the air is generally ignored so we divided the data into three groups t 10 c 10 c t 20 c and t 20 c according the temperature gradient in this study a set of data consisting of intercept was mentioned as 0 88 1 00 and 0 86 for the slopes of d f and as 89 2 99 80 and 86 66 for the intercepts was compiled along the temperature gradient of t 10 c 10 c t 20 c and t 20 c respectively fig 9 however there was a significant linear d f relationship in the temperature gradient of 10 c t 20 c according to the different relative humidity and precipitation rates three data groups also could be divided as shown in fig 9 the slopes in cross plotting of d f records were 0 99 0 72 and 0 69 thus displaying a decreasing trend in the relatively humidity range of rh 70 70 rh 90 and rh 90 respectively the relationship between f and d was relatively stronger in the relatively humidity gradient of rh 70 with the decrease in the precipitation amount the relationship between f and d gradually became weaker when the precipitation amount was less than 5 mm the scattering around the regression line became stronger 5 4 comparing the influence of recycled moisture on precipitation between the eclp and other regions as an important process in energy balances and ecosystem water budgets evapotranspiration including vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation is closely linked to ecosystem productivity and controlled by different biotic and physical processes li et al 2016a b the recycled moisture from evapotranspiration has been proven to have strong influences on continental precipitation of in china zhang and wang 2016 li et al 2016a b sun et al 2019 in the taiwan island region nearly 43 of the water went directly back into the atmosphere from the land and vegetation in the form of evapotranspiration in summer peng et al 2012 ma et al 2013 founded that the transpiration and evaporation fraction accounted for 4 in southeast china relatively higher moisture recycling fraction for local precipitation were observed in the hexi corridor area and the tibetan plateau li et al 2016a b c concluded that the local moisture recycling rate accounted for 27 in the hexi corridor area for the tibetan plateau the contribution of terrestrial moisture to the local precipitation has been estimated to range from 32 to 47 in summer ma et al 2013 besides terrestrial moisture produced by evapotranspiration has been proven to make important contribution to the precipitation in the tianshan mountains kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016c and kunlun mountains in our study the moisture recycling fraction accounted for 28 14 of the local precipitation and the results showed obvious seasonal variation with higher values in summer and lower values in spring these observational findings on the seasonal variation of moisture recycling fractions are also supported by other studies li et al 2016a b in the qilian mountains the local moisture recycling contribution showed an increasing trend from may 12 to july 35 and it decreased obviously until october 11 the growth of plants can be put forth as the main reason for this seasonal change in the moisture recycling contribution with the growth of plants more terrestrial moisture contributed by plant transpiration is transported from the land to the atmosphere which increases the contribution of recycled moisture to local precipitation wang et al 2016c generally speaking meteorological conditions air temperature and relative humidity land use and cover change vegetation open water construction lands and cultivated land and topographic factors are associated with the relative contributions for each moisture component in this study the contribution of recycled moisture for precipitation showed an obvious latitudinal gradient change which was mainly dominated by air temperature the barrier effect of high mountains often changes the moisture recycling rate of local precipitation sun et al 2019 in this study the lancun station mountain station had a relatively higher moisture recycling rate than that of the yitang station lower latitude than at lancun which was mainly dominated by the topographic factors in summary the contribution of recycled moisture to local precipitation in the eclp is close to that in the hexi corridor area effected by the monsoon and continental air mass li et al 2016a b c which indicates that the precipitation in the eclp is a combination of the monsoon and continental air masses 6 conclusions in this study based on precipitation data collected over 2 years during monitoring in the fenhe river basin we analyzed the stable isotope variability and identified the main environmental drivers of rainfall isotopic variation in the eastern chinese loess plateau in order to improve the interpretation of isotopic proxy records in this region the main points are presented as below 1 obvious seasonal variation was observed in the δ18o δ2h and d excess of precipitation in the fenhe river basin the asian monsoon was found to have an important influence on the seasonal variation of precipitation isotopes in the study area the δ18o and d excess values showed increasing trends from the north to the south and the spatial variation of precipitation isotopes in summer was more significant than that in winter 2 the weighted precipitation local meteoric water line lmwl of the fenhe river basin was calculated to be δ2h 7 7δ18o 7 0 in comparisons with the global meteoric water line gmwl the lower slope and intercept values were found to be typical for warm dry sites where sub cloud evaporation of raindrops is experienced 3 there was a significant correlation between the geographical factors including altitude latitude and longitude and spatial distribution of the isotopic composition of precipitation and the best fit equation between geographical factors and δ18o was δ18o 0 0005alt 0 62lat 14 78 in the eclp there were no significant correlations detected between precipitation δ18o and meteorological parameters for all precipitation events at the four stations during the study period stable isotopic signatures of precipitation displayed variability along the different temperature or precipitation amount gradients some continuous summer precipitation δ18o showed negative correlations with the precipitation amount in july and september 2016 and july and late august 2017 4 the stable isotopic components in precipitation were obviously controlled by the sub cloud evaporation and moisture recycling the sub cloud evaporation increased the δ values by about 12 0 4 7 in the precipitation within the eclp during march october the moisture recycling fraction accounted for 28 14 of the local precipitation which showed obvious seasonal variation with higher values in summer and lower values in spring significant seasonal variation in the remaining fraction f of the raindrop mass was observed at the linfen station and the seasonal fluctuation of the f in 2017 was more significant than that in 2016 the remaining fraction of rainfall was always larger under lower air temperatures larger precipitation amounts and higher relative humidity the relationship between f and d was relatively stronger in the temperature range of 10 c t 20 c and at relatively humidity values less than 70 and precipitation amounts larger than 10 mm we acknowledge that this study is preliminary and not comprehensive because of the limited observation data from

5879,based on 487 event based precipitation samples collected at 4 stations in the fenhe river basin on the eastern chinese loess plateau eclp during 2016 2017 we analyzed the influences of meteorological parameters geographical parameters sub cloud evaporation and recycled moisture on precipitation and its isotopic compositions a strong seasonal variation was observed in δ18o δ2h d excess of precipitation although there are no obviously correlations between precipitation δ18o and meteorological parameters for all precipitation data in the eclp stable isotopic signature on precipitation displayed variability in different temperature or precipitation amount gradient the local meteoric water line was calculated to be δ2h 7 7δ18o 7 0 indicating raindrops have undergone partial evaporation the sub cloud evaporation and the recycled moisture from evapotranspiration have been proven to have strong influence on the isotopic composition precipitation of eclp results show that 12 1 4 7 of precipitation are evaporated before reaching the ground in the eclp during march october the moisture recycling fraction accounted for 28 14 to local precipitation the significant seasonal variation of the remaining fraction f of raindrop mass can be seen in the linfen station and the more significantly seasonal fluctuation of the f can be observed in 2017 the remaining fraction of rainfall is always larger under a lower air temperature larger precipitation amount and higher relative humidity this study will improve the understanding of regional water cycling and have implications for water resource management during water shortages keywords stable isotope precipitation sub cloud evaporation recycled moisture eastern chinese loess plateau 1 introduction as the initial source of terrestrial water atmospheric precipitation is an important part of the natural water cycle the variations in precipitation can directly affect the total amount of regional water resources and play a vital role in industrial and irrigation water management regionally especially in arid and semi arid areas the isotopic composition of precipitation usually contains important information on the regional water cycle and environment and the δ2h δ18o and d excess δ2h 8 δ18o in precipitation have been widely used for hydrological and climatic research projects since the earliest studies in the 1960 s craig 1961 dansgaard 1964 dansgaard et al 1993 based on the isotopic composition of precipitation researchers can a clarify the mechanisms controlling precipitation processes pang et al 2011 kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016a b zwart et al 2016 wang et al 2017 b estimate regional sub cloud evaporation processes wang et al 2016b li et al 2016a c and c trace and determine moisture sources kurita et al 2015 li et al 2016a wang et al 2016c thereby providing scientific evidence for the interactions among precipitation ground water and surface water kong and pang 2012 li et al 2016b tan et al 2016 sun et al 2016a b c d 2017 2018 the values of δ2h and δ18o in precipitation decrease or increase spatially or temporally depending on conditions such as the vapour source topographic factors moisture recycling processes precipitation amounts and air temperatures stumpp et al 2014 sun et al 2017 2018 li et al 2016a b wang et al 2017 these relationships between the environmental controlling factors and precipitation isotopes known as environmental effects can be well observed by measuring the isotopic compositions of both global precipitation johnsen et al 1972 lorius et al 1985 dansgaard et al 1993 and regional precipitation thompson et al 2013 kreutz 2003 according to previous studies dansgaard 1964 pang et al 2011 li et al 2016a precipitation δ18o usually shows a strong positive correlation with temperature t and a negative relationship with precipitation amount p in china the δ18o t and δ18o p relationships tend to show significant spatial variability a significant δ18o t relationship was observed in high mountainous areas sun et al 2019 and arid inland areas kong et al 2013 moreover the δ18o p relationship in the monsoon region has been found to be significantly stronger than that in the inland region zhang and wang 2016 cai et al 2017 in the arid inland areas of northwest china a large number of precipitation δ2h and δ18o observations have been obtained in the tianshan mountains kreutz 2003 sun et al 2016b wang et al 2016a b c 2017 tarim river basin sun et al 2016a c d 2018 kunlun mountains sun et al 2017 qilian mountains li et al 2016b and wushaoling mountains li et al 2016a and these data have been proven to be associated with vapour source conditions and air temperatures at the observation stations geographical latitude and elevation controlling factors are also important factors that can influence precipitation δ18o based on the chnip chinese network of isotopes in precipitation database the regression model δ18o 0 041longitude 0 312latitude 0 002altitude m 8 892 was reported by liu et al 2014 for china and the gradient between precipitation δ18o and latitude was demonstrated to be in the range of 0 24 to 0 22 a significant linear gradient between precipitation and altitude was also reported 0 13 100 m in china liu et al 2014 the sub cloud evaporation process is though to have a strong influence on the stable isotope composition of precipitation during dry and warm conditions salamalikis et al 2016 when raindrops pass through unsaturated air sub cloud evaporation usually leads to enrichment of stable isotopes in falling raindrops especially in arid and semi arid areas pang et al 2011 li et al 2016a during this process the light isotopes 1h and 16o in raindrops are preferentially evaporated while the heavy isotopes 2h and 18o are gradually enriched and the diffusion processes during evaporation can result in a decreasing trend of d excess dansgaard 1964 in rainfall wang et al 2017 in addition to the above controlling factors the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of regional precipitation usually can be modified by the terrestrial recycled moisture the recycled moisture contributed by evapotranspiration including water vapour originating from evaporation and transpiration off the land surface usually plays a very important role in the water cycle especially in continental precipitation zhang and wang 2016 wang et al 2016c li et al 2016a b sun et al 2019 in recent years two three component mixing models have been applied widely for calculations the contributions of locally recycled moisture in china such as for the taiwan island region peng et al 2012 tibetan plateau ma et al 2013 yang and yao 2016 sun et al 2019 qilian mountains li et al 2016a b and the tianshan mountains kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016c the d excess value defined as δ2h 8 δ18o in precipitation is considered to be another useful tracer parameter in studies of regional and global hydrological processes and it is sensitive to several regional meteorological parameters including the relative humidity sea surface air temperature and sub cloud evaporation in recent years an increasing number of studies kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016a b li et al 2016a b sun et al 2019 have focused on quantitative estimations of d excess variations from clouds to the ground surface in order to assess the isotopic fractionation caused by the sub cloud evaporation and the isotopic exchange of rainfall during various conditions in 1975 stewart 1975 established the falling water drop model simple one box stewart model based on the estimation of d excess variation and this model has been used widely to evaluate the variation of precipitation isotopes caused by sub cloud evaporation froehlich et al 2008 kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016b previous studies have indicated that there is an increasing trend of d excess in precipitation from the ground to cloud base in the european alps stewart 1975 and a similar linear relationship between the evaporation fraction and d excess variation was reported in the tianshan mountains and qilian mountains kong et al 2013 li et al 2016a b wang et al 2016a b however this linear correlation between the d excess and sub evaporation fraction usually presents spatial variation due to the changes in the geographical environment therefore observing and measuring the values of δ2h δ18o and d excess in modern precipitation have become powerful and valuable tools for systematic analyses on regional hydrological processes and investigations of past climate and environmental change with the gradual establishment of observation networks in china the observation data have improved our understanding of the regional precipitation processes and have provided some helpful information for a great number of precipitation isotope studies tian et al 2007 2008 yu et al 2015 2016 zhang and wang 2016 however the variations in the isotopic composition of falling raindrops in unsaturated air are still unclear for semi arid regions in the chinese loess plateau and thus quantitative assessment based on precipitation event observations are still needed for regional hydrological studies the eastern chinese loess plateau eclp is located in the transition zone between semi arid region and the semi humid region of china where there are complex climatic conditions and high potential evaporation fig 1 this region is located on the western edge of the asian summer monsoon and the precipitation tends to decrease gradually from southeast to northwest limited isotopic studies of atmospheric precipitation have been performed in the chinese loess plateau clp which have focused mainly on the wei river basin tian and duan 2007 wang et al 2013 huang et al 2015 and the laohequ basin in the southern region tan et al 2016 hao et al 2018 however the characteristics of spatial temporal distributions of precipitation isotopes are not clear especially in the fenhe river basin few researchers have focused on the relationship between the isotopic composition of precipitation and variation controlling factors in semi arid regions of the eastern loess plateau these relatively sparse δ2h and δ18o data in precipitation records have limited our understanding of precipitation processes in this region therefore in this study four observation stations for precipitation isotope covering typical landscapes including mountains loess hilly and gully regions and river channels were established and a total of 487 samples of individual precipitation events were analysed during 2016 2017 in the eastern loess plateau the aims of this paper were as follows 1 to present numerous new data on precipitation isotopes and explore the seasonal and spatial variability of the isotopic composition of precipitation in the fenhe river basin 2 to investigate the meteorological and geographical controls on the regional isotopic composition of precipitation in the eastern chinese loess plateau and 3 to evaluate the influence of sub cloud evaporation and recycled moisture in precipitation and its meteorological controls this is a preliminary study about the eastern loess plateau and its results will give us new horizons for understanding the hydrological processes in typical river basins from semi arid area of the chinese loess plateau 2 study area all samples were collected from the fenhe river basin 110 5 113 5 e 35 3 39 0 n which lies in the shanxi province eastern loess plateau as an important tributary of the yellow river the fenhe river originated from the guancen mountain in the northeast of shanxi province and joined the yellow river in the southwest of shanxi province fig 1 the fenhe river basin has three types of watershed landforms including rocky mountainous area gully region loess hilly and river channel area the study area belongs to mid latitude continental monsoon climate and the climate can be characterized by four distinctive seasons short days and little rain in spring high temperature and more rainstorm in summer warm and little rain in autumn and cold and dry in winter liang et al 2010 wang et al 2018 the average annual air temperature of fenhe river basin ranged from 4 c to 13 c from the northern part to southern part the average annual precipitation amount of fenhe river basin during 1960 2017 is 505 mm and the distribution of precipitation shows an increasing trend from the northwest to the southeast more than 70 of the precipitation is concentrated in the period of june to september four representative rainfall observation stations are established in the fenhe river basin including the lancun station located at the northern mountainous region the yitang station valley basin in the middle reaches the zhaocheng station hilly region in the middle reaches and the linfen station valley in the downstream the location and long term meteorological parameters are shown in the table 1 3 data and methods 3 1 precipitation sampling and data collection a total of 487 individual events samples were collected from the four stations lancun yitang zhaocheng and linfen during 2016 2017 table 1 the snow rainfall samples were collected by the standard chinese precipitation gauges funnel diameter 20 cm sun et al 2019 pre cleaned polyethylene sample bottles were used to store rainfall samples and parafilm was used to prevent evaporation air temperature and relative humidity during precipitation events were observed hourly using automatic weather stations solid samples snow or hail were melted at immediately stored in 4 c in the refrigerator in zip lock ldpe bags before being sealed in bottles before the samples were analyzed all samples should be filtrated the liquid water isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research inc with measurement precision is 0 01 and 0 2 for δ18o and δ2h respectively were used measure the δ18o and δ2h values for the precipitation samples at the shanxi normal university the analyzed aliquot volume of measured samples is 1 5 ml each sample was measured six times and the first two values were discarded in order to avoid the memory effect associated with continuous flow methods the measured results were expressed as δ values relative to v smow vienna standard mean ocean water 3 2 the effect of sub cloud evaporation and recycling of continental moisture 3 2 1 calculation of the effect of sub cloud evaporation the sub cloud evaporation of precipitation was investigated by using the model of froehlich et al 2008 which is fully documented by kong et al 2013 and wang et al 2016b in this model we assumed that the sub cloud precipitation and surrounding ambient water vapor are in isotopic equilibrium d excess in collected precipitation variation from that below the cloud base to the near ground determined as the expression 1 δ d d d cloud 1 f 8 18 f where d is d

precipitation δ18o values ranged from 23 09 to 5 23 and the precipitation δ2h values varied from 181 9 to 27 6 d excess fluctuated from 43 6 to 25 7 with a mean value of 6 7 fig 2 the precipitation δ18o values fell within the ranges reported previously for china hao et al 2018 however the range of our data was larger than that of previously reported precipitation δ18o values for the clp which were 19 62 to 5 80 chen et al 2016 hao et al 2018 the larger range of precipitation isotopes indicates that the precipitation processes of the eclp are more complex comparing the two study years the average δ18o δ2h and d excess of all precipitation samples in 2016 were 6 89 49 0 and 6 1 respectively while in 2017 the average δ18o δ2h and d excess of all precipitation samples were 6 90 48 3 and 7 0 respectively obvious seasonal variation was observed in the precipitation δ18o results from 2016 there was a significant increasing trend that appeared in the period of may 2016 to mid july 2016 and then a decreasing trend was observed until september 2016 as for 2017 the precipitation δ18o showed a fluctuating variation trend which corresponding to an obvious sine curve model fig 2 similar fluctuating variation of precipitation δ18o was also reported in the southern clp in the fenhe river basin precipitation d excess tended to show a fluctuating variation trend similar d excess seasonal variation also appeared in the wushaoling mountains li et al 2016b and laohequ basin hao et a 2018 northwest china in the eclp relatively higher d excess values usually appeared in july and mid september with lower δ18o values the advance and retreat of the asian summer monsoon is considered to be a vital controlling factor tian et al 2007 cai et al 2017 hao et al 2018 in july the moisture from the asian summer monsoon with higher d excess and lower δ18o arrives in the loess plateau including at the fenhe river basin and then moves northward this isotope variability caused by the advance and retreat of the asian summer monsoon was most visible at the zhaocheng station fig 2c 4 1 2 spatial isotope variability for the annual precipitation δ18o the maximum 5 23 value was measured on samples collected from the lancun station on june 13 2016 and the minimum 23 10 value appeared at the yitang station on january 5 2018 fig 3 the spatial variation of precipitation isotopes in summer was more significant than that in winter during warmer months april to october the maximum precipitation δ18o value 5 23 was observed at the lancun station on june 13 2016 and the minimum δ18o value sample was collected from the yitang station 19 30 on july 21 2016 during colder months november to march the maximum precipitation δ18o value 3 08 appeared at the yitang station february 21 2017 the precipitation sample from the yitang station in january had the minimum δ18o value of 23 09 the δ2h values of precipitation samples showed similar trends for the monthly annual mean d excess the maximum monthly mean d excess 47 40 was observed in august at the lancun station and the minimum monthly mean 6 38 was observed at the linfen station the average values of d excess at the lancun yitang zhaocheng and linfen stations were 13 06 9 94 8 76 and 7 23 respectively the d excess values showed an increasing trend from the lancun station to the linfen station 4 2 the local meteoric water line lmwl base on all the precipitation samples in this study a local meteoric water line lmwl was established as follows δ2h 7 12δ18o 0 71 r2 0 95 p 0 01 n 487 by using the monthly weighted values of all precipitation samples the lmwl fig 3d was as follows δ2h 7 7δ18o 7 0 r2 0 94 p 0 01 n 82 the lmwl of solid samples not affected by evaporation was as follows δ2h 8 0δ18o 12 1 r2 0 96 p 0 01 n 51 as shown in fig 3 the slope of the lmwl for all solid samples was similar to the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and higher than that of the lmwl of all liquid samples the lower lmwl slope for all liquid samples mainly was associated with the non equilibrium conditions affecting falling raindrops during semi arid conditions thus leading to the potential for significant sub cloud evaporation wang et al 2016a in comparisons of the lmwls of the two years the slope 7 2 of the lmwl for 2017 was larger than the slope 7 0 of the lmwl for 2016 by using the event based values the lmwls for the lancun yitang zhaocheng and linfen stations were fitted for the lmwls of all stations the slope ranged from 7 0 to 7 4 and the intercept varied between 1 4 and 3 3 table s1 the slope of lmwls for the study area displayed a decreasing trend from northwestern to southeastern areas except for the lancun station however there was no significant relationship observed between the landform types mountains hills and valleys and the slope of lmwls for this region both the slope and intercept of lmwls for the whole area and four stations were smaller than that of the gmwl and the regional meteoric water line for china zhang and wang 2016 which indicates that precipitation in this region is affected by the sub cloud evaporation under the warm and dry conditions 4 3 preliminary analysis on the effects of meteorological parameters and geographical parameters on stable isotopes 4 3 1 the relationship between meteorological parameters and the isotopic composition of precipitation the seasonal and spatial variation of the isotopic composition of precipitation usually is related to local meteorological parameters including the temperature precipitation amount vapour pressure relative humidity and altitude and distance to the moisture sources wang et al 2016a b zhang and wang 2016 sun et al 2019 the correlation coefficients between local meteorological factors and δ18o values were estimated and are shown in table 2 significant δ18o t correlation coefficients were only observed in the spring precipitation at the yitang station the autumn precipitation at the zhaocheng station and the winter precipitation at the linfen station the negative correlations between δ18o and precipitation amounts were statistically significant at the 0 05 level for the winter precipitation at the zhangcheng and linfen stations however significant negative correlations between δ18o and vapour pressure only appeared in winter precipitation at the linfen station and the correlations for most stations were not obvious meanwhile δ18o rh relative humidity correlations were not significantly negative for most stations in summary the isotopic composition of winter precipitation at the linfen station was more significantly influenced by the major meteorological factors than that at the other stations in the northwest china a strong temperature effect has usually has been found in the precipitation δ18o zhang and wang 2016 while along the easterncoastofchina the precipitation δ18o shows a significant correlation with the precipitation amount cai et al 2017 however the fenhe river basin is positioned on the transitional zone for the arid semi arid and monsoon region to the non monsoon region in which the seasonal variation in the isotopic composition of precipitaiton is controlled by the combined effects of the temperature precipitation amount and geographical parameters hao et al 2018 we think this is the mainly reason why there is no obvious temperature effect and precipitation amount effect for all precipitation isotope data in the eclp the relationships between the temperature versus δ18o and d excess for precipitation samples were used to describe the precipitation processes although three different precipitation processes adiabatic cooling moisture recycling and sub cloud evaporation have been previously reported in arid and semi arid regions of china pang et al 2011 sun et al 2016a li et al 2016a b these observations typically were collected in the high mountains i e the tianshan mountains qilian mountains and wushaoling mountains presently in the chinese loess plateau it is not clear whether these three different precipitation processes exist in the study region 4 3 2 the relationship between geographical parameters and the isotopic composition of precipitation topographic factors including altitude latitude and longitude are considered to be significantly related to the spatial distribution of the isotopic composition of precipitation in order to assess the relationship between the geographical parameters and isotopic composition of precipitation we fit the relationship between the δ18o and altitude alt in meters and latitude lat in degrees the stepwise regression method has been used widely to define the relationship between precipitation the isotopic composition of precipitation and geographical parameters wang et al 2016a and it can be calculated by a matlab program as follow x altlancun altyitang altzhaocheng altlinfen latlancun latyitang latzhaocheng latlinfen lonlancun

δ18o can be expressed as follows δ18o 0 0005alt 0 62lat 14 78 r2 0 81 p 0 05 n 90 in comparisons of the distributions of the isotopic composition of precipitation for four seasons the results showed that the precipitation isotopes in spring and autumn were affected by the altitude and latitude while the spatial distributions of precipitation isotopes in summer and autumn had no obvious linear relationship with the geographical parameters in spring the regression was δ18o 0 0006alt 1 21lat 38 83 r2 0 78 p 0 05 n 21 and the regression in autumn was δ18o 0 009alt 2 64lat 83 42 r2 0 95 p 0 05 n 30 the altitude effect is generally considered as an important effect that is crucial to both palaeo climatic and palaeo altitude research therefore the δ18o altitude δ2h altitude and d excess altitude gradient were estimated in the fenhe river basin as shown in fig 4 by employing the annual weighted average of δ18o and δ2h values at the lancun yitang zhaocheng and linfen stations negative gradients of 0 2 100 m and 0 4 100 m were obtained respectively fig 4 which were similar to the global values of 0 1 to 0 5 100 m zhang and wang 2016 as shown in fig 4 the lower regression coefficient and larger error bars indicated that the gradient for the δ18o δ2h altitude of the study region was not remarkable however the d excess altitude gradient was significantly different from that of the δ18o δ2h altitude and a positive gradient of 1 1 100 m was obtained by employing an annual weighted average for the d excess values at the four stations this positive d excess altitude gradient indicates that precipitation at higher altitude sites is less influenced by sub cloud evaporation however because of the limited altitude range and the spread of data at each station fig 4 further studies are needed to confirm the main driver for this regional precipitation isotopic variation in precipitation i e to determine whether it is mainly due to the effect of the altitude gradient or the influence of atmospheric circulation 4 4 preliminary analysis on the influence of sub cloud evaporation on the stable isotope composition of precipitation 4 4 1 variation of δ18o and d excess in precipitation from the ground to cloud base due to the fact that precipitation samples with temperatures below 0 c are solid its evaporation can be considered to be negligible for these samples table 3 shows the monthly average values of δ18o and d excess at the ground and cloud base range during march to october the average monthly temperature was above 0 c for each station in the fenhe river basin on an annual basis the δ18o values of precipitation in the cloud base were 7 60 7 31 7 47 and 7 89 in the lancun yitang zhaocheng and linfen station based on the expression 2 and the corresponding values in the ground precipitation were 6 42 5 86 6 07 and 5 73 respectively for the monthly mean d excess variation from the cloud base to ground level d dground dcloud base the mean d value of all stations was 12 0 for the lancun station the δ18o variation from ground to cloud base δ18o δ18oground δ18ocloud base was 1 7 0 8 2 2 0 9 1 1 1 5 and 0 4 in april may june july august september and october respectively and the corresponding d values ranged from 17 3 may to 3 3 october at the yitang station the δ18o values of precipitation varied from 0 75 october to 3 08 may and the corresponding d values ranged from 24 35 may to 5 57 october at the zhaocheng station the δ18o values of precipitation varies from 0 53 october to 2 19 september and the corresponding d valued ranged from 16 6 september to 3 9 october for the linfen station the δ18o values of precipitation varied from 0 43 october to 4 45 april and the corresponding d values ranged from 33 8 april to 3 2 october generally the d during spring was larger than that during summer and autumn and the d of the linfen station was greater than that of the other stations in comparisons with the measured δ18o and d excess in precipitation the results showed that estimated δ18o values at the cloud base had larger spatial variability than that at the ground level meanwhile the d excess values at the cloud base showed smaller spatial variability than that at the ground level this indicates that these four stations may have similar moisture sources at the cloud base and the spatial pattern of d excess is greatly influenced by sub cloud evaporation 4 4 2 characteristics of sub cloud evaporation fig 5 shows the remaining fraction of raindrop mass variation depending on season at the four stations as a whole the sub cloud evaporation has enriched the δ18o composition by 17 4 12 3 15 8 9 7 8 2 11 0 17 8 and 4 3 in march april may june july august september and october respectively over the whole fenhe river basin with a mean of 12 1 4 7 table 4 as for the lancun station the sub cloud evaporation has enriched the isotopic composition of precipitation by about 8 9 4 2 due to the influence of sub cloud evaporation the precipitation δ18o at the yitang station increased by about 11 8 7 6 at the zhaocheng station the remaining fraction f of raindrop mass has accounted for about 88 45 4 83 in precipitation the sub cloud evaporation rate 1 f has accounted for 15 3 8 9 in precipitation at the linfen station generally significant seasonal variation of the remaining fraction f of raindrop mass was seen at the linfen station and the seasonal fluctuation of the f in 2017 was significantly greater than that in 2016 according to the fig 5 the remaining fraction at the lancun station was much lower than that of the other stations while the f of the linfen station was significantly larger than that of the other stations there was an increasing trend for the influence of sub cloud evaporation from the northern to southern parts of the fenhe river basin the values of f in october were generally larger than 95 and those in may and september were less than 90 in comparisons with different seasons the values of f in the spring months march to may were significantly larger than those in the summer months fig 5 the values of f showed a decreasing trend from summer to early autumn in the spring and autumn months under relative higher air temperature and lower relative humidity the f values were relatively lower at some stations especially at the linfen station 4 5 influence of the recycling fraction on the stable isotope composition of precipitation in order to estimate the influence of recycled moisture on the precipitation of the eclp the monthly average recycling fractions of the four stations were calculated during march to october when the average monthly temperature was above 0 c assuming simple mixing between advected and recycled moisture the moisture recycling rate of precipitation was 28 1 14 8 23 6 14 2 31 2 14 1 and 31 3 14 0 in the lancun yitang zhaocheng and linfen stations on an annual basis the precipitation amount weighted mean moisture recycling fraction for precipitation in 2016 and precipitation in 2017 accounted for 26 9 15 7 and 30 5 12 5 respectively for the seasonal variation the contribution of moisture recycling exhibited an increasing trend from may to july and then decreasing trend until september which indicated that the recycled moisture had a strong influence on the summer precipitation in the eclp especially in july fig 6 which is consistent with the reports for arid inland areas in northwest china sun et al 2019 the contribution of the moisture recycling fraction shows a larger spatial variation in spring at most stations the contribution of recycled moisture for precipitation in 2017 was higher than that for precipitation in 2016 except for the lancun station the contribution of moisture recycling for regional precipitation showed an increasing trend from the yitang station to the linfen station 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of lmwls in different regions of china the slope and intercept of lmwls usually reflects the variation of many geographic and meteorological factors comparisons of the lmwls for regional precipitation can be used to study precipitation processes and illustrate the degree of sub cloud evaporation as well as to identify the contribution of different moisture sources to regional precipitation in this study we calculated the local meteoric water line lmwl in six natural areas with different climate backgrounds including the northwest arid region nw the north of southeast monsoon region nsem the south of southeast monsoon region ssem the southwest monsoon region swm zhou and li 2018 the southern chinese loess plateau sclp and the eastern chinese loess plateau eclp in order to compare the differences in precipitation processes in different regions in regard to the lmwl equations fig 7 we can see that the slope and intercept for all samples were greater than those for rainfall samples and smaller than those for snow samples the slopes of lmwls based on all samples snow samples and rainy samples for the ssem were higher than those in other regions which indicates the climate background and moisture sources in the ssem are obviously different from those in other regions as shown in fig 7 the slopes of lmwls for rainfall samples and all samples in the nw nsew sclp and eclp are lower than the gmwl 8 thus indicating that there is a greater dominance of sub cloud evaporation in these regions in contrast the higher lmwl slope of the ssem and swm reflects the contribution of re evaporation from local land and open water in summer wang et al 2016c the slope of the eclp 7 12 was similar to that of the sclp 7 08 and the nsem 7 13 which indicated that the moisture source of the eclp is also close to that of the sclp continental mass dominated hao et al 2018 and nsem monsoon dominated zhu et al 2016 and it is affected by both the monsoon and the continental air masses 5 2 stable isotopic signatures of precipitation in different gradients of temperature and precipitation amounts the eclp is located in the transition zone between the monsoon dominated and continental mass dominated regions complex precipitation processes are associated with various environmental factors previous studies hao et al 2018 have found that stable isotopic signatures of precipitation display variability along gradients of different temperatures or precipitation amounts in order to further systematically analyse the isotopic variation in precipitation in the eclp we divide the data into four temperature groups t 0 c 0 c t 10 c 10 c t 20 c t 20 c and four precipitation groups 0 mm p 5 mm 5 mm p 10 mm 10 mm p 20 mm p 20 mm according to the previous reports hao et al 2018 table s2 presents some parameters for all of the observed samples under different temperature precipitation amount gradients at the four stations the growing set of data for the eclp were calculated as 78 4 t 0 c 50 8 0 c t 10 c 45 8 10 c t 20 c and 45 3 t 20 c in average δ2h and as 11 41 t 0 c 7 43 0 c t 10 c 6 64 10 c t 20 c and 6 17 t 20 c in terms of the average δ18o however the average d excess values showed an opposite trend to the average δ18o as the precipitation gradients increased a decreasing trend in the average δ2h and δ18o was observed the slope and intercept of the local meteoric water line did not present a precise correlation with the temperature precipitation gradient which is inconsistent with the reports in the southern chinese loess plateau relatively larger slopes of lmwls above 8 were observed at the lancun station and linfen station when the temperature ranged from 0 to 10 c which indicates that precipitation with these temperature gradients was strongly affected by the recycled moisture for 10 20 mm the relatively larger slope of the lmwl indicated that precipitation collected from the zhaocheng station and linfen station in this precipitation gradient also was strongly influenced by the moisture recycling in the clp the variability of δ2h and δ18o in precipitation was generated by a combination of factors including the temperature and precipitation amount previous studies have pointed out that the precipitation amount effect and the temperature effect are not very significant for all dates in the sclp hao et al 2018 which is similar to our results for the eclp in this study a positive correlation between δ18o and temperature only was seen in the precipitation samples from the linfen station at below a temperature of 10 c a significant precipitation amount effect was observed in the precipitation samples from the zhaocheng station above 5 mm and the linfen station 10 mm 20 mm the southeastern summer monsoon has been proven to have strong influences on precipitation processes in eastern and central china summer monsoons usually result in continuous precipitation and the vapor becomes progressively depleted in 2h and 18o summer monsoons precipitation shows a statistically negative correlation between the precipitation amount and δ18o in china peng et al 2012 li et al 2016a b c although there was no significant precipitation amount effect for all precipitation events at the four stations during the study period in the eclp some continuous summer precipitation δ18o showed a negative correlation with the precipitation amount in july and september 2016 and july and late august 2017 fig 2 for example a continuous heavy precipitation event occurred in the period during july 3 15 and the δ18o decreased from 4 4 to 16 and the corresponding precipitation increased from 19 mm to 25 mm for the lancun station concurrently at the yitang station the δ18o decreased from 1 35 to 13 15 and the corresponding precipitation increased from 17 mm to 26 mm this was also observed at the zhaocheng station and the linfen station however a similar phenomenon also has been observed at the synoptic scale in the sclp hao et al 2018 the middle qilian mountains li et al 2016b 5 3 meteorological controls on the d f relationship previous studies froehlich et al 2008 kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016b crawford et al 2017 have mentioned that there is an obvious linear relationship between the d and remaining fraction with a slope d f of approximately 1 1 per 1 or 1 2 per 1 under a condition of high f usually 95 which indicates that a 1 increase of evaporation may cause the d excess to decrease by approximately 1 1 1 2 fig 8 shows the correlations between the two parameters which were computed in order to determine whether such a linear relationship exists in the study area however the slope d f of approximately 0 92 per 1 in the fenhe river basin was smaller than that of the average value in the previous studies including in the tianshan moutains and qilian mountains as fig 8 shows a clear relationship between remaining fraction and d always could be observed in the fenhe river basin in an arid and semi arid climate some researches has proven that the remaining fraction of raindrop mass for small raindrops may be much less than 95 and even may disappear salamalikis et al 2016 wang et al 2016b in this study the linear relationship approximately 1 also can be seen from the inset in fig 8 with the decrease in the remaining fraction the relationship between f and d gradually become weaker when the f was less than 60 the scattering around the regression line become stronger the relationship between the d and remaining fraction is considered to be correlated with meteorological conditions such as the surface air temperature precipitation amount and relative humidity as previous studies have shown wang et al 2016b salamalikis et al 2016 the remaining fraction of rainfall is always larger under low air temperatures larger precipitation amount and higher relative humidity under such meteorological conditions the d is close to 0 and a linear correlation with a slightly lower slope between d and f can be observed in contrast relatively smaller f values and larger variations of d will appear in an arid environments with high air temperatures small precipitation amounts and low relative humidities under these conditions the relationship between the f and d may not be linear the variation of d versus f in precipitation at the micro and synoptic scale is useful for tracing local hydrological processes wang et al 2016b when the air temperature is below 0 c the sub cloud evaporation through the air is generally ignored so we divided the data into three groups t 10 c 10 c t 20 c and t 20 c according the temperature gradient in this study a set of data consisting of intercept was mentioned as 0 88 1 00 and 0 86 for the slopes of d f and as 89 2 99 80 and 86 66 for the intercepts was compiled along the temperature gradient of t 10 c 10 c t 20 c and t 20 c respectively fig 9 however there was a significant linear d f relationship in the temperature gradient of 10 c t 20 c according to the different relative humidity and precipitation rates three data groups also could be divided as shown in fig 9 the slopes in cross plotting of d f records were 0 99 0 72 and 0 69 thus displaying a decreasing trend in the relatively humidity range of rh 70 70 rh 90 and rh 90 respectively the relationship between f and d was relatively stronger in the relatively humidity gradient of rh 70 with the decrease in the precipitation amount the relationship between f and d gradually became weaker when the precipitation amount was less than 5 mm the scattering around the regression line became stronger 5 4 comparing the influence of recycled moisture on precipitation between the eclp and other regions as an important process in energy balances and ecosystem water budgets evapotranspiration including vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation is closely linked to ecosystem productivity and controlled by different biotic and physical processes li et al 2016a b the recycled moisture from evapotranspiration has been proven to have strong influences on continental precipitation of in china zhang and wang 2016 li et al 2016a b sun et al 2019 in the taiwan island region nearly 43 of the water went directly back into the atmosphere from the land and vegetation in the form of evapotranspiration in summer peng et al 2012 ma et al 2013 founded that the transpiration and evaporation fraction accounted for 4 in southeast china relatively higher moisture recycling fraction for local precipitation were observed in the hexi corridor area and the tibetan plateau li et al 2016a b c concluded that the local moisture recycling rate accounted for 27 in the hexi corridor area for the tibetan plateau the contribution of terrestrial moisture to the local precipitation has been estimated to range from 32 to 47 in summer ma et al 2013 besides terrestrial moisture produced by evapotranspiration has been proven to make important contribution to the precipitation in the tianshan mountains kong et al 2013 wang et al 2016c and kunlun mountains in our study the moisture recycling fraction accounted for 28 14 of the local precipitation and the results showed obvious seasonal variation with higher values in summer and lower values in spring these observational findings on the seasonal variation of moisture recycling fractions are also supported by other studies li et al 2016a b in the qilian mountains the local moisture recycling contribution showed an increasing trend from may 12 to july 35 and it decreased obviously until october 11 the growth of plants can be put forth as the main reason for this seasonal change in the moisture recycling contribution with the growth of plants more terrestrial moisture contributed by plant transpiration is transported from the land to the atmosphere which increases the contribution of recycled moisture to local precipitation wang et al 2016c generally speaking meteorological conditions air temperature and relative humidity land use and cover change vegetation open water construction lands and cultivated land and topographic factors are associated with the relative contributions for each moisture component in this study the contribution of recycled moisture for precipitation showed an obvious latitudinal gradient change which was mainly dominated by air temperature the barrier effect of high mountains often changes the moisture recycling rate of local precipitation sun et al 2019 in this study the lancun station mountain station had a relatively higher moisture recycling rate than that of the yitang station lower latitude than at lancun which was mainly dominated by the topographic factors in summary the contribution of recycled moisture to local precipitation in the eclp is close to that in the hexi corridor area effected by the monsoon and continental air mass li et al 2016a b c which indicates that the precipitation in the eclp is a combination of the monsoon and continental air masses 6 conclusions in this study based on precipitation data collected over 2 years during monitoring in the fenhe river basin we analyzed the stable isotope variability and identified the main environmental drivers of rainfall isotopic variation in the eastern chinese loess plateau in order to improve the interpretation of isotopic proxy records in this region the main points are presented as below 1 obvious seasonal variation was observed in the δ18o δ2h and d excess of precipitation in the fenhe river basin the asian monsoon was found to have an important influence on the seasonal variation of precipitation isotopes in the study area the δ18o and d excess values showed increasing trends from the north to the south and the spatial variation of precipitation isotopes in summer was more significant than that in winter 2 the weighted precipitation local meteoric water line lmwl of the fenhe river basin was calculated to be δ2h 7 7δ18o 7 0 in comparisons with the global meteoric water line gmwl the lower slope and intercept values were found to be typical for warm dry sites where sub cloud evaporation of raindrops is experienced 3 there was a significant correlation between the geographical factors including altitude latitude and longitude and spatial distribution of the isotopic composition of precipitation and the best fit equation between geographical factors and δ18o was δ18o 0 0005alt 0 62lat 14 78 in the eclp there were no significant correlations detected between precipitation δ18o and meteorological parameters for all precipitation events at the four stations during the study period stable isotopic signatures of precipitation displayed variability along the different temperature or precipitation amount gradients some continuous summer precipitation δ18o showed negative correlations with the precipitation amount in july and september 2016 and july and late august 2017 4 the stable isotopic components in precipitation were obviously controlled by the sub cloud evaporation and moisture recycling the sub cloud evaporation increased the δ values by about 12 0 4 7 in the precipitation within the eclp during march october the moisture recycling fraction accounted for 28 14 of the local precipitation which showed obvious seasonal variation with higher values in summer and lower values in spring significant seasonal variation in the remaining fraction f of the raindrop mass was observed at the linfen station and the seasonal fluctuation of the f in 2017 was more significant than that in 2016 the remaining fraction of rainfall was always larger under lower air temperatures larger precipitation amounts and higher relative humidity the relationship between f and d was relatively stronger in the temperature range of 10 c t 20 c and at
