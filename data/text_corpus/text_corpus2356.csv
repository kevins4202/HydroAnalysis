river basin of ethiopia to predict the current and future for long term groundwater utilization planning and management precipitation and temperature were acquired from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex africa platform using rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for the periods 1986 2015 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 wetspass m distributed hydrological model was used to analyze the seasonal and annual gwr under varying amplitude and dispersion particularly in the spring and summer due to increase in temperature and scanty rainfall gwr is severely affected average minimum and maximum temperatures are anticipated to rise by 0 11 c 0 61 c and 0 75 c 2 15 c respectively during mid rcp4 5 and long term rcp8 5 scenarios for the baseline period rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for both mid term and long term periods the maximum annual gwr was predicted to be 442 5 mm yr 371 6 mm yr 347 6 mm yr 319 6 mm yr and 327 41 mm yr respectively the maximum annual gwr is decreased by 83 3 mm 138 7 mm in the rcp4 5 scenario during the years 2041 2071 but in the rcp8 5 scenario during the years 207 2100 the maximum annual gwr is decreased by 26 1 mm 72 3 mm while the mean annual gwr is decreased by 26 1 mm 72 3 mm there have been numerous studies about how climate change cc may affect gwr but this study focuses specifically on forecasting precipitation and temperature to determine gwr in the basin the results could be crucial for suitable water management use by interpreting the direct and indirect effects of climate change on recharge systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords bilate river basin climate change gwr rcp scenarios wetspass m data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater provides nearly 50 of global population with drinking water and contributes to half of global food production it is even the earth s life support system and is becoming increasingly important due to climate change as it provides a buffer during flood and drought scientific monitoring and regulation are crucial to protect this vital and finite resource climate change cc is aggravating the current water deficit due to continuous rise in temperature resulting to erratic rainfall affecting the global climate yagbasan 2016 cc has direct and indirect impact on african ecosystems with long term consequences predicted considerably and lengthy during 21st century nhemachena et al 2020 africa s land surface temperatures have increased faster in comparison to the remaining continents deteriorating the temperature stability ipcc 2014 significant variations in rainfall reflecting through droughts and excessive rainfall have become more regular across eastern africa lyon and dewitt 2012 williams and funk 2011 the average surface temperature difference between 2 c and 1 5 c global warming levels gwls is larger than 0 5 c reaching 0 8 c in most parts of sudan and northern ethiopia osima et al 2018 the potential evapotranspiration pet could have increased by 27 under rcp8 5 whereas predicted water availability in this basin is expected to fall by 1 7 6 5 and 10 7 22 7 respectively according to cc predictions in ethiopia s upper blue nile basin liersch et al 2018 a1b and b1 assumptions resulted in 13 14 losses in surface runoff in the wari catchment of the tekeze river basin respectively for the period of 2015 2050 gebremeskel and kebede 2018 the maximum temperature in ethiopia s addis ababa area would rise to 2 06 c cgcm3a2 by 2080 although the minimum temperature would be 1 03 c feyissa 2018 throughout the rift valley s gidabo catchment both under rcp s rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios the 2020s 2050s and 2080s forecasts implied a decline in rainfall quantity in all months particularly in the months of february and may alehu et al 2021 cc has an effect on the volume and pattern of groundwater recharge gwr gemitzi et al 2017 saatloo et al 2019 tigabu et al 2021 and will have a negative impact on future gwr atawneh et al 2021 due to ongoing cc yearly average soil moisture in ethiopia is anticipated to decrease ipcc 2014 the wastewater produced as a result of the presence of various pharmaceutical components mostly antibiotics that are manufactured by pharmaceutical companies being used by everyone before reaching the environment including drainage systems has become one of the biggest environmental challenges in recent centuries sarkar et al 2015 massive exploitation of clean water from other sources will increase in the upcoming years due to a lack of infrastructure adhikari et al 2020 groundwater has so far been thought to contain 30 1 of the share of global freshwater 2 78 million trillion gallons roth et al 2018 and stands firm as the most essential resource for agronomic industrial and domestic activity in many dry and semi arid regions worldwide yin et al 2018 as a consequence of economic and population growth groundwater resources have become increasingly stressed in recent years various emission scenarios specified in rcps are used to study the effects of future cc on water systems the most widely used physically based tools for constructing diverse climatic scenarios are global circulation models gcms and the cordex frameworks elshamy et al 2009 nannawo et al 2022b gcms are inappropriate for local climate impact studies due to their lack of geographic resolution and failure to capture local effects navarro racines et al 2020 but on the other hand regional climate models rcms have been used to disaggregate gcm results to get past these limitations eden et al 2014 cordex brings together regional climate models and techniques as well as worldwide groups of regional downscaled forecasts giorgi and gutowski 2015 regardless of the fact that rcm outcomes have greater geographical and time accuracy than gcm projections temperatures and rainfall estimates are still inaccurate berg et al 2012 while climate models may forecast the future rainfall and temperatures there seem to be significant variances and ambiguity in rainfall forecasts among them kiesel et al 2019 most of the erstwhile cc investigations over the lake tana area ademe et al 2020 employed single gcms based on cmip3 data on the other hand cmip3 model outputs have a coarse high spatial resolution that is not as competent as cmip5 prediction taylor et al 2012 climate models from cmip5 could model bio geological systems aerosols and carbon cycles that combine to physical climate wide range of techniques have been practiced to accurately determine gwr volumes and distribution patterns including experimental procedures andualem et al 2021 cong et al 2018 rutledge 1997 wu et al 2016 a wetspass m model is a useful tool for determining gwr and variability for various geographical regions this model is a physically based and regionally dispersed water budget model used to analyze gwr batelaan and smedt 2001 gelebo et al 2022a and b molla et al 2019 nannawo et al 2021 wang et al 1996 and presently used widely in ethiopia cc seems to have the ability to change the frequency and volume of potential recharge modify the hazards of water scarcity droughts and flooding within the study area hughes et al 2021 there has been some studies on the effects of climate change cc on groundwater recharge gwr but no studies have yet been done on projecting precipitation and temperature to predict the space time distribution of gwr across the basin therefore to address these issues in the basin the spatially based and fully distributed hydrological model wetspass m model as well as anticipated climate projections were used by predicting the mean seasonal and annual dgwr under climate change scenarios the main aim of this research is to provide a comprehensive knowledge of the basin s gwr which is essential for long term water resource management 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area the bilate river system drains roughly 5402 8 km2 in ethiopia s center main rift between 37 040 and 38 020 e longitude fig 1 with a semi arid ecosystem throughout the lower basin and a temperate climate mostly in central northern and southwest mountains ayele et al 2022 haji et al 2018 nannawo et al 2022a rift escarpment and highland are the three geomorphic zones in the area with inconsistent rainfall due to varied terrain features which ranges from 1116 m to 3355 m above mean sea level annual rainfall in the high middle and lower parts of the river ranges from 1280 to 1339 1061 1771 and 769 956 mm respectively with an average of 1165 mm for the entire basin hussen et al 2018 2 2 the wetspass model s input data as presented in fig 2 a b and fig 3 a h the wetspass m analysis was simulated to predict the amplitude and distribution of gwr using land use past and present daily rainfall evapotranspiration average temperature tmax and tmin daily flow wind speed terrain gradient soil characteristics and groundwater depth data employing arcgis ampe et al 2012 the parameter tables were all gridded and subsequently used as inputs for the wetspass m model utilizing arc gis software tools of 1978 5635 raster cells of 30 m 30 m the highest point in the area under study was 3355 m in the northern gurage mountain while the lowest was 1116 m at the basin s outlet fig 3g using arcgis slope analysis tool the terrain map is created from the dem where slope ranges between 0 and 87 52 fig 3h winter spring summer and autumn are the tri monthly seasons in a bimodal climatic zone mcsweeney et al 2010 nannawo et al 2022a in order to get the best output from the hydrologic cycle that undergoes continuous climate change the wetspass m model is employed nyenje and batelaan 2009 woldeamlak et al 2007 2 3 land use land use statistics for 2020 were compiled using landsat 8 data path 168 169 and row 054 055 and 056 from the aster elevation archives of ethiopian geological mapping agency a dem with a resolution of 30 m and an elevation grid map with a resolution of 30 m were initiated landsat data was obtained in january to help alleviate the cloud situation this is followed by use of envi 5 3 software to process and categorize it through the maximum likelihood ml pixel based trained classification technique the producer s accuracy which is a measure to accurately classify is used to calculate omission errors the study area covers 115

bilate basin was produced using the fao s harmonized information nachtergaele et al 2010 fig 2b using the hydraulic characteristics conversion of the soil moisture aspects tool soil groups were transformed to usgs texture classes assuming topsoil percentages of grain sizes fractions to conform to model parameters the basin is covered with loam 2337 km2 sandy loam 2246 km2 clayey sand 816 km2

as mean air temperature maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity downward long wave and short wave radiation flux upward long wave and shortwave radiation flux wind sunshine hour and altitude elevation are required to estimate potential evapotranspiration using penman monteith methods fao 2007 the majority of meteorological stations with the exception of hosanna and alaba kulito give insufficient data for relative humidity wind speed and sun radiation as a result for stations with complete data evapotranspiration was calculated using penman monteith methods and hargreaves equations eq 1 for the mean daily minimum and maximum temperature and extraterrestrial radiation and the estimated evapotranspiration was used as an input to the wetspass m model allen et al 1998 nannawo et al 2021a 2022b fig 3d fig 3d depicts that the largest mean potential evapotranspiration with values ranging from 1638 17 to 1854 65 mm was observed in the central southeast and southernmost

corrected average daily pet precipitation and observed stream discharge were provided as inputs 2 6 rainfall and temperature forecasts for the time periods 1986 2015 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 projected climatic data precipitation and temperature were collected in netcdf format from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex africa platform using the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios this study has utilized the rcp scenarios for the ensemble rainfall and mean annual temperature as shown in fig 3a and e rahimpour et al 2021 worku et al 2020 the projected data from mpi cclm4 ichechiram5 and cnrmrca4 gcm data were utilized in general downscaled values cannot be utilized to evaluate effects since the projected elements could be quite different from the recorded data mutayoba and kashaigili 2017 general circulation models gcms are the most widely used methods for predicting the effects of global warming but their level of errors and uncertainty makes it challenging to simulate actual climatic events mengistu et al 2021 ukumo et al 2022a 2022b nannawo et al 2022b when compared to historical data gcm simulations contain enormous errors in order to produce a more accurate climatic projection that closely reflects the effects of climate change bias reduction was used to account for the possibility that downscaled parameters might exaggerate or underestimate the actual mean additionally bias corrections were applied to the basic climate model outputs where a ensemble rainfall b wind speed c observed rainfall d pet e temperature f groundwater level g elevation and h slope of the basin 2 7 bias corrections data from a climate model may be very different from actual data or data from gauging stations before using cc scenario data for hydrological effect analyses these errors are rectified berg et al 2012 the biased efficacy controls utilized in this investigation include temperature linear scaling pls rainfall linear scaling pls and rainfall power transformation eq 2 fig 5a e illustrates how to compare observed data to monthly average rainfall using climate scenario data 1986 2015 using the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 greenhouse gas emission scenarios the monthly ensemble averages of anticipated rainfall at the climatological stations of hulbarag hossana alaba kulito boditi and bilate tena were calculated for this analysis fig 5a e edamo et al 2022 hughes et al 2021 tigabu et al 2021 ukumo et al 2022a the same data s observed results were compared to historical model results from 1986 to 2015 the model s performance is therefore assessed using statistical indicators including percentage relative bias pbias eq 3 mean absolute error mae eq 8 pearson correlation coefficient r eq 4 and root mean square error rmse eq 9 the linear association between the observed and modeled rainfall quantities is assessed using the pearson correlation coefficient the result of 1 0 shows that the model s output and the observed data

racmo22t and mpi remo2009 due to an inability to fit the bimodal rainfall distribution for all observed climatic stations fig 4 a in the dry months of december january and february in the basin fig 4a shows that the racmo22t model anticipated historical mean monthly rainfall of 155 59 278 82 and 223 66 mm but the recmo2009 model predicted 164 26 433 48 and 589 7 mm climate stations in the basin recorded average rainfall of 12 01 19 79 and 24 59 mm in december january and february respectively fig 4a the forecast monthly rainfall was confusingly high and failed to fit a bimodal rainfall distribution when compared to the observed rainfall from the climatic stations in the basin during these months the mean seasonal rainfall for the racmo22t and recmo2009 models during the dry winter season was 659 07 mm and 1187 43 mm respectively the observed average seasonal rainfall for this season on the other hand was 57 31 mm fig 4b which is significantly less than the predicted amount additionally there are significant differences between the expected and actual mean seasonal rainfall patterns in terms of distribution patterns for instance the racmo22t and recmo2009 models predict relatively little rainfall in the summer yet the autumn and winter seasons predict confusingly large rainfall quantities compared to the observed mean seasonal rainfall all projected mean monthly and seasonal rainfall exhibits favorable correlates with observed rainfall with the exception of the racmo22t and recmo2009 models fig 4c the mean monthly and seasonal rainfall forecasts from the racmo22t and recmo2009 models revealed inverse connections with the actual rainfall in the basin the racmo22t and recmo2009 models monthly correlation coefficients r to recorded historical periods are 0 26 and 0 49 respectively while their seasonal correlation values are 0 36 and 0 63 respectively fig 4c these findings suggest a tenuous connection between observed and model output the outputs of other models such as ensemble mean have a lower correlation with observed rainfall values with a range of 0 90 0 95 for monthly results and 0 94 to 0 98 for seasonal results these findings suggest a solid relationship between observed and model output as a result the mpi cclm4 ichechiram and cnrmrca4 outputs were used to calculate the gwr s magnitude and distribution the results of the recmo2009 model did not match the bimodal rainfall distribution pattern in the gilgel gibe district according to an earlier study demissie and sime 2021 the reference period 1985 2015 and the future time period which is separated into short term 2011 2040 medium term 2041 2070 and long term 2071 2100 periods were simulated using the calibrated wetspass m model although short term results were also studied we focused on the medium and long term periods to conduct a thorough analysis edamo et al 2022 nannawo et al 2022b 2022b ukumo et al 2022a 2022b using three ensembles mpi cclm4 ichechiram5 and cnrmrca4 the amplitude and distribution of the gwr were calculated for two future time periods the fifty s between 2041 and 2070 and the eighty s between 2071 and 2100 the 2050s 2041 2070 and 2080s 2071 2100 were used as the baseline periods and respectively the middle and end of the 21st century for the research which was then done using two 30 year time frames 2 8 model performance evaluation in this work statistical methods are used to assess how effectively the wetspass m model reproduces observed statistics this study takes into account the mean squared error mse coefficient of variation cv mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination and root mean square error rmse these statistics serve as measures of how well model predictions match observed data by providing quantitative estimates of the goodness of fit between observed and simulated values the outcomes of these tests are used to evaluate the model prediction skills the observed and simulated discharges relative and absolute errors can be used to evaluate the goodness of fit the following evaluation criteria were used in this study 5 m s e i 1 n r i 2 n 6 r i s i p o b 7 r 2 r s s s s t 1 e s s t s s 8 m a e 1 n

terms of bias in terms of r the ichec hiram5 model performed best 0 87 the cnrm rca4 cv value 11 6 is close to the observed value 11 3 indicating that there is less variance between observed and simulated rainfall in terms of rmse cnrm rca4 model performs the best 17 0 7 while ichec hiram5 is least performed table 1 3 2 elucidation of the predicted precipitation the ensemble means rainfall changes in the bilate river basin throughout mid term rcps 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios show a visible heterogeneity during 2041 2070 therefore under the rcp4 5 scenario the rainfall is expected to fall by 3 6 9 4 0 6 and 1 51 at hulbarag hossana alaba kulito and boditi stations respectively during the long term rcp8 5 scenario for the 21st century 2071 2100 the predicted total mean ensemble rainfall has declined in all stations throughout the basin the hossana station fig 6 a e exhibited the biggest recorded decrease 599 98 mm or 30 21 while boditi station has the least drop 3 09 mm fig 7 boditi station had the greatest average means ensemble rainfall with an estimated value of 18 33 mm over the long term for rcp4 5 scenarios and bilate tena station had the lowest mean ensemble rainfall with an estimated value of 0 82 mm over the mid term for rcp4 5 scenarios rainfall forecasts were made for two time periods 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 unlike annual rainfall seasonal rainfall was expected to increase in winter seasons across all rcp scenarios for mid term and long term periods as to rcp 8 5 scenario for the assessment periods of 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 the value of average seasonal and yearly minimum temperatures has increased for all stations during the periods as compared to the base period 1986 2015 fig 8 a and b the largest variation in rise of percentage in long term rcp8 5 scenarios was 0 61 c at bilate tena station whereas the smallest least increase in medium term rcp8 5 scenarios was 0 11 for both the stations rcp4 5 3 3 projected mean seasonal and annual maximum temperature the computed seasonal and yearly averaged maximum temperature throughout all stations presents a clear rising pattern for nearly all seasons fig 8a the highest change in the seasonal maximum temperature of the middle and late periods may keep increasing during the winter season same to that of rcp8 5 scenario in the rcp8 5 scenario the mean maximum temperature increased by 2 15 c at bilate tena station in belg spring season among 2041 and 2070 whereas the least rise was recorded as 0 75 c during 2071 2100 rcp8 5 fig 8b 3 4 averaged minimum and maximum temperature regardless of rainfall dynamics the average temperature at all stations go on increasing fig 9 a e in the projected emission scenario rcp4 5 the temperature is rising across the belg season from 0 23 c in 2041 2070 to 1 27 c in 2071 2100 the maximum mean temperature was taken at boditi station during the long term rcp scenario with a forecasted value of 1 41 c in all rcp scenarios the average annual temperature is anticipated to rise in all seasons in the 2050s and 2080s the rainfall and temperature simulation capabilities of cordex regional climate models include ichec hiram5 mpi cclm4 and cnrm rca4 3 5 wetspass m model performance evaluation trial simulation is used to conduct calibration runs in the wetspass m model the output of the model is compared to the filtered base flow and surface runoff measurements parameter changes are done to enhance the model s performance for ethiopia s bilate river based on comparisons and reviews a comparison of the measured and simulated runoff and base flow from separated discharge using bfi 3 hydro office techniques for the basin is shown in fig 10 several parameters have been carefully adjusted in the bilate river basin including the alpha coefficient a interception lp coefficient average rainfall intensity i and runoff delay factor x until a final agreement was reached the surface runoff and base flow that were produced by utilizing a base flow separator to separate the observed river discharge were held in reserve and optimized the wetspass m model with base flow and surface runoff was used to simulate data for the model s calibration with correlation coefficients r2 of 0 82 and 0 84 and standard errors of 0 32 and 0 42 the simulation analysis was satisfactory in order to improve the goodness of fit the parameters were changed to have the following values average rainfall intensity i 5 8 mm h lp 1 a 6 4 mm day and x 0 37 after calibration the wetspass m model may forecast results for base flow and total surface runoff that are acceptable 3 6 estimated effects of climate change on gwr annually 3 6 1 changes annual gwr the influence of climate change on average seasonal and annual gwr in the basin was investigated based on temperature increases and precipitation reductions over rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios for the timeframe were 1986 2100 the gwr was projected during the time periods 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 the maximum annual gwr was forecasted to be 442 5 mm yr 371 6 mm yr 347 6 mm yr 319 6 mm yr and 327 41 mm yr respectively for the baseline era rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for both mid term and long term periods fig 11 the mean annual gwr for the baseline mid as well as long term periods in the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios was 192 4 mm yr 154 29 mm yr and 140 2 mm yr 154 3 mm yr and 143 7 mm yr respectively fig 11 depicts future gwr as a regional and temporal fluctuation in the mid as well as long term rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the average annual gwr in the basin is found to decline by 16 0 27 7 21 4 and 26 0 accordingly 3 6 2 changes seasonal gwr the mean seasonal gwr across the two mentioned emission scenarios may decrease over the winter season with the exception of the 2041 2070 rcp4 5 emission scenario under the rcp4 5 scenario the anticipated recharge drops between 10 6 mm and 23 mm 17 0 and 36 8 throughout 2041 2070 as well as 2071 2100 timeframes fig 12 a the future gwr under the rcp8 5 scenario might be between 14 5 mm and 25 6 mm 23 2 and 40 89 respectively in mid and long term during the entire period of rcp4 5 scenario the maximum gwr in the winter season was observed with a magnitude of 90 3 mm during the spring season gwr quantities were significantly more likely to fall in rcp4 5 than rcp8 5 scenarios fig 12b as a result within that rcp4 5 scenario the gwr might be reduced between 17 2 mm and 22 4 mm 31 67 and 39 4 in the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods respectively in rcp8 5 seasonal gwr ranges from 9 0 mm to 21 4 mm 16 7 and 39 4 gwr was the most affected by rcp8 5 dropping from 158 2 mm in the base era to 125 7 mm in the long term rcp8 5 in the mid and long term periods precipitation is supposed to lower over rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios in all rcp scenarios the forecasted average seasonal gwr for the summer season may have risen fig 12c as in rcp4 5 scenario the seasonal gwr might fluctuate between 2 4 mm and 14 6 mm throughout 2050s and 2080s the mean gwrs for rcp4 5 might be enhanced by 10 2 and 23 32 mm for the mid term and long term periods respectively irrespective of precipitation changes in eto were found to have a considerable correlation with heavy wet days changes on wet days this condition could be created by a poor infiltration rate which exposes the majority of rainfall to surface runoff rather than replenishing groundwater systems during the autumn rcp8 5 scenarios depicted that mean seasonal gwr had become more proficient of decreasing than rcp4 5 the gwr might be reduced between 16 3 mm and 24 9 mm 27 5 and 41 9 for the rcp4 5 scenario fig 12d rcp8 5 s seasonal gwr could range from 28 4 mm to 28 6 mm 47 7 and 48 0 rcp8 5 had the greatest impact on gwr which reduced from 168 1 mm during the reference period to 123 2 mm in the long term rcp8 5 the autumn season had the highest maximum and mean seasonal recharge of all of the other seasons and computation periods in the area 168 1 and 59 5 mm during base periods respectively 4 discussions 4 1 projected rainfall the forecasted ensemble mean seasonal rainfall has decreased in all stations of the basin except boditi station during 2071 2100 through rcp8 5 emission scenarios during the 2071 2100 periods with rcp8 5 the highest decrease in rainfall was observed at hossana station 599 98 mm 30 21 and the least has been observed at boditi station 3 09 mm fig 6a e 7 the best overall mean ensemble rainfall was recorded at hulbarag station with an estimated value of 33 58 mm over the long term for rcp4 5 scenarios while the lowest average mean ensemble rainfall was recorded at bilate tena station with an estimated value of 0 82 mm over the period 2041 2070 in rcp4 5 scenarios according to alehu et al 2021 calculations indicated a decrease in rf amount in the gidabo watershed which borders the current research region of bilate river basin corroborating the quality the bilate river basin s rain fed agronomy is adversely affected by the succeeding decades decrease in rainfall volume climate change when paired with non climate causes and pressures is projected to aggravate the vulnerabilities of agricultural systems in sub saharan africa particularly in semi arid regions antwi agyei et al 2017 serdeczny et al 2017 4 2 projected maximum temperature the mean maximum temperature increases by 2 15 c in the long term rcp8 5 scenario at bilate tena station in belg spring season however the minimum was recorded at the same location with a determined value of 0 75 c fig 8b under the rcp4 5 scenarios seasonal maximum temperatures

barren landscape where clay soil predominates fig 13a e they have lower quantity of vegetated land settlement and impervious layers environs projecting high potential to encourage greater surface

in recent years various emission scenarios specified in rcps are used to study the effects of future cc on water systems the most widely used physically based tools for constructing diverse climatic scenarios are global circulation models gcms and the cordex frameworks elshamy et al 2009 nannawo et al 2022b gcms are inappropriate for local climate impact studies due to their lack of geographic resolution and failure to capture local effects navarro racines et al 2020 but on the other hand regional climate models rcms have been used to disaggregate gcm results to get past these limitations eden et al 2014 cordex brings together regional climate models and techniques as well as worldwide groups of regional downscaled forecasts giorgi and gutowski 2015 regardless of the fact that rcm outcomes have greater geographical and time accuracy than gcm projections temperatures and rainfall estimates are still inaccurate berg et al 2012 while climate models may forecast the future rainfall

flooding within the study area hughes et al 2021 there has been some studies on the effects of climate change cc on groundwater recharge gwr but no studies have yet been done on projecting precipitation and temperature to predict the space time distribution of gwr across the basin therefore to address these issues in the basin the spatially based and fully distributed hydrological model wetspass m model as well as anticipated climate projections were used by predicting the mean seasonal and annual dgwr under climate change scenarios the main aim of this research is to provide a comprehensive knowledge of the basin s gwr which is essential for long term water resource management 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area the bilate river system drains roughly 5402 8 km2 in

climatic data precipitation and temperature were collected in netcdf format from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex africa platform using the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios this study has utilized the rcp scenarios for the ensemble rainfall and mean annual temperature as shown in fig 3a and e rahimpour et al 2021 worku et al 2020 the projected data from mpi cclm4 ichechiram5 and cnrmrca4 gcm data were utilized in general downscaled values cannot be utilized to evaluate effects since the projected elements could be quite different from the recorded data mutayoba and kashaigili 2017 general circulation models gcms are the most widely used methods for predicting the effects of global warming but their level of errors and uncertainty makes it challenging to simulate actual climatic events mengistu et al 2021 ukumo et al 2022a 2022b nannawo et al 2022b when compared to historical data gcm simulations contain enormous errors in order to produce a more accurate climatic projection that closely reflects the effects of climate change bias reduction was used to account for the possibility that downscaled parameters might exaggerate or underestimate the actual mean additionally bias corrections were applied to the basic climate model outputs where a ensemble rainfall b wind speed c observed rainfall d pet e temperature f groundwater

and rainfall power transformation eq 2 fig 5a e illustrates how to compare observed data to monthly average rainfall using climate scenario data 1986 2015 using the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 greenhouse gas emission scenarios the monthly ensemble averages of anticipated rainfall at the climatological stations of hulbarag hossana alaba kulito boditi and bilate tena were calculated for this analysis fig 5a

the linear association between the observed and modeled rainfall quantities is assessed using the pearson correlation coefficient the result of 1 0 shows that the model s output and the observed data

racmo22t and mpi remo2009 due to an inability to fit the bimodal rainfall distribution for all observed climatic stations fig 4 a in the dry months of december january and february in the basin fig 4a shows that the racmo22t model anticipated historical mean monthly rainfall of 155 59 278 82 and 223 66 mm but the recmo2009 model predicted 164 26 433 48 and 589 7 mm climate stations in the basin recorded average rainfall of 12 01 19 79 and 24 59 mm in december january and february respectively fig 4a the forecast monthly rainfall was confusingly high and failed to fit a bimodal rainfall distribution when compared to the observed rainfall from the climatic stations in the basin during these months the mean seasonal rainfall for the racmo22t and recmo2009 models during the dry winter season was 659 07 mm and 1187 43 mm respectively the observed average seasonal rainfall for this season on the other hand was 57 31 mm fig 4b which is significantly less than the predicted amount additionally there are significant differences between the expected and actual mean seasonal rainfall patterns in terms of distribution patterns for instance the racmo22t and recmo2009 models predict relatively little rainfall in the summer yet the autumn and winter seasons predict confusingly large rainfall quantities compared to the observed mean seasonal rainfall all projected mean monthly and seasonal rainfall exhibits favorable correlates with observed rainfall with the exception of the racmo22t and recmo2009 models fig 4c the mean monthly and seasonal rainfall forecasts from the racmo22t and recmo2009 models revealed inverse connections with the actual rainfall in the basin the racmo22t and recmo2009 models monthly correlation coefficients r to recorded historical periods are 0 26 and 0 49 respectively while their seasonal correlation values are 0 36 and 0 63 respectively fig 4c these findings suggest a tenuous connection between observed and model output the outputs of other models such as ensemble mean have a lower correlation with observed rainfall values with a range of 0 90 0 95 for monthly results and 0 94 to 0 98 for seasonal results these findings suggest a solid relationship between observed and model output as a result the mpi cclm4 ichechiram and cnrmrca4 outputs were used to calculate the gwr s magnitude and distribution the results of the recmo2009 model did not match the bimodal rainfall distribution pattern in the gilgel gibe district according to an earlier study demissie and sime 2021 the reference period 1985 2015 and the future time period which is separated into short term 2011 2040 medium term 2041 2070 and long term 2071 2100 periods were simulated using the calibrated wetspass m model although short term results were also studied we focused on the medium and long term periods to conduct a thorough analysis edamo et al 2022 nannawo et al 2022b 2022b ukumo et al 2022a 2022b using three ensembles mpi cclm4 ichechiram5 and cnrmrca4 the amplitude and distribution of the gwr were calculated for two future time periods the fifty s between 2041 and 2070 and the eighty s between 2071 and 2100 the 2050s 2041 2070 and 2080s 2071 2100 were used as the baseline periods and respectively the middle and end of the 21st century for the research which was then done using two 30 year time frames 2 8 model performance evaluation in this work statistical methods are used to assess how effectively the wetspass m model reproduces observed statistics this study takes into account the mean squared error mse coefficient of variation cv mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination and root mean square error rmse these statistics serve as measures of how well model predictions match observed data by providing quantitative

changes in the bilate river basin throughout mid term rcps 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios show a visible heterogeneity during 2041 2070 therefore under the rcp4 5 scenario the rainfall is expected to fall by 3 6 9 4 0 6 and 1 51 at hulbarag hossana alaba kulito and boditi stations respectively during the long term rcp8 5 scenario for the 21st century 2071 2100 the predicted total mean ensemble rainfall has declined in all stations throughout the basin the hossana station fig 6 a e exhibited the biggest recorded decrease 599 98 mm or 30 21 while boditi station has the least drop 3 09 mm fig 7 boditi station had the greatest average means ensemble rainfall with an estimated value of 18 33 mm over the long term for rcp4 5 scenarios and bilate tena station had the lowest mean ensemble rainfall with an estimated value of 0 82 mm over the mid term for rcp4 5 scenarios rainfall forecasts were made for two time periods 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 unlike annual rainfall seasonal rainfall was expected to increase in winter seasons across all rcp scenarios for mid term and long term periods as to rcp 8 5 scenario for the assessment periods of 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 the value of average seasonal and yearly minimum temperatures has increased for all stations during the periods as compared to the base period 1986 2015 fig 8 a and b the largest variation in rise of percentage in long term rcp8 5

to 1 27 c in 2071 2100 the maximum mean temperature was taken at boditi station during the long term rcp scenario with a forecasted value of 1 41 c in all rcp scenarios the average annual temperature

a interception lp coefficient average rainfall intensity i and runoff delay factor x until a final agreement was reached the surface runoff and base flow that were produced by utilizing a base flow separator to separate the observed river discharge were held in reserve and optimized the wetspass m model with base flow and surface runoff was used to simulate data for the model s calibration with correlation coefficients r2 of 0 82 and 0 84 and standard errors of 0 32 and 0 42 the simulation analysis was satisfactory in order to improve the goodness of fit the parameters were changed to have the following values average rainfall intensity i 5 8 mm h lp 1 a 6 4 mm day and x 0 37 after calibration the wetspass m model may forecast results for base flow and total surface runoff that are

maximum annual gwr was forecasted to be 442 5 mm yr 371 6 mm yr 347 6 mm yr 319 6 mm yr and 327 41 mm yr respectively for the baseline era rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for both mid term and long term periods fig 11 the mean annual gwr for the baseline mid as well as long term periods in the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios was 192 4 mm yr 154 29 mm yr and 140 2 mm yr 154 3 mm yr and 143 7 mm yr respectively fig 11 depicts future gwr as a regional and temporal fluctuation in the mid as well as long term rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the average annual gwr in the basin is found to decline by 16 0 27 7 21 4 and 26 0 accordingly 3 6 2 changes seasonal gwr the mean seasonal gwr across the two mentioned emission scenarios may decrease over the winter season with the exception of the 2041 2070 rcp4 5 emission scenario under the rcp4 5 scenario the anticipated recharge drops between 10 6 mm and 23 mm 17 0 and 36 8 throughout 2041 2070 as well as 2071 2100 timeframes fig 12 a the future gwr under the rcp8 5 scenario might be between 14 5 mm and 25 6 mm 23 2 and 40 89 respectively in mid and long term during the entire period of rcp4 5 scenario the maximum gwr in the winter season was observed with a magnitude of 90 3 mm during the spring season gwr quantities were significantly more likely to fall in rcp4 5 than rcp8 5 scenarios fig 12b as a result within that rcp4 5 scenario the gwr might be reduced between 17 2 mm and 22 4 mm 31 67 and 39 4 in the 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 periods respectively in rcp8 5 seasonal gwr ranges from 9 0 mm to 21 4 mm 16 7 and 39 4 gwr was the most affected by rcp8 5 dropping from 158 2 mm in the base era to 125 7 mm in the long term rcp8 5 in the mid and long term periods precipitation is supposed to lower over rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios in all rcp scenarios the forecasted average seasonal gwr for the summer season may have risen fig 12c as in rcp4 5 scenario the seasonal gwr might fluctuate between 2 4 mm and 14 6 mm throughout 2050s and 2080s the mean gwrs for rcp4 5 might be enhanced by 10 2 and 23 32 mm for the mid term and long term periods respectively irrespective of precipitation changes in eto were found to have a considerable correlation with heavy wet days changes on wet days this condition could be created by a poor infiltration rate which exposes the majority of rainfall to surface runoff rather than replenishing groundwater systems during the autumn rcp8 5 scenarios depicted that mean seasonal gwr had become more proficient of decreasing than rcp4 5 the gwr might be reduced between 16 3 mm and 24 9 mm 27 5 and 41 9 for the rcp4 5 scenario fig 12d rcp8 5 s seasonal gwr could range from 28 4 mm to 28 6 mm 47 7 and 48 0 rcp8 5 had the greatest impact on gwr which reduced from 168 1 mm during the reference period to 123 2 mm in the long term rcp8 5 the autumn season had the highest maximum and mean seasonal recharge of all of the other seasons and computation periods in the area 168 1 and 59 5 mm during base periods respectively 4 discussions 4 1 projected rainfall the forecasted ensemble mean seasonal rainfall has decreased in all stations of the basin except boditi station during 2071 2100 through rcp8 5 emission scenarios during the 2071 2100 periods with rcp8 5 the highest decrease in rainfall was observed at hossana station 599 98 mm 30 21 and the least has been observed at boditi station 3 09 mm fig 6a e 7 the best overall mean ensemble rainfall was recorded at hulbarag station with an estimated value of 33 58 mm over the long term for rcp4 5 scenarios while the lowest average mean ensemble rainfall was recorded at bilate tena station with an estimated value of 0 82 mm over the period 2041 2070 in rcp4 5 scenarios according to alehu et al 2021 calculations indicated a decrease

africa particularly in semi arid regions antwi agyei et al 2017 serdeczny et al 2017 4 2 projected maximum temperature the mean maximum temperature increases by 2 15 c in the long term rcp8 5 scenario at bilate tena station in belg spring season however the minimum was recorded at the same location with a determined value of 0 75 c fig 8b under the rcp4 5 scenarios seasonal maximum temperatures could escalates by 0 24 0 71 c in the mid term and 0 35 0 46 c in the long term as per the future projection by the turn of the 21st century maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to rise considerably 4 3 projected average tmax and tmin temperature the average temperature in all stations will rise regardless of rainfall dynamics fig 9a e the temperature increases from 0 23 c throughout

rainfall and temperature rahimpour et al 2021 worku et al 2020 4 4 changes on annual gwr during 1986 2015 the maximum annual gwr was calculated as 442 5 mm yr 371 6 mm yr 347 6 mm yr 319 6 mm yr and 327 41 mm yr consecutively for rcp4 5 2041 2070 and 2071 2100 and rcp8 5 for 2041 2100 and 2071 2100 future groundwater recharge is portrayed as a regional and temporal change in the amount of water flowing into the ground figs 11 and 12a d 13a e according to the assessment mean annual recharge has decreased and both rcp scenarios are expected to decline over the next decades gwr on the other hand is projected to get more intricate in future across the study area jannis et al 2021 moeck et al 2016 raposo et al 2013 climate change could have a negative impact on future groundwater recharge

land has affected the direct recharge mathewos et al 2019 sulamo et al 2021 aggregated flow in the river from a basin has a direct consequence of runoff water and basin aquifers systems increased surface runoff rates in the river system are influenced by agricultural land development deforestation and bush lands abdollahi et al 2017 the gwr will be further affected over both rcps in the coming decades figs 11 and 12a d kahsay et al 2018 tigabu et al 2021 the focus of this research was to see how gwr in this basin would be disrupted in the coming decades when rainfall drops and temperatures rises locations with more forest cover can collect more water than those with more grass and shrubs fig 13 a d dereje and nedaw 2019 meresa and taye 2019 molla et al 2019 the maximum and mean seasonal change in gwr are shown in figs 11 and 12a d with decrements of 45 23 mm 26 9 and 28 6 mm 48 0 for the long term rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively the maximum annual gwr amount is lowered by 83 3 mm 138 7 mm in the both the scenarios respectively while the mean yearly grw amount is reduced by 26 1 mm 72 3 mm figs 11 13e the annual return gwr in various combinations of the basin were determined using wetspass m simulation consequently it was realized that when combined with loam and clayey sand soil type classes maximum groundwater recharge occurs in forest areas particularly around northern north western and south western parts of the basin for both rcp scenarios and base mid term and long term periods the lowest gwr was detected in residential areas lakes and rivers and barren landscape where clay soil predominates fig 13a e they have lower quantity of vegetated land settlement and impervious layers environs projecting high potential to encourage greater surface runoff rather than replenishing groundwater recharge within the region xu et al 2020 the abrupt distribution of soil formations disrupt infiltration processes negatively impacting gwr in the area berhanu and hatiye 2020 kumar et al 2016 rukundo and doğan 2019 5 conclusions the study focused on present and future gwr systems for their effects due to variables related to climate change and their effects in ethiopia s bilate river basin future precipitation and temperature shifts were projected as a result of cc which was a major concern for gwr the sensitivity of ground water recharge using wetspass m model for global and local model parameters was observed during the base period r2 value of 0 89 indicates close agreement for the base period compared to the simulated outputs fig 10 the wetspass m model is also validated with rapidly changing physical attributes the essential parameters to the system s long term viability coupled with loam and clayey sand soil types provides information of maximum groundwater recharge occurring in the basin s northern north western and south western locations the lowest gwr was observed in rivers lakes and deforested areas dominated by clay for the determined emissions scenarios for base mid term and long term periods fig 13a e the wetspass m model supersedes all the other models for locations that are inaccessible and availability of data from gauging stations is restricted further studies accounted future variations in temperature and precipitation for short medium and long term periods 20s 50s and 80s to analyze changes in climate variability and dynamics and its impacts of water balance including surface water and groundwater in the basin the hydro climate and dgwr of the area are predicted to alter significantly as a

observations of other sensors was selected as the best scenario gws has a downward trend of 0 263 gigaton year the maximum eij subsidence is 16 cm year and the subsidence around the sinkhole is evaluated at 8 cm year the pw has a decreasing linear trend of 1 91 m year all 3 sensors have an average correlation of 0 81 continuous wavelet transform was used to determine insar grace and pw

is used land subsidence ls will occur currently more than 90 of iran s provinces are facing ls due to mismanagement of water resources memarian sorkhabi et al 2022 all 610 plains in the country subsidence occurs and has very dangerous environmental consequences ls in iran is due to drought uncontrolled drilling of agricultural and industrial wells and over extraction of groundwater and aquifer reserves reduction mahmoudpour et al 2016 ranjbar and ehteshami 2019 castellazzi et al 2018 introduced the insar grace approach to groundwater extraction which better understands the relationship between subsidence and groundwater extraction changes in the earth s crust around the mine have been studied with grace and insar and the gws has undergone significant changes since mine closure zheng et al 2018 grace and insar complement can be the best sensors for monitoring groundwater changes agarwal et al 2020 multi annual trends and seasonal changes in the earth s crust resulting from insar are fully correlated with groundwater changes li et al 2020 ramillien et al 2020 studied the water mass change of the grace satellite with the kalman filter in daily temporal

and grace fo satellites li et al 2020 shokri et al 2018 studied the different ensemble kalman filter structures for grace total water storage assimilation which show improvement in all structures there are several methods for measuring subsidence and crustal deformation including radar images geological study precise leveling modeling and global navigation satellite system gnss sorkhabi et al 2022 elshambaky 2019 konakoglu 2021 in this study radar images grace observations and piezometric well observations have been used to estimate subsidence and gws the study of subsidence with radar images and the rate of gws reduction can provide a more accurate understanding of changes in the earth s crust first the ekf was used to reduce noise and grace limitations in the next step the subsidence rates obtained from insar and then compared with gws the results are also confirmed by piezometric wells observation in the last step the observations of different sensors in the time frequency domain are studied by continuous wavelet transform 2 study area eij is a city in the southeast of fars province the distance from this city to shiraz is 210 km eij region is located in the zagros region based on geological divisions the general structure of the region includes large anticline buildings and due to active tectonics with local fractures highly crushed limestone layers and large blocks with fault boundaries have been created fig 1 shows a the study area b the creation of a sinkhole from 2014 to 2020 in 2016 a sinkhole was created in chah daraz village of the eij region which has a diameter of about 20 m and a depth of 80 m this sinkhole is located in the southwest of eij city and south of estahban city in fars province this is a kind of collapse sinkhole ls has also affected infrastructure and the situation has become more critical due to precipitation softening and wetting of the soil the sinking of the eij area is getting bigger which will be evident in 2020 the lands around the neighboring village of sinkhole have been cracked and if it reaches people s houses the place must be completely evacuated irregular water withdrawals in recent years in this area have intensified the phenomenon of dissolution and eventually the creation of subsidence in this area due to the ls of the plain surface the sloping parts have formed long and deep gaps in the margin of the plain due to the difference in the subsidence rate these ls have not occurred suddenly but gradually and have become wider and deeper in recent times 3 materials and methods 3 1 extended kalman filter ekf the ekf is used in the case of dynamic equations and nonlinear observations after linearizing the equations and using the taylor expansion to approximate the shape of the predicted and synchronized equations becomes very similar to what is available in the standard filter this special mode filter is more linearized than the kalman filter crassides and junkins 2012 this method uses a derivative of nonlinear dynamics equations and observations to run and apply this filter it is necessary to know the initial values of the state vector and its weight if these values are known and the problem modeling is correct the filter will converge and the state vector and its weight will tend to their true values boleiro ullman 2004 when dynamic modeling and observations are highly nonlinear this method is not able to provide a convergent and stable response due to the use of a first order derivative or a maximum second order derivative and a more robust and stable method should be used giss 2011 fig 2 shows the ekf flowchart used in this study process noise is caused by uncertainty in the mathematical modeling of the system the function differs from the real and practical model of the system this difference will be modeled in the noise process noise measurement and process are often modeled as gaussian processes with a covariance matrix statistical analysis of sensors can be used to determine the measurement covariance matrix but due to the variety and complexity of nonlinear systems there is no specific algorithm for determining the process noise covariance matrix and in practice it is often set by trial and error it is assumed that all system information is available up to sample k 1 in this case based on the mathematical model of the system and the signals available up to time k 1 an initial estimate of the state variables in the sample k is calculated this step of the ekf is the prediction process at time k a new measurement is made by the sensors in the second step of the ekf called the update phase the prediction is made in the first step is improved based on the new data available to obtain the final estimation states in sample k 4 scenarios are designed the specifications of which are given in table 1 moving average filter length and lookback window length for covariance estimation have been changed in different scenarios to evaluate the best scenario 3 2 continues wavelet transform cwt unlike fourier transform cwt can also be used for non static signals and dynamic systems fourier transform deficiencies in the analysis of signals with non stationary properties have led to the presentation of frequency time analysis sorkhabi et al 2021a although cwt can provide information about the frequency and time of a particular event in the signal but is limited by the use of fixed size windows this problem was solved by providing wavelet transform wavelet transform is window or place analysis on a variable scale the term wavelet means small wave meaning the window function has a finite length the output of the wavelet transforms on a one dimensional signal results in a two dimensional spectrogram this spectrogram can provide detailed information about the system state space or in other words information about dynamic behavior sorkhabi et al 2021b in this study subsidence time series gws and piezometric wells in the time frequency domain with continuous wavelet transform have been investigated to discuss differences and similarities 3 3 gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on grace fo the grace satellite measures the displacement of water on the earth surface over time mohamed and gonçalvès 2021 sorkhabi et al 2021b using hydrological models it is possible to understand groundwater changes from total water storage deep et al 2021 in this study jpl grace satellite data from 2002 to 2017 and grace fo from 2018 to 2021 were used by combining the global land data assimilation system gldas model to obtain gws taha et al 2021 the process of sarkar et al 2020 has been applied to achieve gws grace observations have the problem of spectral leakage and noise for this purpose the ekf algorithm has been used to reconstruct the gws signal 3 4 interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar in radar interferometry the amount of ground displacement is calculated through the phase difference of the two images after preparing the interferometers and making various corrections on them considering that each interferometer contains a large area with different correlations the results are not reliable for this reason the alone interferometer of radar pair images cannot show the displacement dong et al 2014 to solve the problem various methods have been proposed one of which is the small baseline subset time series sbas in this method only pairs of images are used whose vertical component of the baseline is less than the critical value of the baseline and also their baseline time is minimal at the same time tizzani et al 2007 in this way only interferometers of good quality are formed after forming these interferometers a network of images is created then the displacement amount of each pixel is estimated using the least squares method in this study sentinel 1 images from 2014 to 2020 were used to estimate eij subsidence from 100 radar images and the sbas method the subsidence time series and average annual subsidence are evaluated 3 5 piezometric well pw in this study pw has been used to estimate the rate of groundwater reduction from 1997 to 2015 pw can measure the level of groundwater which can determine the amount of nutrition and consumption first the data is refined based on the normality test and blunders are removed from the time series in the next step the resulting time series is compared with other sensors 4 results 4 scenarios were designed for grace signal reconstruction fig 3 shows the different scenarios of grace signal reconstruction with ekf in all scenarios a decreasing trend is observed with annual and semi annual periods but their amplitude is different scenario 1 has the most differences with grace observations and the least differences with scenario 4 as the lookback window length for covariance estimation increases the difference increases the best moving average filter length of 5 is evaluated the gws grace time series reconstructed with ekf with scenario 4 is shown in fig 4 a mainly annual and semi annual periods related to precipitation the estimated linear trend shows 1 21 cm year gws time series from 2002 to 2010 has no decreasing trend and starts decreasing trend after 2010 after the torrential rains of march 2019 in shiraz no decreasing trend is observed from 2019 to 2020 gws has a decreasing linear trend of 0 263 gigaton year fig 4 b shows the pw observations of the eij city from 1997 to 2015 a decrease of 27 m is observed from 1997 to 2003 an increase of 10 m is observed from 2003 to late 2005 from 2006 to 2015 a decrease of about 15 m is evaluated the linear trend of pw observations is 1 9 m year the sampling rate of pw has been done in different intervals from monthly to yearly in some years sampling is regular and monthly and seasonal changes are observed and in some years sampling is irregular for this reason pw shows low correlation with other sensors 100 radar images from 2014 to 2020 were processed using snap software fig 5 shows a average annual subsidence and b the subsidence time series of the study area the average annual subsidence in the southwest reaches 16 cm which is the highest value these are mainly agricultural areas other subsidence areas 1 up to 8 cm year is observed in the southeastern regions of eij the sinkhole zone has 8 cm year subsidence the linear trend of the subsidence time series is estimated to be 8 cm year it can be caused by groundwater extraction the correlation matrix of the sensors has been analyzed with different scenarios fig 6 shows the correlation matrix of sensors with different scenarios that have been used for validation the average correlation of sensors with the first second third and fourth scenarios is 0 67 0 69 0 74 and 0 81 respectively the subsidence correlation with the first second third and fourth scenarios is 0 62 0 68 0 72 and 0 84 respectively pw correlation with the first second third and fourth scenarios is 0 57 0 58 0 69 and 0 76 respectively the highest correlation is related to scenario 4 and the lowest to scenario 1 for this purpose scenario 4 has been selected due to more accurate reconstruction the subsidence correlation with pw is 0 83 to determine insar grace and pw periods continuous wavelet transform is used which are shown in fig 7 a to c respectively the purpose of wavelet analysis is to check periods and the compatibility of different sensors wavelet transform offers time frequency analysis and observation periods of different sensors can be compared in insar and grace outputs a 1 year period is detected in the observed time insar outputs are estimated to be 0 5 year periods after 2011 grace outputs detect periods of 0 5 years or less after 2008 also 2 year and 3 year periods are detected throughout the observation period pw outputs from 1993 to 2007 revealed a period of about 3 years detected periods insar and grace are well compatible but the period of about 3 years pw is compatible with grace fig 8 b shows precipitation and evaporation time series the long term average precipitation from 1992 to 2017 is 237 mm the amount of precipitation in some years is higher than 237 mm but in most years it is lower than the long term average also the amount of evaporation is more than 200 mm in most years to further investigate the drought index it has been calculated the standardized precipitation index spi time series is calculated for further investigation as shown in fig 8 b from 1993 to 2005 most years have a positive spi index the main reason being the almost constant gws from 2005 to 2017 most years have a negative spi which is the main reason for the annual decline in gws the lowest spi value is for 2017 and the highest spi value is for 1995 full compatibility is observed between gws and spi changes 5 discussion and conclusion improper water management in iran has caused most of its plains to face the problem of subsidence proper monitoring of this phenomenon along with its causes can be very effective in making the right decision in this study subsidence gws and pw of eij plain were studied the subsidence of the region reaches 16 cm year and pw has recorded a decrease of 1 91 m year ekf was able to successfully reconstruct the attenuated grace signal so that the correlation with pw and insar sensors reached 0 81 the gws decreasing linear trend is 0 263 gigaton year detected periods with continuous wavelet transform are well compatible with insar and grace gws is fully compatible with spi so in years of low precipitation the rate of gws decreases simultaneous use of spi and gws can separate the human role and nature in gws periods detected by time frequency analysis in both insar and grace are well compatible the study of the subsidence phenomenon and gws with several sensors provides a comprehensive view so that the impact on each other can be examined subsidence is one of the hazards of the earth that starts slowly and creepily with the accumulation of sediments due to the emptying of groundwater aquifers and subsurface falls or with the emptying of fossil aquifers destroying the sediment roof into the underground cavities the phenomenon of subsidence should be considered as one of the important risks and crises in iran and long term and short term solutions should be considered for it eij plain is located in the place of sinkholes and fissures between mountains of limestone formation after uncontrolled groundwater extraction the plain surface subsides or a sinkhole is formed due to the calmness of this event surface effects due to subsidence or sinkhole usually appear on the ground and indicate the existence of danger in the area of eij plain effects such as long wide and deep fissures have appeared on the slopes of mountains and plains and even smaller fissures and deep fissures have been seen in the area of the large eij slope in the eastern parts of the eij sinkhole long and numerous fissures have been created and in the northern part small depressions and long deep crevices have been created most of these small fissures are related to previous years a distinction must be made between subsidence which occurs over a relatively large area and sinkhole where cavities are circular and relatively deep but with a small radius subsidence occurs due to high exploitation of groundwater by wells and subsidence or sinkhole of the ground surface for various reasons on a large scale sinkholes often are occurred in carbonate rocks including limestone and gypsum and are difficult to identify because they are not visible the occurrence of sinkholes requires the roof to collapse an underground cavity and is visible on the ground while in the phenomenon of subsidence a land the size of a plain may be involved and its effects are not visible the closer the structures are to these areas are more vulnerable cracks in buildings damage to roads and bridges but the most important damage to subsidence is that water permeability is lost if the precipitation increases tens of times it will not be able to penetrate the inner layers of the earth therefore runoff is formed on the ground that carries soil nutrients as a result it turns fertile plains into barren deserts the only way to prevent subsidence and manage this crisis in the first place is to reduce groundwater abstraction dig wells and of course artificial nutrition inject water into aquifers change the cultivation pattern and create sustainable agriculture periods of different drought index can be studied with wavelet but due to the relevance of precipitation with the studied sensors a similar period behavior is expected for future work groundwater recharge can be assessed by changes in the earth s crust which grace and insar can be performed the evolution of groundwater recharge rate can be very useful in iran to monitor the rate of earth crust changes also near real time monitoring of groundwater and earth crust changes can be effective in water resource management decisions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

which has a diameter of about 20 m and a depth of 80 m this sinkhole is located in the southwest of eij city and south of estahban city in fars province this is a kind of collapse sinkhole ls has also affected infrastructure and the situation has become more critical due to precipitation softening and wetting of the soil the sinking of the eij area is getting bigger which will be evident in 2020 the lands around the neighboring village of sinkhole have been cracked and if it reaches people s houses the place must be completely evacuated irregular water withdrawals in recent years in this area have intensified the phenomenon of dissolution and eventually the creation of subsidence in this area due to the ls of the plain surface the sloping parts have formed long and deep gaps in the margin of the plain due to the difference in the subsidence rate these ls have not occurred suddenly but gradually and have become wider and deeper in recent times 3 materials and methods 3 1 extended kalman filter ekf the ekf is used in the case of dynamic equations and nonlinear observations after linearizing the equations and using the taylor expansion to approximate the shape of the predicted and synchronized equations becomes very similar to what is available in the standard filter this special mode filter is more linearized than the kalman filter crassides and junkins 2012 this method uses a derivative of nonlinear dynamics equations and observations to run and apply this filter it is necessary to know the initial values of the state vector and its weight if these values are known and the problem modeling is correct the filter will converge and the state vector and its weight will tend to their true values boleiro ullman 2004 when dynamic modeling and observations are highly nonlinear this method is not able to provide a convergent and stable response due to the use of a first order derivative or a maximum second order derivative and a more robust and stable method should be used giss 2011 fig 2 shows the ekf flowchart used in this study process noise is caused by uncertainty in the mathematical modeling of the system the function differs from the real and practical model of the system this difference will be modeled in the noise process noise measurement and process are often modeled as gaussian processes with a covariance matrix statistical analysis of sensors can be used to determine the measurement covariance matrix but due to the variety and complexity of nonlinear systems there is no specific algorithm for determining the process noise covariance matrix and in practice it is often set by trial and error it is assumed that all system information is available up to sample k 1 in this case based on the mathematical model of the system and the signals available up to time k 1 an initial estimate of the state variables in the sample k is calculated this step of the ekf is the prediction process at time k a new measurement is made by the sensors in the second step of the ekf called the update phase the prediction is made in the first step is improved based on the new data available to obtain the final estimation states in sample k 4 scenarios are designed the specifications of which are given in table 1 moving average filter length and lookback window length for covariance estimation have been changed in different scenarios to evaluate the best scenario 3 2 continues wavelet transform cwt unlike fourier transform cwt can also be used for non static signals and dynamic systems fourier transform deficiencies in the analysis of signals with non stationary properties have led to the presentation of frequency time analysis sorkhabi et al 2021a although cwt can provide information about the frequency and time of a particular event in the signal but is limited by the use of fixed size windows this problem was solved by providing wavelet transform wavelet transform is window or place analysis on a variable scale the term wavelet means small wave meaning the window function has a finite length the output of the wavelet transforms on a one dimensional signal results in a two dimensional spectrogram this spectrogram can provide detailed information about the system state space or in other words information about dynamic behavior sorkhabi et al 2021b in this study subsidence time series gws and piezometric wells in the time frequency domain with continuous wavelet transform have been investigated to discuss differences and similarities 3 3 gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on grace fo the grace satellite measures the displacement of water on the earth surface over time mohamed and gonçalvès 2021 sorkhabi et al 2021b using hydrological models it is possible to understand groundwater changes from total water storage deep et al 2021 in this study jpl grace satellite data from 2002 to 2017 and grace fo from 2018 to 2021 were used by combining the global land data assimilation system gldas model to obtain gws taha et al 2021 the process of sarkar et al 2020 has been applied to achieve gws grace observations have the problem of spectral leakage and noise for this purpose the ekf algorithm has been used to reconstruct the gws signal 3 4 interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar in radar interferometry the amount of ground displacement is calculated through the phase difference of the two images after preparing the interferometers and making various corrections on them considering that each interferometer contains a large area with different correlations the results are not reliable for this reason the alone interferometer of radar pair images cannot show the displacement dong et al 2014 to solve the problem various methods have been proposed one of which is the small baseline subset time series sbas in this method only pairs of images are used whose vertical component of the baseline is less than the critical value of the baseline and also their baseline time is minimal at the same time tizzani et al 2007 in this way only interferometers of good quality are formed after forming these interferometers a network of images is created then the displacement amount of each pixel is estimated using the least squares method in this study sentinel 1 images from 2014 to 2020 were used to estimate eij subsidence from 100 radar images and the sbas method the subsidence time series and average annual subsidence are evaluated 3 5 piezometric well pw in this study pw has been used to estimate the rate of groundwater reduction from 1997 to 2015 pw can measure the level of groundwater which can determine the amount of nutrition and consumption first the data is refined based on the normality test and blunders are removed from the time series in the next step the resulting time series is compared with other sensors 4 results 4 scenarios were designed for grace signal reconstruction fig 3 shows the different scenarios of grace signal reconstruction with ekf in all scenarios a decreasing trend is observed with annual and semi annual periods but their amplitude is different scenario 1 has the most differences with grace observations and the least differences with scenario 4 as the lookback window length for covariance estimation increases the difference increases the best moving average filter length of 5 is evaluated the gws grace time series reconstructed with ekf with scenario 4 is shown in fig 4 a mainly annual and semi annual periods related to precipitation the estimated linear trend shows 1 21 cm year gws time series from 2002 to 2010 has no decreasing trend and starts decreasing trend after 2010 after the torrential rains of march 2019 in shiraz no decreasing trend is observed from 2019 to 2020 gws has a decreasing linear trend of 0 263 gigaton year fig 4 b shows the pw observations of the eij city from 1997 to 2015 a decrease of 27 m is observed from 1997 to 2003 an increase of 10 m is observed from 2003 to late 2005 from 2006 to 2015 a decrease of about 15 m is evaluated the linear trend of pw observations is 1 9 m year the sampling rate of pw has been done in different intervals from monthly to yearly in some years sampling is regular and monthly and seasonal changes are observed and in some years sampling is irregular for this reason pw shows low correlation with other sensors 100 radar images from 2014 to 2020 were processed using snap software fig 5 shows a average annual subsidence and b the subsidence time series of the study area the average annual subsidence in the southwest reaches 16 cm which is the highest value these are mainly agricultural areas other subsidence areas 1 up to 8 cm year is observed in the southeastern regions of eij the sinkhole zone has 8 cm year subsidence the linear trend of the subsidence time series is estimated to be 8 cm year it can be caused by groundwater extraction the correlation matrix of the sensors has been analyzed with different scenarios fig 6 shows the correlation matrix of sensors with different scenarios that have been used for validation the average correlation of sensors with the first second third and fourth scenarios is 0 67 0 69 0 74 and 0 81 respectively the subsidence correlation with the first second third and fourth scenarios is 0 62 0 68 0 72 and 0 84 respectively pw correlation with the first second third and fourth scenarios is 0 57 0 58 0 69 and 0 76 respectively the highest correlation is related to scenario 4 and the lowest to scenario 1 for this purpose scenario 4 has been selected due to more accurate reconstruction the subsidence correlation with pw is 0 83 to determine insar grace and pw periods continuous wavelet transform is used which are shown in fig 7 a to c respectively the purpose of wavelet analysis is to check periods and the compatibility of different sensors wavelet transform offers time frequency analysis and observation periods of different sensors can be compared in insar and grace outputs a 1 year period is detected in the observed time insar outputs are estimated to be 0 5 year periods after 2011 grace outputs detect periods of 0 5 years or less after 2008 also 2 year and 3 year periods are detected throughout the observation period pw outputs from 1993 to 2007 revealed a period of about 3 years detected periods insar and grace are well compatible but the period of about 3 years pw is compatible with grace fig 8 b shows precipitation and evaporation time series the long term average precipitation from 1992 to 2017 is 237 mm the amount of precipitation in some years is higher than 237 mm but in most years it is lower than the long term average also the amount of evaporation is more than 200 mm in most years to further investigate the drought index it has been calculated the standardized precipitation index spi time series is calculated for further investigation as shown in fig 8 b from 1993 to 2005 most years have a positive spi index the main reason being the almost constant gws from 2005 to 2017 most years have a negative spi which is the main reason for the annual decline in gws the lowest spi value is for 2017 and the highest spi value is for 1995 full compatibility is observed between gws and spi changes 5 discussion and conclusion improper water management in iran has caused most of its plains to face the problem of subsidence proper monitoring of this phenomenon along with its causes can be very effective in making the right decision in this study subsidence gws and pw of eij plain were studied the subsidence of the region reaches 16 cm year and pw has recorded a decrease of 1 91 m year ekf was able to successfully reconstruct the attenuated grace signal so that the correlation with pw and insar sensors reached 0 81 the gws decreasing linear trend is 0 263 gigaton year detected periods with continuous wavelet transform are well compatible with insar and grace gws is fully compatible with spi so in years of low precipitation the rate of gws decreases simultaneous use of spi and gws can separate the human role and nature in gws periods detected by time frequency analysis in both insar and grace are well compatible the study of the subsidence phenomenon and gws with several sensors provides a comprehensive view so that the impact on each other can be examined subsidence is one of the hazards of the earth that starts slowly and creepily with the accumulation of sediments due to the emptying of groundwater aquifers and subsurface falls or with the emptying of fossil aquifers destroying the sediment roof into the underground cavities the phenomenon of subsidence should be considered as one of the important risks and crises in iran and long term and short term solutions should be considered for it eij plain is located in the place of sinkholes and fissures between mountains of limestone formation after uncontrolled groundwater extraction the plain surface subsides or a sinkhole is formed due to the calmness of this event surface effects due to subsidence or sinkhole usually appear on the ground and indicate the existence of danger in the area of eij plain effects such as long wide and deep fissures have appeared on the slopes of mountains and plains and even smaller fissures and deep fissures have been seen in the area of the large eij slope in the eastern parts of the eij sinkhole long and numerous fissures have been created and in the northern part small depressions and long deep crevices have been created most of these small fissures are related to previous years a distinction must be made between subsidence which occurs over a relatively large area and sinkhole where cavities are circular and relatively deep but with a small radius subsidence occurs due to high exploitation of groundwater by wells and subsidence or sinkhole of the ground surface for various reasons on a large scale sinkholes often are occurred in carbonate rocks including limestone and gypsum and are difficult to identify because they are not visible the occurrence of sinkholes requires the roof to collapse an underground cavity and is visible on the ground while in the phenomenon of subsidence a land the size of a plain may be involved and its effects are not visible the closer the structures are to these areas are more vulnerable cracks in buildings damage to roads and bridges but the most important damage to subsidence is that water permeability is lost if the precipitation increases tens of times it will not be able to penetrate the inner layers of the earth therefore runoff is formed on the ground that carries soil nutrients as a result it turns fertile plains into barren deserts the only way to prevent subsidence and manage this crisis in the first place is to reduce groundwater abstraction dig wells and of course artificial nutrition inject water into aquifers change the cultivation pattern and create sustainable agriculture periods of different drought index can be studied with wavelet but due to the relevance of precipitation with the studied sensors a similar period behavior is expected for future work groundwater recharge can be assessed by changes in the earth s crust which grace and insar can be performed the evolution of groundwater recharge rate can be very useful in iran to monitor the rate of earth crust changes also near real time monitoring of groundwater and earth crust changes can be effective in water resource management decisions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11782,energy crises caused some secondary challenges in the field of water and food as well its inherent catastrophes in the nexuses of water and energy supplying the power for desalination and water treatment process is assumed as an important subject in scientific communities while in sunny arid and semi arid climates zahedan iran the application of solar irradiances can convert threats into

image 1 keywords desalination reverse osmosis photovoltaic simulation machine learning computations statistical optimization data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction and literature review access to clean water is known as a basic human right by united nations un and an inadequate supply of clean water could have devastating effects on society and human beings gheibi et al 2019 2022 nowadays water scarcity is one of the most crucial global problems and this is expected to become more acute due to population growth and climate changes monteiro et al 2020 more than 97 of the water on earth is located in oceans as salt water and in most parts of the world which face water scarcity saltwater is available in large quantities thakkar et al 2020 therefore the importance of developing and optimizing water desalination systems is increasing every day the scientific community and industry have developed several methods for each of them has its advantages and disadvantages in the following table 1 lists the most important technologies for water desalination water desalination technologies require an intensive amount of energy for example in saudi arabia approximately half of the domestic oil production is being used for water desalination denicola et al 2015 globally fossil fuels are the main energy source for water desalination however in recent years the advancement in solar panel technology made photovoltaic pv systems a promising technology for water desalination energy supply also the increasing threatening effects of climate change in recent years have made pv supply desalination systems one of the hottest scientific topics in desalination for instance some studies have focused on conceptual terms like the feasibility studies of applying green energies for desalination dévora isiordia et al 2022 some other experts illustrated the importance of desalination to the future of human civilization regarding the water and energy crisis chenoweth and al masri 2022 identifying the role of policymaking on the water economy and the technological models is the other significant part of the relevant studies tarazona romero et al 2022 in this study we performed a bibliometric analysis using scopus database with the help of an r based package named bibliometrix aria and cuccurullo 2017 as depicted in fig s1 desalination is by far the most repetitive field research to date followed by reverse osmosis ro solar energy and solar energy generation finally it is noteworthy that iran is one of the countries facing water scarcity and according to several studies most parts of iran are located in high stress regions smakhtin 2004 rezaei kalvani et al 2019 jafari shalamzari and zhang 2018 therefore the current issue is indispensable for iran and has attracted academic attention worldwide especially in the recent decade as portrayed in fig s2 water desalination methods are used to separate salt from saline water to make it suitable for drinking and agriculture as mentioned earlier in table 1 scientists have worked on several methods for water desalination like thermal technologies kharroubi et al 2022 membrane naidu et al 2020 electrodialysis al amshawee et al 2020 crystallization frigidity wu et al 2020 and conventional distillation rostamzadeh et al 2020 although membrane desalination is more popular than other methods for industrial purposes due to its high efficiency recovery ability ease of maintenance and low depreciation rajakumaran et al 2020 these advantages made ro the leading technology in water desalination so in 2019 ro technology accounted for 69 of total water desalination capacity in the world jones et al 2019 as demonstrated in the literature review the current subject became popular recently for instance hughes et al 2014 tested a combination of membrane desalination and photovoltaic pv thermal energy on a laboratory scale at heriot watt university in edinburgh united kingdom grubert et al 2014 stated that the energy requirement for surface water and seawater treatment equals 0 06 kwhm 3 and 3 5 4 5 kwhm 3 respectively latorre et al 2015 explained the unpredictability of costs availability of fossil fuels and energy consumption by using renewable energy for desalination novosel et al 2015 utilized an integrated pv wind energy system for desalination facilities within jordan as a case study mentis et al 2016 appraised renewable energy desalination plants in the south aegean islands with pv wind hybrid power systems and grid electricity to provide the energy expenses caldera et al 2016 estimated the global renewable energy demand for water preparation until 2030 compared to fossil fuel demand in more recent studies zhang et al 2018 reviewed all usages of solar energy in water treatment technologies and focused on commercialization aspects of the joined solar system with water decontamination methods also al hrari et al 2020 analyzed the efficiency of pv and thermal hybrid systems with a membrane desalination plant to recognize the amount of energy consumed and water produced esmaeilion et al 2021 performed a feasibility study on using renewable energy for water desalination in arid and semi arid areas of iran kaczmarczyk et al 2022 developed a model for membrane water desalination using geothermal water and energy resources it is noteworthy that machine learning ml is also utilized in a few studies to power the desalination process priya et al 2022 in the industries the applications of membrane based system are developed because of their efficiency and ease of operation giwa et al 2017 politano et al 2016 meanwhile the mentioned systems have considerable investment and operation costs during desalination gharsallah et al 2022 petrosino et al 2021 with the extension of simulation and modelling tools in the field of desalination process francesco et al 2021 petrosino et al 2022 some ideas are expressed due to the reduction of membrane based desalination systems such as green membrane applications green energy supplying and carbon prevention strategies in industrial facilities coppola et al 2021 dasgupta et al 2015a b aloulou et al 2022 the present study also follows the same policy to increase environmental compatibility the mentioned studies and several more articles revealed optimizing pv ro desalination system with an integrated ml response surface methodology rsm is a novel method to be more specific other investigations analyze one or two aspects but the current study attempted to take a holistic approach that not only includes technical aspects but also embraces the sdgs goals this study aims to 1 design a conceptual model for pv applications in a combination of ro desalination equipment based on implementation and operational aspects 2 pv simulation by pvsyst platform with the application of integrated ml rsm as an optimization computation 3 economic e and environmental en evaluation of solar energy harvesting in the case study for determination of cost functions 4 presentation of managerial insights with focus

system for renewable energy supplying in groundwater desalination which meets the affordable and clean energy goals for sustainable development creating the sustainable nexus between water and energy with consideration to desalination efficiency enhancement which satisfies the clean water and sanitation goal the application of machine learning computations in the smart management of renewable energy supplying in the desalination process which mentions the sustainable cities and communities goal utilizing the rsm method for renewable energy improvement in the process which is related to the industry innovation and infrastructure section of sustainable development goals in the following section 2 expresses the experimental and computational aspects tools and instruments and presents the case study then the outcomes of this study with a comparison of other similar investigations are argued in section 3 section 4 presents managerial insights and finally the main achievement alongside the suggestions for future studies are conveyed in section 5 2 materials and methods this investigation studies the capacity of solar energy for desalination the biggest challenge here is creating a comprehensive framework that utilizes different equipment to work efficiently shahsavar et al 2021 salehi amiri et al 2022 this study employed pvsyst to simulate the region strength in electricity production and then investigated the most optimum condition of solar panels the next step is using ml to identify different parameters roles and predict various situations finally when the big picture is portrayed it is time to build the framework with managerial insights and instructions for decision makers chouhan et al 2022 the conceptual roadmap of this study is illustrated in fig s3 2 1 case study in this paper a ro desalination system for kalile village 20 km west of zahedan sistan and balochestan province iran is designed with a capacity of 1000 m 3 day 1 a well near the village supplies the water for this system according to the literature review water consumption in iran is considered 250 l day 1 per capita nuñez von voigt and mohajeri 2013 madani et al 2016 based on this assumption this system can provide fresh water for 4000 people daily for measuring well water quality samples were taken four times a year and tests were performed with agilent inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms which reported a fixed range of pollutants for all tests different parameters have impacted the quality of groundwater resources such as geo specifications water level supplier source type of soil and drainage layer depth the case study has three main water wells with different tds levels of 575 mg l 1815 mg l and 1235 mg l fig s4 however local water managers of the case study decided to desalinate only one well with the least tds and diluted other resources with desalinated water to reduce the clogging of the membranes optimize the operating costs and to increase the life of the facilities with consideration to eq 1 it can be found that before desalination the mean tds is equal to 930 mg l and after the desalination process with 92 efficiency percentage the tds of the target well reduced to 46 mg l and the mean tds reached to 589 mg l which acceptable amount for drinking water it should be mentioned that the well with the least tds 575 mg l has a high mg ion concentration according to iran s 1053 drinking water quality standard the desirable value of mg ion is equal to 30 mg l therefore the amount of mg ion in the mentioned well is almost three times higher 100 mg l than the desirable value 30 mg l isiri 2009 therefore the case study s water quality is unacceptable in all aspects and should be purified eq 1 t d s t o t a l i 1 3

quality and soluble materials in the most critical conditions which was the basis for the ro system design 2 2 conceptual model of energy harvesting as mentioned the system s main purpose is to provide drinking water but the hot issue is the region s energy crisis therefore considering the situation of the case study this study founds the solution in solar energy utilization nevertheless proposing a practical framework requires proper equipment and comprehensive technical answers as depicted in fig s5 fig s 6proposed the conceptual model for energy harvesting in this region as shown in this figure this study designed an interactive platform for pv ro simulation designed with artificial intelligence ai and design of experiment doe methods to act efficiently be smart and be updated with the changes in the situation 2 3 water desalination system and energy demand the water treatment systems are designed based on the influent water analysis and the desired output water quality in three stages the pre treatment the treatment system and the post treatment system dasgupta et al 2015a b liu et al 2013 nath et al 2014 in the pre treatment section of the present case study equipment including a pumping station sand filter carbon filter and cartridge have been used to improve turbidity color odor taste and the quality of water chakraborty et al 2012 politano et al 2017 the main treatment system of the case study is a ro system in this system the pump transfers the inlet water into pressure vessels containing membranes and the freshwater are discharged from two different outlets das et al 2016 bhattacharjee et al 2015 the post treatment unit is equipped with a chlorination unit to prevent algae growth and control water pollution elimelech and phillip 2011 giwa et al 2017 nag et al 2007 fig 1 shows the flowchart of the treatment process and the equipment used to design and build the ro treatment system is described in table 3 moreover the amount of electricity consumed in this system according to the formal company datasheet of each piece of equipment is shown in table 4 in total considering the 15 safety factor 91 3 kw electricity is required to set up the treatment system 2 4 optimization by rsm the rsm method investigates the relationships between variables and responses with consideration to sensitive analysis analysis of variance and response optimization according to effective parameters eftekhari et al 2018 2020 also this system evaluates the normality of the statistical distribution of results in order to obtain optimal operating conditions five parameters including tilt t degree cross distance cd m pitch p m panel capacity pc watt and baseline b degree were considered in design expert 7 0 0 software it is noteworthy that the authors chose these parameters by reviewing literature and estimated the limitation of each parameter by pvsyst software schuster 2020 siregar and hutahuruk 2020 to consider the economical technical and environmental aspects of the proposed system this study suggested four objective functions including produced energy mwh yr carbon emission prevention 25 years ton initial cost eur and maintenance cost for each year eur da silva et al 2018 the optimization process in the present study aimed to satisfy all four functions together and create an optimum system luo et al 2021 akbarpour et al 2021 the selected parameters are shown in fig s7 and the limits of each one is listed in table 5 as shown in the mentioned figure all the parameters are dependent on each other and changing one influences the others the relation between parameters is thoroughly discussed in the next section 2 5 simulation system meteo software was used for extracting the data required data for solar simulation which contains the solar potential of the area geographical condition of the region and other parameters like wind it is also noteworthy that the project is modeled by the meteonorm 7 2 the used models are set at perez 29 1 unlimited load and 100 for transposition average height user s need and electrical effect in order the pv array loss factors related parameters for thermal loss factor are uc const equal to 20 w m 2 k and uv wind equal to 0 0 w m 2 k m s furthermore loss fractions for wiring ohmic module quality module mismatch and strings mismatch are 1 5 at stc 0 8 1 0 at mpp and 0 10 respectively it is noteworthy that the incidence effect iam is considered as fresnel ar coating n glass equal to 1 526 and n ar equal to 1 290 finally the region s solar potential is modeled by pvsyst with the data gathered from www suncalc org fig s 8 displays sun potential in the present study region and as it shows this area has a considerable capacity for producing energy based on the mentioned figure in the fixed 32 for the t there are seven peaks in sun energy gathering which happened on 22 jun 22 ma y to 23 jul 20 apr to 23 aug 20 mar to 23 sep 21 feb to 23 oct 19 jan to 22 nov and 22 dec the most important parameter here is the sun s height as it goes up the potential of energy producing increases as well 2 6 ml role in solar desalination the ml is performed in the present study to learn the process of establishing thorough solar desalination of water as well as identifying the importance of each parameter in the efficiency of performances this ml model is based on the mentioned simulations and can change hand in hand by the transformation of site features ghadami et al 2021a b in other words the role of ml reveals the other side of simulations to have a practical instrument for designing establishing and running the solar desalination system ghadami et al 2021a b the present study collected the corresponding data and randomly hold 10 20 of them for testing purposes while train the model with the rest four methods including gaussian processes multilayer perceptron support vector machine for regression smoreg and polynomial trees m5p are utilized in weka 3 9 software to identify each parameter role and predict the future situation based on different scenarios the defined role for ml is almost popular amongst experts and the chosen algorithms have proved their capability in similar cases yang and gueymard 2019 luo et al 2018 although the nature of performing these methods and their capabilities are discussed in the next section of the present study but table 6 is represented the settings which is used in creating the models corresponding to four objective functions 3 result and discussion as it mentioned before there are four objective functions which are supposed to satisfy the optimum situation as precise as possible all together the summary of these models is depicted in table 7 the output of design expert 7 0 0 software based on the results almost all the sources including linear 2fi quadratic and cubic have significant performance regarding the high r squared although quadratic produced the most accurate models overall it is also noteworthy that linear sources are not recommended for the rest of the functions except for maintenance function after identifying suitable sources and comparing the results one indispensable point should be noted the low scores of the predicted r squared compared to r squared this observation leads to this conclusion that despite the ability of these sources to build solid functions there is no reliable capacity to predict different results in various situation it reveals the need of evaluation to the ml and artificial intelligence more and more the experts already touch on the importance of the current finding alzu bi et al 2019 wang et al 2021 although finding a practical instrument is not easy the equations which make the objective functions are depicted in eqs 2 5 at first look it is obvious that initial cost and annual maintenance have shorter formulas than the others moreover to realize the logic of generating these functions it is useful to investigate table 8 which illustrates the anova and reveals the f and p value of used parameters based on the anova results all four objective functions are significant due to the low p value which is negligible however the achieved formulas are different for prediction of the 4 cost functions based on similar effective factors for instance the p is the most significant parameter in the produced energy and carbon emission prevention functions in contrast cd p and pc are effective in the initial cost function the other interesting point about this function is that the t and b are almost alien to the other parameters finally pc plays the first role in annual maintenance costs based on the p value it should be noted that the anova is calculated based on the quadratic model eq 2 p r o d u c e d e n e r g

follow normal probability or not this quality is rooted in need for behavior prediction which is valuable in the managerial area gmar et al 2017 shahsavar et al 2022 fig s9 a d illustrated the normal plots of produced energy carbon emission prevention initial and maintenance costs for each year fig s9 a reveals that produced energy fairly follows the normal plot while the points colored based on the values of produced energy are distributed on the normal plot fig s9 b also demonstrates the normal behavior of carbon emission prevention the only significant difference between these two plots is related to the color points which is reasonable due to the distinguished nature of the functions fig s9 c showed a plot with some points on the normal line but has not followed the normal overall and finally fig s9 d created an optimum condition by going up and down vertically over the normal line and not being horizontally placed around the line in the end it is fair to say that produced energy and carbon emission prevention followed the normal plot but the initial cost and annual maintenance are not categorized in the same group as mentioned before in anova calculation and table 8 the role and influence of the parameters are not the same on the generation of the function although the numbers of p values could show the importance of each parameter in internal interactions having a visual frame of reference is helpful fig 2 a d are investigated to show a glimpse of the weight of technical parameters on the four presented functions fig 2 a shows the fluctuations of the produced energy due to the p and t the diagram perfectly demonstrates how the p can change the produced energy for different amounts fig 2 b also has similar conditions and carbon emission prevention significantly reacts to p changes this observation makes sense because in p value calculations the p was negligible in both produced energy and carbon emission prevention functions fig 2 c is related to the initial cost based on the pc and cd changes in the slope of the diagram in fig 2 c revealed that except for t and b parameters all the other parameters were negligible which means cd p and pc highly influence the initial cost fig 2 d is assigned to the maintenance cost which has an exaggerated response to the changes of pc it could be said that annual maintenance cost has an optimum number which occurred in the pc watt of 335 00 and 375 00 it should be noted that functions are optimized based on their nature in other words parameters should be set up to minimize produced energy and carbon emission prevention and minimize cost related functions table 9 is presented the solutions that create the optimized condition for solar panels it should be noted that these proposed limits are chosen to optimize all four functions together as shown in the mentioned table all ten proposed solutions have above 97 desirability although the first solution created the most score with 0 978 based on the first solution t is assumed to be 15 02 degree cd suggested 0 61 m and the other parameters including p pc and b are set at 2 31 m 380 95 watt and 4 49 degree respectively with utilizing these settings produced energy is estimated at 146 mwh yr carbon emission prevention for every 25 years is 1548 19 ton and the initial cost for this power station is 27713 2 eur while the annual maintenance is 1657 42 eur fig s10 also portrayed the desirability of four functions with t and cd as the main parameters the slope of the diagram in this fig and the corresponding changes due to the different values of the parameters is a good example of the influence of parameters on desirability after optimization and sensitivity analysis the desirable solution was obtained and ready for pvsyst simulation more specifically optimum values were applied to pvsyst to simulate the solar power station for desalination this simulation is established in the ccd rsm and fig 3 represents the perspective of the layout of the panels in the optimized condition since the mentioned fig is just a schematic pic another trace is prepared and presented in fig s11 which is described the shading loss in the field maximum energy collecting is already discussed in fig s8 and sections 2 6 but fig s11 illustrates the energy loss due to the shading which ranges from 1 to 40 in five situations it could be concluded that 30 degree is the line that divides the sun s energy into two maximum and minimum situations maximum situations have seven significant points already described and minimum situations contain five considerable points specified in fig s11 fig 4 presents the total performance of the designed solar power station for desalination purposes in a year fig 4 a is the normalized productions and fig 4 b is the performance ratio as shown in fig 4 a there are two major losses collection and system loss the collection loss is considerably larger than system loss which could be interpreted as the system s desirable efficiency this observation means solar panels work efficiently if the sun is at the seven maximum points investigating on fig 4 b shows the stable performance of the solar panels slightly drops in jan nov and dec fig 5 presents the daily behavior of the panels and the ratio of the energy produced to the received energy the desirability of the system is simply proven by the normal behavior depicted in the mentioned fig based on the nominal specifications the total energy consumption of the treatment system is equal to 91 30 kw which is already described in table 4 this proposed treatment plant should work 8 h a day and be at service 200 days a year and the local water sources can supply the remaining water demand the extra amount of produced energy is in the hand of decision makers to put the region on the rail for sdgs moreover this amount of environmentally friendly energy based on the zero carbon policy concept is precious wealth for this region nejatian et al 2022 the more conceptual parts are discussed under the managerial insights term in the next section as depicted in fig s12 the system produced 145 9 142 4 and 141 4 mwh annually which means there is 2 7 mwh tolerance on the other hand based on fig s13 as the system works the co2 emission decreases in a linear behavior considerably the irradiance generation process is done based on some stochastic feature in nature therefore solar energy generation is expressed by possible functions bykov et al 2018 while well established random algorithms can justify global irradiation based on statistical distributions mermoud and wittmer 2014 in the declared progress firstly a daily databank is built by the application of library of markov transition matrices probability matrices and meteo hourly data in the next step an autoregressive gaussian model has created per time fluctuations for predicting harvested solar energy based on possibilities considering fig s12 it is clear that the basis of design and solar energy production is built on the highest probability ideal conditions equivalent to p50 145922 kwh with a probability of 0 4 this gaussian distribution demonstrates that annually the highest frequency of solar energy production as probable random event is equal to 145922 kwh which is the basis of the simulation procedure according to fig s13 the carbon emission prevention is computed as per life cycle emissions lce method mermoud and wittmer 2014 as per the difference in carbon emissions from the cycle of fossil fuel based power grid system c1 and pv technology c2 when c2 c1 carbon emission prevention is met and renewable energy resource can satisfy its prophecy the carbon emission prevention is related to four features include efficiency of plant with consideration to 1 degradation in each year life time of operation gco2 kwh for fossil fuel based energy resource and gco2 kwh pv system sharma et al 2018 in the present research based on international panel on climate change ipcc 46gco2 kwh is considered as a default of pv systems as per 25 year life time of pv system in the present project 1500 ton co2 is prevented by the implementation of pv system in couple of ro facilities artificial intelligence and ml algorithms are performed in the current study to investigate the relation between parameters and future forecasting according to the detailed distribution of cost functions based on changes in effective parameters it is clear that the process of ml is complicated investigating the density of data represented in fig 6 a and b depicted the difficulty of ml application the other experts already mention this challenge kumar et al 2017 rathore et al 2021 the proposed solution here is establishing solid calculation with the help of high performance software weka with the settings presented in table 6 table 10 contains the complete scores for different model evaluation parameters corresponding to four objective functions as depicted in table 10 for both objective functions including carbon emission prevention and energy producing the best ml method is gaussian processes which showed the best scores among the other three methods the correlation coefficient of the gaussian process for carbon emission prevention and energy producing is calculated at 0 989 and 0 988 respectively it goes with the last observation on fig s9 a and b which presented the behavior of these two functions much similarly it means two functions have a similar nature and both gave their best response to a particular ml method gaussian process the other experts specified the capability of this algorithm kanuri et al 2022 and this study also revealed this algorithm has good performance for this means the other two functions which are cost related including the initial cost for establishing a solar panel for water desalination and maintenance costs are best fitted with the m5p method this algorithm s correlation coefficient for both functions is 0 99 which puts high stress on this statement that ml can predict different situations based on various scenarios moreover amongst all the ml methods for four functions there is no correlation coefficient under 0 70 the presented methods all have a desirable performance to utilize in future studies 4 managerial insights and sdgs assessment nowadays with the intensification of climate change and increasing its aspects on human life sustainable use of resources has become a crucial issue amiri et al 2020 one of the low hanging fruits of resource management is optimizing the infrastructures by using different approaches including ai metaheuristic and heuristic algorithms and other mathematical methods golmohamadi et al 2017 hajiaghaei keshteli and sajadifar 2010 gholian jouybari et al 2016 therefore using these techniques to optimize the infrastructures aligns with different global goals and standards liao et al 2020 sdgs assessments have been used in this study to investigate the impact of the implementation of a smart pv ro system on the 17 sdgs akbarian et al 2022 hajiaghaei keshteli et al 2011 as illustrated in fig 7 using renewable energies for water desalination meets the sdgs numbers 1 5 3 9 3 4 6 2 6 a 6 3 7 b 7 2 7 1 9 1 9 4 11 3 and 13 1 by harvesting green energy and using it for ro of groundwater das et al 2022 shahzad et al 2022 the main problem related to water desalination methods is their high energy consumption therefore considering fossil fuels as the world s main energy source water desalination methods are not in line with the sustainable development goals sdgs thus the study on the application of renewable energy for water desalination has increased in recent years shatat et al 2013 he et al 2022 the present study proposed a solar water desalination system based on the mentioned findings it can desalinate water and offer the region s decision makers extra energy this section of the study is dedicated to managerial insights which contains reviews and managerial advice to policymakers and local government organizations the main purpose of the presented study here is to give an instrument to receive the region s high potential and turn it into the equipment for improving local people s lives and well being and also the environment fig s14 points out the importance of the subject and as it showed studies on this area started with three main terms ro photovoltaic system and solar power experts spent considerable efforts in desalination solar energy and solar power generation as it went by the significant importance of the mentioned subjects is the increasing need for freshwater and green energy the other bold observation here is the change of technical desalination process into green energy provider it got more highlighted when the small green circle emerged on the top left of fig s14 based on the current fig most modern topics are eager to find renewable energy resources that could desalinate water with the ro method shalaby et al 2022 bonny et al 2022 sitterley et al 2022 this is a valuable finding for decision makers and moving into solar desalination is the starting edge of the new era for both energy producing and drinking water providing fig s15 is also another proof of the last statement fig s15 also reveals this study worked on a modern dynamic subject that constantly moves to maturity the present study investigated kalile village 20 km west of zahedan sistan and balochestan province iran fig s16 shows an infographic picture of the countries that are working and collaborating in water desalination with solar power to identify the situation of iran in the current subject based on this fig iran is among the countries that worked on this subject which shows the importance of this study nevertheless research on this subject in iran has no strong tie to the other countries studies talaeipour et al 2018 to handle this issue and present a comprehensive framework illustrated in fig 8 the concept in the mentioned fig is straightforward and practical the work path is almost similar to the procedure of this study it means a solar water desalination plant is supposed to be established in a suitable location with enough solar power and water this location identifies not only by field studies but also with the help of literature review and receiving advice from countries with similar experiences the next step is investigating desalination methods compatible with the chosen location s requirements through this step we could also use the experts findings and the interaction between multinational companies and organizations in the next move there is a need for brainstorming meetings between local and federal decision makers to create the foundation of the plant moreover employing artificial intelligence could help identify hidden aspects and help to reveal the patterns sadeghi moghaddam et al 2019 also ml empowers the process by creating the ability to predict different outcomes based on various scenarios cheraghalipour et al 2017 finally the plant is ready to build and extra energy is available for sdgs purposes of the region it is also noteworthy that a tight interaction in each step creates a solid dynamic chain the main limitations of the present research are lack of field evaluation of solar energy availability for comparison with simulation outputs lack of enough data for evaluation of climate change effect on the created system 5 conclusion with the increasing problems of water and energy as well as the correlation of these two issues many scientists and managers are trying to create the infrastructure of renewable energy resources in order to solve the challenges of water crisis in this study an integrated approach is presented to create water supply infrastructure using pvsyst simulation tools and make the system intelligent with the application of integrated ccd rsm and machine learning computations the present research s main novelty is the execution of smart sustainable optimization and planning framework for the desalination of saline water resources in the arid areas of developing countries by integrating machine learning and statistical computations with the implementation of the mentioned photovoltaic system carbon emission is reduced by 1400 tons 25yr also through the optimization procedure rsm outcomes demonstrated that in the optimal conditions of different parameters including tilt cross distance panel capacity and baseline the harvested energy could be 146 mwh yr furthermore the gaussian process algorithm with a 0 98 correlation coefficient has the most efficiency for smart prediction of the outcomes of the system including energy production and carbon emission prevention according to sensitive analysis and statistical evaluations based on both energy production and prevention carbon emission 25 year functions the most important effect is related to pitch degree likewise considering investment and maintenance costs the most significant factors are cd and pc for future studies the present research suggests the application of integrated machine learning and metaheuristic computations simultaneously as a decision support system for optimization and prediction also the simulation of pv systems in water treatment plants could be attractive to scientific communities declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

11782,energy crises caused some secondary challenges in the field of water and food as well its inherent catastrophes in the nexuses of water and energy supplying the power for desalination and water treatment process is assumed as an important subject in scientific communities while in sunny arid and semi arid climates zahedan iran the application of solar irradiances can convert threats into opportunities in the present research in the first step all operational features in photovoltaic facilities are optimized by central composition design ccd as a response surface methodology rsm method in the second step harvested renewable energy values carbon emission prevention initial cost and maintenance for each year are predicted as per operational factors of the photovoltaic system which are utilized in the desalination process and with the application of gaussian processes multilayer perceptron support vector machine for regression smoreg and polynomial trees m5p algorithms finally in the managerial insight section of the research an integrated reverse osmosis photovoltaic system is presented as a green facility of water providing in arid and semi arid climates based on rsm system the main effective factors for energy production prevention carbon emission 25 year initial and maintenance costs are pitch degree p p value 0 0001 pitch degree p value 0 0001 cross distance cd p

study both carbon emission values and cost functions are optimized while to the prediction of available solar energy gaussian process with more than 0 98 has the most efficiency graphical abstract image 1 keywords desalination reverse osmosis photovoltaic simulation machine learning computations statistical optimization data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction and literature review access to clean water is known as a basic human right by united nations un and an inadequate supply of clean water could have devastating effects on society and human beings gheibi et al 2019 2022 nowadays water scarcity is one of the most crucial global problems and this is expected to become more acute due to population growth and climate changes monteiro et al 2020 more than 97 of the water on earth is located in oceans as salt water and in most parts of the world which face water scarcity saltwater is available in large quantities thakkar et al 2020 therefore the importance of developing and optimizing water desalination systems is increasing every day the scientific community and industry have developed several methods for each of them has its advantages and disadvantages in the following table 1 lists the most important technologies for water desalination water desalination technologies require an intensive amount of energy for example in saudi arabia approximately half of the domestic oil production is being used for water desalination denicola et al 2015 globally fossil fuels are the main energy source for water desalination however in recent years the advancement in solar panel technology made photovoltaic pv systems a promising technology for water desalination energy supply also the increasing threatening effects of climate change in recent years have made pv supply desalination systems one of the hottest scientific topics in desalination for instance some studies have focused on conceptual terms like the feasibility studies of applying green energies for desalination dévora isiordia et al 2022 some other experts illustrated the importance of desalination to the future of human civilization regarding the water and energy crisis chenoweth and al masri 2022 identifying the role of policymaking on the water economy and the technological models is the other significant part of the relevant studies tarazona romero et al 2022 in this study we performed a bibliometric analysis using scopus database with the help of an r based package named bibliometrix aria and cuccurullo 2017 as depicted in fig s1 desalination is by far the most repetitive field research to date followed by reverse osmosis ro solar energy and solar energy generation finally it is noteworthy that iran is one of the countries facing water scarcity and according to several studies most parts of iran are located in high stress regions smakhtin 2004 rezaei kalvani et al 2019 jafari shalamzari and zhang 2018 therefore the current issue is indispensable for iran and has attracted academic attention worldwide especially in the recent decade as portrayed in fig s2 water desalination methods are used to separate salt from saline water to make it suitable for drinking and agriculture as mentioned earlier in table 1 scientists have worked on several methods for water desalination like thermal technologies kharroubi et al 2022 membrane naidu et al 2020 electrodialysis al amshawee et al 2020 crystallization frigidity wu et al 2020 and conventional distillation rostamzadeh et al 2020 although membrane desalination is more popular than other methods for industrial purposes due to its high efficiency recovery ability ease of maintenance and low depreciation rajakumaran et al 2020 these advantages made ro the leading technology in water desalination so in 2019 ro technology accounted for 69 of total water desalination capacity in the world jones et al 2019 as demonstrated in the literature review the current subject became popular recently for instance hughes et al 2014 tested a combination of membrane desalination and photovoltaic pv thermal energy on a laboratory scale at heriot watt university in edinburgh united kingdom grubert et al 2014 stated that the energy requirement for surface water and seawater treatment equals 0 06 kwhm 3 and 3 5 4 5 kwhm 3 respectively latorre et al 2015 explained the unpredictability of costs availability of fossil fuels and energy consumption by using renewable energy for desalination novosel et al 2015 utilized an integrated pv wind energy system for desalination facilities within jordan as a case study mentis et al 2016 appraised renewable energy desalination plants in the south aegean islands with pv wind hybrid power systems and grid electricity to provide the energy expenses caldera et al 2016 estimated the global renewable energy demand for water preparation until 2030 compared to fossil fuel demand in more recent studies zhang et al 2018 reviewed all usages of solar energy in water treatment technologies and focused on commercialization aspects of the joined solar system with water decontamination methods also al hrari et al 2020 analyzed the efficiency of pv and thermal hybrid systems with a membrane desalination plant to recognize the amount of energy consumed and water produced esmaeilion et al 2021 performed a feasibility study on using renewable energy for water desalination in arid and semi arid areas of iran kaczmarczyk et al 2022 developed a model for membrane water desalination using geothermal water and energy resources it is noteworthy that machine learning ml is also utilized in a few studies to power the desalination process priya et al 2022 in the industries the applications of membrane based system are developed because of their efficiency and ease of operation giwa et al 2017 politano et al 2016 meanwhile the mentioned systems have considerable investment and operation costs during desalination gharsallah et al 2022 petrosino et al 2021 with the extension of simulation and modelling tools in the field of desalination process francesco et al 2021 petrosino et al 2022 some ideas are expressed due to the reduction of membrane based desalination systems such as green membrane applications green energy supplying and carbon prevention strategies in industrial facilities coppola et al 2021 dasgupta et al 2015a b aloulou et al 2022 the present study also follows the same policy to increase environmental compatibility the mentioned studies and several more articles revealed optimizing pv ro desalination system with an integrated ml response surface methodology rsm is a novel method to be more specific other investigations analyze one or two aspects but the current study attempted to take a holistic approach that not only includes technical aspects but also embraces the sdgs goals this study aims to 1 design a conceptual model for pv applications in a combination of ro desalination equipment based on implementation and operational aspects 2 pv simulation by pvsyst platform with the application of integrated ml rsm as an optimization computation 3 economic e and environmental en evaluation of solar energy harvesting in the case study for determination of cost functions 4 presentation of managerial insights with focus on sdgs and 5 evolving a green smart framework for energy supplying of desalination process in developing countries also the main novelties of this research are as follows using an optimized solar system for renewable energy supplying in groundwater desalination which meets the affordable and clean energy goals for sustainable development creating the sustainable nexus between water and energy with consideration to desalination efficiency enhancement which satisfies the clean water and sanitation goal the application of machine learning computations in the smart management of renewable energy supplying in the desalination process which mentions the sustainable cities and communities goal utilizing the rsm method for renewable energy improvement in the process which is related to the industry innovation and infrastructure section of sustainable development goals in the following section 2 expresses the experimental and computational aspects tools and instruments and presents the case study then the outcomes of this study with a comparison of other similar investigations are argued in section 3 section 4 presents managerial insights and finally the main achievement alongside the suggestions for future studies are conveyed in section 5 2 materials and methods this investigation studies the capacity of solar energy for desalination the biggest challenge here is creating a comprehensive framework that utilizes different equipment to work efficiently shahsavar et al 2021 salehi amiri et al 2022 this study employed pvsyst to simulate the region strength in electricity production and then investigated the most optimum condition of solar panels the next step is using ml to identify different parameters roles and predict various situations finally when the big picture is portrayed it is time to build the framework with managerial insights and instructions for decision makers chouhan et al 2022 the conceptual roadmap of this study is illustrated in fig s3 2 1 case study in this paper a ro desalination system for kalile village 20 km west of zahedan sistan and balochestan province iran is designed with a capacity of 1000 m 3 day 1 a well near the village supplies the water for this system according to the literature review water consumption in iran is considered 250 l day 1 per capita nuñez von voigt and mohajeri 2013 madani et al 2016 based on this assumption this system can provide fresh water for 4000 people daily for measuring well water quality samples were taken four times a year and tests were performed with agilent inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms which reported a fixed range of pollutants for all tests different parameters have impacted the quality of groundwater resources such as geo specifications water level supplier source type of soil and drainage layer depth the case study has three main water wells with different tds levels of 575 mg l 1815 mg l and 1235 mg l fig s4 however local water managers of the case study decided to desalinate only one well with the least tds and diluted other resources with desalinated water to reduce the clogging of the membranes optimize the operating costs and to increase the life of the facilities with consideration to eq 1 it can be found that before desalination the mean tds is equal to 930 mg l and after the desalination process with 92 efficiency percentage the tds of the target well reduced to 46 mg l and the mean tds reached to 589 mg l which acceptable amount for drinking water it should be mentioned that the well with the least tds 575 mg l has a high mg ion concentration according to iran s 1053 drinking water quality standard the desirable value of mg ion is equal to 30 mg l therefore the amount of mg ion in the mentioned well is almost three times higher 100 mg l than the desirable value 30 mg l isiri 2009 therefore the case study s water quality is unacceptable in all aspects and should be purified eq 1 t d s t o t a l i 1 3

quality and soluble materials in the most critical conditions which was the basis for the ro system design 2 2 conceptual model of energy harvesting as mentioned the system s main purpose is to provide drinking water but the hot issue is the region s energy crisis therefore considering the situation of the case study this study founds the solution in solar energy utilization nevertheless proposing a practical framework requires proper equipment and comprehensive technical answers as depicted in fig s5 fig s 6proposed the conceptual model for energy harvesting in this region as shown in this figure this study designed an interactive platform for pv ro simulation designed with artificial intelligence ai and design of experiment doe methods to act efficiently be smart and be updated with the changes in the situation 2 3 water desalination system and energy demand the water treatment systems are designed based on the influent water analysis and the desired output water quality in three stages the pre treatment the treatment system and the post treatment system dasgupta et al 2015a b liu et al 2013 nath et al 2014 in the pre treatment section of the present case study equipment including a pumping station sand filter carbon filter and cartridge have been used to improve turbidity color odor taste and the quality of water chakraborty et al 2012 politano et al 2017 the main treatment system of the case study is a ro system in this system the pump transfers the inlet water into pressure vessels containing membranes and the freshwater are discharged from two different outlets das et al 2016 bhattacharjee et al 2015 the post treatment unit is equipped with a chlorination unit to prevent algae growth and control water pollution elimelech and phillip 2011 giwa et al 2017 nag et al 2007 fig 1 shows the flowchart of the treatment process and the equipment used to design and build the ro treatment system is described in table 3 moreover the amount of electricity consumed in this system according to the formal company datasheet of each piece of equipment is shown in table 4 in total considering the 15 safety factor 91 3 kw electricity is required to set up the treatment system 2 4 optimization by rsm the rsm method investigates the relationships between variables and responses with consideration to sensitive analysis analysis of variance and response optimization according to effective parameters eftekhari et al 2018 2020 also this system evaluates the normality of the statistical distribution of results in order to obtain optimal operating conditions five parameters including tilt t degree cross distance cd m pitch p m panel capacity pc watt and baseline b degree were considered in design expert 7 0 0 software it is noteworthy that the authors chose these parameters by reviewing literature and estimated the limitation of each parameter by pvsyst software schuster 2020 siregar and hutahuruk 2020 to consider the economical technical and environmental aspects of the proposed system this study suggested four objective functions including produced energy mwh yr carbon emission prevention 25 years ton initial cost eur and maintenance cost for each year eur da silva et al 2018 the optimization process in the present study aimed to satisfy all four functions together and create an optimum system luo et al 2021 akbarpour et al 2021 the selected parameters are shown in fig s7 and the limits of each one is listed in table 5 as shown in the mentioned figure all the parameters are dependent on each other and changing one influences the others the relation between parameters is thoroughly discussed in the next section 2 5 simulation system meteo software was used for extracting the data required data for solar simulation which contains the solar potential of the area geographical condition of the region and other parameters like wind it is also noteworthy that the project is modeled by the meteonorm 7 2 the used models are set at perez 29 1 unlimited load and 100 for transposition average height user s need and electrical effect in order the pv array loss factors related parameters for thermal loss factor are uc const equal to 20 w m 2 k and uv wind equal to 0 0 w m 2 k m s furthermore loss fractions for wiring ohmic module quality module mismatch and strings mismatch are 1 5 at stc 0 8 1 0 at mpp and 0 10 respectively it is noteworthy that the incidence effect iam is considered as fresnel ar coating n glass equal to 1 526 and n ar equal to 1 290 finally the region s solar potential is modeled by pvsyst with the data gathered from www suncalc org fig s 8 displays sun potential in the present study region and as it shows this area has a considerable capacity for producing energy based on the mentioned figure in the fixed 32 for the t there are seven peaks in sun energy gathering which happened on 22 jun 22 ma y to 23 jul 20 apr to 23 aug 20 mar to 23 sep 21 feb to 23 oct 19 jan to 22 nov and 22 dec the most important parameter here is the sun s height as it goes up the potential of energy producing increases as well 2 6 ml role in solar desalination the ml is performed in the present study to learn the process of establishing thorough solar desalination of water as well as identifying the importance of each parameter in the efficiency of performances this ml model is based on the mentioned simulations and can change hand in hand by the transformation of site features ghadami et al 2021a b in other words the role of ml reveals the other side of simulations to have a practical instrument for designing establishing and running the solar desalination system ghadami et al 2021a b the present study collected the corresponding data and randomly hold 10 20 of them for testing purposes while train the model with the rest four methods including gaussian processes multilayer perceptron support vector machine for regression smoreg and polynomial trees m5p are utilized in weka 3 9 software to identify each parameter role and predict the future situation based on different scenarios the defined role for ml is almost popular amongst experts and the chosen algorithms have proved their capability in similar cases yang and gueymard 2019 luo et al 2018 although the nature of performing these methods and their capabilities are discussed in the next section of the present study but table 6 is represented the settings which is used in creating the models corresponding to four objective functions 3 result and discussion as it mentioned before there are four objective functions which are supposed to satisfy the optimum situation as precise as possible all together the summary of these models is depicted in table 7 the output of design expert 7 0 0 software based on the results almost all the sources including linear 2fi quadratic and cubic have significant performance regarding the high r squared although quadratic produced the most accurate models overall it is also noteworthy that linear sources are not recommended for the rest of the functions except for maintenance function after identifying suitable sources and comparing the results one indispensable point should be noted the low scores of the predicted r squared compared to r squared this observation leads to this conclusion that despite the ability of these sources to build solid functions there is no reliable capacity to predict different results in various situation it reveals the need of evaluation to the ml and artificial intelligence more and more the experts already touch on the importance of the current finding alzu bi et al 2019 wang et al 2021 although finding a practical instrument is not easy the equations which make the objective functions are depicted in eqs 2 5 at first look it is obvious that initial cost and annual maintenance have shorter formulas than the others moreover to realize the logic of generating these functions it is useful to investigate table 8 which illustrates the anova and reveals the f and p value of used parameters based on the anova results all four objective functions are significant due to the low p value which is negligible however the achieved formulas are different for prediction of the 4 cost functions based on similar effective factors for instance the p is the most significant parameter in the produced energy and carbon emission prevention functions in contrast cd p and pc are effective in the initial cost function the other interesting point about this function is that the t and b are almost alien to the other parameters finally pc plays the first role in annual maintenance costs based on the p value it should be noted that the anova is calculated based on the quadratic model eq 2 p r o d u c e d e n e r g

follow normal probability or not this quality is rooted in need for behavior prediction which is valuable in the managerial area gmar et al 2017 shahsavar et al 2022 fig s9 a d illustrated the normal plots of produced energy carbon emission prevention initial and maintenance costs for each year fig s9 a reveals that produced energy fairly follows the normal plot while the points colored based on the values of produced energy are distributed on the normal plot fig s9 b also demonstrates the normal behavior of carbon emission prevention the only significant difference between these two plots is related to the color points which is reasonable due to the distinguished nature of the functions fig s9 c showed a plot with some points on the normal line but has not followed the normal overall and finally fig s9 d created an optimum condition by going up and down vertically over the normal line and not being horizontally placed around the line in the end it is fair to say that produced energy and carbon emission prevention followed the normal plot but the initial cost and annual maintenance are not categorized in the same group as mentioned before in anova calculation and table 8 the role and influence of the parameters are not the same on the generation of the function although the numbers of p values could show the importance of each parameter in internal interactions having a visual frame of reference is helpful fig 2 a d are investigated to show a glimpse of the weight of technical parameters on the four presented functions fig 2 a shows the fluctuations of the produced energy due to the p and t the diagram perfectly demonstrates how the p can change the produced energy for different amounts fig 2 b also has similar conditions and carbon emission prevention significantly reacts to p changes this observation makes sense because in p value calculations the p was negligible in both produced energy and carbon emission prevention functions fig 2 c is related to the initial cost based on the pc and cd changes in the slope of the diagram in fig 2 c revealed that except for t and b parameters all the other parameters were negligible which means cd p and pc highly influence the initial cost fig 2 d is assigned to the maintenance cost which has an exaggerated response to the changes of pc it could be said that annual maintenance cost has an optimum number which occurred in the pc watt of 335 00 and 375 00 it should be noted that functions are optimized based on their nature in other words parameters should be set up to minimize produced energy and carbon emission prevention and minimize cost related functions table 9 is presented the solutions that create the optimized condition for solar panels it should be noted that these proposed limits are chosen to optimize all four functions together as shown in the mentioned table all ten proposed solutions have above 97 desirability although the first solution created the most score with 0 978 based on the first solution t is assumed to be 15 02 degree cd suggested 0 61 m and the other parameters including p pc and b are set at 2 31 m 380 95 watt and 4 49 degree respectively with utilizing these settings produced energy is estimated at 146 mwh yr carbon emission prevention for every 25 years is 1548 19 ton and the initial cost for this power station is 27713 2 eur while the annual maintenance is 1657 42 eur fig s10 also portrayed the desirability of four functions with t and cd as the main parameters the slope of the diagram in this fig and the corresponding changes due to the different values of the parameters is a good example of the influence of parameters on desirability after optimization and sensitivity analysis the desirable solution was obtained and ready for pvsyst simulation more specifically optimum values were applied to pvsyst to simulate the solar power station for desalination this simulation is established in the ccd rsm and fig 3 represents the perspective of the layout of the panels in the optimized condition since the mentioned fig is just a schematic pic another trace is prepared and presented in fig s11 which is described the shading loss in the field maximum energy collecting is already discussed in fig s8 and sections 2 6 but fig s11 illustrates the energy loss due to the shading which ranges from 1 to 40 in five situations it could be concluded that 30 degree is the line that divides the sun s energy into two maximum and minimum situations maximum situations have seven significant points already described and minimum situations contain five considerable points specified in fig s11 fig 4 presents the total performance of the designed solar power station for desalination purposes in a year fig 4 a is the normalized productions and fig 4 b is the performance ratio as shown in fig 4 a there are two major losses collection and system loss the collection loss is considerably larger than system loss which could be interpreted as the system s desirable efficiency this observation means solar panels work efficiently if the sun is at the seven maximum points investigating on fig 4 b shows the stable performance of the solar panels slightly drops in jan nov and dec fig 5 presents the daily behavior of the panels and the ratio of the energy produced to the received energy the desirability of the system is simply proven by the normal behavior depicted in the mentioned fig based on the nominal specifications the total energy consumption of the treatment system is equal to 91 30 kw which is already described in table 4 this proposed treatment plant should work 8 h a day and be at service 200 days a year and the local water sources can supply the remaining water demand the extra amount of produced energy is in the hand of decision makers to put the region on the rail for sdgs moreover this amount of environmentally friendly energy based on the zero carbon policy concept is precious wealth for this region nejatian et al 2022 the more conceptual parts are discussed under the managerial insights term in the next section as depicted in fig s12 the system produced 145 9 142 4 and 141 4 mwh annually which means there is 2 7 mwh tolerance on the other hand based on fig s13 as the system works the co2 emission decreases in a linear behavior considerably the irradiance generation process is done based on some stochastic feature in nature therefore solar energy generation is expressed by possible functions bykov et al 2018 while well established random algorithms can justify global irradiation based on statistical distributions mermoud and wittmer 2014 in the declared progress firstly a daily databank is built by the application of library of markov transition matrices probability matrices and meteo hourly data in the next step an autoregressive gaussian model has created per time fluctuations for predicting harvested solar energy based on possibilities considering fig s12 it is clear that the basis of design and solar energy production is built on the highest probability ideal conditions equivalent to p50 145922 kwh with a probability of 0 4 this gaussian distribution demonstrates that annually the highest frequency of solar energy production as probable random event is equal to 145922 kwh which is the basis of the simulation procedure according to fig s13 the carbon emission prevention is computed as per life cycle emissions lce method mermoud and wittmer 2014 as per the difference in carbon emissions from the cycle of fossil fuel based power grid system c1 and pv technology c2 when c2 c1 carbon emission prevention is met and renewable energy resource can satisfy its prophecy the carbon emission prevention is related to four features include efficiency of plant with consideration to 1 degradation in each year life time of operation gco2 kwh for fossil fuel based energy resource and gco2 kwh pv system sharma et al 2018 in the present research based on international panel on climate change ipcc 46gco2 kwh is considered as a default of pv systems as per 25 year life time of pv system in the present project 1500 ton co2 is prevented by the implementation of pv system in couple of ro facilities artificial intelligence and ml algorithms are performed in the current study to investigate the relation between parameters and future forecasting according to the detailed distribution of cost functions based on changes in effective parameters it is clear that the process of ml is complicated investigating the density of data represented in fig 6 a and b depicted the difficulty of ml application the other experts already mention this challenge kumar et al 2017 rathore et al 2021 the proposed solution here is establishing solid calculation with the help of high performance software weka with the settings presented in table 6 table 10 contains the complete scores for different model evaluation parameters corresponding to four objective functions as depicted in table 10 for both objective functions including carbon emission prevention and energy producing the best ml method is gaussian processes which showed the best scores among the other three methods the correlation coefficient of the gaussian process for carbon emission prevention and energy producing is calculated at 0 989 and 0 988 respectively it goes with the last observation on fig s9 a and b which presented the behavior of these two functions much similarly it means two functions have a similar nature and both gave their best response to a particular ml method gaussian process the other experts specified the capability of this algorithm kanuri et al 2022 and this study also revealed this algorithm has good performance for this means the other two functions which are cost related including the initial cost for establishing a solar panel for water desalination and maintenance costs are best fitted with the m5p method this algorithm s correlation coefficient for both functions is 0 99 which puts high stress on this statement that ml can predict different situations based on various scenarios moreover amongst all the ml methods for four functions there is no correlation coefficient under 0 70 the presented methods all have a desirable performance to utilize in future studies 4 managerial insights and sdgs assessment nowadays with the intensification of climate change and increasing its aspects on human life sustainable use of resources has become a crucial issue amiri et al 2020 one of the low hanging fruits of resource management is optimizing the infrastructures by using different approaches including ai metaheuristic and heuristic algorithms and other mathematical methods golmohamadi et al 2017 hajiaghaei keshteli and sajadifar 2010 gholian jouybari et al 2016 therefore using these techniques to optimize the infrastructures aligns with different global goals and standards liao et al 2020 sdgs assessments have been used in this study to investigate the impact of the implementation of a smart pv ro system on the 17 sdgs akbarian et al 2022 hajiaghaei keshteli et al 2011 as illustrated in fig 7 using renewable energies for water desalination meets the sdgs numbers 1 5 3 9 3 4 6 2 6 a 6 3 7 b 7 2 7 1 9 1 9 4 11 3 and 13 1 by harvesting green energy and using it for ro of groundwater das et al 2022 shahzad et al 2022 the main problem related to water desalination methods is their high energy consumption therefore considering fossil fuels as the world s main energy source water desalination methods are not in line with the sustainable development goals sdgs thus the study on the application of renewable energy for water desalination has increased in recent years shatat et al 2013 he et al 2022 the present study proposed a solar water desalination system based on the mentioned findings it can desalinate water and offer the region s decision makers extra energy this section of the study is dedicated to managerial insights which contains reviews and managerial advice to policymakers and local government organizations the main purpose of the presented study here is to give an instrument to receive the region s high potential and turn it into the equipment for improving local people s lives and well being and also the environment fig s14 points out the importance of the subject and as it showed studies on this area started with three main terms ro photovoltaic system and solar power experts spent considerable efforts in desalination solar energy and solar power generation as it went by the significant importance of the mentioned subjects is the increasing need for freshwater and green energy the other bold observation here is the change of technical desalination process into green energy provider it got more highlighted when the small green circle emerged on the top left of fig s14 based on the current fig most modern topics are eager to find renewable energy resources that could desalinate water with the ro method shalaby et al 2022 bonny et al 2022 sitterley et al 2022 this is a valuable finding for decision makers and moving into solar desalination is the starting edge of the new era for both energy producing and drinking water providing fig s15 is also another proof of the last statement fig s15 also reveals this study worked on a modern dynamic subject that constantly moves to maturity the present study investigated kalile village 20 km west of zahedan sistan and balochestan province iran fig s16 shows an infographic picture of the countries that are working and collaborating in water desalination with solar power to identify the situation of iran in the current subject based on this fig iran is among the countries that worked on this subject which shows the importance of this study nevertheless research on this subject in iran has no strong tie to the other countries studies talaeipour et al 2018 to handle this issue and present a comprehensive framework illustrated in fig 8 the concept in the mentioned fig is straightforward and practical the work path is almost similar to the procedure of this study it means a solar water desalination plant is supposed to be established in a suitable location with enough solar power and water this location identifies not only by field studies but also with the help of literature review and receiving advice from countries with similar experiences the next step is investigating desalination methods compatible with the chosen location s requirements through this step we could also use the experts findings and the interaction between multinational companies and organizations in the next move there is a need for brainstorming meetings between local and federal decision makers to create the foundation of the plant moreover employing artificial intelligence could help identify hidden aspects and help to reveal the patterns sadeghi moghaddam et al 2019 also ml empowers the process by creating the ability to predict different outcomes based on various scenarios cheraghalipour et al 2017 finally the plant is ready to build and extra energy is available for sdgs purposes of the region it is also noteworthy that a tight interaction in each step creates a solid dynamic chain the main limitations of the present research are lack of field evaluation of solar energy availability for comparison with simulation outputs lack of enough data for evaluation of climate change effect on the created system 5 conclusion with the increasing problems of water and energy as well as the correlation of these two issues many scientists and managers are trying to create the infrastructure of renewable energy resources in order to solve the challenges of water crisis in this study an integrated approach is presented to create water supply infrastructure using pvsyst simulation tools and make the system intelligent with the application of integrated ccd rsm and machine learning computations the present research s main novelty is the execution of smart sustainable optimization and planning framework for the desalination of saline water resources in the arid areas of developing countries by integrating machine learning and statistical computations with the implementation of the mentioned photovoltaic system carbon emission is reduced by 1400 tons 25yr also through the optimization procedure rsm outcomes demonstrated that in the optimal conditions of different parameters including tilt cross distance panel capacity and baseline the harvested energy could be 146 mwh yr furthermore the gaussian process algorithm with a 0 98 correlation coefficient has the most efficiency for smart prediction of the outcomes of the system including energy production and carbon emission prevention according to sensitive analysis and statistical evaluations based on both energy production and prevention carbon emission 25 year functions the most important effect is related to pitch degree likewise considering investment and maintenance costs the most significant factors are cd and pc for future studies the present research suggests the application of integrated machine learning and metaheuristic computations simultaneously as a decision support system for optimization and prediction also the simulation of pv systems in water treatment plants could be attractive to scientific communities declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

11783,fluoride has a pivotal importance in dental health and the main source of fluoride intake by humans is known as drinking water fluoride intake that is excessive or insufficient may have negative impacts on infants and children including dental caries and fluorosis the i̇psala district is located in the south west part of edirne city which is a major agricultural land in türkiye s thrace region the aim of the present research was to determine the fluoride accumulations in drinking water and to assess and compare the non carcinogenic health risks of fluoride via daily human intake in drinking water of the i̇psala district and connected villages a total of 23 drinking water samples were collected during the wet season of 2021 the fluoride levels of villages were measured by using a spectrophotometric method and estimated daily intake edi and hazard quotient hq of fluoride were calculated for all the investigated locations separately fluoride concentrations in i̇psala district drinking water ranged from 0 02 to 0 192 ppm the mean edi data in infants children teenagers and adults was recorded as 0 00076 0 00538 0 00380 and 0 00304 ppm respectively all the calculated hq values in terms of all age groups were recorded as less than the critical limit of 1 with a mean of 0 01267 for infants 0 08972 for children 0 06333 for teenagers and 0 05075 for adults which means there is no non carcinogenic health risk in terms of fluoride accumulations in drinking water children are more sensitive than all the age groups in terms of health risk associated with fluoride intake from the study region the findings of this research will aid the respective authorities in developing better policies to safeguard children from fluoride exposure graphical abstract image 1 keywords i̇psala district fluoride level health risk assessment türkiye 1 introduction fluoride intake in infants and children has recently received increased worldwide attention particularly in developed and developing countries yuan et al 2019 onur and tokatli 2020 ijumulana et al 2022 fluoride is ubiquitous in nature and it dissolves quickly in groundwater who 2011 drinking water is therefore the primary source of fluoride exposure on a daily basis with around 90 of fluoride ingested via the digestive system yousefi et al 2017 excess fluoride exposure in drinking water is responsible for around 65 percent of endemic fluorosis fallahzadeh et al 2018 although fluorine is an essential element it may be toxic by direct inhalation and skin absorption contact with skin in lower than lethal doses may cause significant chemical burns fluorine is one of the most chemically reactive and electronegative elements therefore it does not exist on its own in the natural environment and in aqueous solutions fluorine commonly occurs as the fluoride ions fluoride may enter the human body through mainly drinking water but foods drugs and industrial exposure are also among the entryways of fluoride intake andezhath et al 1993 güner et al 2016 tokatlı and güner 2018 onur et al 2019 onur and tokatlı 2020 many adverse effects including tooth decay may be seen when the fluoride concentration is less than 0 5 mg l in drinking water ijumulana et al 2021 children may suffer from fluorosis with long term use of drinking water containing fluoride when the concentration is in the range of 1 5 5 mg l in drinking water it is known that skeletal fluorosis rates in human populations are rising significantly when the concentration of fluoride in drinking water is 5 40 mg day jannat et al 2022 it has also been reported that drinking water containing more than 10 mg of fluoride from birth to adolescence may cause a number of health problems such as hypertension infertility neurological problems alzheimer s thyroid cancer and arthritis related to high concentrations of fluoride guissouma et al 2017 yousefi et al 2018 the world health organization who has recommended 0 5 1 5 mg l to prevent the adverse effects of fluoride in drinking water and also suggested a concentration of 0 5 1 mg l of fluoride in drinking water to prevent tooth decay who 2017 to predict the likelihood of adverse health consequences induced by chemicals in polluted environmental media health risk appraisal has been widely employed rahman et al 2020 the hazard quotient hq is a tool of assessing the health hazards posed by potentially hazardous contaminants miri et al 2018 thus health risk appraisal indices are quite useful tools in estimating non cancer hazards which may occur when people are exposed to certain toxicants ustaoğlu and aydın 2020 tokatlı and ustaoğlu 2020 tokatlı and varol 2021a 2021b varol and tokatlı 2022 the thrace region which has great agricultural potential due to its fertile clayey soil is in the north west part of the marmara region of türkiye the ipsala district is located in the meriç plain in the western part of the thrace region and is ideal for wet agriculture applications due to its abundant groundwater and surface water resources about 80 of the region consists of agricultural lands and approximately 1 4 of türkiye s total paddy production is provided by the thrace region mainly from the meriç plain anonymous 2016 http www edirnekulturturizm gov tr however the cultivation activities in the region have been conducted as a mono cultural approach for a long time therefore farmers have to use more and more chemical fertilizers every year in every planting season arda et al 2015 anonymous 2018 tokatlı and ustaoğlu 2020 tokatlı and varol 2021a tokatlı 2021 also the social studies conducted around the region reflect that the local people of the thrace region are not susceptible enough to sustainability and the environment tokatlı and gürbüz 2014 helvacıoğlu et al 2016 based on the review of existing literature there is insufficient no research focusing on fluoride concentrations in türkiye s i̇psala district despite these agricultural pressures and polluting factors it has been reported that although the aquifer structure of the meriç plain is quite shallow and the water table level is quite close to the surface groundwater resources of the region have been less affected by surface pollutants because of its clayey soil structure tokatlı 2019 however there has been relatively little research done to date on fluoride concentration in the study region and therefore there are no relevant approaches that have reported the health risk of fluoride in the thrace region of northwest türkiye therefore this constitutes a critical gap in our knowledge and as studies of this nature are conducted populations that use agro environments benefit considering that scientific subsidies are provided for socio environmental actions led by local governments approximately one million people living in the nearby areas of the thrace region northwest türkiye are experienced with problems associated with the quality of groundwater anonymous 2016 consequently local people use groundwater for drinking domestic purposes and agricultural i e irrigation purposes but various water sources are often utilized without testing the aptness of water for definite use dental caries fluorosis and other health related problems originating from drinking f contaminated water have been reported globally fallahzadeh et al 2018 kimambo et al 2019 rahman et al 2020 ijumulana et al 2020 ligate et al 2021 tomašek et al 2022 for example ijumulana et al 2021 2022 have recently conducted important research on the geographical distribution of fluoride and the health concerns associated with drinking water with fluoride concentrations below 0 5 mg l and over 1 5 mg l in the east african rift valley areas although groundwater is of high socio ecological and agricultural importance as well as an important strategic resource in the thrace region of northwest türkiye there is little or no information on fluoride contamination in groundwater systems resulting in limited insights on its present condition at a local scale tokatli 2019 in the background of groundwater studies they refer to quantitative information on the status of fluoride contamination in the groundwater system the absence of such information is a serious constraint for the sustainable development and management of groundwater resources the aim of the current research was to determine the fluoride accumulations and evaluate the non carcinogenic health risks of fluoride via daily human intake in 23 drinking water samples collected from the i̇psala district türkiye the findings of this study may assist policymakers in providing relevant guidelines for managing drinking water safety 2 materials and methods 2 1

into four age groups based on their physiological and behavioural differences as follow infants 2 years old children 2 6 years old teenagers 6 16 years old and adults 16 years old the daily exposure to fluoride was calculated in these four different groups by using equation 1 hazard quotient hq describes the non carcinogenic risk of fluoride and it was calculated by using equation 2 yousefi et al 2018 a lower value of hq than one reflects a negligible risk of non carcinogenic effects and a higher value of hq than one reflects an important health risk and a significant risk of severe fluorosis

datasets are normally distributed at the p 0 05 significant level 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluoride concentrations and spatial distribution spatial data of fluoride and hq in tap drinking water of i̇psala district are given in figs 2 and 3 the fluoride levels in drinking water and edi and hq values for the four evaluated populations of native water consumers are given in table 2 the fluoride accumulations in drinking water of villages connected to the i̇psala district were varied from 0 02 yenikarpuzlu town 0 192 hıdırköy village ppm with a mean value of 0 095 ppm fluoride may enter the human body in various ways but drinking water is known as the most significant source of fluoride intake of inadequate or excessive fluoride may cause several adverse effects on humans it is known that about 65 of dental fluorosis is caused by excessive fluoride exposure in drinking water while inadequate intake causes an increase in the risk of dental caries in children rasool et al 2017 aslani et al 2019 even though fluoride is not a major problem in groundwater within that region in türkiye it is still necessary to monitor fluoride concentrations to avoid the adverse effects of excess concentrations since it is known that the fluoride concentration of approximately 0 5 mg l in drinking water is beneficial in preventing dental caries especially in children the results of this study are substantial in terms of taking regional measures to reduce the amount of caries in the local population tokatli and güner 2020 3 2 health risk assessment the edi data for fluoride in infants

children teenagers adults infants in general fluoride is very important for dental health and it may easily get deposited on teeth rahman et al 2020 drinking water is a direct source of fluoride exposure and depending on the content and amount consumed it can have serious health consequences ayoob and gupta 2006 gómezhortigüela 2013 taghipour et al 2016 drinking water with optimal fluoride levels has a preventive effect on dental caries especially in children however if excessive amounts are ingested through drinking water fluoride may be adversely effective on human health mainly on teeth and exposure to fluoride at a higher than optimal level may result in fluorosis güner et al 2016 tokatlı and güner 2018 2020 in the current research the concentrations of fluoride in drinking water of i̇psala district ranged from 0 02 to 0 22 ppm and the fluoride concentrations of all the 23 drinking water samples were within the acceptable limit of 1 5 ppm for drinking specified by ts 266 2005 ec 2007 and who 2011 many studies on the assessment of health risks associated with fluoride in water conducted in a variety of countries confirm that children are at chronic health risk due to fluoride in drinking water intake gao et al 2013 narsimha et al 2018 dehghani et al 2019 qasemi et al 2020 in the current study children were found to be the most sensitive age group for health risks associated with fluoride intake from i̇psala district drinking water in research work performed in pakistan fluoride exposure through drinking water consumption was investigated the population was divided into three groups 7 15 years 16 25 years and 26 50 years and the results showed that the younger age group 7 15 years was at a severe risk of fluorosis as compared to the older groups kapil et al 2014 in another research performed in china the non carcinogenic risk of fluoride in drinking water was investigated and chinese populations were divided into three groups as follows children 0 10 years teenagers 11 20 years and adults 21 72 years as similar to the results of the present research the highest non carcinogenic risk of fluoride was recorded in the children s group and the adverse risks of fluoride were found for children teenagers and adults huang et al 2017 precise areas with significant fluoride hazards for children should get increased health priority as well as some practical interventions including careful water source selection frequent water quality monitoring and regularly updated protection regulations to reduce the negative health effects fallahzadeh et al 2018 miri et al 2018 yuan et al 2019 3 3 fluoride mobility in drinking water the primary mechanism of fluoride release to groundwater is thought to be wall rock contact vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 high f in drinking water is frequent in arid and semi arid areas of the globe the explanation is that fluoride is formed primarily via hydroxypositions in biotite and hornblende and is concentrated by evapotranspiration in soil and groundwater with residual alkalinity such waters are prevalent in locations with typically alkaline soils calcite dolomite and fluorite seem to precipitate in that sequence along the water flow patterns from hilltops to valley bottoms jacks et al 2005 fertilizers put on the soil during irrigation may make it easier for fluoride to release from the soil into the groundwater fluoride mostly occurs through weathering although air deposition from soil dust and industrial pollutants may also be significant evapotranspiration causes calcite precipitation a decrease in ca2 activity and a rise in na ca ratios allowing for an f level increase high f groundwater often has a high ph value a high hco3 content and a high na concentration jacks et al 2005 ijumulana et al 2022 f dissolution from rocks is influenced by alkaline conditions moderate specific conductivity and their ratios jannat et al 2022 3 4 implication and future research in response to unique situations the standards for fluoride content in drinking water vary by location there is no fluoride minimum requirement in drinking water especially in türkiye to protect against dental caries the recommended fluoride level in drinking water to help reduce tooth decay is 1 mg l while the minimum recommended value is 0 5 mg l accordingly as a result of our research all the fluoride levels detected in the drinking waters of the region are below the 0 5 mg l limit in the future it will be quite useful to support and improve this investigation with dental screening and oral health records although the fluoride contents in the regional drinking waters are considerably lower than the reported drinking water fluoride limit value for the protection of dental health the fluoride data should be supported by the results of dental screening in order to determine that the regional waters pose a significant risk for dental health it should be noted that local guideline values that are appropriate for a certain location based on its economy politics climate population and environment must be determined the association between land use change induced by anthropogenic activities and fluoride levels should be studied future long term investigations into the determination of both trace and toxic elements and nutrients in drinking water resources of the whole meriç river delta are also recommended in order to help us protect the health of local people and better understand the interactions between the organic and inorganic pollution parameters 4 conclusion humans are being exposed to various sources of fluoride such as water food and excessive use of toothpaste in their daily lives the control of drinking water quality is one of the basic factors to protect people against the overlying uptake of this element by drinking in this research fluoride accumulations and the non carcinogenic health risks of fluoride via daily human intake in drinking water of 23 settlement areas located in the i̇psala district türkiye were investigated by using the methods of estimated daily intake edi and hazard quotient hq and by dividing the population into four age groups based on their physiological and behavioural differences as a result of this study the fluoride levels varied from 0 02 to 0 192 ppm the mean edi values were recorded as 0 00076 ppm for infants 0 00538 ppm for children 0 00380 ppm for teenagers and 0 00304 ppm for adults the hq values of all age groups were found to be less than the critical limit of 1 and the risk rankings among the investigated different age groups were found as follows children teenagers adults infants in general the findings of this research will aid the respective authorities in developing better policies to

11783,fluoride has a pivotal importance in dental health and the main source of fluoride intake by humans is known as drinking water fluoride intake that is excessive or insufficient may have negative impacts on infants and children including dental caries and fluorosis the i̇psala district is located in the south west part of edirne city which is a major agricultural land in türkiye s thrace region the aim of the present research was to determine the fluoride accumulations in drinking water and to assess and compare the non carcinogenic health risks of fluoride via daily human intake in drinking water of the i̇psala district and connected villages a total of 23 drinking water samples were collected during the wet season of 2021 the fluoride levels of villages were measured by using a spectrophotometric method and estimated daily intake edi and hazard quotient hq of fluoride were calculated for all the investigated locations separately fluoride concentrations in i̇psala district drinking water ranged from 0 02 to 0 192 ppm the mean edi data in infants children teenagers and adults was recorded as 0 00076 0 00538 0 00380 and 0 00304 ppm respectively all the calculated hq values in terms of all age groups were recorded as less than the critical limit of 1 with a mean of 0 01267 for infants 0 08972 for children 0 06333 for teenagers and 0 05075 for adults which means there is no non carcinogenic health risk in terms of fluoride accumulations in drinking water children are more sensitive than all the age groups in terms of health risk associated with fluoride intake from the study region the findings of this research will aid the respective authorities in developing better policies to safeguard children from fluoride exposure graphical abstract image 1

developed and developing countries yuan et al 2019 onur and tokatli 2020 ijumulana et al 2022 fluoride is ubiquitous in nature and it dissolves quickly in groundwater who 2011 drinking water is therefore the primary source of fluoride exposure on a daily basis with around 90 of fluoride ingested via the digestive system yousefi et al 2017 excess fluoride exposure in drinking water is responsible for around 65 percent of endemic fluorosis fallahzadeh et al 2018 although fluorine is an essential element it may be toxic by direct inhalation and skin absorption contact with skin in lower than lethal doses may cause significant chemical burns fluorine is one of the most chemically reactive and electronegative elements therefore it does not exist on its own in the natural environment and in aqueous solutions fluorine commonly occurs as the fluoride ions fluoride may enter the human body through mainly drinking water but foods drugs and industrial exposure are also among the entryways of fluoride intake andezhath et al 1993 güner et al 2016 tokatlı and güner 2018 onur et al 2019 onur and tokatlı 2020 many adverse effects including tooth decay may be seen when the fluoride concentration is less than 0 5 mg l in drinking water ijumulana et al 2021 children may suffer from fluorosis with long term use of drinking water containing fluoride when the concentration is in the range of 1 5 5 mg l in drinking water it is known that skeletal fluorosis rates in human populations are rising significantly when the concentration of fluoride in drinking water is 5 40 mg day jannat et al 2022 it has also been reported that drinking water containing more than 10 mg of fluoride from birth to adolescence may cause a number of health problems such as hypertension infertility neurological problems alzheimer s thyroid cancer and arthritis related to high concentrations of fluoride guissouma et al 2017 yousefi et al 2018 the world health organization who has recommended 0 5 1 5 mg l to prevent the adverse effects of fluoride in drinking water and also suggested a concentration of 0 5 1 mg l of fluoride in drinking water to prevent tooth decay who 2017 to predict the likelihood of adverse health consequences induced by chemicals in polluted environmental media health risk appraisal has been widely employed rahman et al 2020 the hazard quotient hq is a tool of assessing the health hazards posed by potentially hazardous contaminants miri et al 2018 thus health risk appraisal indices are quite useful tools in estimating non cancer hazards which may occur when people are exposed to certain toxicants ustaoğlu and aydın 2020 tokatlı and ustaoğlu 2020 tokatlı and varol 2021a 2021b varol and tokatlı 2022 the thrace region which has great agricultural potential due to its fertile clayey soil is in the north west part of the marmara region of türkiye the ipsala district is located in the meriç plain in the western part of the thrace region and is ideal for wet agriculture applications due to its abundant groundwater and surface water resources about 80 of the region consists of agricultural lands and approximately 1 4 of türkiye s total paddy production is provided by the thrace region mainly from the meriç plain anonymous 2016 http www edirnekulturturizm gov tr however the cultivation activities in the region have been conducted as a mono cultural approach for a long time therefore farmers have to use more and more chemical fertilizers every year in every planting season arda et al 2015 anonymous 2018 tokatlı and ustaoğlu 2020 tokatlı and varol 2021a tokatlı 2021 also the social studies conducted around the region reflect that the local people of the thrace region are not susceptible enough to sustainability and the environment tokatlı and gürbüz 2014 helvacıoğlu et al 2016 based on the review of existing literature there is insufficient no research focusing on fluoride concentrations in türkiye s i̇psala district despite these agricultural pressures and polluting factors it has been reported that although the aquifer structure of the meriç plain is quite shallow and the water table level is quite close to the surface groundwater resources of the region have been less affected by surface pollutants because of its clayey soil structure tokatlı 2019 however there has been relatively little research done to date on fluoride concentration in the study region and therefore there are no relevant approaches that have reported the health risk of fluoride in the thrace region of northwest türkiye therefore this constitutes a critical gap in our knowledge and as studies of this nature are conducted populations that use agro environments benefit considering that scientific subsidies are provided for socio environmental actions led by local governments approximately one million people living in the nearby areas of the thrace region northwest türkiye are experienced with problems associated with the quality of groundwater anonymous 2016 consequently local people use groundwater for drinking domestic purposes and agricultural i e irrigation purposes but various water sources are often utilized without testing the aptness of water for definite use dental caries fluorosis and other health related problems originating from drinking f contaminated water have been reported globally fallahzadeh et al 2018 kimambo et al 2019 rahman et al 2020 ijumulana et al 2020 ligate et al 2021 tomašek et al 2022 for example ijumulana et al 2021 2022 have recently conducted important research on the geographical distribution of fluoride and the health concerns associated with drinking water with fluoride concentrations below 0 5 mg l and over 1 5 mg l in the east african rift valley areas although groundwater is of high socio ecological and agricultural importance as well as an important strategic resource in the thrace region of northwest türkiye there is little or no information on fluoride contamination in groundwater systems resulting in limited insights on its present condition at a local scale tokatli 2019 in the background of groundwater studies they refer to quantitative information on the status of fluoride contamination in the groundwater system the absence of such information is a serious constraint for the sustainable development and management of groundwater resources the aim of the current research was to determine the fluoride accumulations and evaluate the non carcinogenic health risks of fluoride via daily human intake in 23 drinking water samples collected from the i̇psala district türkiye the findings of this study may assist policymakers in providing relevant guidelines for managing drinking water safety 2 materials and methods 2 1

human body in various ways but drinking water is known as the most significant source of fluoride intake of inadequate or excessive fluoride may cause several adverse effects on humans it is known that about 65 of dental fluorosis is caused by excessive fluoride exposure in drinking water while inadequate intake causes an increase in the risk of dental caries in children rasool et al 2017 aslani et al 2019 even though fluoride is not a major problem in groundwater within that region in türkiye it is still necessary to monitor fluoride concentrations to avoid the adverse effects of excess concentrations since it is known that the fluoride concentration of approximately 0 5 mg l in drinking water is beneficial in preventing dental caries especially in children the results of this

capillary suction time cst and degree of substitutions ds 0 85 on the other hand hafs et al 2021 have determined a novel sustainable solar desalination technology for removing the salinity by using the passive and active single slope solar still combined with phase change material pcm for the thermal energy storage system numerically modelled and simulated on the agricultural grounds sharmin et al 2020 have investigated in the hoar areas of bangladesh to prevent hazardous algal blooms that can catastrophically take out fish and water bird populations by using the potential sorbent materials for their ability to remove excess phosphate from agricultural runoff whereas khandaker et al 2020 studied the treatment of industrial waste water using calcium hypochlorite oxidation followed by waste iron rust it helped for fast filtration for color and chemical oxygen demand cod removal for application in resource constraint countries like bangladesh similarly sharma et al 2020 evaluated the dose estimation from the exposure to radon thoron and their progeny concentrations in the environs in the kangra area of the himachal himalayas using pin hole based single entrance dosimeters and time deposition based progeny sensors dtps drps the total equivalent equilibrium concentrations of radon eecr and equilibrium equivalent concentrations of thoron eect for attached and unattached fractions have been found to vary from 8 04 to 29 58 bq m3 with an average of 13 94 bq m3 and 0 18 2 18 bq m3 with an average of 1 23 bq m3 respectively the study found that investigated region appears to be safe from exposure to radon thoron and their progenies jakariya et al 2020 determined the livelihood vulnerability index lvi for the local fishermen communities in the cox s bazar kutubdia khulna koyra and patuakhali kalapara in the south and west end of the bangladesh using the geospatial the study put forward the idea that location specific fishermen s vulnerability factors could be identified after a certain interval with an active engagement of local communities the active local participation can generate valuable information for developing appropriate strategies to secure their livelihood in a sustainable way ochoa caballero and rivera parra 2021 studied the environmental risk associated with the formation of water which is produced jointly with oil as part of the oil production process in ecuador mainly within the amazon region the study determines the environmental risks associated with the formation of water chemical composition using gis to generate risk and vulnerability maps with gis based spatial analysis in order to assess periodical water quality evaluations of nearby rivers similar environmental studies and better land use planning by the local governments considering the potential risks associated to oil production activities 3 conclusion the articles published in this special issue reflect the deep understanding of the water resources behavior occurrence contamination and new ways to study the groundwater resources using geophysical methods ahp groundwater modeling dwi wqi iwqi and grace satellite data therefore it is expected that the methods innovations and researchs discussed in the special issue will contribute to a better understanding of the global problem of water for domestic irrigation and industrial uses and also help both scientific and non scientific communities to develop strategies to address the issues related to groundwater and surface water resources and enable us to manage the crisis in a
