8885,as a critical index for irrigation scheduling plant water deficit index pwdi is defined as the ratio of water deficit to water demand to reflect the extent of abiotic stresses such as water and salinity recently smart irrigation scheduling according to pwdi thresholds to maintain desirable or acceptable stress levels has been suggested to maximize yields while minimizing negative environmental effects under non saline conditions to investigate and quantify the potential for pwdi driven irrigation on agricultural production under conditions of salinity a two year experiment with six specific thresholds was conducted in shawan of xinjiang for drip irrigated cotton under film mulch results indicated that with increasing pwdi threshold irrigation depth per event increased while irrigation frequency and total volume decreased consequently the soil water and salt environment deteriorated resulting in less nutrient uptake slower growth and lower yield and net profit with particularly high pwdi thresholds leading to serious stress conditions fiber quality was also negatively affected within a designed range of pwdi thresholds between 0 39 and 0 62 an elliptic function characterized the processes of water application yield and net profit r2 0 95 and water productivity could be described by a parabolic function r2 0 77 these quantitative results were used to provide guidelines for smart irrigation scheduling under local conditions considering water management measures and market prices of cotton for a reference market price of 7 5 cny kg 1 a pwdi threshold of 0 49 was found to optimize economic benefits while maximizing water productivity when prices of cotton are prohibitively low a lower threshold should be considered to obtain an acceptable net profit otherwise a higher threshold would be preferable to use water more efficiently further verification and improvement are necessary to deal with more complex scenarios such as considering crop sensitivity to water and salinity stresses at different growth stages and optimizing irrigation depth per event keywords water and salinity stresses irrigation scheduling drip irrigation plant water deficit index water productivity net profit 1 introduction farmers often aim at maximizing economic benefit by balancing costs and benefits of water consumption and crop productivity fernández et al 2020 consequently optimization of irrigation scheduling accounting for both economic benefits and environmental repercussions is crucial for sustainable agriculture especially in arid and semi arid regions where water scarcity and soil salinization have become seemingly insurmountable obstacles cominelli et al 2013 hopmans et al 2021 yu et al 2021 seasonal irrigation quota is typically determined by a water production function referring to an expected yield predicted rainfall and anticipated irrigation water availability subsequently irrigation timing frequency and depth are commonly determined according to local experience wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 actual irrigation scheduling particularly concerning timing might be fine tuned according to meteorological conditions such empirical nature of irrigation scheduling leads to inevitable deviations between water supply and crop demand and subsequent less than satisfactory economic benefits or environmental repercussions hou et al 2021 wang et al 2021 owing to rapid development of technology to monitor soil crop systems irrigation scheduling based on crop water status has gained more and more attention jones 2004 candogan et al 2013 shi et al 2015 knowledge and data driven irrigation benefiting from timely and accurate evaluation of plant water status and the quantitative understanding of relationships between irrigation scheduling and outcomes have exhibited great potential in simultaneously achieving satisfactory economic benefits while reducing environmental costs wu et al 2017 shi et al 2020 2021 qin et al 2021 plant water deficit often occurs when root water uptake cannot support atmospheric transpiration demand due to abiotic stresses such as water and salinity a dimensionless coefficient quantifying stress extent namely plant water deficit index pwdi has been defined as the ratio of water deficit to water demand thornthwaite 1948 woli et al 2012 as a critical index pwdi has been widely adopted to schedule irrigation under conditions without salinity stress by weighting the effects of water in various soil layers on crop water status according to root distribution shi et al 2015 improved an approach estimating pwdi on average soil water content over the root zone this led to superior temporal provision of plant water demand via irrigation wu et al 2017 additionally through field experiments and numerical simulation the effects of utilizing a pwdi threshold to initiate irrigation on yield and water productivity were explored and quantified for drip irrigated maize shi et al 2020 2021 laying a strong foundation for smart irrigation scheduling in non saline field recently the root weighted pwdi estimation approach was extended to salinity conditions by quantifying the effects of the relative distribution of salts to roots liu et al 2022 nevertheless it remains challenging to determine reliable pwdi thresholds designed to balance economic and environmental benefits while simultaneously considering multiple objectives such as saving water regulating salinity and increasing income when irrigation scheduling is optimized crop yield and water productivity are usually considered as the main indicators evaluating economic and environmental costs and benefits kang et al 2000 kiziloglu et al 2009 kang et al 2017 while water and salinity stresses are expected to lower production they commonly enhance water productivity at least until extreme stress is reached shi et al 2020 qin et al 2021 to consider the impacts of agricultural input and output on irrigation decision making net profit is often employed as an alternative of yield matovic et al 2016 kaner et al 2019 fernández et al 2020 sushil et al 2021 to protect water resources in arid and semi arid regions trends in policy include intervention measures such as cutting down irrigation quota or area raising water price and placing limitation on water flow and solute transport out of the root zone boelens and vos 2012 grafton et al 2018 fernández et al 2020 singh et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 therefore the effects of local water management measures should also be considered when smart irrigation scheduling is applied in arid and semi arid regions as a typical arid region with annual precipitation of only 5 25 cm and evaporation of more than 100 cm xinjiang has become the biggest cotton production base in china feng et al 2017 ma et al 2022 for example in shawan a county with 1 20 105 ha of cultivated cotton production reached 5 13 108 kg in 2020 xinjiang statistics bureau 2021 while consuming about 4 19 108 m3 irrigation water yang et al 2022 beneficial from remarkable superiority in saving water and fertilizer regulating salinity and increasing yield drip irrigation under film mulch is applied for more than 87 of the cotton grown in xinjiang nevertheless rapid expansion of cultivated land and irrational irrigation scheduling aggravates water scarcity and soil salinization and about one third of arable land has been salinized chen et al 2010 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 based on the case of drip irrigated cotton under film mulch in shawan we investigated pwdi thresholds while evaluating irrigation scheduling soil water and salt dynamics nutrient uptake and soil residual and cotton growth water consumption yield and quality we further quantified the effects of pwdi thresholds on net profit and water productivity additionally the impacts of local water management and cotton prices on irrigation decision making were analyzed to provide intelligent solutions for sustainable and efficient production under conditions of salinity 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment 2 1 1 experimental conditions cotton

application for w1 w2 and w3 in 2019 was reduced 30 to prevent excessive fertilization wang et al 2018 shi et al 2022 for each irrigation event fertilizer was injected into the irrigation system

either groundwater or surface water for irrigation according to regional water resources since the year 2000 to conserve water resources the shawan government sets a threshold of 52 5 cm for irrigation quota for the groundwater irrigation region gwir price of water is set as 0 4 cny m 3 and over extraction is prohibited for the surface water irrigation region swir an incremental water price is implemented water costs 0 23 cny m 3 within the quota and doubles after this limit is reached for the case of the shawan cotton field scenario analysis was conducted to explore the effects of water management measures and market prices of cotton on net profit and water productivity and subsequently to provide reference for balancing economic benefits and environmental costs when smart irrigation decision was optimized the analysis methods and procedures were as follows 1 the average precipitation for the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons was used as a reference value for various scenarios 2 the average market price of cotton in 2018 and 2019 7 5 cny kg 1 was taken as a reference value 3 with the quantitative relationships between pwdi threshold and yield as well as water application irrigation and precipitation obtained in 2018 and 2019 and the local water management measures pwdi thresholds corresponding to maximum and zero net profits were estimated to determine the range of pwdi threshold for swir and gwir respectively 4 between the pwdi thresholds corresponding to the maximum and zero net benefits various scenarios were respectively set up for swir and gwir by taking 0 01 as the step of pwdi threshold and then seasonal irrigation amount water productivity and net profit under each scenario were estimated 5 for swir and gwir the results from scenarios were compared to the data averaged in 2018 and 2019 under the local traditional fertigation approach net profit was respectively re evaluated according to specific water price 6 around the reference price of cotton additional scenarios were set up with a change step of 4 with a maximum variation less than 50 to investigate the influence of cotton price on the profitability of the mentioned irrigation schemes 7 according to the analysis results smart irrigation schemes were further optimized for swir and gwir in shawan to take economic benefits and environmental costs into account simultaneously so as to evaluate the effects of local water management measures and market changes 2 3 statistical analysis microsoft excel 2013 microsoft corporation usa was used to process experimental data and conduct regression analysis analysis of variance anova was performed with the general linear model glm procedure of statistical software package spss 20 0 international business machines corporation usa when differences were found one way analysis of variance was performed to evaluate the effects on studied parameters based on the least significant difference lsd at 0 05 probability level 3 results and discussion throughout the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 precipitation reached 12 68 and 14 79 cm respectively with 6 04 and 4 43 cm falling within the treatment period of 61 158 das figs 1 and 2 by substituting the assumed parameters ρ 1 0 and τ 1 0 with the optimized values ρ 1 15 and τ 0 9 pwdi under each treatment was re estimated daily liu et al 2022 compared to the primary estimation the re estimated pwdi was generally higher while having similar dynamics figs 1 and 2 according to the actual irrigation processes pwdi thresholds under w1 w2 and w3 in 2018 were adjusted from the primary values of 0 36 0 46 and 0 58 to 0 39 0 49 and 0 62 fig 1 liu et al 2022 and from 0 41 0 50 and 0 54 to 0 44 0 53 and 0 57 for w1 w2 and w3 in 2019 fig 2 table 2 respectively after each irrigation or rainfall event pwdi sharply decreased and then gradually increased until the next water input event different from the values close to zero in non saline field shi et al 2020 pwdi in figs 1 and 2 only dropped to 0 26 0 40 after most irrigation events since the hysteresis effect of previous stress pérez pérez et al 2007 wu et al 2020 liu et al 2022 was neglected in eq 1 the estimated pwdi reflected the real time soil water and salinity conditions when irrigation depth was estimated using eq 5 the irrigation and leaching strategies setting the target soil water content as field water capacity in the designed wetting layer 0 60 cm and taking the salinity leaching coefficient as 1 2 ensured optimal soil water conditions over 0 80 cm root zone after irrigation 80 field water capacity and thus negligible water stress feddes et al 1978 shi et al 2020 consequently the estimated pwdi immediately after an irrigation event figs 1 and 2 mainly was influenced by root zone soil salinity under local hydrogeological climatic and agricultural production conditions the average soil salt content over root zone was almost kept at a stable level of 4 19 g kg 1 and the slight difference of pwdi after irrigation might be a result of the varied salinity distributions among irrigation treatments fig 3c f or due to soil spatial variability additionally soil salinity conditions under each treatment would be immediately improved by irrigation induced lower salt concentration in soil solution and salt leaching to the deeper soil layers wang et al 2014 yu et al 2021 therefore the estimated pwdi immediately after irrigation represented a relatively low level of salinity stress under each treatment and the average of 0 33 under all treatments was taken as the basic salinity stress extent in this study 3 1 the effects of pwdi thresholds on soil crop system 1 irrigation scheduling when irrigation was triggered by pwdi lower threshold values led to more frequent application events and thus less reduction in soil water content between events since each irrigation event was programmed to return soil water within the designed wetting depth of 0 60 cm to field water capacity lower thresholds also meant lower irrigation depth per event figs 1 and 2 table 2 this is similar to results reported under non saline conditions nielsen 1990 shi et al 2020 qin et al 2021 during the treatment period in 2018 when pwdi threshold increased from 0 39 w1 to 0 49 w2 or 0 62 w3 irrigation amounts decreased from 53 85 to 40 82 or 7 57 cm with 45 25 or 4 events respectively table 2 similarly in 2019 irrigation application was 42 47 cm with 26 events under w1 0 44 and was reduced to 34 84 cm with 17 events under w2 0 53 and 19 45 cm with 8 events for w3 0 57 in general irrigation depth per event was much higher in 2019 than 2018 for instance compared to 1 89 cm under w3 the average irrigation depth of 2 43 cm per event under w3 with a 0 05 lower pwdi threshold was 28 6 higher this might be related to different soil salt distributions in the two growing seasons before an irrigation event in flowering and bolling stage 2018 86 das 2019 77 das although total salt over root zone was almost identical in contrast with w3 salt in the main root zone of 0 35 cm including most roots was 14 7 lower under w3 fig 3c d this indicates a smaller contribution of salinity stress and greater contribution of water stress when the pwdi threshold was reached eq 1 liu et al 2022 and therefore more water was needed to refill the soil to field water capacity correspondingly the average soil water content in 0 60 cm under w3 was 6 7 lower than w3 and thus the required irrigation water was 13 4 greater 2 soil water and salt dynamics thresholds of pwdi also affected soil water and salt dynamics fig 3 with increasing pwdi threshold soil water contents before irrigation tended to decrease especially in the main root zone of 0 35 cm fig 3a and b implying greater difficulty in root water uptake and more serious water stress homaee et al 2002 wang et al 2017 shi et al 2020 prior to irrigation the average soil water contents over the root zone under w1 w2 and w3 treatments in 2018 were 0 20 0 22 0 16 0 19 and 0 14 0 15 cm3 cm 3 while in 2019 corresponding values were 0 19 0 21 0 16 0 18 and 0 13 0 15 cm3 cm 3 under w1 w2 and w3 respectively this indicates that the field experiment successfully created different soil water conditions for cotton growth and production according to the pre designed scheme under all the irrigation treatments no drainage was observed from the outlets of the lysimeters and soil water and salt fluxes through the lower boundary of root zone calculated according to darcy s law were also negligible leading to almost constant salt content in root zone fig 3c f in the main root zone of 0 35 cm regardless of irrigation treatments relative to the initial value before sowing lower soil salt contents prior to the irrigation events on about 20 days after initiating treatments verified the superiority of drip irrigation under film mulch in xinjiang in creating and maintaining a shallow region relatively low in salts xu et al 2003 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 owing to higher soil water content and thus more downwards water flow salt reduction in the main root zone was more obvious under the treatment with lower pwdi threshold fig 3a d almost all the leaching salt from the upper 0 35 cm was transported into and gradually accumulated in 35 55 cm where soil salt content was higher than the initial lower pwdi thresholds resulted in more serious salt accumulation agreeing well with previous studies zhao et al 2014 chen et al 2018 compared to the flowering and bolling stage fig 3c and d during the harvesting stage fig 3e and f both salt reduction in the main root zone and salt accumulation in the middle root zone were more obvious with a downwards movement of salt content peak from 40 to 50 cm and an expansion of salt accumulation area from 35 to 55 35 75 cm consequently at a cost of more water consumption lower pwdi thresholds created more favorable soil water and salinity conditions for root water uptake and plant growth wang et al 2014 dong et al 2022 3 cotton growth transpiration yield and quality leaf water potential decreased as a function of increasing pwdi threshold value and decreasing cumulative irrigation depth fig 4 this was accompanied by less root n uptake slower growth and lower yield figs 5 and 6 these results were as anticipated resulting from root zone soil water and salt conditions fig 3 and agreed well with previous findings under non saline conditions shi et al 2020 qin et al 2021 zhu et al 2022 in 2018 the average leaf water potential prior to irrigation decreased from 1 36 w1 to 1 84 w2 and 3 41 mpa w3 which was correlated with respective sharp decreases in transpiration during the treatment period from 55 43 to 44 23 and 16 75 cm compared to w1 leaf area index aboveground dry weight and n accumulation and yield decreased 6 9 9 7 under w2 and 60 5 75 5 under w3 similarly in 2019 average leaf water potential was 1 40 mpa under w1 0 44 and significantly decreased to 1 91 mpa under w2 0 53 and 2 52 mpa under w3 0 57 corresponding transpiration was also reduced from 46 72 to 39 71 and 24 31 cm as well as decrease of 11 7 17 8 under w2 while 37 8 51 0 under w3 in leaf area index aboveground dry weight and n accumulation and yield in addition cotton fiber quality was also reported balkcom et al 2006 dagdelen et al 2009 and observed to be affected by water stress however significant decline was only found under severe stress conditions saeidi et al 2021 when pwdi thresholds were higher than 0 57 table 4 in non saline fields the yield and water consumption of drip irrigated maize were reported to be linearly decreased with increasing pwdi threshold from 0 21 to 0 71 shi et al 2020 likely due to the interaction between water and salinity stresses lier et al 2009 cotton yield and water consumption also tended to decrease with increasing pwdi threshold but in a form of elliptic functions r2 0 95 fig 6 showing a sharper decline rate than linear functions when threshold increased from 0 39 to 0 62 the quantitative relationships between pwdi threshold and yield water application demonstrated in fig 6 provides feasibility for smart irrigation scheduling under conditions of salinity for an objective yield corresponding pwdi threshold and water application can be determined to timely regulate soil water and salt conditions via irrigation or conversely yield and water demand can be predicted according to a predesigned threshold shi et al 2020 4 net profit and environmental repercussions water and salinity stresses related with higher pwdi thresholds were shown to lower yield and be detrimental to product quality and subsequently to reduce gross profit in spite of production cost savings due to less water consumption wang et al 2014 since product quality degradation only occurred under extreme stress conditions table 4 its effect on net profit was not considered in this study for the field experiment located in gwir with unrestricted irrigation quotas both irrigation cost and gross profit gradually decreased with increasing pwdi threshold table 3 since the local water price was very low the irrigation cost saved by a higher pwdi threshold could not compensate the loss in gross profit and thus farmers would be expected to be ill disposed to adopt water saving practices ørum et al 2010 wang et al 2018 an increase in pwdi threshold from 0 39 to 0 57 decreases net profit from 28 546 5 to 9976 8 cny ha 1 as an elliptic function and a loss of 5521 4 cny ha 1 occurred when the threshold rose to 0 62 fig 7 r2 0 96 to make an optimal irrigation regime environmental repercussions should be considered together with economic benefits especially in arid and semi arid areas zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 fernández et al 2020 increasing the extent of water and or salinity stress has commonly been found to increase water productivity at least until extreme stress is reached kang et al 2002 candogan et al 2013 wang et al 2014 shi et al 2020 within the designed range of pwdi thresholds between 0 39 and 0 62 water productivity firstly increased from 1 10 kg m 3 to a maximum of 1 34 kg m 3 and then decreased to 0 79 kg m 3 as a quadratic function fig 7 r2 0 77 this result is similar to results found for drip irrigated maize under non saline conditions shi et al 2020 qin et al 2021 compared to w1 at the cost of 2 9 65 1 reduction in net profit water productivity under w1 w2 w2 and w3 increased 13 2 21 5 in addition increasing pwdi threshold generally resulted in higher residual soil n concentration table 2 due to less root nutrient uptake fig 5c and f in contrast with w1 in 2018 the residual soil mineral n on the day of harvesting increased 33 1 under w2 and 170 3 under w3 when n application was cut down 30 in 2019 similar results were found with an increase of 43 7 under w2 and 123 8 under w3 relative to w1 table 2 3 2 scheduling smart irrigation under conditions of salinity due to increasing water shortage and government intervention seasonal irrigation depth for cotton cultivation in shawan decreased gradually from 52 53 cm in 2000 and remained around 35 00 cm in the last five years yang et al 2022 in this study a total of 40 59 and 31 84 cm irrigation water was supplied for ck in 2018 and ck in 2019 respectively and all the corresponding indexes during the

there is significant room for improving the economic benefits and environmental costs of local cotton production by triggering irrigation according pwdi estimation and pre designed threshold compared to the traditional regime the w1 w2 and w2 treatments not only increased net profit by 47 8 81 3 but also raised water productivity by 10 7 14 7 owing to more precise regulation of soil water and salinity conditions to timely meet water demand of cotton especially at critical growth stages shi et al 2020 liao et al 2021 liu et al 2022 for instance at the flowering and bolling stage 69 113 das when cotton is very sensitive to water and salinity stresses drip irrigation was applied 19 times with 30 86 cm 17 times with 28 76 cm and 13 times with 26 39 cm under w1 w2 and w2 treatments respectively figs 1 and 2 corresponding to 83 3 97 5 of potential reference crop evapotranspiration estimated by penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 however cotton was watered only six times with a total of 22 50 cm and five times with 15 92 cm under ck and ck treatments representing only 50 3 69 1 of potential reference crop evapotranspiration and apparently unsuitable for potential yield or water productivity doorenbos 1977 li et al 2016 in practice to use water resources efficiently in arid and semi arid areas such as shawan local water management measures and market prices of agricultural products should be considered when irrigation scheduling is optimized wang et al 2014 fernández et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 according to limited irrigation quotas and the quantitative functions in figs 6 and 7 for gwir in shawan 18 irrigation scenarios based on minimum and maximum pwdi thresholds of 0 44 with a maximum allowable irrigation amount of 52 5 cm and 0 61 zero net profit were evaluated fig 8a similarly for swir without any irrigation quota restriction 29 irrigation scenarios based on a minimum pwdi threshold of 0 33 i e the basic salinity stress extent and a maximum of 0 61 were assessed fig 8b as expected net profit was found to decrease with increasing pwdi threshold and maximums of 27 651 7 and 35 325 1 cny ha 1 could be achieved for gwir and swir when pwdi thresholds were set as 0 44 and 0 33 respectively equal to 1 7 and 2 1 times the income from the traditional regime the corresponding water productivities would be 1 28 and 0 63 kg m 3 equal to 115 4 and 56 9 of the traditional regime fig 8 obviously in swir the considerable economic benefits come with unacceptable environmental costs and therefore a low pwdi threshold such as 0 33 would not be feasible for agricultural sustainable development zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 whether in gwir or swir a pwdi threshold of 0 49 coinciding with w2 would result in considerable economic benefit maximum water productivity and acceptable residual soil mineral n content about 1 4 fig 8 1 2 fig 7 and 1 0 table 2 times that of the traditional management respectively in this case the income from the cotton fields of gwir 3 45 104 ha and swir 8 51 104 ha in shawan would increase 2 45 108 and 6 13 108 cny with additional irrigation water consumption of 2 91 107 and 7 18 107 m3 respectively conversely to achieve the average net profit in 2018 and 2019 from the traditional regime 16 261 7 cny ha 1 pwdi thresholds in gwir and swir could be set as 0 55 with a water productivity of 1 26 kg m 3 and a seasonal irrigation depth of 33 62 cm and 3 10 107 m3 water would be saved in shawan within the pwdi threshold range of 0 44 0 61 owing to lower water price net profits in swir were always 216 846 cny ha 1 higher than gwir for any given pwdi threshold in gwir or swir net profit would gradually increase when the market price of cotton is raised from 3 9 52 of the reference price to 11 1 cny kg 1 148 moreover for any price when pwdi threshold increases from the minimum to the maximum net profit still decreases as an elliptical function fig 8 therefore in gwir or swir irrigation scheduling and or water management measures should be adjusted appropriately according to cotton price to obtain acceptable combinations of economic benefits and environmental costs matovic et al 2016 sinha et al 2017 if prices are too low a low pwdi threshold should be chosen to obtain a relatively satisfactory net profit by consuming a great deal of water inefficiently otherwise if selling prices are relatively high maximal net profit should not be pursued blindly and a high pwdi threshold should be adopted to improve water productivity reduce water consumption figs 6 8 and minimize environmental repercussions in recent years with the continuous increase of global population and development of society demand for cotton and its market price have risen if the market price of cotton would reach 11 1 cny kg 1 the average net profit under the traditional regime in 2018 and 2019 could be obtained if pwdi thresholds were set as 0 59 and 0 60 for gwir and swir respectively this would result in a subsequent consumption of irrigation water of only 23 54 and 20 42 cm and 1 78 108 m3 savings of water in shawan in view of the limitation of experimental conditions only six pwdi thresholds within a small range 0 39 0 62 were evaluated in this study it therefore might be unreliable to apply the fitted results widely especially in the untested threshold ranges of 0 0 39 and 0 62 1 0 the experiment data indicate that besides water stress a low pwdi threshold could also relieve salinity stress by removing salts from the active root zone fig 3 however due to the total salt in root zone the extent of relief from salinity stress by adjusting the pwdi threshold may be limited thus in contrast to non saline conditions shi et al 2020 it might be challenging to maximize yield by setting a pwdi threshold close to zero unless other measures such as salt leaching are applied therefore to understand the effects of pwdi thresholds on crop yield water productivity and net profit under saline conditions more comprehensively and further optimize irrigation scheduling it is necessary to set more scenarios through experiments or simulations shi et al 2021 besides pwdi thresholds potential approaches might include optimization of irrigation depth per event by adjusting the parameters in eq 5 such as the designed wetting depth the salt leaching coefficient or the objective soil water content feng et al 2021 ning et al 2021 che et al 2022 additionally while the effects of water and salinity stresses on plant water status and growth vary significantly among different growth stages the pwdi thresholds in this study were kept constant inconsistent with plant physiological water saving mechanisms munns 2002 abdelraheem et al 2019 consequently it is also necessary to further investigate how to optimize pwdi thresholds and irrigation scheduling according to the difference of plant sensitivity to water and salinity stresses at various growth stages 4 conclusions by influencing irrigation scheduling changes in pwdi thresholds significantly affected soil water and salt dynamics nutrient uptake and soil residual crop growth water consumption yield product quality net profit and water productivity under conditions of salinity lower pwdi thresholds led to higher irrigation frequency and more seasonal water application which were beneficial to root zone soil conditions and crop production the choice of pwdi threshold is therefore crucial especially in arid and semi arid areas where water resources are scarce and soil salinization can be prominent to support the sustainable development of agriculture resulting from six specific scenarios in a two year field experiment the quantitative relationships between pwdi threshold and water application yield net profit and water productivity support intelligent decision making for irrigation of cotton under conditions of salinity for a reference price of cotton of 7 5 cny kg 1 a pwdi threshold of 0 49 was recommended in both gwir and swir to achieve considerable simultaneously economic and environmental benefits for prohibitive low cotton prices a lower pwdi threshold should be chosen to obtain a relatively satisfactory net profit at the cost of more water consumption and lower water productivity otherwise an acceptable but not maximal net profit is encouraged by applying a relatively high pwdi threshold to improve water productivity and reduce negative environmental repercussions due to the limitation of experimental conditions the quantitative results from this study should be further verified and improved by setting more experiment or simulation scenarios future work should focus on recognizing and using the difference of plant sensitivity to water and salinity stresses at various growth stages and optimizing irrigation depth per event by adjusting relevant impact factors in addition to pwdi threshold declaration of competing interest the authors declare that we have no

8885,as a critical index for irrigation scheduling plant water deficit index pwdi is defined as the ratio of water deficit to water demand to reflect the extent of abiotic stresses such as water and salinity recently smart irrigation scheduling according to pwdi thresholds to maintain desirable or acceptable stress levels has been suggested to maximize yields while minimizing negative environmental effects under non saline conditions to investigate and quantify the potential for pwdi driven irrigation on agricultural production under conditions of salinity a two year experiment with six specific thresholds was conducted in shawan of xinjiang for drip irrigated cotton under film mulch results indicated that with increasing pwdi threshold irrigation depth per event increased while irrigation frequency and total volume decreased consequently the soil water and salt environment deteriorated resulting in less nutrient uptake slower growth and lower yield and net profit with particularly high pwdi thresholds leading to serious stress conditions fiber quality was also negatively affected within a designed range of pwdi thresholds between 0 39 and 0 62 an elliptic function characterized the processes of water application yield and net profit r2 0 95 and water productivity could be described by a parabolic function r2 0 77 these quantitative results were used to provide guidelines for smart irrigation scheduling under local conditions considering water management measures and market prices of cotton for a reference market price of 7 5 cny kg 1 a pwdi threshold of 0 49 was found to optimize economic benefits while maximizing water productivity when prices of cotton are prohibitively low a lower threshold should be considered to obtain an acceptable net profit otherwise a higher threshold would be preferable to use water more efficiently further verification and improvement are necessary to deal with more complex scenarios such as considering crop sensitivity to water and salinity stresses at different growth stages and optimizing irrigation depth per event keywords water and salinity stresses irrigation scheduling drip irrigation plant water deficit index water productivity net profit 1 introduction farmers often aim at maximizing economic benefit by balancing costs and benefits of water consumption and crop productivity fernández et al 2020 consequently optimization of irrigation scheduling accounting for both economic benefits and environmental repercussions is crucial for sustainable agriculture especially in arid and semi arid regions where water scarcity and soil salinization have become seemingly insurmountable obstacles cominelli et al 2013 hopmans et al 2021 yu et al 2021 seasonal irrigation quota is typically determined by a water production function referring to an expected yield predicted rainfall and anticipated irrigation water availability subsequently irrigation timing frequency and depth are commonly determined according to local experience wang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 actual irrigation scheduling particularly concerning timing might be fine tuned according to meteorological conditions such empirical nature of irrigation scheduling leads to inevitable deviations between water supply and crop demand and subsequent less than satisfactory economic benefits or environmental repercussions hou et al 2021 wang et al 2021 owing to rapid development of technology to monitor soil crop systems irrigation scheduling based on crop water status has gained more and more attention jones 2004 candogan et al 2013 shi et al 2015 knowledge and data driven irrigation benefiting from timely and accurate evaluation of plant water status and the quantitative understanding of relationships between irrigation scheduling and outcomes have exhibited great potential in simultaneously achieving satisfactory economic benefits while reducing environmental costs wu et al 2017 shi et al 2020 2021 qin et al 2021 plant water deficit often occurs when root water uptake cannot support atmospheric transpiration demand due to abiotic stresses such as water and salinity a dimensionless coefficient quantifying stress extent namely plant water deficit index pwdi has been defined as the ratio of water deficit to water demand thornthwaite 1948 woli et al 2012 as a critical index pwdi has been widely adopted to schedule irrigation under conditions without salinity stress by weighting the effects of water in various soil layers on crop water status according to root distribution shi et al 2015 improved an approach estimating pwdi on average soil water content over the root zone this led to superior temporal provision of plant water demand via irrigation wu et al 2017 additionally through field experiments and numerical simulation the effects of utilizing a pwdi threshold to initiate irrigation on yield and water productivity were explored and quantified for drip irrigated maize shi et al 2020 2021 laying a strong foundation for smart irrigation scheduling in non saline field recently the root weighted pwdi estimation approach was extended to salinity conditions by quantifying the effects of the relative distribution of salts to roots liu et al 2022 nevertheless it remains challenging to determine reliable pwdi thresholds designed to balance economic and environmental benefits while simultaneously considering multiple objectives such as saving water regulating salinity and increasing income when irrigation scheduling is optimized crop yield and water productivity are usually considered as the main indicators evaluating economic and environmental costs and benefits kang et al 2000 kiziloglu et al 2009 kang et al 2017 while water and salinity stresses are expected to lower production they commonly enhance water productivity at least until extreme stress is reached shi et al 2020 qin et al 2021 to consider the impacts of agricultural input and output on irrigation decision making net profit is often employed as an alternative of yield matovic et al 2016 kaner et al 2019 fernández et al 2020 sushil et al 2021 to protect water resources in arid and semi arid regions trends in policy include intervention measures such as cutting down irrigation quota or area raising water price and placing limitation on water flow and solute transport out of the root zone boelens and vos 2012 grafton et al 2018 fernández et al 2020 singh et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 therefore the effects of local water management measures should also be considered when smart irrigation scheduling is applied in arid and semi arid regions as a typical arid region with annual precipitation of only 5 25 cm and evaporation of more than 100 cm xinjiang has become the biggest cotton production base in china feng et al 2017 ma et al 2022 for example in shawan a county with 1 20 105 ha of cultivated cotton production reached 5 13 108 kg in 2020 xinjiang statistics bureau 2021 while consuming about 4 19 108 m3 irrigation water yang et al 2022 beneficial from remarkable superiority in saving water and fertilizer regulating salinity and increasing yield drip irrigation under film mulch is applied for more than 87 of the cotton grown in xinjiang nevertheless rapid expansion of cultivated land and irrational irrigation scheduling aggravates water scarcity and soil salinization and about one third of arable land has been salinized chen et al 2010 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 based on the case of drip irrigated cotton under film mulch in shawan we investigated pwdi thresholds while evaluating irrigation scheduling soil water and salt dynamics nutrient uptake and soil residual and cotton growth water consumption yield and quality we further quantified the effects of pwdi thresholds on net profit and water productivity additionally the impacts of local water management and cotton prices on irrigation decision making were analyzed to provide intelligent solutions for sustainable and efficient production under conditions of salinity 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment 2 1 1 experimental conditions cotton

either groundwater or surface water for irrigation according to regional water resources since the year 2000 to conserve water resources the shawan government sets a threshold of 52 5 cm for irrigation quota for the groundwater irrigation region gwir price of water is set as 0 4 cny m 3 and over extraction is prohibited for the surface water irrigation region swir an incremental water price is implemented water costs 0 23 cny m 3 within the quota and doubles after this limit is reached for the case of the shawan cotton field scenario analysis was conducted to explore the effects of water management measures and market prices of cotton on net profit and water productivity and subsequently to provide reference for balancing economic benefits and environmental costs when smart irrigation decision was optimized the analysis methods and procedures were as follows 1 the average precipitation for the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons was used as a reference value for various scenarios 2 the average market price of cotton in 2018 and 2019 7 5 cny kg 1 was taken as a reference value 3 with the quantitative relationships between pwdi threshold and yield as well as water application irrigation and precipitation obtained in 2018 and 2019 and the local water management measures pwdi thresholds corresponding to maximum and zero net profits were estimated to determine the range of pwdi threshold for swir and gwir respectively 4 between the pwdi thresholds corresponding to the maximum and zero net benefits various scenarios were respectively set up for swir and gwir by taking 0 01 as the step of pwdi threshold and then seasonal irrigation amount water productivity and net profit under each scenario were estimated 5 for swir and gwir the results from scenarios were compared to the data averaged in 2018 and 2019 under the local traditional fertigation approach net profit was respectively re evaluated according to specific water price 6 around the reference price of cotton additional scenarios were set up with a change step of 4 with a maximum variation less than 50 to investigate the influence of cotton price on the profitability of the mentioned irrigation schemes 7 according to the analysis results smart irrigation schemes were further optimized for swir and gwir in shawan to take economic benefits and environmental costs into account simultaneously so as to evaluate the effects of local water management measures and market changes 2 3 statistical analysis microsoft excel 2013 microsoft corporation usa was used to process experimental data and

results and discussion throughout the growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 precipitation reached 12 68 and 14 79 cm respectively with 6 04 and 4 43 cm falling within the treatment period of 61 158 das figs 1 and 2 by substituting the assumed parameters ρ 1 0 and τ 1 0 with the optimized values ρ 1 15 and τ 0 9 pwdi under each treatment was re estimated daily liu et al 2022 compared to the primary estimation the re estimated pwdi was generally higher while having similar dynamics figs 1 and 2 according to the actual irrigation processes pwdi thresholds under w1 w2 and w3 in 2018 were adjusted from the primary values of 0 36 0 46 and 0 58 to 0 39 0 49 and 0 62 fig 1 liu et al 2022 and from 0 41 0 50 and 0 54 to 0 44 0 53 and 0 57 for w1 w2 and w3 in 2019 fig 2 table 2 respectively after each irrigation or rainfall event pwdi sharply decreased and then gradually increased until the next water input event different from the values close to zero in non saline field shi et al 2020 pwdi in figs 1 and 2 only dropped to 0 26 0 40 after most irrigation events since the hysteresis effect of previous stress pérez pérez et al 2007 wu et al 2020 liu et al 2022 was neglected in eq 1 the estimated pwdi reflected the real time soil water and salinity conditions when irrigation depth was estimated using eq 5 the irrigation and leaching strategies setting the target soil water content as field water capacity in the designed wetting layer 0 60 cm and taking the salinity leaching coefficient as 1 2 ensured optimal soil water conditions over 0 80 cm root zone after irrigation 80 field water capacity and thus negligible water stress feddes et al 1978 shi et al 2020 consequently the estimated pwdi immediately after an irrigation event figs 1 and 2 mainly was influenced by root zone soil salinity under local hydrogeological climatic and agricultural production conditions the average soil salt content over root zone was almost kept at a stable level of 4 19 g kg 1 and the slight difference of pwdi after irrigation might be a result of the varied salinity distributions among irrigation treatments fig 3c f or due to soil spatial variability additionally soil salinity conditions under each treatment would be immediately improved by irrigation induced lower salt concentration in soil solution and salt leaching to the deeper soil layers wang et al 2014 yu et al 2021 therefore the estimated pwdi immediately after irrigation represented a relatively low level of salinity stress under each treatment and the average of 0 33 under all treatments was taken as the basic salinity stress extent in this study 3 1 the effects of pwdi thresholds on soil crop system 1 irrigation scheduling when irrigation was triggered by pwdi lower threshold values led to more frequent application events and thus less reduction in soil water content between events since each irrigation event was programmed to return soil water within the designed wetting depth of 0 60 cm to field water capacity lower thresholds also meant lower irrigation depth per event figs 1 and 2 table 2 this is similar to results reported under non saline conditions nielsen 1990 shi et al 2020 qin et al 2021 during the treatment period in 2018 when pwdi threshold increased from 0 39 w1 to 0 49 w2 or 0 62 w3 irrigation amounts decreased from 53 85 to 40 82 or 7 57 cm with 45 25 or 4 events respectively table 2 similarly in 2019 irrigation application was 42 47 cm with 26 events under w1 0 44 and was reduced to 34 84 cm with 17 events under w2 0 53 and 19 45 cm with 8 events for w3 0 57 in general irrigation depth per event was much higher in 2019 than 2018 for instance compared to 1 89 cm under w3 the average irrigation depth of 2 43 cm per event under w3 with a 0 05 lower pwdi threshold was 28 6 higher this might be related to different soil salt distributions in the two growing seasons before an irrigation event in flowering and bolling stage 2018 86 das 2019 77 das although total salt over root zone was almost identical in contrast with w3 salt in the main root zone of 0 35 cm including most roots was 14 7 lower under w3 fig 3c d this indicates a smaller contribution of salinity stress and greater contribution of water stress when the pwdi threshold was reached eq 1 liu et al 2022 and therefore more water was needed to refill the soil to field water capacity correspondingly the average soil water content in 0 60 cm under w3 was 6 7 lower than w3 and thus the required irrigation water was 13 4 greater 2 soil water and salt dynamics thresholds of pwdi also affected soil water and salt dynamics fig 3 with increasing pwdi threshold soil water contents before irrigation tended to decrease especially in the main root zone of 0 35 cm fig 3a and b implying greater difficulty in root water uptake and more serious water stress homaee et al 2002 wang et al 2017 shi et al 2020 prior to irrigation the average soil water contents over the root zone under w1 w2 and w3 treatments in 2018 were 0 20 0 22 0 16 0 19 and 0 14 0 15 cm3 cm 3 while in 2019 corresponding values were 0 19 0 21 0 16 0 18 and 0 13 0 15 cm3 cm 3 under w1 w2 and w3 respectively this indicates that the field experiment successfully created different soil water conditions for cotton growth and production according to the pre designed scheme under all the irrigation treatments no drainage was observed from the outlets of the lysimeters and soil water and salt fluxes through the lower boundary of root zone calculated according to darcy s law were also negligible leading to almost constant salt content in root zone fig 3c f in the main root zone of 0 35 cm regardless of irrigation treatments relative to the initial value before sowing lower soil salt contents prior to the irrigation events on about 20 days after initiating treatments verified the superiority of drip irrigation under film mulch in xinjiang in creating and maintaining a shallow region relatively low in salts xu et al 2003 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 owing to higher soil water content and thus more downwards water flow salt reduction in the main root zone was more obvious under the treatment with lower pwdi threshold fig 3a d almost all the leaching salt from the upper 0 35 cm was transported into and gradually accumulated in 35 55 cm where soil salt content was higher than the initial lower pwdi thresholds resulted in more serious salt accumulation agreeing well with previous studies zhao et al 2014 chen et al 2018 compared to the flowering and bolling stage fig 3c and d during the harvesting stage fig 3e and f both salt reduction in the main root zone and salt accumulation in the middle root zone were more obvious with a downwards movement of salt content peak from 40 to 50 cm and an expansion of salt accumulation area from 35 to 55 35 75 cm consequently at a cost of more water consumption lower pwdi thresholds created more favorable soil water and salinity conditions for root water uptake and plant growth wang et al 2014 dong et al 2022 3 cotton growth transpiration yield and quality leaf water potential decreased as a function of increasing pwdi threshold value and decreasing cumulative irrigation depth fig 4 this was accompanied by less root n uptake slower growth and lower yield figs 5 and 6 these results were as anticipated resulting from root zone soil water and salt conditions fig 3 and agreed well with previous findings under non saline conditions shi et al 2020 qin et al 2021 zhu et al 2022 in 2018 the average leaf water potential prior to irrigation decreased from 1 36 w1 to 1 84 w2 and 3 41 mpa w3 which was correlated with respective sharp decreases in transpiration during the treatment period from 55 43 to 44 23 and 16 75 cm compared to w1 leaf area index aboveground dry weight and n accumulation and yield decreased 6 9 9 7 under w2 and 60 5 75 5 under w3 similarly in 2019 average leaf water potential was 1 40 mpa under w1 0 44 and significantly decreased to 1 91 mpa under w2 0 53 and 2 52 mpa under w3 0 57 corresponding transpiration was also reduced from 46 72 to 39 71 and 24 31 cm as well as decrease of 11 7 17 8 under w2 while 37 8 51 0 under w3 in leaf area index aboveground dry weight and n accumulation and yield in addition cotton fiber quality was also reported balkcom et al 2006 dagdelen et al 2009 and observed to be affected by water stress however significant decline was only found under severe stress conditions saeidi et al 2021 when pwdi thresholds were higher than 0 57 table 4 in non saline fields the yield and water consumption of drip irrigated maize were reported to be linearly decreased with increasing pwdi threshold from 0 21 to 0 71 shi et al 2020 likely due to the interaction between water and salinity stresses lier et al 2009 cotton yield and water consumption also tended to decrease with increasing pwdi threshold but in a form of elliptic functions r2 0 95 fig 6 showing a sharper decline rate than linear functions when threshold increased from 0 39 to 0 62 the quantitative relationships between pwdi threshold and yield water application demonstrated in fig 6 provides feasibility for smart irrigation scheduling under conditions of salinity for an objective yield corresponding pwdi threshold and water application can be determined to timely regulate soil water and salt conditions via irrigation or conversely yield and water demand can be predicted according to a predesigned threshold shi et al 2020 4 net profit and environmental repercussions water and salinity stresses related with higher pwdi thresholds were shown to lower yield and be detrimental to product quality and subsequently to reduce gross profit in spite of production cost savings due to less water consumption wang et al 2014 since product quality degradation only occurred under extreme stress conditions table 4 its effect on net profit was not considered in this study for the field experiment located in gwir with unrestricted irrigation quotas both irrigation cost and gross profit gradually decreased with increasing pwdi threshold table 3 since the local water price was very low the irrigation cost saved by a higher pwdi threshold could not compensate the loss in gross profit and thus farmers would be expected to be ill disposed to adopt water saving practices ørum et al 2010 wang et al 2018 an increase in pwdi threshold from 0 39 to 0 57 decreases net profit from 28 546 5 to 9976 8 cny ha 1 as an elliptic function and a loss of 5521 4 cny ha 1 occurred when the threshold rose to 0 62 fig 7 r2 0 96 to make an optimal irrigation regime environmental repercussions should be considered together with economic benefits especially in arid and semi arid areas zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 fernández et al 2020 increasing the extent of water and or salinity stress has commonly been found to increase water productivity at least until extreme stress is reached kang et al 2002 candogan et al 2013 wang et al 2014 shi et al 2020 within the designed range of pwdi thresholds between 0 39 and 0 62 water productivity firstly increased from 1 10 kg m 3 to a maximum of 1 34 kg m 3 and then decreased to 0 79 kg m 3 as a quadratic function fig 7 r2 0 77 this result is similar to results found for drip irrigated maize under non saline conditions shi et al 2020 qin et al 2021 compared to w1 at the cost of 2 9 65 1 reduction in net profit water productivity under w1 w2 w2 and w3 increased 13 2 21 5 in addition increasing pwdi threshold generally resulted in higher residual soil n concentration table 2 due to less root nutrient uptake fig 5c and f in contrast with w1 in 2018 the residual soil mineral n on the day of harvesting increased 33 1 under w2 and 170 3 under w3 when n application was cut down 30 in 2019 similar results were found with an increase of 43 7 under w2 and 123 8 under w3 relative to w1 table 2 3 2 scheduling smart irrigation under conditions of salinity due to increasing water shortage and government intervention seasonal irrigation depth for cotton cultivation in shawan decreased gradually from 52 53 cm in 2000 and remained around 35 00 cm in the last five years yang et al 2022 in this study a total of 40 59 and 31 84 cm irrigation water was supplied for ck in 2018 and ck in 2019 respectively and all the corresponding indexes during the treatment periods such as irrigation application 33 45 and 28 09 cm and frequency 9 and 8 times soil water and salt conditions average leaf water potential prior to irrigation events 2 15 and 2 22 mpa transpiration consumption 40 68 and 36 54 cm leaf area index aboveground dry weight and n accumulation yield 4833 1 and 4503 8 kg ha 1 fiber quality indicators net profit 17 234 4 and 15 288 9 cny ha 1 water productivity 1 09 and 1 13 kg m 3 and residual soil mineral n contents 250 6 and 261 8 kg ha 1 fell between those of w2 and w3 and w2 and w3 figs 1 5 tables 2 4 these results indicate that there is significant room for improving the economic benefits and environmental costs of local cotton production by triggering irrigation according pwdi estimation and pre designed threshold compared to the traditional regime the w1 w2 and w2 treatments not only increased net profit by 47 8 81 3 but also raised water productivity by 10 7 14 7 owing to more precise regulation of soil water and salinity conditions to timely meet water demand of cotton especially at critical growth stages shi et al 2020 liao et al 2021 liu et al 2022 for instance at the flowering and bolling stage 69 113 das when cotton is very sensitive to water and salinity stresses drip irrigation was applied 19 times with 30 86 cm 17 times with 28 76 cm and 13 times with 26 39 cm under w1 w2 and w2 treatments respectively figs 1 and 2 corresponding to 83 3 97 5 of potential reference crop evapotranspiration estimated by penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 however cotton was watered only six times with a total of 22 50 cm and five times with 15 92 cm under ck and ck treatments representing only 50 3 69 1 of potential reference crop evapotranspiration and apparently unsuitable for potential yield or water productivity doorenbos 1977 li et al 2016 in practice to use water resources efficiently in arid and semi arid areas such as shawan local water management measures and market prices of agricultural products should be considered when irrigation scheduling is optimized wang et al 2014 fernández et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 according to limited irrigation quotas and the quantitative functions in figs 6 and 7 for gwir in shawan 18 irrigation scenarios based on minimum and maximum pwdi thresholds of 0 44 with a maximum allowable irrigation amount of 52 5 cm and 0 61 zero net profit were evaluated fig 8a similarly for swir without any irrigation quota restriction 29 irrigation scenarios based on a minimum pwdi threshold of 0 33 i e the basic salinity stress extent and a maximum of 0 61 were assessed fig 8b as expected net profit was found to decrease with increasing pwdi threshold and maximums of 27 651 7 and 35 325 1 cny ha 1 could be achieved for gwir and swir when pwdi thresholds were set as 0 44 and 0 33 respectively equal to 1 7 and 2 1 times the income from the traditional regime the corresponding water productivities would be 1 28 and 0 63 kg m 3 equal to 115 4 and 56 9 of the traditional regime fig 8 obviously in swir the considerable economic benefits come with unacceptable environmental costs and therefore a low pwdi threshold such as 0 33 would not be feasible for agricultural sustainable development zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 whether in gwir or swir a pwdi threshold of 0 49 coinciding with w2 would result in considerable economic benefit maximum water productivity and acceptable residual soil mineral n content about 1 4 fig 8 1 2 fig 7 and 1 0 table 2 times that of the traditional management respectively in this case the income from the cotton fields of gwir 3 45 104 ha and swir 8 51 104 ha in shawan would increase 2 45 108 and 6 13 108 cny with additional irrigation water consumption of 2 91 107 and 7 18 107 m3 respectively conversely to achieve the average net profit in 2018 and 2019 from the traditional regime 16 261 7 cny ha 1 pwdi thresholds in gwir and swir could be set as 0 55 with a water productivity of 1 26 kg m 3 and a seasonal irrigation depth of 33 62 cm and 3 10 107 m3 water would be saved in shawan within the pwdi threshold range of 0 44 0 61 owing to lower water price net profits in swir were always 216 846 cny ha 1 higher than gwir for any given pwdi threshold in gwir or swir net profit would gradually increase when the market price of cotton is raised from 3 9 52 of the reference price to 11 1 cny kg 1 148 moreover for any price when pwdi threshold increases from the minimum to the maximum net profit still decreases as an elliptical function fig 8 therefore in gwir or swir irrigation scheduling and or water management measures should be adjusted appropriately according to cotton price to obtain acceptable combinations of economic benefits and environmental costs matovic et al 2016 sinha et al 2017 if prices are too low a low pwdi threshold should be chosen to obtain a relatively satisfactory net profit by consuming a great deal of water inefficiently otherwise if selling prices are relatively high maximal net profit should not be pursued blindly and a high pwdi threshold should be adopted to improve water productivity reduce water consumption figs 6 8 and minimize environmental repercussions in recent years with the continuous increase of global population and development of society demand for cotton and its market price have risen if the market price of cotton would reach 11 1 cny kg 1 the average net profit under the traditional regime in 2018 and 2019 could be obtained if pwdi thresholds were set as 0 59 and 0 60 for gwir and swir respectively this would result in a subsequent consumption of irrigation water of only 23 54 and 20 42 cm and 1 78 108 m3 savings of water in shawan in view of the limitation of experimental conditions only six pwdi thresholds within a small range 0 39 0 62 were evaluated in this study it therefore might be unreliable to apply the fitted results widely especially in the untested threshold ranges of 0 0 39 and 0 62 1 0 the experiment data indicate that besides water stress a low pwdi threshold could also relieve salinity stress by removing salts from the active root zone fig 3 however due to the total salt in root zone the extent of relief from salinity stress by adjusting the pwdi threshold may be limited thus in contrast to non saline conditions shi et al 2020 it might be challenging to maximize yield by setting a pwdi threshold close to zero unless other measures such as salt leaching are applied therefore to understand the effects of pwdi thresholds on crop yield water productivity and net profit under saline conditions more comprehensively and further optimize irrigation scheduling it is necessary to set more scenarios through experiments or simulations shi et al 2021 besides pwdi thresholds potential approaches might include optimization of irrigation depth per event by adjusting the parameters in eq 5 such as the designed wetting depth the salt leaching coefficient or the objective soil water content feng et al 2021 ning et al 2021 che et al 2022 additionally while the effects of water and salinity stresses on plant water status and growth vary significantly among different growth stages the pwdi thresholds in this study were kept constant inconsistent with plant physiological water saving mechanisms munns 2002 abdelraheem et al 2019 consequently it is also necessary to further investigate how to optimize pwdi thresholds and irrigation scheduling according to the difference of plant sensitivity to water and salinity stresses at various growth stages 4 conclusions by influencing irrigation scheduling changes in pwdi thresholds significantly affected soil water and salt dynamics nutrient uptake and soil residual crop growth water consumption yield product quality net profit and water productivity under conditions of salinity lower pwdi thresholds led to higher irrigation frequency and more seasonal water application which were beneficial to root zone soil conditions and crop production the choice of pwdi threshold is therefore crucial especially in arid and semi arid areas where water resources are scarce and soil salinization can be prominent to support the sustainable development of agriculture resulting from six specific scenarios in a two year field experiment the quantitative relationships between pwdi threshold and water application yield net profit and water productivity support intelligent decision making for irrigation of cotton under conditions of salinity for a reference price of cotton of 7 5 cny kg 1 a pwdi threshold of 0 49 was recommended in both gwir and swir to achieve considerable simultaneously economic and environmental benefits for prohibitive low cotton prices a lower pwdi threshold should be chosen to obtain a relatively satisfactory net profit at the cost of more water consumption and lower water productivity otherwise an acceptable but not maximal net profit is encouraged by applying a relatively high pwdi threshold to improve water productivity and reduce negative environmental repercussions due to the limitation of experimental conditions the quantitative results from this study should be further verified and improved by setting more experiment or simulation scenarios future work should focus on recognizing and using the difference of plant sensitivity to water and salinity stresses at various growth stages and optimizing irrigation depth per event by adjusting relevant impact factors in addition to pwdi threshold declaration of competing interest the authors declare that we have no

8886,agricultural drainage increases hydrological connectivity between fields and receiving environments tile drains and drainage ditches are the main drainage types studied at the field scale they can be associated with temporary surface drains to improve the removal of surface water combining surface drains with tile drains is likely to modify surface runoff and soil water dynamics the behaviour of tile drained fields has been studied at the event scale but few studies have been conducted over a full hydrological year and no studies have quantified water volumes in a field combining surface and tile drainage so quantifications of water partition between surface drainage tile drainage and soil water are needed to understand the hydrological behaviour of a field combining surface and tile drains moreover at the event scale few studies showed macropores can contribute to tile drain runoff but the partition between preferential flow and matrix flow is still unclear it needs to be study depending on several parameters as soil type soil water content or agricultural practice for a better understanding in this study high temporal resolution quantification of surface runoff and tile drainage was conducted for two full hydrological years to study hydrological functioning of the field using the water balance for a drained field soil water pathways were studied under dry and saturated soil conditions tracing water by measuring stable isotope 18o and 2h concentrations in rainwater soil water and surface and tile runoff runoff quantification showed that surface drainage and tile drainage respectively transferred 44 and 20 of annual effective rainfall however water balance showed that at the annual scale 65 of infiltrating water was not captured by tile drains at the event scale water tracing showed a season variation in macropores contribution depending on soil hydric state under dry conditions rainwater was directly transferred to tile drains likely through macropores on saturated soil pre event soil water content provided most of the water flowing out from the tile drain but rainfall can contribute up to 25 of the water flowing out from the tile drains combining water balance and water trancing allowed to propose a conceptual model for surface and tile drainage hydrological functioning at the event scale keywords tile drain surface drainage water balance water tracers soil water pathways data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction tile drainage constitutes an artificial water pathway that directly links subsoil to surface water and increases water connectivity thus tile drainage contributes to the eutrophication of receiving environments via transfer of nitrate arlot 1999 gilliam and skaggs 1986 and phosphate chapman et al 2001 king et al 2015a sims et al 1998 moreover it is a pathway for pesticides especially via preferential flow through macropores resulting in pollution and contamination of receiving environments blann et al 2009 haria et al 1994 harris et al 1994 since the 1950 s production oriented agricultural policies have led to draining hydromorphic soils to increase the area of cultivated land and its yield musgrave 1994 according to recent data from the international commission on irrigation and drainage 2018 11 of arable lands worldwide are drained two types of drainage are commonly used drainage by digging ditches at the edge of the field and tile drainage by laying buried pipes at the field scale in temperate climates the functioning of tile drains is generally highly seasonal arlot 1999 gramlich et al 2018 hirt et al 2011 king et al 2014 the decrease in evapotranspiration during the fall leads to the formation of a saturated zone in the hydromorphic soils and this usually lasts from fall to spring therefore during this period runoff coefficients are at their maximum and tile drains flow continuously during the rest of the year drains only flow during intense storm events arlot 1999 zimmer 1988 tile drainage has been shown to reduce surface runoff for example arlot 1999 compared drained and non drained fields with cambisol on altered shale and showed that tile drainage decreased surface runoff by a factor 10 20 accounting for 90 of total runoff grazhdani et al 1996 studied clay loam fields and showed that tile drainage increased the water yield by 34 but reduced surface runoff by 40 however in this study tile drain contribution to total runoff varied from 47 to 69 depending on drain spacing in lowland agricultural regions tile drainage can be complemented by surface drainage by digging surface drainage rills surface drains are temporary they are installed after seeding and destroyed by the first tillage following harvest this type of drainage modifying the natural pathways improves the transfer of surface water and guides surface runoff surface drainage is therefore likely to modify the hydrological functioning of the field however to our knowledge no hydrological study has been carried out on fields combining surface drainage rills and tile drains studies at the soil profile scale drained contexts have shown that macropores are an important pathway for both dissolved transfers king et al 2015b and solid transfers michaud et al 2019 øygarden et al 1997 understanding the pathways of water flow in drained soils is essential to reduce the negative impacts of drainage water flow in soil can be categorised as two types flow through the soil matrix skopp 1981 and flow through macropores jarvis 2007 mcdonnell 1990 richard and steenhuis 1988 matrix flow is generally slower than macropore flow which is qualified as preferential flow macropores can have biological or structural origin and are distinguished from the rest of the porosity by the heterogeneity of their distribution vertical and lateral their large diameter and their strong connectivity geochemical tracing experiments and observation of water flow paths through the use of brilliant blue tracing has highlighted the role of macropores in the hydrological functioning of drains stamm et al 2002 this study showed that macropores enhance connectivity between the soil surface and drains using bromide tracing everts and kanwar 1990 performed two irrigation experiments and found that 29 and 20 of the total volume flowing out of the drain was from a preferential flow stone and wilson 2006 used chloride tracing and measured a preferential flow contribution of 11 and 51 during two rainfall events after two years of isotopic monitoring leaney et al 1993 estimated that preferential flow accounted for at least 80 of tile drain flows these studies underline the difficulty that persists in predicting the relative contribution of preferential flow from drains during rainfall events a few studies have therefore explored the factors influencing the functioning of macropores for example grant et al 2019 used brilliant blue to trace the water pathways taken in two types of soil to explore the influence of soil type on the flow of water through macropores the preferential flow in a clay soil was greater than in a sandy silt soil in addition to soil properties the functioning of macropores seems to be linked to the hydric state of the soil using three fluorobenzoic acids and bromide kung et al 2000 showed that preferential flow contribution to tile drain flow depends on the soil moisture consequently prethese results were confirmed by weiler and naef 2003 that used brilliant blue tracing experiments combined with high temporal resolution soil moisture measurements weiler and naef 2003 showed that water circulation in macropores depends on the soil water content and permeability of the soil matrix the higher the soil matrix is permeable and unsaturated the higher transfer of water from matrix to macropores smith and capel 2018 monitored the specific conductance of water at the drain outlet and showed that even a light rainfall 5 mm can lead to a preferential flow of rainwater through macropores most previous studies concerning water flow in a drained context are generally limited to a few rainfall events uncertainties remain on the distribution between matrix and preferential flow according to the hydric state of the soil hence it is preferable to determine the type of water flow in drained soils throughout the year particularly regarding variations in the hydric state of the soil moreover addition of surface drainage to tile drainage is likely to increase the complexity of the hydrological functioning of the field however this complexity has been rarely explored in order to investigate these phenomena the present study was conducted to quantify surface and tile drain contributions to establish the water balance of a drained field and thus improve our knowledge of hydrological processes in a drained field identify general conditions affecting runoff generation processes for surface drains and tile drains understand seasonal changes at the surface and tile drains functioning under natural conditions over the course of a full hydrological year to establish the water balance of a drained field surface drain flow tile drain flow and soil hydric state were monitored in an agricultural field over 2 years combining surface and tile drainage monitoring of flows and soil hydric state were performed at high temporal resolution in order to compare runoff dynamics at the event scale depending on the season finally water pathways in soil according to the hydric state were investigated through isotopic tracing of water during a winter runoff event and a spring runoff event 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site was a 5 ha cultivated

draining soil to allow water transfers from b1 to tile drains according to the original map of the tile drain network design the main collector drains 83 4 2 ha of the field it collects the runoff from 34 tile drains and pours it into the ditch at the north of the field the collector output is 16 cm above the bottom of the ditch and is sometimes submerged during runoff events the second drain

min intervals with an original device developed especially for this study fig 2b an ultraflux minisonic 2000 doppler radar device ultraflux éragny sur oise france was placed on a horizontal pvc siphon installed at the main drain collector output this setup allows flow monitoring without flow modification and measurements even when the drain collector output is under water a common situation in this region the soil hydric state was measured using both the matrix potential and the water level of the soil temporary saturated zone the matrix potential was monitored from the end of november 2019 to the end of june 2020 the matrix potential was monitored on one point every 10 min with autonomous watermark tensiometers irrometer co riverside ca usa around the middle of the field at different depths and distances throughout the drainage system location of the set is showed in fig 1 specifically four tensiometer sets were installed at within 0 5 1 5 2 5 and 5 m of a tile drain axis for each set soil water potential was automatically measured at 15 30 and 45 cm depths five manual tensiometers were set up to check autonomous records to identify moments when the upper limit of the saturated zone is in the superficial horizon a the water level of temporary saturated zone was measured at 10 spots spread across the field from mid december 2019 to june 2020 at 10 min intervals using mini diver probes schlumberger water service compensated for atmospheric pressure using baro divers fig 1 the measurement accuracy was 1 cm h2o mini diver probes were installed in piezometers at 40 cm depth their locations were chosen using stratified random sampling and some probes were placed at interdrains above the clayey horizon 2 2 2 fieldwork sampling and isotopic analyses a sampling strategy was optimised to investigate the different soil water pathways under different hydrodynamic conditions during several runoff events rainfall surface runoff tile drain runoff and soil water were sampled at short time intervals 1 3 h two runoff events including a high sampling density were used to illustrate the methodology the first event a occurred during the intense drainage period february 2 2020 the second event b occurred in late spring may 10 2020 rainfall was sampled from a rain collector setup next to the rain gauge rainfall was collected every 2 weeks moreover during a runoff event rainfall was collected only during the rainfall event to be representative of the event surface and tile drain runoff water were collected using two automatic samplers fig 2a b whose sampling frequency was automatically adjusted for each event depending on the runoff rate soil water was sampled using ceramic cups with depressions of 800 mbar generated by a manual vacuum pump ceramic cups were placed as follows four ceramic cups 15 30 45 and 80 cm depth were placed on a line parallel to the tile drain at a distance of 5 5 m and two ceramic cups at 30 cm depth were placed 2 m and at 3 5 m away from the drain axis soil water was not sampled during dry periods due to the low soil water content samples were filtered at the laboratory through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane within 24 h of sampling stable isotopes of water were analysed by laser spectrometry with a picarro l2120 i instrument picarro santa clara ca usa the results are reported using conventional notation δ as a deviation from the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and the analytical error for 18o and 2h were lower than 0 2 and 0 7 respectively local meteoric water line lmwl was determined from rainwater sampled between october 2018 to october 2020 39 rainwater samples r² 0 97 and calculated follows 1 δ 2 h 7 46 δ 18 o 5 61 the δ18o and δ2h composition of rainwater soil water surface and tile drain runoff were determined at early time intervals during a storm event in order to identify water sources and pathways no evaporation processes could be identified from the isotopic signatures fig 7 therefore variability of isotopic signature was due to hydrological factors such as a change in water origin or mixing conditions during an event for each component rainwater soil water surface and tile drain runoff δ18o and δ2h variations were similar so only δ18o variations are presented in the present study 2 3 rainfall and runoff event separation rainfall events were defined according to musy et al 2014 during the study period no runoff event was generated from a rainfall event lower than 0 6 mm the minimal duration between two runoff event peaks was 2 h 20 so a rainfall event is considered if 0 6 mm of rain fall during less than 2 h 20 a surface drain and a tile drain runoff event were identified when a peak flow was measured in total 353 rainfall events 85 surface runoff events and 106 tile drain runoff events were identified lag time used in this study was defined as the time between rainfall event peak and discharge peak 2 4 water balance model in the case of a small intensively instrumented experimental study area such as the studied field it is possible to determine the water balance for research purposes ward and robinson 2000 in this study determining water balance aimed to improve our knowledge of hydrological processes in a drained field water balance at the field scale is defined as follows 2 s a b 1 s b 2 r et d where δsa b1 is the change in soil water content in a and b1 horizons mm d δsb2 is the change in soil water content in the b2 horizon above and below the tile drain mm d that is dependent on infiltration from b1 to b2 and evapotranspiration r is the rainfall mm d et is the etc evapotranspiration mm d and d is the drainage factor mm d i e the sum of surface and tile drain runoffs in this model we assume that the water content in a and b1 horizons ranges between saturation sat and permanent wilting point pwp water content of all horizon were initialised at the permanent wilting point if the rainfall is higher than etc water is firstly stored in the a and b1 horizons then to the b2 horizon depending on the soil water conditions in a and b1 horizons in the same way if the etc is higher than the rainfall the water losses firstly came from the a and b1 horizons then from the b2 horizon water balance was applied daily from the 1st september 2019 following a period of 24 days without rainfall the 1st september 2019 the soil water content was assumed to be equal to the permanent wilting point for all soil horizons the average field capacity permanent wilting point and resulting maximum water content mwc of surface and subsurface horizons were estimated using the pedotransfer function developed by saxton et al 1986 as a function of grain size table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of intense drainage periods the total rainfall depth was 722 mm and 739 mm during 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 respectively in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 the total runoff depth was 137 4 mm and 173 7 mm with a tile drain contribution of 63 3 mm 46 and 35 3 mm 20 respectively the hydrological year can be separated into two periods depending on the tile drain discharge characteristics figs 3 4 6 as proposed by zimmer 1988 an intense drainage period when tile drain discharge presents a continuous flow resulting in a base flow fig 4 and a low drainage period when there is no tile drain base flow in the present study the intense drainage periods occurred between november 2019 and mid march 2020 and between december 2020 and mid february 2021 figs 4 and 6 during the two intense drainage periods 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 the average tile drain base flow was 0 1 l s 1 fig 4 the runoff flow was unevenly distributed during the hydrological year with the intense drainage period accounting for 95 of surface runoff in both 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 and for 98 and 88 of the tile drain runoff in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 respectively 3 2 soil water hydric states providing intense drainage period the calculation of the water balance realized for a field combining surface drainage rills and tile drainage showed 64 table 3 of water reaching horizon b2 are not drained by the tile drain network but stored in horizon b2 in 2019 2020 and in 2020 2021 the intense drainage period started when the water content of the horizons a and b1 was close to the saturation point fig 5 d 4 days and 7 days before respectively therefore on the study field that has a low depth clay horizon and tile drains installed in this horizon the intense drainage period began when water content of surface horizons reached the saturation along the intense drainage period according to water balance calculations a and b1 horizons were close to the saturation the maximum deviation from the saturation was 6 4 mm and 0 8 mm in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 respectively this is consistent with the hydric state measurement of the soil in 2019 2020 fig 5 b the minimal soil water potential measured during the intense drainage period was 5 43 cbar at 15 cm depth this hydric state of the horizons suggests that tile drain runoff generation was caused by slow water transfer such as matrix flow and that surface runoff generation may be caused by soil surface saturation in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 the end of the intense drainage period occurred as soon as the water content of horizons a and b1 were no longer at the saturation even if the b2 horizon remained at the field capacity in 2019 2020 soil water potential at 15 cm depth decreased rapidly from mid march 2020 fig 5 b consistent with water balance showing a rapid decrease in the water content of horizons a and b1 therefore saturation of surface horizons seems a necessary condition to tile drain runoff however in 2019 2020 and in 2020 2021 tile drain runoff was observed after the intense drainage period when the water balance indicated that horizons a and b1 were not at the saturation this suggest that outside of the intense drainage period other processes of runoff generation occur indeed crop development and the intensity of evapotranspiration mean that water losses must simultaneously certainly affect both a b1 and b2 horizons and not a b1 firstly as the model do in addition the presence of cracks significantly modifies the distribution of water in the soil koivusalo et al 1999 and may lead to direct flow to b2 water balance is well adapted to intense drainage and show that the water content of the horizons are determinant to start and stop the intense drainage period however the water balance seems less adapted to the low drainage period runoff has been measured when soil water content is below the saturation and in some case below the field capacity according to the water balance this suggest that runoff generation processes during the low drainage period are different than during the intense drainage period furthermore the seasonal contrast in the soil water content in the superficial horizons suggest changes in soil structure that may have consequences for soil water pathways 3 3 seasonal variations of surface and tile drainage dynamics 3 3 1 rainfall characteristics inducing runoff drainage during the intense drainage periods of 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 54 and 81 respectively of rainfall events induced surface and or tile drain runoff whereas during the low drainage period only 3 of rainfall events produced a surface and or tile drain runoff fig 6 during the intense drainage period low intensity 2 4 mm h and low cumulative 0 6 mm rainfall events can generate runoff making the drainage system particularly reactive during the low drainage period only five rainfall events generated runoff all of which were spring or summer storms their average rainfall was 26 7 mm 16 8 mm with a minimum of 8 8 mm and an average maximal rainfall intensity of 47 5 mm h 22 3 mm h with a minimum of 14 4 mm h during the low drainage period eight other rainfall events showed similar characteristics but did not generate runoff therefore runoff events that occurred during the low drainage period are generated by rainfall events combining high cumulative rainfall 8 8 mm and high rainfall intensities 14 4 mm h 3 3 2 seasonal variations of surface drainage runoff events in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 94 of surface runoff events occurred during the intense drainage period table 4 this is typical for cultivated fields and it is explained by the importance of effective rainfall during autumn and winter associated with a degraded soil surface state le bissonnais et al 2005 during the low drainage period the average peak flow of the surface runoff is two times higher than that during the intense drainage period moreover during the intense drainage period the average surface runoff coefficient is eight times higher than the average of events occurring during the low drainage period these differences in peak flow and runoff coefficient can be explained by the soil surface state which is generally rougher during spring and summer le bissonnais et al 2005 and by the soil hydric state during summer surface runoff is only caused by excess infiltration whereas during winter soil saturation may generate runoff 3 3 3 seasonal variations of tile drain runoff events from september 2019 to september 2021 106 tile drain runoff events occurred and 96 occurred during intense drainage periods according to the measurement of soil water potential during 2019 2020 the soil was already saturated at 15 30 and 45 cm depths in mid november it stayed saturated at 15 cm depth until mid march and stayed saturated at 45 cm depth until mid april a short period in mid january was characterised by a slight decrease in water potential in the topsoil due to 10 days without rainfall moreover between mid november date of installation of the mini diver probes and mid march the saturated zone was at 30 cm or higher below the soil surface for 75 of the time this suggests a constant water pressure remaining above the tile drain network during the intense drainage period which can explain the reaction of the tile drain network to low rainfall 0 6 mm events during this period during the intense drainage period the event runoff coefficients runoff volume divided by rainfall volume of tile drains were 10 times higher than those occurring during the low drainage period table 5 this can be explained by the soil hydric state during spring and summer the soil water content is low hence the soil stores most of the rainfall and et can be considered negligible during short and intense rainfall events in 2019 2020 the soil water potential started to decrease around mid march at the end of march and at the beginning of april at 15 30 and 45 cm depths respectively this period corresponds to a decrease in the effective rainfall and was correlated with the end of the intense drainage period measurement of the depth of the saturated zone confirmed these results from mid march the saturated zone was present only when intense rainfall events occurred and was always more than 14 cm below the soil surface from april cracks progressively appeared at the soil surface consistent with a decrease in soil water potential and that can affect soil water pathways specifically cracks increase the hydro connectivity between the soil surface and the tile drains therefore as shown by the water balance tile drain runoff can occur even if horizons a and b1 are not at the field capacity during the low drainage period 3 4 seasonal variability of water pathways 3 4 1 water pathways during the intense drainage period event a 02 02 2020 was a typical runoff event of the intense drainage period with pre event soil saturation at 5 cm below the surface a surface runoff preceding the tile drain runoff 22 min time lag and a high runoff coefficient 76 combined tile plus surface drainage table 6 during event a the isotopic composition of rain soil water tile drain and surface runoff was significantly different fig 7 surface and tile water isotopic composition analysis revealed that they were composed of soil water and rainfall in different proportions fig 7 a two end member mixing analysis emma pinder and jones 1969 has been applied using isotopic signatures to estimate the proportion of soil water and rainwater contributing to the surface and tile drain runoffs the soil water composition was assumed to be similar to that of tile drain runoff water before the runoff event this assumption is supported by the fact that the δ18o value 6 9 0 2 fig 7 fig 8 of the tile drain runoff before the event was close to that of the soil water δ18o 6 8 0 2 figs 7 and 8 the surface runoff signature is not equal to the rainwater signature showing surface runoff is not only composed by rainwater but also by pre event soil water the variation δ18o of surface runoff from 4 9 0 2 to 4 2 0 2 figs 7 and 8 indicates variations in surface drainage runoff composition at the beginning of the event surface drainage runoff is composed of 45 of rainwater and it is composed of 62 of rainwater at the moment of the last sample the tile runoff isotopic composition also varied during storm events fig 8 highlighting the variability in the relative contributions of soil water and rainfall indeed at the peak discharge the δ18o of tile drain runoff is significantly different than the pre event soil water and tends toward that the δ18o rainfall at the maximal discharge the rainwater contribution reaching 30 then δ18o of tile drain runoff decreases showing the proportion of rainwater in tile drain runoff decreased at the end of the event tile drain runoff is composed of 80 of soil water therefore at the event scale the surface and tile drain runoff were composed of 40 and 75 of pre event soil water and 60 and 25 of rainwater respectively during event a alongside slow soil water rapid transfer of rainwater occurred demonstrating the significance of preferential flows during the intense drainage period in previous studies culley et al 1983 cullum 2009 radcliffe et al 2015 water reaching tile drains was composed of both types of flows coulomb and dever 1994 had already observed this type of transfers in a clay soil at the beginning of the intense drainage season but they didn t observed it in the middle of the intense drainage period reportedly due to the collapse and saturation of macropores basing on irrigation experiment kung et al 2000 showed preferential flows could be active even under humid conditions results of the present study suggest that macroporosity is still present in the middle of the intense drainage period facilitating rapid transfer of rainwater even if the soil is saturated however the contribution of macropores to tile drain runoff is highly variable depending on the context of the study and this needs to be better characterized for example cullum 2009 observed that matrix fluxes represented up to 90 of water flux on silty soil plots meanwhile nazari et al 2021 observed a near equal contribution of the two types of flows in a clay silt soil plot this variability including the present study can be explained by differences in macroporosity characteristics that depend on freeze thaw cycles clay swelling and shrinkage ground glass activity and cultural practices jarvis et al 2016 concerning surface runoff isotope water tracing showed that surface runoff is a mix of both soil water and rainwater presence of rainwater may be due to infiltration excess and presence of soil water suggest saturation runoff process it could be explain by an increase in the saturated zone level or by saturation of the first centimeters of soil resulting in lateral soil water flows haria et al 1994 specified that a lateral flow circulated over an impeding layer in the present case there was no impeding layer but similar processes may occur stamm et al 2002 showed that lateral flows can occur near the soil surface in horizon a in a loamy soil such a process could explain the significant proportion of soil water in the surface runoff in addition lateral flow may also flow directly into a ditch at the edge of the field 3 4 2 water pathways during the low drainage period event b 05 11 2020 was typical of the low drainage period with a low soil water content soil water potential was 45 cbar at 45 cm depth a tile runoff preceding surface runoff 1 9 h time lag and a low runoff coefficient 9 according to the depth of the saturated measured by the diver probes and to the soil water content calculated from the water balance model before the rainfall event figs 4 and 7 the soil water content is below the field capacity so rainwater is the only possible source for both surface and tile drain runoff moreover measurements of the saturated zone depth show surface runoff was not caused by saturation but was only generated by infiltration excess during event b the surface runoff δ18o ranged from 4 9 0 2 to 3 8 0 2 fig 8 as rainwater is the only possible source for surface runoff any δ18o variation indicates a δ18o variation of rainwater therefore even if the rainwater signature was only measured as the average signature of the entire rainfall event surface runoff signature variations can be interpreted as the copy of the rainwater signature variations concerning the tile drain runoff during event b the tile drain runoff δ18o value was almost constant ranging from 4 9 0 2 to 4 6 0 2 at the beginning of event b tile drain runoff signature was similar to the surface runoff signature but during the event tile drain and surface drain signature progressively became significantly different two hypothesis can explain it i tile drain runoff is a mixed of rainwater and of soil water or ii rainwater signature varied during the rainfall event and a part of the rainwater come to the drain with a significant delay the similarity between surface and tile drain runoff signatures is inconsistent with the first hypothesis but considering rainwater is the only possible source both for tile drain and surface runoff differences in signature variations could be explained by the spatio temporal dynamic of water in soil water transfers from surface to tile drain are faster in the vicinity of the drain axis than at the inter drain therefore at the beginning of the event water that composed tile drain runoff should come from the surface at the vicinity of the drain axis andit should generate a tile drain runoff with the same signature than the surface runoff rainwater fell at the interdrain should arrive with a delay this delay can be explained by the longer way to go from the inter drain to the tile drain so during the event the tile drain runoff should be made of rainwater fallen at the vicinity of the tile drain axis but also from rainwater fallen at the inter drain therefore at a given moment during the event the tile drain runoff signature is a mix of the signature of the rainwater fallen recently after this moment and of the signature of the rainwater fallen earlier at the interdrain during the low drainage period soil moisture is constantly low under field capacity fig 4 however the studied event showed that a sufficiently intense event can generate surface and tile drain runoff for such events tile drain runoff starts before surface runoff proving that the process of rainwater transfer to tile drains is faster than the generation of surface runoff there are two possible reasons i the presence of wheat cover may slow surface runoff ii preferential vertical flow through macropores isotopic measurements support the hypothesis of preferential flow through the macroporosity but our results do not support any conclusion about the soil cover effect on surface runoff moreover cracks present at the soil surface before the event constitute a macroporosity that can support direct water transfer from the soil surface to tile drains 3 5 conceptual model of hydrological processes of a drained field water pathways through cracks presented in conceptual models haria et al 1994 showed that sub surface lateral flow can occur in the first 30 cm above the saturated zone of the horizon a thus our conceptual model of water pathways is similar to previous conceptual models but it is the first for a field combining surface and tile drainage moreover it is the first to separate pre event soil water and rainfall event water to determine the expected composition of runoff rainfall runoff events for intense drainage and low drainage periods can be described in four steps fig 9 during the intense drainage period 1 before rainfall events a saturated zone is present and tile drains already flow before rainfall events tile drain water is only composed of pre event soil water which is a mix of previous rainwaters according to the water balance the soil is close to the saturation 2 surface runoff starts and the saturated zone level rises due to an increase in the water content of the topsoil rainwater is rapidly transferred to tile drains through the soil macroporosity rainfall event water increases the pressure on pre event soil water hence tile drain flow increases tile drain flow increases progressively and contains both pre event soil water and event rainwater 3 drainage of the saturated zone if close enough to the surface the saturated zone can overflow and contribute to the surface drainage system tile drain runoff still contains pre event soil water and event rainwater but the proportion of pre event soil water decreases 4 end of the event the saturated zone is progressively drained by the tile drain system surface runoff stops within a few hours tile drain runoff decreases progressively to its pre event flow during the low drainage period fig 9 1 before rainfall events soil moisture is very low and cracks are visible at the soil surface 2 runoff initiation and formation of local saturated zones surface runoff is reduced by crop cover only intense rainfall events can generate surface runoff moreover as other study on clay soil showed e g nazari et al 2021 øygarden et al 1997 cracks could be preferential pathways for rainwater from the soil surface to tile drains therefore tile drainage can begin before or at the same time as surface runoff a saturated zone is formed deep in the soil 3 drainage of the saturated zone the saturated zone is quickly drained by tile drains cracks collapse and are clogged by soil particles eroded from surface soil or form the sides of cracks 4 end of the event runoff stops quickly after the end of rainfall the saturated zone is no longer present after the end of the event the size and width of some cracks are reduced 4 conclusion in this study the water balance of a surface and tile drained field was determined for two successive years quantification of surface and tile drain fluxes can reveal the characteristics of flows of drained fields in our case the period of intense drainage extended from november to march during the first year and from december to february during the second year during both the first and second year it corresponds to a period during which the saturated zone was close to the soil surface during this period most of the tile flow was due to a slow matrix flow of water into the soil but macroporosity seemed to be active and contributed to up to 30 of the tile drain flow thus it appears that rapid flows of water from soil to tile drains occurs throughout the year regardless of the hydric state of the soil when the entire soil profile is saturated a slow matrix flow of water from the soil to the drains occurred and remained dominant as long as the soil moisture content was close to the saturation runoff by surface drainage appeared to be mainly due to saturation excess runoff but water from the first few centimetres of soil was transferred to surface drainage rills if the saturated zone approached the soil surface moreover according to the water balance 36 of water transiting through the soil infiltrated into the deep horizon b2 at the end of the intense drainage period the water content of the surface horizons a and b1 decreased below the saturation resulting in the discontinuation of base flow for tile drainage after the intense drainage period tile drains and surface drains only operated during intense rainfall events however tile drain flow is from a preferential flow through macropores while runoff by surface drainage rills is only due to an infiltration excess calculation of the water balance proposed in this study makes it possible to predict the start and the end of the intense drainage in a field combined surface drainage rills and tile drains provided that the variability of soils and the characteristics of the drainage networks of the other fields in the watershed are taken into account the simplicity of setting up this model should make it possible to extrapolate it to other fields moreover according to the soil hydric state water source variations in tile drain runoff may be one of the factors explaining the variation in dissolved and solid transfers over the year in drained systems concerning runoff by surface drainage rills in addition to the runoff processes usually occurring in drained fields there is a lateral flow of water from the soil to surface drains when the saturated zone reaches the depth of surface drains this flow is therefore likely to be associated with the transfer of dissolved substances stored in the first few centimetres of soil

8886,agricultural drainage increases hydrological connectivity between fields and receiving environments tile drains and drainage ditches are the main drainage types studied at the field scale they can be associated with temporary surface drains to improve the removal of surface water combining surface drains with tile drains is likely to modify surface runoff and soil water dynamics the behaviour of tile drained fields has been studied at the event scale but few studies have been conducted over a full hydrological year and no studies have quantified water volumes in a field combining surface and tile drainage so quantifications of water partition between surface drainage tile drainage and soil water are needed to understand the hydrological behaviour of a field combining surface and tile drains moreover at the event scale few studies showed macropores can contribute to tile drain runoff but the partition between preferential flow and matrix flow is still unclear it needs to be study depending on several parameters as soil type soil water content or agricultural practice for a better understanding in this study high temporal resolution quantification of surface runoff and tile drainage was conducted for two full hydrological years to study hydrological functioning of the field using the water balance for a drained field soil water pathways were studied under dry and saturated soil conditions tracing water by measuring stable isotope 18o and 2h concentrations in rainwater soil water and surface and tile runoff runoff quantification showed that surface drainage and tile drainage respectively transferred 44 and 20 of annual effective rainfall however water balance showed that at the annual scale 65 of infiltrating water was not captured by tile drains at the event scale water tracing showed a season variation in macropores contribution depending on soil hydric state under dry conditions rainwater was directly transferred to tile drains likely through macropores on saturated soil pre event soil water content provided most of the water flowing out from the tile drain but rainfall can contribute up to 25 of the water flowing out from the tile drains combining water balance and water trancing allowed to propose a conceptual model for surface and tile drainage hydrological functioning at the event scale keywords tile drain surface drainage water balance water tracers soil water pathways data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction tile drainage constitutes an artificial water pathway that directly links subsoil to surface water and increases water connectivity thus tile drainage contributes to the eutrophication of receiving environments via transfer of nitrate arlot 1999 gilliam and skaggs 1986 and phosphate chapman et al 2001 king et al 2015a sims et al 1998 moreover it is a pathway for pesticides especially via preferential flow through macropores resulting in pollution and contamination of receiving environments blann et al 2009 haria et al 1994 harris et al 1994 since the 1950 s production oriented agricultural policies have led to draining hydromorphic soils to increase the area of cultivated land and its yield musgrave 1994 according to recent data from the international commission on irrigation and drainage 2018 11 of arable lands worldwide are drained two types of drainage are commonly used drainage by digging ditches at the edge of the field and tile drainage by laying buried pipes at the field scale in temperate climates the functioning of tile drains is generally highly seasonal arlot 1999 gramlich et al 2018 hirt et al 2011 king et al 2014 the decrease in evapotranspiration during the fall leads to the formation of a saturated zone in the hydromorphic soils and this usually lasts from fall to spring therefore during this period runoff coefficients are at their maximum and tile drains flow continuously during the rest of the year drains only flow during intense storm events arlot 1999 zimmer 1988 tile drainage has been shown to reduce surface runoff for example arlot 1999 compared drained and non drained fields with cambisol on altered shale and showed that tile drainage decreased surface runoff by a factor 10 20 accounting for 90 of total runoff grazhdani et al 1996 studied clay loam fields and showed that tile drainage increased the water yield by 34 but reduced surface runoff by 40 however in this study tile drain contribution to total runoff varied from 47 to 69 depending on drain spacing in lowland agricultural regions tile drainage can be complemented by surface drainage by digging surface drainage rills surface drains are temporary they are installed after seeding and destroyed by the first tillage following harvest this type of drainage modifying the natural pathways improves the transfer of surface water and guides surface runoff surface drainage is therefore likely to modify the hydrological functioning of the field however to our knowledge no hydrological study has been carried out on fields combining surface drainage rills and tile drains studies at the soil profile scale drained contexts have shown that macropores are an important pathway for both dissolved transfers king et al 2015b and solid transfers michaud et al 2019 øygarden et al 1997 understanding the pathways of water flow in drained soils is essential to reduce the negative impacts of drainage water flow in soil can be categorised as two types flow through the soil matrix skopp 1981 and flow through macropores jarvis 2007 mcdonnell 1990 richard and steenhuis 1988 matrix flow is generally slower than macropore flow which is qualified as preferential flow macropores can have biological or structural origin and are distinguished from the rest of the porosity by the heterogeneity of their distribution vertical and lateral their large diameter and their strong connectivity geochemical tracing experiments and observation of water flow paths through the use of brilliant blue tracing has highlighted the role of macropores in the hydrological functioning of drains stamm et al 2002 this study showed that macropores enhance connectivity between the soil surface and drains using bromide tracing everts and kanwar 1990 performed two irrigation experiments and found that 29 and 20 of the total volume flowing out of the drain was from a preferential flow stone and wilson 2006 used chloride tracing and measured a preferential flow contribution of 11 and 51 during two rainfall events after two years of isotopic monitoring leaney et al 1993 estimated that preferential flow accounted for at least 80 of tile drain flows these studies underline the difficulty that persists in predicting the relative contribution of preferential flow from drains during rainfall events a few studies have therefore explored the factors influencing the functioning of macropores for example grant et al 2019 used brilliant blue to trace the water pathways taken in two types of soil to explore the influence of soil type on the flow of water through macropores the preferential flow in a clay soil was greater than in a sandy silt soil in addition to soil properties the functioning of macropores seems to be linked to the hydric state of the soil using three fluorobenzoic acids and bromide kung et al 2000 showed that preferential flow contribution to tile drain flow depends on the soil moisture consequently prethese results were confirmed by weiler and naef 2003 that used brilliant blue tracing experiments combined with high temporal resolution soil moisture measurements weiler and naef 2003 showed that water circulation in macropores depends on the soil water content and permeability of the soil matrix the higher the soil matrix is permeable and unsaturated the higher transfer of water from matrix to macropores smith and capel 2018 monitored the specific conductance of water at the drain outlet and showed that even a light rainfall 5 mm can lead to a preferential flow of rainwater through macropores most previous studies concerning water flow in a drained context are generally limited to a few rainfall events uncertainties remain on the distribution between matrix and preferential flow according to the hydric state of the soil hence it is preferable to determine the type of water flow in drained soils throughout the year particularly regarding variations in the hydric state of the soil moreover addition of surface drainage to tile drainage is likely to increase the complexity of the hydrological functioning of the field however this complexity has been rarely explored in order to investigate these phenomena the present study was conducted to quantify surface and tile drain contributions to establish the water balance of a drained field and thus improve our knowledge of hydrological processes in a drained field identify general conditions affecting runoff generation processes for surface drains and tile drains understand seasonal changes at the surface and tile drains functioning under natural conditions over the course of a full hydrological year to establish the water balance of a drained field surface drain flow tile drain flow and soil hydric state were monitored in an agricultural field over 2 years combining surface and tile drainage monitoring of flows and soil hydric state were performed at high temporal resolution in order to compare runoff dynamics at the event scale depending on the season finally water pathways in soil according to the hydric state were investigated through isotopic tracing of water during a winter runoff event and a spring runoff event 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site was a 5 ha cultivated field located in the 25 km² louroux lowland catchment 0 45 20 43 e 47 08 33 51 n in the loire river basin around 250 km southwest of paris france fig 1 with a maximum altitude of 111 4 m ngf general levelling of france and a minimum altitude of 109 4 m ngf the climate is classified as cfb according to the köppen geiger climate classification beck et al 2018 peel et al 2007 with an annual average atmospheric temperature of 12 c and a cumulative rainfall by hydrological cycle ranging between 459 mm and 1044 mm with an average of 695 mm data measured at tours france from 1981 to 2010 météo france data during the study period annual rainfall was 722 mm and 739 mm for the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 hydrological cycle september to september respectively fig 3 in 2019 2020 the spring and summer were drier than average 19 and in 2020 2021 spring and summer were similar to the average 1 however for both periods autumn and winter were more humid than average 23 and 12 in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 respectively the field characterised by a mean slope of 0 7 was bordered by a ditch on the northwest and northeast sides a farm road on the southwest side and adjacent to another crop field on the southeast side in 2019 2020 the field was cultivated with wheat seeded on october 10th 2019 by direct seeding and harvested on july 9th 2020 in 2020 2021 the field was cultivated with sunflower seeded on april 16th 2021 and harvested on september 2021 on october 2020 a seeding of rye failed so soil surface is considered bare until april 2021 the field substratum was middle miocene langhian shelly sands rasplus et al 1982 with an addition of quaternary silty aeolian deposits soils are cambisols fao 2014 showing generalised redoximorphic features below 25 cm depth grain size organic carbon oc and ph analyses were performed for the surface and subsurface horizons table 1 grain size analysis showed an increase in clay content with depth the a horizon 0 30 cm is characterised by an average oc content of 18 g kg 1 standard deviation 3 g kg 1 the second horizon b1 30 48 cm had a silt loam texture the third horizon b2 below 48 cm 12 cm had a clay loam texture as in most fields of the catchment two types of drainage were present i surface drainage composed of surface drainage rills sdrs and ii tile drainage with tile drains fig 1 the tile drainage system installed during the 1980 s is composed of a tile drain network at 120 cm depth with a 10 m spacing and two drain collectors of 16 cm diameter each tile drain is installed in the horizon b2 in an artificial trench of draining soil to allow water transfers from b1 to tile drains according to the original map of the tile drain network design the main collector drains 83 4 2 ha of the field it collects the runoff from 34 tile drains and pours it into the ditch at the north of the field the collector output is 16 cm above the bottom of the ditch and is sometimes submerged during runoff events the second drain collector collects the runoff from seven drains and it drains other fields fig 1 the drains were last cleaned in 2017 the surface drainage is composed of a temporary artificial surface drainage rill network sdr fig 1 created every year after seeding operations and present until the first tillage operation following harvest sdrs are u shaped and shallow 15 cm and they either intersect the major slope or follow microthalwegs allowing the transfer of excess surface and hypodermic water to the surrounding ditch the sdr network is composed of primary sdrs connected to a collector sdr itself connected to the ditch network here two collectors were on the field with the main sdr collector connected to the northeast ditch and a second connected to the northwest ditch the main sdr collector drains 80 4 0 ha of the field 2 2 data acquisition 2 2 1 hydrological and hydrodynamic measurements rainfall potential crop evapotranspiration etc surface drainage runoff and tile drainage runoff were recorded from september 2019 to august 2021 rainfall was recorded at 5 min intervals using an automatic rain gauge located at the northeast corner of the field fig 1 reference evapotranspiration et0 was estimated at hourly intervals from the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 accounting for the hourly average of air temperature wind speed solar radiation humidity and atmospheric air pressure measurements for et0 estimation were performed by a weather station located 2 km northeast of the study field the potential crop evapotranspiration etc was estimated at daily intervals from et0 and crop coefficient data the crop coefficient was estimated from the degree day and growth stage relation surface drainage discharge was monitored using the main sdr collector at 1 min intervals using a u notch aqualyse uv0300 instrument aqualabo champigny sur marne france located directly at the output of the furrow collector fig 2a the water level was measured by an aqualyse soniv 3 instrument 0 260 cm aqualabo champigny sur marne france flow was deduced using a rating curve supplied by the manufacturer tile drain discharge was monitored using the main tile drain collector at 1 min intervals with an original device developed especially for this study fig 2b an ultraflux minisonic 2000 doppler radar device ultraflux éragny sur oise france was placed on a horizontal pvc siphon installed at the main drain collector output this setup allows flow monitoring without flow modification and measurements even when the drain collector output is under water a common situation in this region the soil hydric state was measured using both the matrix potential and the water level of the soil temporary saturated zone the matrix potential was monitored from the end of november 2019 to the end of june 2020 the matrix potential was monitored on one point every 10 min with autonomous watermark tensiometers irrometer co riverside ca usa around the middle of the field at different depths and distances throughout the drainage system location of the set is showed in fig 1 specifically four tensiometer sets were installed at within 0 5 1 5 2 5 and 5 m of a tile drain axis for each set soil water potential was automatically measured at 15 30 and 45 cm depths five manual tensiometers were set up to check autonomous records to identify moments when the upper limit of the saturated zone is in the superficial horizon a the water level of temporary saturated zone was measured at 10 spots spread across the field from mid december 2019 to june 2020 at 10 min intervals using mini diver probes schlumberger water service compensated for atmospheric pressure using baro divers fig 1 the measurement accuracy was 1 cm h2o mini diver probes were installed in piezometers at 40 cm depth their locations were chosen using stratified random sampling and some probes were placed at interdrains above the clayey horizon 2 2 2 fieldwork sampling and isotopic analyses a sampling strategy was optimised to investigate the different soil water pathways under different hydrodynamic conditions during several runoff events rainfall surface runoff tile drain runoff and soil water were sampled at short time intervals 1 3 h two runoff events including a high sampling density were used to illustrate the methodology the first event a occurred during the intense drainage period february 2 2020 the second event b occurred in late spring may 10 2020 rainfall was sampled from a rain collector setup next to the rain gauge rainfall was collected every 2 weeks moreover during a runoff event rainfall was collected only during the rainfall event to be representative of the event surface and tile drain runoff water were collected using two automatic samplers fig 2a b whose sampling frequency was automatically adjusted for each event depending on the runoff rate soil water was sampled using ceramic cups with depressions of 800 mbar generated by a manual vacuum pump ceramic cups were placed as follows four ceramic cups 15 30 45 and 80 cm depth were placed on a line parallel to the tile drain at a distance of 5 5 m and two ceramic cups at 30 cm depth were placed 2 m and at 3 5 m away from the drain axis soil water was not sampled during dry periods due to the low soil water content samples were filtered at the laboratory through a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate membrane within 24 h of sampling stable isotopes of water were analysed by laser spectrometry with a picarro l2120 i instrument picarro santa clara ca usa the results are reported using conventional notation δ as a deviation from the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and the analytical error for 18o and 2h were lower than 0 2 and 0 7 respectively local meteoric water line lmwl was determined from rainwater sampled between october 2018 to october 2020 39 rainwater samples r² 0 97 and calculated follows 1 δ 2 h 7 46 δ 18 o 5 61 the δ18o and δ2h composition of rainwater soil water surface and tile drain runoff were determined at early time intervals during a storm event in order to identify water sources and pathways no evaporation processes could be identified from the isotopic signatures fig 7 therefore variability of isotopic signature was due to hydrological factors such as a change in water origin or mixing conditions during an event for each component rainwater soil water surface and tile drain runoff δ18o and δ2h variations were similar so only δ18o variations are presented in the present study 2 3 rainfall and runoff event separation rainfall events were defined according to musy et al 2014 during the study period no runoff event was generated from a rainfall event lower than 0 6 mm the minimal duration between two runoff event peaks was 2 h 20 so a rainfall event is considered if 0 6 mm of rain fall during less than 2 h 20 a surface drain and a tile drain runoff event were identified when a peak flow was measured in total 353 rainfall events 85 surface runoff events and 106 tile drain runoff events were identified lag time used in this study was defined as the time between rainfall event peak and discharge peak 2 4 water balance model in the case of a small intensively instrumented experimental study area such as the studied field it is possible to determine the water balance for research purposes ward and robinson 2000 in this study determining water balance aimed to improve our knowledge of hydrological processes in a drained field water balance at the field scale is defined as follows 2 s a b 1 s b 2 r et d where δsa b1 is the change in soil water content in a and b1 horizons mm d δsb2 is the change in soil water content in the b2 horizon above and below the tile drain mm d that is dependent on infiltration from b1 to b2 and evapotranspiration r is the rainfall mm d et is the etc evapotranspiration mm d and d is the drainage factor mm d i e the sum of surface and tile drain runoffs in this model we assume that the water content in a and b1 horizons ranges between saturation sat and permanent wilting point pwp water content of all horizon were initialised at the permanent wilting point if the rainfall is higher than etc water is firstly stored in the a and b1 horizons then to the b2 horizon depending on the soil water conditions in a and b1 horizons in the same way if the etc is higher than the rainfall the water losses firstly came from the a and b1 horizons then from the b2 horizon water balance was applied daily from the 1st september 2019 following a period of 24 days without rainfall the 1st september 2019 the soil water content was assumed to be equal to the permanent wilting point for all soil horizons the average field capacity permanent wilting point and resulting maximum water content mwc of surface and subsurface horizons were estimated using the pedotransfer function developed by saxton et al 1986 as a function of grain size table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of intense drainage periods the total rainfall depth was 722 mm and 739 mm during 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 respectively in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 the total runoff depth was 137 4 mm and 173 7 mm with a tile drain contribution of 63 3 mm 46 and 35 3 mm 20 respectively the hydrological year can be separated into two periods depending on the tile drain discharge characteristics figs 3 4 6 as proposed by zimmer 1988 an intense drainage period when tile drain discharge presents a continuous flow resulting in a base flow fig 4 and a low drainage period when there is no tile drain base flow in the present study the intense drainage periods occurred between november 2019 and mid march 2020 and between december 2020 and mid february 2021 figs 4 and 6 during the two intense drainage periods 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 the average tile drain base flow was 0 1 l s 1 fig 4 the runoff flow was unevenly distributed during the hydrological year with the intense drainage period accounting for 95 of surface runoff in both 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 and for 98 and 88 of the tile drain runoff in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 respectively 3 2 soil water hydric states providing intense drainage period the calculation of the water balance realized for a field combining surface drainage rills and tile drainage showed 64 table 3 of water reaching horizon b2 are not drained by the tile drain network but stored in horizon b2 in 2019 2020 and in 2020 2021 the intense drainage period started when the water content of the horizons a and b1 was close to the saturation point fig 5 d 4 days and 7 days before respectively therefore on the study field that has a low depth clay horizon and tile drains installed in this horizon the intense drainage period began when water content of surface horizons reached the saturation along the intense drainage period according to water balance calculations a and b1 horizons were close to the saturation the maximum deviation from the saturation was 6 4 mm and 0 8 mm in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 respectively this is consistent with the hydric state measurement of the soil in 2019 2020 fig 5 b the minimal soil water potential measured during the intense drainage period was 5 43 cbar at 15 cm depth this hydric state of the horizons suggests that tile drain runoff generation was caused by slow water transfer such as matrix flow and that surface runoff generation may be caused by soil surface saturation in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 the end of the intense drainage period occurred as soon as the water content of horizons a and b1 were no longer at the saturation even if the b2 horizon remained at the field capacity in 2019 2020 soil water potential at 15 cm depth decreased rapidly from mid march 2020 fig 5 b consistent with water balance showing a rapid decrease in the water content of horizons a and b1 therefore saturation of surface horizons seems a necessary condition to tile drain runoff however in 2019 2020 and in 2020 2021 tile drain runoff was observed after the intense drainage period when the water balance indicated that horizons a and b1 were not at the saturation this suggest that outside of the intense drainage period other processes of runoff generation occur indeed crop development and the intensity of evapotranspiration mean that water losses must simultaneously certainly affect both a b1 and b2 horizons and not a b1 firstly as the model do in addition the presence of cracks significantly modifies the distribution of water in the soil koivusalo et al 1999 and may lead to direct flow to b2 water balance is well adapted to intense drainage and show that the water content of the horizons are determinant to start and stop the intense drainage period however the water balance seems less adapted to the low drainage period runoff has been measured when soil water content is below the saturation and in some case below the field capacity according to the water balance this suggest that runoff generation processes during the low drainage period are different than during the intense drainage period furthermore the seasonal contrast in the soil water content in the superficial horizons suggest changes in soil structure that may have consequences for soil water pathways 3 3 seasonal variations of surface and tile drainage dynamics 3 3 1 rainfall characteristics inducing runoff drainage during the intense drainage periods of 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 54 and 81 respectively of rainfall events induced surface and or tile drain runoff whereas during the low drainage period only 3 of rainfall events produced a surface and or tile drain runoff fig 6 during the intense drainage period low intensity 2 4 mm h and low cumulative 0 6 mm rainfall events can generate runoff making the drainage system particularly reactive during the low drainage period only five rainfall events generated runoff all of which were spring or summer storms their average rainfall was 26 7 mm 16 8 mm with a minimum of 8 8 mm and an average maximal rainfall intensity of 47 5 mm h 22 3 mm h with a minimum of 14 4 mm h during the low drainage period eight other rainfall events showed similar characteristics but did not generate runoff therefore runoff events that occurred during the low drainage period are generated by rainfall events combining high cumulative rainfall 8 8 mm and high rainfall intensities 14 4 mm h 3 3 2 seasonal variations of surface drainage runoff events in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 94 of surface runoff events occurred during the intense drainage period table 4 this is typical for cultivated fields and it is explained by the importance of effective rainfall during autumn and winter associated with a degraded soil surface state le bissonnais et al 2005 during the low drainage period the average peak flow of the surface runoff is two times higher than that during the intense drainage period moreover during the intense drainage period the average surface runoff coefficient is eight times higher than the average of events occurring during the low drainage period these differences in peak flow and runoff coefficient can be explained by the soil surface state which is generally rougher during spring and summer le bissonnais et al 2005 and by the soil hydric state during summer surface runoff is only caused by excess infiltration whereas during winter soil saturation may generate runoff 3 3 3 seasonal variations of tile drain runoff events from september 2019 to september 2021 106 tile drain runoff events occurred and 96 occurred during intense drainage periods according to the measurement of soil water potential during 2019 2020 the soil was already saturated at 15 30 and 45 cm depths in mid november it stayed saturated at 15 cm depth until mid march and stayed saturated at 45 cm depth until mid april a short period in mid january was characterised by a slight decrease in water potential in the topsoil due to 10 days without rainfall moreover between mid november date of installation of the mini diver probes and mid march the saturated zone was at 30 cm or higher below the soil surface for 75 of the time this suggests a constant water pressure remaining above the tile drain network during the intense drainage period which can explain the reaction of the tile drain network to low rainfall 0 6 mm events during this period during the intense drainage period the event runoff coefficients runoff volume divided by rainfall volume of tile drains were 10 times higher than those occurring during the low drainage period table 5 this can be explained by the soil hydric state during spring and summer the soil water content is low hence the soil stores most of the rainfall and et can be considered negligible during short and intense rainfall events in 2019 2020 the soil water potential started to decrease around mid march at the end of march and at the beginning of april at 15 30 and 45 cm depths respectively this period corresponds to a decrease in the effective rainfall and was correlated with the end of the intense drainage period measurement of the depth of the saturated zone confirmed these results from mid march the saturated zone was present only when intense rainfall events occurred and was always more than 14 cm below the soil surface from april cracks progressively appeared at the soil surface consistent with a decrease in soil water potential and that can affect soil water pathways specifically cracks increase the hydro connectivity between the soil surface and the tile drains therefore as shown by the water balance tile drain runoff can occur even if horizons a and b1 are not at the field capacity during the low drainage period 3 4 seasonal variability of water pathways 3 4 1 water pathways during the intense drainage period event a 02 02 2020 was a typical runoff event of the intense drainage period with pre event soil saturation at 5 cm below the surface a surface runoff preceding the tile drain runoff 22 min time lag and a high runoff coefficient 76 combined tile plus surface drainage table 6 during event a the isotopic composition of rain soil water tile drain and surface runoff was significantly different fig 7 surface and tile water isotopic composition analysis revealed that they were composed of soil water and rainfall in different proportions fig 7 a two end member mixing analysis emma pinder and jones 1969 has been applied using isotopic signatures to estimate the proportion of soil water and rainwater contributing to the surface and tile drain runoffs the soil water composition was assumed to be similar to that of tile drain runoff water before the runoff event this assumption is supported by the fact that the δ18o value 6 9 0 2 fig 7 fig 8 of the tile drain runoff before the event was close to that of the soil water δ18o 6 8 0 2 figs 7 and 8 the surface runoff signature is not equal to the rainwater signature showing surface runoff is not only composed by rainwater but also by pre event soil water the variation δ18o of surface runoff from 4 9 0 2 to 4 2 0 2 figs 7 and 8 indicates variations in surface drainage runoff composition at the beginning of the event surface drainage runoff is composed of 45 of rainwater and it is composed of 62 of rainwater at the moment of the last sample the tile runoff isotopic composition also varied during storm events fig 8 highlighting the variability in the relative contributions of soil water and rainfall indeed at the peak discharge the δ18o of tile drain runoff is significantly different than the pre event soil water and tends toward that the δ18o rainfall at the maximal discharge the rainwater contribution reaching 30 then δ18o of tile drain runoff decreases showing the proportion of rainwater in tile drain runoff decreased at the end of the event tile drain runoff is composed of 80 of soil water therefore at the event scale the surface and tile drain runoff were composed of 40 and 75 of pre event soil water and 60 and 25 of rainwater respectively during event a alongside slow soil water rapid transfer of rainwater occurred demonstrating the significance of preferential flows during the intense drainage period in previous studies culley et al 1983 cullum 2009 radcliffe et al 2015 water reaching tile drains was composed of both types of flows coulomb and dever 1994 had already observed this type of transfers in a clay soil at the beginning of the intense drainage season but they didn t observed it in the middle of the intense drainage period reportedly due to the collapse and saturation of macropores basing on irrigation experiment kung et al 2000 showed preferential flows could be active even under humid conditions results of the present study suggest that macroporosity is still present in the middle of the intense drainage period facilitating rapid transfer of rainwater even if the soil is saturated however the contribution of macropores to tile drain runoff is highly variable depending on the context of the study and this needs to be better characterized for example cullum 2009 observed that matrix fluxes represented up to 90 of water flux on silty soil plots meanwhile nazari et al 2021 observed a near equal contribution of the two types of flows in a clay silt soil plot this variability including the present study can be explained by differences in macroporosity characteristics that depend on freeze thaw cycles clay swelling and shrinkage ground glass activity and cultural practices jarvis et al 2016 concerning surface runoff isotope water tracing showed that surface runoff is a mix of both soil water and rainwater presence of rainwater may be due to infiltration excess and presence of soil water suggest saturation runoff process it could be explain by an increase in the saturated zone level or by saturation of the first centimeters of soil resulting in lateral soil water flows haria et al 1994 specified that a lateral flow circulated over an impeding layer in the present case there was no impeding layer but similar processes may occur stamm et al 2002 showed that lateral flows can occur near the soil surface in horizon a in a loamy soil such a process could explain the significant proportion of soil water in the surface runoff in addition lateral flow may also flow directly into a ditch at the edge of the field 3 4 2 water pathways during the low drainage period event b 05 11 2020 was typical of the low drainage period with a low soil water content soil water potential was 45 cbar at 45 cm depth a tile runoff preceding surface runoff 1 9 h time lag and a low runoff coefficient 9 according to the depth of the saturated measured by the diver probes and to the soil water content calculated from the water balance model before the rainfall event figs 4 and 7 the soil water content is below the field capacity so rainwater is the only possible source for both surface and tile drain runoff moreover measurements of the saturated zone depth show surface runoff was not caused by saturation but was only generated by infiltration excess during event b the surface runoff δ18o ranged from 4 9 0 2 to 3 8 0 2 fig 8 as rainwater is the only possible source for surface runoff any δ18o variation indicates a δ18o variation of rainwater therefore even if the rainwater signature was only measured as the average signature of the entire rainfall event surface runoff signature variations can be interpreted as the copy of the rainwater signature variations concerning the tile drain runoff during event b the tile drain runoff δ18o value was almost constant ranging from 4 9 0 2 to 4 6 0 2 at the beginning of event b tile drain runoff signature was similar to the surface runoff signature but during the event tile drain and surface drain signature progressively became significantly different two hypothesis can explain it i tile drain runoff is a mixed of rainwater and of soil water or ii rainwater signature varied during the rainfall event and a part of the rainwater come to the drain with a significant delay the similarity between surface and tile drain runoff signatures is inconsistent with the first hypothesis but considering rainwater is the only possible source both for tile drain and surface runoff differences in signature variations could be explained by the spatio temporal dynamic of water in soil water transfers from surface to tile drain are faster in the vicinity of the drain axis than at the inter drain therefore at the beginning of the event water that composed tile drain runoff should come from the surface at the vicinity of the drain axis andit should generate a tile drain runoff with the same signature than the surface runoff rainwater fell at the interdrain should arrive with a delay this delay can be explained by the longer way to go from the inter drain to the tile drain so during the event the tile drain runoff should be made of rainwater fallen at the vicinity of the tile drain axis but also from rainwater fallen at the inter drain therefore at a given moment during the event the tile drain runoff signature is a mix of the signature of the rainwater fallen recently after this moment and of the signature of the rainwater fallen earlier at the interdrain during the low drainage period soil moisture is constantly low under field capacity fig 4 however the studied event showed that a sufficiently intense event can generate surface and tile drain runoff for such events tile drain runoff starts before surface runoff proving that the process of rainwater transfer to tile drains is faster than the generation of surface runoff there are two possible reasons i the presence of wheat cover may slow surface runoff ii preferential vertical flow through macropores isotopic measurements support the hypothesis of preferential flow through the macroporosity but our results do not support any conclusion about the soil cover effect on surface runoff moreover cracks present at the soil surface before the event constitute a macroporosity that can support direct water transfer from the soil surface to tile drains 3 5 conceptual model of hydrological processes of a drained field water pathways through cracks presented in conceptual models haria et al 1994 showed that sub surface lateral flow can occur in the first 30 cm above the saturated zone of the horizon a thus our conceptual model of water pathways is similar to previous conceptual models but it is the first for a field combining surface and tile drainage moreover it is the first to separate pre event soil water and rainfall event water to determine the expected composition of runoff rainfall runoff events for intense drainage and low drainage periods can be described in four steps fig 9 during the intense drainage period 1 before rainfall events a saturated zone is present and tile drains already flow before rainfall events tile drain water is only composed of pre event soil water which is a mix of previous rainwaters according to the water balance the soil is close to the saturation 2 surface runoff starts and the saturated zone level rises due to an increase in the water content of the topsoil rainwater is rapidly transferred to tile drains through the soil macroporosity rainfall event water increases the pressure on pre event soil water hence tile drain flow increases tile drain flow increases progressively and contains both pre event soil water and event rainwater 3 drainage of the saturated zone if close enough to the surface the saturated zone can overflow and contribute to the surface drainage system tile drain runoff still contains pre event soil water and event rainwater but the proportion of pre event soil water decreases 4 end of the event the saturated zone is progressively drained by the tile drain system surface runoff stops within a few hours tile drain runoff decreases progressively to its pre event flow during the low drainage period fig 9 1 before rainfall events soil moisture is very low and cracks are visible at the soil surface 2 runoff initiation and formation of local saturated zones surface runoff is reduced by crop cover only intense rainfall events can generate surface runoff moreover as other study on clay soil showed e g nazari et al 2021 øygarden et al 1997 cracks could be preferential pathways for rainwater from the soil surface to tile drains therefore tile drainage can begin before or at the same time as surface runoff a saturated zone is formed deep in the soil 3 drainage of the saturated zone the saturated zone is quickly drained by tile drains cracks collapse and are clogged by soil particles eroded from surface soil or form the sides of cracks 4 end of the event runoff stops quickly after the end of rainfall the saturated zone is no longer present after the end of the event the size and width of some cracks are reduced 4 conclusion in this study the water balance of a surface and tile drained field was determined for two successive years quantification of surface and tile drain fluxes can reveal the characteristics of flows of drained fields in our case the period of intense drainage extended from november to march during the first year and from december to february during the second year during both the first and second year it corresponds to a period during which the saturated zone was close to the soil surface during this period most of the tile flow was due to a slow matrix flow of water into the soil but macroporosity seemed to be active and contributed to up to 30 of the tile drain flow thus it appears that rapid flows of water from soil to tile drains occurs throughout the year regardless of the hydric state of the soil when the entire soil profile is saturated a slow matrix flow of water from the soil to the drains occurred and remained dominant as long as the soil moisture content was close to the saturation runoff by surface drainage appeared to be mainly due to saturation excess runoff but water from the first few centimetres of soil was transferred to surface drainage rills if the saturated zone approached the soil surface moreover according to the water balance 36 of water transiting through the soil infiltrated into the deep horizon b2 at the end of the intense drainage period the water content of the surface horizons a and b1 decreased below the saturation resulting in the discontinuation of base flow for tile drainage after the intense drainage period tile drains and surface drains only operated during intense rainfall events however tile drain flow is from a preferential flow through macropores while runoff by surface drainage rills is only due to an infiltration excess calculation of the water balance proposed in this study makes it possible to predict the start and the end of the intense drainage in a field combined surface drainage rills and tile drains provided that the variability of soils and the characteristics of the drainage networks of the other fields in the watershed are taken into account the simplicity of setting up this model should make it possible to extrapolate it to other fields moreover according to the soil hydric state water source variations in tile drain runoff may be one of the factors explaining the variation in dissolved and solid transfers over the year in drained systems concerning runoff by surface drainage rills in addition to the runoff processes usually occurring in drained fields there is a lateral flow of water from the soil to surface drains when the saturated zone reaches the depth of surface drains this flow is therefore likely to be associated with the transfer of dissolved substances stored in the first few centimetres of soil

levels in the root zone of soilless crops when the ds is recycled the scenario analysis showed that the algorithm is not sensitive to inaccuracies in input parameters related to the daily volume of ns supplied to the crop or to the volume of available ns per plant in the soilless system however it was moderately sensitive to inaccurate determinations of the nutrient concentrations in the ds furthermore a case study with a closed loop soilless crop of cucumber managed with nutrisense was conducted aimed to confirm the efficiency of the algorithm to maintain optimal nutrient levels in the root environment the case study showed that the readjustment of the nutrient supply using nutrisense could successfully maintain the ec ph and macronutrient levels within a range of 10 variation from the target level only so4 2 showed a larger discrepancy than 10 from the target value because the supply level of this macronutrient was not estimated directly through the current algorithm but indirectly through the anion to cation balance however this problem can be easily tackled by setting a minimum level of so4 2 supply as a present value in nutrisense graphical abstract ga1

a restricted volume compared to soil grown crops and thus the reserves of nutrients for the plants are limited sonneveld and voogt 2009 therefore the nutrient supply to the crop should be precise inappropriate nutrient concentrations in the nutrient solution ns supplied to a crop henceforth termed supply solution and abbreviated as ss can cause nutrient imbalances in the root environment with deleterious effects on yield and quality due to nutrient deficiency toxicity or salinity massa et al 2020 neocleous and savvas 2013 sonneveld and voogt 2009 tzerakis et al 2013 however unpredictable conditions in each crop such as the current microclimatic parameters inside the greenhouse the cultivar the fruit load etc could alter the nutrient needs of the plants gallardo et al 2021 therefore the composition of the ss should be periodically adapted to the current crop demands savvas et al 2021 in a closed loop soilless system cls the fertigation effluents henceforth termed drainage solution ds are collected mixed with raw water and nutrients and recycled after appropriate adjustment of ph and electrical conductivity ec recycling of the ds represents an ecologically sound technology as it can reduce water consumption by 20 35 and fertiliser use by 40 50 in greenhouse crops while minimising or even eliminating losses of nutrients thus preventing environmental pollution by no3 n and p savvas and gruda 2018 the management of nutrient supply in clss is largely based on the anticipated ratio between the mass of a nutrient absorbed by the crop and the volume of water expressed as mmol l 1 this ratio will be henceforth termed uptake concentration sonneveld and voogt 2009 thompson et al 2013 abbreviated as uc when the concentration of a nutrient is maintained close to a standard level in the root zone the average uc of this nutrient exhibits some stability for a particular developmental stage and plant species under non contrasting climatic conditions gallardo et al 2021 savvas and lenz 1995 sonneveld and voogt 2009 therefore it can be used as a basic suggestion for the net nutrient input to crops cultivated in clss in crops grown on substrates in clss the ss is ultimately a mix of fresh ns net nutrient input henceforth termed added solution as and ds blok et al 2023 in such cropping systems the net input of the i nutrient to the plants should be equilibrated with its net output assuming that no ds is discharged to avoid accumulation or depletion of this nutrient to the root zone to achieve this equilibrium the concentration of the i nutrient in the as should be constantly equal to the anticipated uc of this nutrient however in a commercial greenhouse the actual ucs may deviate to some extent from those referenced as standard in the literature gallardo et al 2021 which have been determined experimentally as a result a gradual accumulation or depletion of some nutrients in the root zone may occur with time deviations between the standard and the actual ucs in a particular crop can be due to the season of the year gallardo et al 2021 gómez lópez et al 2004 the actual climatic conditions maintained inside the greenhouse ropokis et al 2019 the cultivar ropokis et al 2018 the current concentration of this nutrient in the root zone ropokis et al 2019 sonneveld and voogt 2009 and the use of grafted plants savvas et al 2017 therefore the standard ucs suggested in the literature should be considered only rough estimations serving as a starting point although accumulation or depletion of nutrients in the root zone may be small in the short term it can reach harmful levels when summed over longer periods resulting in serious nutrient imbalances in the root zone to prevent large nutrient imbalances in the root zone growers regularly ideally fortnightly or even weekly determine the nutrient concentrations in a sample of ds or ns sampled from the root zone and use the analytical data to readjust the net nutrient input by modifying the composition of the as massa et al 2020 neocleous and savvas 2022 voogt and bar yosef 2019 nevertheless properly readjusting the composition of the as remains a challenge as it requires complicated calculations based on sound simulation principles blok et al 2023 to address this requirement an algorithm based on mass balance simulation was developed as part of the decision support system dss nutrisense which was presented at the ii international symposium on growing media soilless cultivation and compost utilization in horticulture in ghent belgium in 2021 savvas et al 2021 nutrisense is online available via the link https nutrisense online to calibrate this algorithm a simulation study was conducted based on data originating from a commercial crop of tomato cultivated in a cls furthermore a greenhouse experiment with cucumber grown in a cls was conducted to validate this algorithm under semi commercial cropping conditions and assess its efficiency to maintain the nutrient concentrations close to the target levels in the root zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 algorithm outline following the concept of the dutch nutrient recommendation system blok et al 2023 the current algorithm is based on standard compositions of two interdependent nutrient solutions for each crop species which are the basic added solution as and the target root solution rs i e the ns retained in the pores of the substrate the ns that is finally supplied to the crop henceforth termed supply solution ss is the mix of as and ds at an adjustable ratio however the ds is in fact rs released from the substrate due to gravity when new ss is provided to the crop via irrigation system therefore the composition of rs and ds can be considered identical ignoring small differences due to temporal variations in both compositions this consideration is common practice in commercial soilless crops voogt and bar yosef 2019 suggestions for the nutrient concentrations in the basic as and the rs are referenced in several literature sources e g de kreij et al 1999 savvas et al 2013 sonneveld and voogt 2009 van der lugt et al 2020 for most nutrients the suggested concentration in the basic as corresponds to the standard uc of this nutrient standard ucs specific for each plant species have been experimentally determined and reported in several publications e g adams 2002 neocleous et al 2021 2020 neocleous and savvas 2019 2018 2015 ropokis et al 2021 2018 savvas et al 2017 savvas and lenz 1995 thompson et al 2013 the algorithm presented in the current paper aims at readjusting the composition of the basic as at regular time intervals e g every fortnight based on a chemical analysis of rs sampled either directly from the rooting medium or more commonly from the ds the algorithm is based on mass balance modelling and was established according to the chain of reasoning presented in the next readjusting the concentration of the i nutrient in the as is necessary when a chemical analysis reveals a significant difference between the current concentration of the i nutrient in the rs c dc and the suggested value in the target rs c dt in the current study a difference between c dc and c dt was considered insignificant when 0 95c dt c dc 1 05c dt if the difference is significant the total mass mmol per plant of i m i that has to be supplied to or removed from the rs to re establish the target concentration can be theoretically estimated using the following equation 1 m i c dt c dc v d where v d is the total volume l of the sum of rs and ds per plant measured when the ds sample was collected for analysis assuming that mi is gradually supplied to the crop in addition to the current level of supply by altering the concentration mmol l of the i nutrient in the as from the currently applied value c ac to a suitable new value c an and supplying the re adjusted as for t f days m i is estimated also through the following equation 2 m i v a t f δ c a where v a is the volume l of as per plant per day and δc a c an c ac consequently 3 v a t f δ c a c dt c dc v d rearranging 3 and solving for δc a renders 4 δ c a c dt c dc v d v a t f for each nutrient a different δc a is estimated through 4 as the values of c dt and c dc are also different for each of them δc a is subsequently added to the actual uc of i c ua to estimate the new readjusted concentration of i c ar in the as the currently applied concentration of the i nutrient in the as c ac is different than the actual uc c ua when i accumulates or depletes in the rs and no losses of i occur due to ds discharge or due to any other reason accumulation or depletion occurs when c dc is significantly higher or lower than c dt according to the latest chemical analysis of the rs and no other losses of i occur in the cls in that case the actual uc of i c ua has to be estimated by definition 5 c ua m i v a in 5 σ mi is the total mass mmol plant 1 of the i nutrient that was absorbed by the crop during a time period of t p days this period d started on the date of the n 1 n 0 1 2 sampling of rs and terminates on the date of the current sampling n sampling σv a is the volume l of as per plant that has been supplied to the crop during the t p days from sampling n 1 to n and thus 6 v a v a t p the total absorbed mass of the i nutrient during the t p days is equal to the mass of i supplied via as minus plus the amount that has accumulated or depleted respectively in the rs the total mass of the i nutrient supplied via as during the t p days is equal to the product of its concentration mmol l 1 in the currently supplied as the supplied volume l of as per day and t p c ac v a t p similarly the amount of i accumulated or depleted is equal to the concentration difference mmol l 1 in the rs between samplings n 1 and n multiplied with the total volume l of rs and ds v d in the greenhouse compartment that is irrigated with the as under readjustment consequently 7 m i c ac v a t p c dp c dc v d substituting 6 and 7 in 5 renders 8 c ua c ac v a t p c dp c dc v d v a t p c ac c dp c dc v d v a t p if n 1 first sampling of rs after crop establishment then the c ac values are equal to the target concentrations in the standard as and the c dp values are equal to the target concentrations in the standard rs as suggested in credible literature sources finally the readjusted concentration mmol l 1 of i in the as c ar is equal to the sum of c ua which covers the plant needs without any accumulation or depletion and δc a which is needed to decrease or increase the current concentration of i in the rs from c dc to c dt within a time interval of t f days in mathematical terms 9 c ar c ua δ c a where c ua and δc a have been determined using 8 and 4 respectively consequently the concentration of the i nutrient in the as is readjusted to c ar according to the following equation which is obtained by substituting 8 for c ua and 4 for δc a in 9 10 c ar c ac c dp c dc v d v a t p c dt c dc v d t f v a eq 10 is a core component of the algorithms used by nutrisense savvas et al 2021 when applied as a dss to readjust the composition of the as in crops grown on substrates in clss in 10 c dt is a standard value for each nutrient and crop species the database of nutrisense includes standard c dt values for many plant species grown in greenhouses and all nutrients added in a ns originating from various literature sources de kreij et al 1999 neocleous et al 2021 2020 neocleous and savvas 2019 2018 2015 ropokis et al 2021 2019 2018 savvas et al 2017 2013 savvas and lenz 1995 sonneveld and voogt 2009 van der lugt et al 2020 furthermore c dc and c dp are measured values introduced to nutrisense by the user while c ac is a value taken from the currently applied formula of as finally v d v a t p t f are known parameters related to the soilless cropping system and the applied fertigation schedule which are introduced to nutrisense by the user the c ar values are subsequently used by nutrisense to estimate the weights of fertilisers needed to prepare new concentrated stock solutions cs a and b based on the algorithm developed by savvas and adamidis 1999 2000 eq 10 is used to readjust the concentrations of k ca2 mg2 no3 n p fe mn zn cu b and mo the c ar value for nh4 n is readjusted only when the ph in the rs ph r is lower than 5 5 or higher than 6 5 in proportion to the current ph r as the ph in the rs is strongly influenced by the level of ammonium supply savvas et al 2006 2003 savvas and gruda 2018 sonneveld and voogt 2009 the c ar values for k ca2 mg2 and nh4 n and the sodium concentration in the water c naw are further used to calculate the ec of the readjusted as e ar using the empirical equation obtained from savvas and adamidis 1999 2000 after solving for e ar 11 e ar σ c i 1 462 9 819 where σ c i is the sum of the c ar values for k ca2 and mg2 obtained from 10 nh4 n and c naw after conversion into meq l 1 sometimes the c ar values estimated for ca and or mg by 10 are lower than the respective concentrations in the raw water massa et al 2020 neocleous and savvas 2013 ropokis et al 2021 in these cases the ca and or mg values estimated by 10 are replaced by their concentrations in the raw water in substrate grown crops the most widely used technology to recycle the ds is to initially blend this with raw water at an automatically adjustable ratio that renders a pre set ec in the mix e m using a suitable device blok et al 2023 subsequently the mix is pumped to a fertigation system which automatically injects stock solutions of fertilisers to achieve the target ec in the outgoing ss e s hence to manage recycling of the ds in a cls when the as is readjusted it is imperative to also readjust e m and e s estimating new values henceforth denoted by e mr and e sr respectively to readjust the ec of the ss the following equation is used 12 e sr a e d t 1 a e ar where e sr is the readjusted e s a is the target drainage fraction e dt is the target ec in the rs and ds and e ar is the value estimated using 11 since e sr is estimated as a function of the target ec in the rs ds e dt while the current ec in the rs ds e dc may be different the actual drainage fraction that is recycled x may also be different than the target a the actual drainage fraction that is recycled is estimated using 12 after replacing a with x and e dt with e da and subsequently solving for x 13 x e sr e ar e dc e ar finally a readjusted ec for the mix of ds and raw water e mr is estimated taking into consideration the current ec in the ds on the n sampling date e dc using the following equation 14 e mr x e dc 1 x e w where e w is the ec of the raw water e mr can be estimated also through the following mass balance equation which is obtained by subtracting the net contribution of fertiliser injection from e sr 15 e mr e sr 1 x e ar e w the e mr value estimated by 14 is identical with that estimated by 15 nutrisense uses a default value of 0 3 as a in 12 to estimate e sr but the user has the option to select a pre set e mr value for the mix in that case the pre set e mr is used in 14 to estimate x after rearrangement the estimated x value is substituted in 15 which is subsequently solved for e sr to estimate a readjusted ec value for the ss the algorithm presented in the current study is suitable for closed loop soilless cultivations on substrates in which the ds is initially mixed with raw water and subsequently the mix is driven to a fertigation system where the injection of fertilisers takes place blok et al 2023 if the ds is mixed with as which has been previously prepared by the fertigation system or if the plants are cultivated in a water culture system such as nft or floating savvas and gruda 2018 a properly modified version of the currently presented algorithm is applied by nutrisense not described in the current paper 2 2 pilot study and scenario analysis to test the capability of the current algorithm to provide a sound readjustment of the as in clss a pilot study was conducted the specific aims of this case study were to test a whether the results obtained from application of the algorithm in a commercial greenhouse are reasonable and how these are related to the introduced parameters and b to better understand the relationships between the ss and the rs the pilot study was conducted in a commercial greenhouse tomato crop grown on rockwool slabs in a cls the greenhouse enterprise comprised 8 compartments and the area of each compartment was 2 ha each compartment was equipped with an independent fertigation system to prepare the final ss and irrigate the crop with this the ss was prepared by automatically injecting cs of fertilisers from two separate tanks a b system see savvas and gruda 2018 to a mix of ds and raw water the ds was blended with raw water using a suitable device at an automatically adjustable ratio aiming at maintaining a pre set ec to the mix e m irrespective of temporal changes in the ec of the ds blok et al 2023 the plant density was 3 1 plants m 2 and the volume of ns supplied to the crop ss during the study period was 2 8 l plant 1 d 1 table 1 the mean fraction of ds was 0 32 for the period from n 1 to the n sampling date thus the net volume of as per plant was 1 90 l d 1 the mineral concentrations k ca2 mg2 nh4 n no3 n p so4 2 s fe mn zn cu b cl na and hco3 in the ds were determined on weekly basis the composition of the ds collected on the n 1 sampling date was introduced to nutrisense to readjust the e mr and e sr and to compute a readjusted composition of as using the algorithm presented in section 2 1 subsequently the readjusted e m e s and as composition were applied in the tomato crop the raw water used to prepare ns e w had an ec of 0 57 ds m 1 and the following mineral composition macronutrients in mm micronutrients in μμ ca2 2 22 mg2 0 42 na 0 37 so4 2 s 0 2

target nutrient concentrations in the rs c dt and the currently applied concentrations in the as c ac i e the concentrations applied in the interval from the n 1 to the n sampling date are also listed in table 2 the c dt values were according to sonneveld and voogt 2009 with small modifications taking into consideration new research findings about the benefits or partially replacing no3 n by cl in tomato crops neocleous et al 2021 truffault et al 2019 the dimensions of the slabs were 120 20 7 5 cm which corresponds to 18 l and their mean water content after full irrigation container capacity was 60 of their volume each slab accommodated 6 plants pruned to a single stem and thus the volume of rs per plant was 1 8 l at morning when the ds samples were collected a mean ds volume of 1 15 l per plant was contained in the tank used to store it before reusing thus the total volume of rs plus ds v d was 2 95 l plant 1 since samples were collected every week the application time of a readjusted as was 7 days thus t p 7 while readjusting was aiming at re establishing the target concentrations in the rs within 7 days thus t f 7 the data from the commercial tomato crop the c dc and c dp values measured in samples collected on the n and n 1 sampling days respectively and the c ac values applied from the n 1 to the n sampling date were used to estimate the car e sr and emr values the calculations were performed using eqs 10 12 and 14 respectively subsequently the algorithm was used to conduct scenario analyses aiming to demonstrate how c ar changes as function of v d v a c dc or c dp when these variables vary within a reasonable range the strategic objective of the scenario analyses was to assess the sensitivity of the algorithm to inaccuracies in the estimation of these parameters by growers v d v a and chemical laboratories c dc c dp inaccuracies in the estimated values of these parameters may occur also because in systems with growing media there are blind spots not interfering with the water flows where nutrients salts accumulate four different scenario analyses were conducted in each scenario analysis one of the parameters v d v a c dc or c dp was considered the single independent variable in eq 10 while c ar was always the dependent variable in these scenarios v d or v a received values ranging from 50 to 50 while c dc or c dp received values ranging from 20 20 around the corresponding true values shown in table 2 each scenario analysis was applied for two representative macronutrients particularly for k and no3 n the 50 variation of v d or v a are scenarios based on the assumption that a reasonable overestimation or underestimation of these parameters by the user of nutrisense cannot exceed this range normally a much shorter discrepancy than 50 is anticipated the 20 variation of c dc or c dp are scenarios assuming that a maximum error in a concentration determined by a chemical laboratory cannot exceed this range and normally should be much shorter otherwise this laboratory is considered unreliable in all scenarios the reasonable ranges were taken so large that in commercial practice an underestimation overestimation of the tested parameters beyond these ranges is rather unlikely 2 3 case study to assess the efficiency of nutrisense to maintain the nutrient concentrations in the root environment close to target values by frequent readjustment of the ss an experiment with cucumber as a case study was conducted the experiment took place from november 2021 to march 2022 in a glasshouse of the laboratory of vegetable production at the agricultural university of athens aua ν 37 59 10 ε 23 42 29 altitude 24 m cucumber plants cucumis sativus l aisopos f1 rz were grown in a cls using rockwool slabs 100 20 7 5 cm as growing media the plants were transplanted on 4 november and the experiment was terminated on 14 march the seedlings grew up in rockwool cubes 7 5 6 7 5 cm two plants per slab were transplanted and the final plant density was 2 4 plants m 2 harvesting of fruit started on december 21 five experimental plots were used corresponding to five gutters 6 m in length in each gutter 12 cucumber plants were planted the initial composition of the as was according to de kreij et al 1999 without any readjustment up to day 68 while subsequently it was readjusted regularly via nutrisense aiming to maintain target concentrations in the rs as measured in the ds for this purpose samples of ds were collected from each experimental unit at 67 88 116 and 130 days after transplanting dat and immediately analysed to determine the concentrations of k ca2 mg2 no3 n p fe mn zn cu b na cl and hco3 furthermore the ec and the ph were also determined in the ds samples based on these data the concentration of so4 2 s was estimated based on the anion to cation balance the obtained analytical data was used as input to nutrisense c dc c dp to readjust the composition of the as using 10 the new formula of as was immediately implemented and used to fertigate the crop the concept of readjusting the nutrient supply using nutrisense in clss is schematically illustrated in fig 1 the ns compositions calculated using nutrisense were implemented using an automatic fertigation systems alagro iq120 athens greece before transplanting the substrates were filled with a starter solution de kreij et al 1999 and subsequently three slits were performed in each bag to allow free drainage from the substrate after transplanting an as was supplied to the plants with composition suitable for full recycling of the ds in clss savvas et al 2013 the ns was delivered to the plants via a drip irrigation system and two individual emitters were used to supply each plant at a flow rate of 2 l h 1 the fraction of the ds released after irrigation events was maintained within the range 0 30 0 40 by adjusting their frequency in accordance with the climatic conditions the fertigation system was preparing ns for the cls by mixing the entire volume of ds with raw water to a target ec value e m subsequently cs of fertilisers were added to the mix to prepare the final solution supplied to the crop ss at rates aiming to achieve a target ec in the outgoing solution e s the fertigation system comprised nine cs tanks including one for acid one for a fe chelate fertiliser and one for the rest of the micronutrients while each of the other six tanks accommodated a single macronutrient fertiliser calcium nitrate potassium nitrate ammonium nitrate monopotassium phosphate potassium sulphate and magnesium sulphate the use of nine cs of fertilisers enabled the fertigation system to automatically prepare ns of any desired composition merely by introducing into the controlling system the target ec and ph in the ns and suitable injection rates for each of the nine cs savvas 2002 van os et al 2019 the target ec and the injection rates of the cs were calculated by nutrisense the obtained values were introduced to the controlling system of the fertigation system whenever a new chemical analysis of the ds was introduced as input data to nutrisense the plants were pruned into one stem system with gradual descending of the stem fruits and lateral shoots were removed up to a height of 50 cm to encourage vigorous early vegetative growth essential for maximum fruit production above the 50 cm level all lateral branches were pruned out leaving one fruit per node through weekly removal of old leaves a constant number of leaves was maintained on each plant which ranged between 13 and 16 aiming at a leaf area index of 3 3 5 xiaolei and zhifeng 2004 the air temperature c and relative humidity were monitored at 15 minute intervals throughout the cultivation period the minimum day and night temperature was set at 23 and 17 c respectively as suggested by grimstad and frimanslund 1993 the ec and ph levels in the ds as well as the drainage fraction volume of ds to volume of supplied ns were recorded every two days the mineral concentrations in the ds were measured in samples collected separately from each channel a sample of ds was collected from each experimental unit at 67 88 116 and 130 dat subsequently the samples were analysed to determine the ec and ph levels and the concentrations of k ca 2 mg 2 no3 n p fe mn zn cu b na

schnetger and lehners 2014 and phosphorous was determined photometrically according to the murphy riley method at 880 nm murphy and riley 1962 boron was determined according to the azomethine h method zenki et al 1989 at 420 nm while chloride was determined according to the mercury thiocyanate iron method iwasaki et al 1952 zall et al 1956 at 480 nm statistical analysis was performed using the statistica 12 5 for windows statsoft inc tulsa usa in the cucumber case study the concentrations in the ds that were measured after the first use of nutrisense to readjust the as were subjected to linear regression analysis the aim of the regression analysis was to assess the deviation of the measured data from the target value which was constant over time as well as the deviation of the line slope from zero the graphical representation of data was carried out using thegraphpad prism 8 sofware graphpad sofware united states 3 results 3 1 pilot study in table 2 the readjusted nutrient

l plant 1 from the true value revealed that the corresponding change in c ar is appreciably lower than that of v d ranging up to 98 for k and 102 for no3 n fig 2a b this means that a deviation of v d up to 10 from the true value resulted in an error of only 2 in the calculation of c ar similarly when the volume of as v a l plant 1 d 1 varied within a range of 50 the estimated c ar values ranged from 95 to 102 for k and no3 n with reference to the true values shown in table 2 fig 2c d c ar is linearly related to v d indicating that both the overestimation and the underestimation of v d imposes proportionally equal changes to c ra however the relationship of c ar with v a is curvilinear indicating that an underestimation of v a results in larger discrepancies between the estimated and the true c ar compared to an overestimation of v a fig 3a and b show the scenario of obtaining c dp values from a chemical laboratory that deviate up to 20 from the true values while the v a value introduced to nutrisense is either the true value v a or underestimated up to 50 0 5v a or overestimated up to 50 1 5v a when the introduced v a value is true and c dp deviates up to 20 from the true value the discrepancy of the calculated c ar from the true value does not exceed 4 from 96 to 104 of the true value for k and 5 from 95 to 105 of the true value for no3 n when v a is underestimated down to 50 of the true value a deviation of c dp of up to 20 from the true value overestimates the calculated c ar values to a maximum of 4 for k 100 104 of the true c ar and 5 for no3 n 100 105 of the true c ar moreover when v a is overestimated by 50 of the true value the corresponding range of c ar when c dp varies within 20 of the true value is from 92 to 104 of the true c ar value for k and from 90 to 106 for no3 n the c dc values introduced to nutrisense also can deviate from the corresponding true values as they also originate from routine laboratory analyses thus a scenario analysis has been conducted assuming a deviation of the measured c dc values up to 20 from the true c dc values as shown in fig 3c and d c ar changed from 91 to 109 of the true k value 9 deviation as the c dc of k varied within a range of 20 from the true value and v d was the true value while the corresponding range for no3 n extended from 88 to 112 12 deviation when v a was underestimated down to 50 0 5v a the variation of c dc by 20 of the true value resulted in a shorter variation of c ar than that obtained with the true v d which ranged from 98 to 107 of the true c ar value for k and from 96 to 108 for no3 n in contrast when v d was overestimated to 50 of the true v d value 1 5v d the variation of c ar due to variation of c dc by 20 of the true value was substantially larger compared to that estimated with the true v d value ranging from 84 to 112 for k and from 79 to 116 for no3 n 3 3 case study to assess the efficiency of the current algorithm to maintain the mineral composition of the

algorithm developed and tested as a component of the dss nutrisense in the current study successfully readjusted the ec and the nutrient concentrations in the as i e the solution constituting the net nutrient input to the crop grown in the cls this conclusion is mainly based on the composition of the ds on the n sampling date in the pilot study which was closer to the target levels than in the n 1 sampling date compare the c dp and the c dc values with the c dt values in table 2 furthermore this was demonstrated also in the case study in which nutrisense successfully maintained the ec the ph and the concentrations of k ca2 mg2 no3 n and p within the target range in the rs as determined in the ds during the time it was used to regularly readjust the composition of the as several models and dss have been developed to simulate nutrient uptake by vegetable crops some of them are based on simulation of crop growth and plant biomass production in combination with tissue nutrient concentrations to predict nutrient requirements conversa et al 2015 elia and conversa 2015 gallardo et al 2021 2020 2016 ramírez pérez et al 2018 other models and algorithms including the algorithm presented in the current study are mainly based on estimations of the nutrient status in the root environment and the changes occurring during the cropping period due to nutrient uptake by plants savvas 2002 massa et al 2011 moreira barradas et al 2018 most of these models either were developed mainly to simulate nutrient uptake in soil grown crops conversa et al 2015 elia and conversa 2015 or are not specific for either soil grown or soilless crops gallardo et al 2016 2020 2021 only few models and algorithms were specifically developed for soilless crops savvas and adamidis 1999 2000 pardossi et al 2004 savvas et al 2005 silberbush et al 2005 katsoulas et al 2015 and even less are commissioned to optimise nutrition in clss savvas 2002 savvas et al 2005 katsoulas et al 2015 savvas et al 2021 however to our knowledge there is hardly any report in peer reviewed journals on integrated models or algorithms operating via dss to control nutrition in crops cultivated in clss the only relevant references seem to be the reports on the dutch nutrient recommendation system dnrs which is widely used in the netherlands to readjust the nutrient supply during the cropping period in soilless culture systems de kreij et al 1999 blok et al 2023 nutrisense shares a similar approach with the dnrs as it is also based on standard recommendations for the compositions of two interdependent nss particularly the as and the rs which are specific for each crop species thus both the dnrs and nutrisense consider the composition of the as a starting set of target values constituting a standard composition sonneveld and voogt 2009 the standard composition is regularly readjusted during the cropping period aiming to maintain an optimal composition in the rs which is the strategic target for optimal nutrient supply to the crop blok et al 2023 however in the dnrs the exact magnitude of the changes required for the corrections has been established experimentally in single crop single element experiments blok et al 2023 the current algorithm as part of the dss nutrisense goes beyond that approach as it is based on a series of mass balance models to accurately estimate the nutrient uptake by the current crop this is achieved by taking into consideration not only the composition of the latest ds sample n sampling date but also the composition of the ds collected in the previous sampling date n 1 the use of data from both sampling dates enables a quantification of the nutrient to water uptake ratios during the interval between the n 1 and the n sampling date thus the corrections in nutrient supply rates are no longer based on standard estimations from previous model experiments with different cultivars that have been grown in a different environment but on actual measurement of the nutrient uptake in the current crop in addition to the estimation of the current nutrient uptake the algorithm presented here includes a component eq 4 to estimate the change in the concentration of each nutrient in the as that is needed to re establish its target concentration in the rs the dnrs follows a similar approach to compensate the variations of nutrient levels in the root zone aiming at a target duration of 14 days for completion of the compensation action blok et al 2023 as a result the nutrient concentrations in the root solution fluctuate within an acceptable range from the one to the next sampling date which is anticyclic to the variations of the corresponding nutrients in the as and the ss in commercial greenhouses inaccuracies in the estimation of the volume sum of rs and ds per plant v d and the volume of supplied as per plant per day v a are likely in the current study the impact of such inaccuracies was tested by considering scenarios with a 50 deviation of both v d and v a from the true value which is much larger than the anticipated range the results showed that the algorithm tested in the current study is highly forgiving to inaccuracies in these parameters indeed even a 50 deviation in v d resulted in an inaccuracy of 2 in the estimation of c ar for k and no3 n similarly an underestimation of v a by 50 underestimated by only 5 the c ar values of k and no3 n while the overestimation of v a by 50 overestimated c ar by only 2 for k and no3 n low errors in the estimation of the readjusted concentrations in the as were obtained also with all other nutrients data not shown these results show that the readjusted composition of the as is fully credible even when the v d and v a values introduced to nutrisense are rough estimations which may be frequently the case in low tech greenhouses furthermore the curvilinear pattern of the relationship between v a and c ar indicates that an overestimation of v a introduced to nutrisense renders smaller deviations between the estimated and the true optimal c ar value than its underestimation another likely source of errors when readjusting the composition of the as is the possible inaccuracy in analytical results obtained from commercial laboratories that are used to feed the current algorithm although the results from accredited laboratories generally show a high level of confidence cantarella et al 2006 deviations of the measured from the true c dp and c dc values are likely in some cases in the present study scenarios with deviations of c dp and c dc ranging up to a maximum of 20 were tested indicatively for k and no3 n the results showed a fairly low sensitivity of the algorithm to errors in the c dp values measured in laboratories with deviations of the estimated c ar from the true value that did not exceed 5 for an error of 20 in c dp however an error of 20 in the measurement of c dc rendered higher deviations between the estimated and the true c ar values which ranged up to 9 for k and 12 for no3 n these results indicate that an accurate measurement of the nutrient concentrations in the ds is important for a precise readjustment of the as nevertheless small errors ranging up to 10 in the c dc introduced to the algorithm impose only minor deviations between the estimated and the true optimal c ar values the errors in the readjustment of the as composition are not additive over time indeed in the next sampling date any errors in the analytical results obtained from laboratories are again of the same magnitude i e 9 for k and 12 for no3 n in the current study thus the discrepancies between the target and the actual concentrations in the rs are maintained within this rather low range when the composition of the as is regularly readjusted using the current algorithm in contrast if the composition of the as is not regularly readjusted the discrepancies between the nutrient supply and the nutrient uptake rates result in accumulation or depletion of nutrients that is cumulative over time miller et al 2020 voogt and bar yosef 2019 as a result serious nutrient imbalances may occur that may be detrimental for a crop hence the use of a suitable dss such as nutrisense to regularly readjust the composition of the as in clss is valuable for maintaining a balanced nutrient status in the root zone as suggested in credible literature sources e g sonneveld and voogt 2009 this is valid even if the readjusted composition of the as exhibits some discrepancies from the true optimal composition due to inaccuracies in analytical results used as input data in commercial practice deviations in the introduced c dp and or c dc values may coexist with inaccuracies in the introduced v d and or v a values the analysis of this scenario in the current study showed that the discrepancies of the estimated output values c ar from the true c ar values due to simultaneous errors in c dc and v d or c dp and v d are not additive only when v d is overestimated by 50 deviations of the introduced c dp or c dc from the respective true value of about 10 or more render c ar values deviating more than 10 from the true optimal c ar value these results suggest that it is much more important to avoid an overestimation than an underestimation of the v d value introduced to nutrisense in the current paper results from only one case study are reported due to limitations in time and financial resources the case study indicated that when the ds was recycled frequent determination of its mineral composition and subsequent readjustment of the as using the current algorithm as part of the dss nutrisense could effectively maintain the nutrient concentrations within the target range in the root zone rs the frequent readjustment of the nutrient supply using nutrisense maintained the ec ph and the concentrations of the main macronutrients k ca2 mg2 no3 n p within the target range only the sulphate concentration in the ds dropped to substantially lower levels than the target range in the two last readjustments of the as this happened because the so4 2 s concentration in the ad was not readjusted through the current algorithm but was automatically determined by nutrisense to equalise differences in the ionic balance which is a standard practice in nss for soilless crops sonneveld 2002 sulphate is the most suitable nutrient ion for electrochemically balancing a ns because the plants are well adapted within a wide range of sulphate concentrations in the root zone lopez et al 1996 thus even larger fluctuations of the sulphate level in the root zone than 10 of the optimal level are mostly not harmful to plants nevertheless a too low s supply may be harmful to plants martinez et al 1984 as implied by the results of the current study in exceptional cases the sulphate concentration in the as that is estimated through the anion to cation balance might be too low or too high due to additive deviations in the estimated concentrations of the other macronutrient ions although such discrepancies are corrected in the next readjustments of the as minimum and maximum acceptable concentrations for so4 2 s in the as could be set to fully prevent sub or supra optimal supply of so4 2 s when the so4 2 s value estimated for the as via anion to cation balance is out of the min max range the electrochemical balance can be completed through a commensurate change of the no3 n concentration in the as the algorithm presented in the current study estimates the mean nutrient ucs for the period between the last two ds samplings and assumes that these values will be valid also for the time until the next readjustment however due to changes in both climatic conditions and crop development some ucs may change slightly in the next days after the readjustment of the as and this may result in commensurate deviations between the actual and the target composition in the rs ds therefore small deviations between the target and the actual nutrient concentrations in the rs ds despite the use of nutrisense to optimise nutrition in a cls are reasonable however these deviations are not additive as they are detected and corrected in the next readjustment of the nutrient concentrations in the as appropriate readjustment of the nutrient supply in clss based on feedback from the root zone solution requires complicated calculations and a sound chemical mathematical and plant nutritional background thus even in the absence of yield benefits the current algorithm operating via nutrisense provides a novel tool for easy and accurate readjustment of the nutrient supply in clss that can be used not only by experts but also by growers with hardly any background in chemistry and mathematics nutrisense is available via internet at https nutrisense online and can thus be used any time by any professional working with any soilless culture system in any country worldwide 5 conclusions in the current study an algorithm consisting of a series of mass balance models was developed and used as a component of the decision support system nutrisense to optimise nutrition in crops grown in clss the algorithm improved the nutrient status in the root zone of a tomato crop grown in a cls after application of nutrient solution with composition readjusted using nutrisense a scenario analysis showed that the algorithm is not sensitive to inaccuracies of up to 50 in some parameters used to feed the models particularly the daily volume of nutrient solution supplied to the crop or the volume of available nutrient solution per plant in the soilless system deviations up to 20 in the drainage solution composition introduced to nutrisense due to inaccurate measurements in commercial laboratories render output values for the readjusted concentration of the added solution ranging within 10 from the true value which are acceptable a case study with cucumber grown in a cls and managed with nutrisense showed that the nutrient concentrations in the root zone were effectively maintained within the target range when the as was frequently readjusted based on the composition of the drainage solution only so4 2 s was lower that the optimal range because it was readjusted based on the anion to cation balance and not on the algorithm but this can fixed by setting minimum maximum acceptable levels for sulphate in the as declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

8887,to support growers in their transition towards recycling of water and fertilisers in soilless crops an algorithm consisting of mass balance models was developed and applied via the decision support system nutrisense this algorithm is commissioned to readjust the composition of the nutrient solution ns supplied to plants after a chemical analysis of the drainage solution ds aiming to match nutrient input with crop nutrient uptake thus maintaining the nutrient concentrations within target ranges in the root zone the algorithm was tested in a pilot study conducted in a commercial greenhouse with tomato grown in a closed loop soilless system and the data were further used for scenario analyses to assess its sensitivity to inaccuracies in the parameters fed to the models the nutrient concentrations in the root solution were closer to the target levels after supplying ns readjusted using the current algorithm thus confirming its efficiency to maintain optimal nutrient levels in the root zone of soilless crops when the ds is recycled the scenario analysis showed that the algorithm is not sensitive to inaccuracies in input parameters related to the daily volume of ns supplied to the crop or to the volume of available ns per plant in the soilless system however it was moderately sensitive to inaccurate determinations of the nutrient concentrations in the ds furthermore a case study with a closed loop soilless crop of cucumber managed with nutrisense was conducted aimed to confirm the efficiency of the algorithm to maintain optimal nutrient levels in the root environment the case study showed that the readjustment of the nutrient supply using nutrisense could successfully maintain the ec ph and macronutrient levels within a range of 10 variation from the target level only so4 2 showed a larger discrepancy than 10 from the target value because the supply level of this macronutrient was not estimated directly through the current algorithm but indirectly through the anion to cation balance however this problem can be easily tackled by setting a minimum level of so4 2 supply as a present value in nutrisense graphical abstract ga1

a restricted volume compared to soil grown crops and thus the reserves of nutrients for the plants are limited sonneveld and voogt 2009 therefore the nutrient supply to the crop should be precise inappropriate nutrient concentrations in the nutrient solution ns supplied to a crop henceforth termed supply solution and abbreviated as ss can cause nutrient imbalances in the root environment with deleterious effects on yield and quality due to nutrient deficiency toxicity or salinity massa et al 2020 neocleous and savvas 2013 sonneveld and voogt 2009 tzerakis et al 2013 however unpredictable conditions in each crop such as the current microclimatic parameters inside the greenhouse the cultivar the fruit load etc could alter the nutrient needs of the plants gallardo et al 2021 therefore the composition of the ss should be periodically adapted to the current crop demands savvas et al 2021 in a closed loop soilless system cls the fertigation effluents henceforth termed drainage solution ds are collected mixed with raw water and nutrients and recycled after appropriate adjustment of ph and electrical conductivity ec recycling of the ds represents an ecologically sound technology as it can reduce water consumption by 20 35 and fertiliser use by 40 50 in greenhouse crops while minimising or even eliminating losses of nutrients thus preventing environmental pollution by no3 n and p savvas and gruda 2018 the management of nutrient supply in clss is largely based on the anticipated ratio between the mass of a nutrient absorbed by the crop and the volume of water expressed as mmol l 1 this ratio will be henceforth termed uptake concentration sonneveld and voogt 2009 thompson et al 2013 abbreviated as uc when the concentration of a nutrient is maintained close to a standard level in the root zone the average uc of this nutrient exhibits some stability for a particular developmental stage and plant species under non contrasting climatic conditions gallardo et al 2021 savvas and lenz 1995 sonneveld and voogt 2009 therefore it can be used as a basic suggestion for the net nutrient input to crops cultivated in clss in crops grown on substrates in clss the ss is ultimately a mix of fresh ns net nutrient input henceforth termed added solution as and ds blok et al 2023 in such cropping systems the net input of the i nutrient to the plants should be equilibrated with its net output assuming that no ds is discharged to avoid accumulation or depletion of this nutrient to the root zone to achieve this equilibrium the concentration of the i nutrient in the as should be constantly equal to the anticipated uc of this nutrient however in a commercial greenhouse the actual ucs may deviate to some extent from those referenced as standard in the literature gallardo et al 2021 which have been determined experimentally as a result a gradual accumulation or depletion of some nutrients in the root zone may occur with time deviations between the standard and the actual ucs in a particular crop can be due to the season of the year gallardo et al 2021 gómez lópez et al 2004 the actual climatic conditions maintained inside the greenhouse ropokis et al 2019 the cultivar ropokis et al 2018 the current concentration of this nutrient in the root zone ropokis et al 2019 sonneveld and voogt 2009 and the use of grafted plants savvas et al 2017 therefore the standard ucs suggested in the literature should be considered only rough estimations serving as a starting point although accumulation or depletion of nutrients in the root zone may be small in the short term it can reach harmful levels when summed over longer periods resulting in serious nutrient imbalances in the root zone to prevent large nutrient imbalances in the root zone growers regularly ideally fortnightly or even weekly determine the nutrient concentrations in a sample of ds or ns sampled from the root zone and use the analytical data to readjust the net nutrient input by modifying the composition of the as massa et al 2020 neocleous and savvas 2022 voogt and bar yosef 2019 nevertheless properly readjusting the composition of the as remains a challenge as it requires complicated calculations based on sound simulation principles blok et al 2023 to address this requirement an algorithm based on mass balance simulation was developed as part of the decision support system dss nutrisense which was presented at the ii international symposium on growing media soilless cultivation and compost utilization in horticulture in ghent belgium in 2021 savvas et al 2021 nutrisense is online available via the link https nutrisense online to calibrate this algorithm a simulation study was conducted based on data originating from a commercial crop of tomato cultivated in a cls furthermore a greenhouse experiment with cucumber grown in a cls was conducted to validate this algorithm under semi commercial cropping conditions and assess its efficiency to maintain the nutrient concentrations close to the target levels in the root zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 algorithm outline following the concept of the dutch nutrient recommendation system blok et al 2023 the current algorithm is based on standard compositions of two interdependent nutrient solutions for each crop species which are the basic added solution as and the target root solution rs i e the ns retained in the pores of the substrate the ns that is finally supplied to the crop henceforth termed supply solution ss is the mix of as and ds at an adjustable ratio however the ds is in fact rs released from the substrate due to gravity when new ss is provided to the crop via irrigation system therefore the composition of rs and ds can be considered identical ignoring small differences due to temporal variations in both compositions this consideration is common practice in commercial soilless crops voogt and bar yosef 2019 suggestions for the nutrient concentrations in the basic as and the rs are referenced in several literature sources e g de kreij et al 1999 savvas et al 2013 sonneveld and voogt 2009 van der lugt et al 2020 for most nutrients the suggested concentration in the basic as corresponds to the standard uc of this nutrient standard ucs specific for each plant species have been experimentally determined and reported in several publications e g adams 2002 neocleous et al 2021 2020 neocleous and savvas 2019 2018 2015 ropokis et al 2021 2018 savvas et al 2017 savvas and lenz 1995 thompson et al 2013 the algorithm presented in the current paper aims at readjusting the composition of the basic as at regular time intervals e g every fortnight based on a chemical analysis of rs sampled either directly from the rooting medium or more commonly from the ds the algorithm is based on mass balance modelling and was established according to the chain of reasoning presented in the next readjusting the concentration of the i nutrient in the as is necessary when a chemical analysis reveals a significant difference between the current concentration of the i nutrient in the rs c dc and the suggested value in the target rs c dt in the current study a difference between c dc and c dt was considered insignificant when 0 95c dt c dc 1 05c dt if the difference is significant the total mass mmol per plant of i m i that has to be supplied to or removed from the rs to re establish the target concentration can be theoretically estimated using the following equation 1 m i c dt c dc v d where v d is the total volume l of the sum of rs and ds per plant measured when the ds sample was collected for analysis assuming that mi is gradually supplied to the crop in addition to the current level of supply by altering the concentration mmol l of the i nutrient in the as from the currently applied value c ac to a suitable new value c an and supplying the re adjusted as for t f days m i is estimated also through the following equation 2 m i v a t f δ c a where v a is

different δc a is estimated through 4 as the values of c dt and c dc are also different for each of them δc a is subsequently added to the actual uc of i c ua to estimate the new readjusted concentration of i c ar in the as the currently applied concentration of the i nutrient in the as c ac is different than the actual uc c ua when i accumulates or depletes in the rs and no losses of i occur due to ds discharge or due to any other reason accumulation or depletion occurs when c dc is significantly higher or lower than c dt according to the latest chemical analysis of the rs and no other losses of i occur in the cls in that case the actual uc of i c ua has to be estimated by definition 5 c ua m i v a in 5 σ mi is the total mass mmol plant 1 of the i nutrient that was absorbed by the crop during a time period of t p days this period d started on the date of the n 1 n 0 1 2 sampling of rs and terminates on the date of the current sampling n sampling σv a is the volume l of as

concentration mmol l 1 in the currently supplied as the supplied volume l of as per day and t p c ac v a t p similarly the amount of i accumulated or depleted is equal to the concentration difference mmol l 1 in the rs between samplings n 1 and n multiplied with the total volume l of rs and ds v d in the greenhouse compartment that is irrigated with the as under readjustment consequently 7 m i c

values are equal to the target concentrations in the standard as and the c dp values are equal to the target concentrations in the standard rs as suggested in credible literature sources finally the readjusted concentration mmol l 1 of i in the as c ar is equal to the sum of c ua which covers the plant needs without any accumulation or depletion and δc a which is needed to decrease or increase the current concentration of i in the rs from c dc to c dt within a time interval of t f days in mathematical terms 9 c ar c ua δ c a where c ua and δc a have been determined using 8 and 4 respectively consequently the concentration of the i nutrient in the as is readjusted to c ar according to the following equation which is obtained by substituting 8 for c ua and 4 for δc a in 9 10 c

crops grown on substrates in clss in 10 c dt is a standard value for each nutrient and crop species the database of nutrisense includes standard c dt values for many plant species grown in greenhouses and all nutrients added in a ns originating from various literature sources de kreij et al 1999 neocleous et al 2021 2020 neocleous and savvas 2019 2018 2015 ropokis et al 2021 2019 2018 savvas et al 2017 2013 savvas and lenz 1995 sonneveld and voogt 2009 van der lugt et al 2020 furthermore c dc and c dp are measured values introduced to nutrisense by the user while c ac is a value taken from the currently applied formula of as finally v d v a t p t f are known parameters related to the soilless cropping system and the applied fertigation schedule which are introduced to nutrisense by the user the c ar values are subsequently used by nutrisense to estimate the weights of fertilisers needed to prepare new concentrated stock solutions cs a and b based on the algorithm developed by savvas and adamidis 1999 2000 eq 10 is used to readjust the concentrations of k ca2 mg2 no3 n p fe mn zn cu b and mo the c ar value for nh4 n is readjusted only when the ph in the rs ph r is lower than 5 5 or higher than 6 5 in proportion to the current ph r as the ph in the rs is strongly influenced by the level of ammonium supply savvas et al 2006 2003 savvas and gruda 2018 sonneveld and voogt 2009 the c ar values for k ca2 mg2 and nh4 n and the sodium concentration in the water c naw are further used to calculate the ec of the readjusted as e ar using the empirical equation obtained from savvas and adamidis 1999 2000 after solving for e ar 11 e ar σ c i 1 462 9 819 where σ c i is the sum of the c ar values for k ca2 and mg2 obtained from 10 nh4 n and c naw after conversion into meq l 1 sometimes the c ar values estimated for ca and or mg by 10 are lower than the respective concentrations in the raw water massa et al 2020 neocleous and savvas 2013 ropokis et al 2021 in these cases the ca and or mg values estimated by 10 are replaced by their concentrations in the raw water in substrate grown crops the most widely used technology to recycle the ds is to initially blend this with raw water at an automatically adjustable ratio that renders a pre set ec in the mix e m using a suitable device blok et al 2023 subsequently the mix is pumped to a fertigation system which automatically injects stock solutions of fertilisers to achieve the target ec in the outgoing ss e s hence to manage recycling of the ds in a cls when the as is readjusted it is imperative to also readjust e m and e s estimating new values henceforth denoted by e mr and e sr respectively to readjust the ec of the ss the following equation is used 12 e sr a e d t 1 a e ar where e sr is the readjusted e s a is the target drainage fraction e dt is the target ec in the rs and ds and e ar is the value estimated using 11 since e sr is estimated as a function of the target ec in the rs ds e dt while the current ec in the rs ds e dc may be different the actual drainage fraction that is recycled x may also be different than the target a the actual drainage fraction that is recycled is estimated using 12 after replacing a with x and e dt with e da and subsequently solving for x 13 x e sr e ar e dc e ar finally a readjusted ec for the mix of ds and raw water e mr is estimated taking into consideration the current ec in the ds on the n sampling date e dc using the following equation 14 e mr x e dc 1 x e w where e w is the ec of the raw water e mr can be estimated also through the following mass balance equation which is obtained by subtracting the net contribution of fertiliser injection from e sr 15 e mr e sr 1 x e ar e w the e mr value estimated by 14 is identical with that estimated by 15 nutrisense uses a default value of 0 3 as a in 12 to estimate e sr but the user has the option to select a pre set e mr value for the mix in that case the pre set e mr is used in 14 to estimate x after rearrangement the estimated x value is substituted in 15 which is subsequently solved for e sr to estimate a readjusted ec value for the ss the algorithm presented in the current study is suitable for closed loop soilless cultivations on substrates in which the ds is initially mixed with raw water and subsequently the mix is driven to a fertigation system where the injection of fertilisers takes place blok et al 2023 if the ds is mixed with as which has been previously prepared by the fertigation system or if the plants are cultivated in a water culture system such as nft or floating savvas and gruda 2018 a properly modified version of the currently presented algorithm is applied by nutrisense not described in the current paper 2 2 pilot study and scenario analysis to test the capability of the current algorithm to provide a sound readjustment of the as in clss a pilot study was conducted the specific aims of this case study were to test a whether the results obtained from application of the algorithm in a commercial greenhouse are reasonable and how these are related to the introduced parameters and b to better understand the relationships between the ss and the rs the pilot study was conducted in a commercial greenhouse tomato crop grown on rockwool slabs in a cls the greenhouse enterprise comprised 8 compartments and the area of each compartment was 2 ha each compartment was equipped with an independent fertigation system to prepare the final ss and irrigate the crop with this the ss was prepared by automatically injecting cs of fertilisers from two separate tanks a b system see savvas and gruda 2018 to a mix of ds and raw water the ds was blended with raw water using a suitable device at an automatically adjustable ratio aiming at maintaining a pre set ec to the mix e m irrespective of temporal changes in the ec of the ds blok et al 2023 the plant density was 3 1 plants m 2 and the volume of ns supplied to the crop ss during the study period was 2 8 l plant 1 d 1 table 1 the mean fraction of ds was 0 32 for the period from n 1 to the n sampling date thus the net volume of as per plant was 1 90 l d 1 the mineral concentrations k ca2 mg2 nh4 n no3 n p so4 2 s fe mn zn cu b cl na and hco3 in the ds were determined on weekly basis the composition of the ds collected on the n 1 sampling date was introduced to nutrisense to readjust the e mr and e sr and to compute a readjusted composition of as using the algorithm presented in section 2 1 subsequently the readjusted e m e s and as composition were applied in the tomato crop the raw water used to prepare ns e w had an ec of 0 57 ds m 1 and the following mineral composition macronutrients in mm micronutrients in μμ ca2 2 22 mg2 0 42 na 0 37 so4 2 s 0 2

target nutrient concentrations in the rs c dt and the currently applied concentrations in the as c ac i e the concentrations applied in the interval from the n 1 to the n sampling date are also listed in table 2 the c dt values were according to sonneveld and voogt 2009 with small modifications taking into consideration new research findings about the benefits or partially replacing no3 n by cl in tomato crops neocleous et al 2021 truffault et al 2019 the dimensions of the slabs were 120 20 7 5 cm which corresponds to 18 l and their mean water content after full irrigation container capacity was 60 of their volume each slab accommodated 6 plants pruned to a single stem and thus the volume of rs per plant was 1 8 l at morning when the ds samples were collected a mean ds volume of 1 15 l per plant was contained in the tank used to store it before reusing thus the total volume of rs plus ds v d was 2 95 l plant 1 since samples were collected every week the application time of a readjusted as was 7 days thus t p 7 while readjusting was aiming at re establishing the target concentrations in the rs within 7 days thus t f 7 the data from the commercial tomato crop the c dc and c dp values measured in samples collected on the n and n 1 sampling days respectively and the c ac values applied from the n 1 to the n sampling date were used to estimate the car e sr and emr values the calculations were performed using eqs 10 12 and 14 respectively subsequently the algorithm was used to conduct scenario analyses aiming to demonstrate how c ar changes as function of v d v a c dc or c dp when these variables vary within a reasonable range the strategic objective of the scenario analyses was to assess the sensitivity of the algorithm to inaccuracies in the estimation of these parameters by growers v d v a and chemical laboratories c dc c dp inaccuracies in the estimated values of these parameters may occur also because in systems with growing media there are blind spots not interfering with the water flows where nutrients salts accumulate four different scenario analyses were conducted in each scenario analysis one of the parameters v d v a c dc or c dp was considered the single independent variable in eq 10 while c ar was always the dependent variable in these scenarios v d or v a received values ranging from 50 to 50 while c dc or c dp received values ranging from 20 20 around the corresponding true values shown in table 2 each scenario analysis was applied for two representative macronutrients particularly for k and no3 n the 50 variation of v d or v a are scenarios based on the assumption that a reasonable overestimation or underestimation of these parameters by the user of nutrisense cannot exceed this range normally a much shorter discrepancy than 50 is anticipated the 20 variation of c dc or c dp are scenarios assuming that a maximum error in a concentration determined by a chemical laboratory cannot exceed this range and normally should be much shorter otherwise this laboratory is considered unreliable in all scenarios the reasonable ranges were taken so large that in commercial practice an underestimation overestimation of the tested parameters beyond these ranges is rather unlikely 2 3 case study to assess the efficiency of nutrisense to maintain the nutrient concentrations in the root environment close to target values by frequent readjustment of the ss an experiment with cucumber as a case study was conducted the experiment took place from november 2021 to march 2022 in a glasshouse of the laboratory of vegetable production at the agricultural university of athens aua ν 37 59 10 ε 23 42 29 altitude 24 m cucumber plants cucumis sativus l aisopos f1 rz were grown in a cls using rockwool slabs 100 20 7 5 cm as growing media the plants were transplanted on 4 november and the experiment was terminated on 14 march the seedlings grew up in rockwool cubes 7 5 6 7 5 cm two plants per slab were transplanted and the final plant density was 2 4 plants m 2 harvesting of fruit started on december 21 five experimental plots were used corresponding to five gutters 6 m in length in each gutter 12 cucumber plants were planted the initial composition of the as was according to de kreij et al 1999 without any readjustment up to day 68 while subsequently it was readjusted regularly via nutrisense aiming to maintain target concentrations in the rs as measured in the ds for this purpose samples of ds were collected from each experimental unit at 67 88 116 and 130 days after transplanting dat and immediately analysed to determine the concentrations of k ca2 mg2 no3 n p fe mn zn cu b na cl and hco3 furthermore the ec and the ph were also determined in the ds samples based on these data the concentration of so4 2 s was estimated based on the anion to cation balance the obtained analytical data was used as input to nutrisense c dc c dp to readjust the composition of the as using 10 the new formula of as was immediately implemented and used to fertigate the crop the concept of readjusting the nutrient supply using nutrisense in clss is schematically illustrated in fig 1 the ns compositions calculated using nutrisense were implemented using an automatic fertigation systems alagro iq120 athens greece before transplanting the substrates were filled with a starter solution de kreij et al 1999 and subsequently three slits were performed in each bag to allow free drainage from the substrate after transplanting an as was supplied to the plants with composition suitable for full recycling of the ds in clss savvas et al 2013 the ns was delivered to the plants via a drip irrigation system and two individual emitters were used to supply each plant at a flow rate of 2 l h 1 the fraction of the ds released after irrigation events was maintained within the range 0 30 0 40 by adjusting their frequency in accordance with the climatic conditions the fertigation system was preparing ns for the cls by mixing the entire volume of ds with raw water to a target ec value e m subsequently cs of fertilisers were added to the mix to prepare the final solution supplied to the crop ss at rates aiming to achieve a target ec in the outgoing solution e s the fertigation system comprised nine cs tanks including one for acid one for a fe chelate fertiliser and one for the rest of the micronutrients while each of the other six tanks accommodated a single macronutrient fertiliser calcium nitrate potassium nitrate ammonium nitrate monopotassium phosphate potassium sulphate and magnesium sulphate the use of nine cs of fertilisers enabled the fertigation system to automatically prepare ns of any desired composition merely by introducing into the controlling system the target ec and ph in the ns and suitable injection rates for each of the nine cs savvas 2002 van os et al 2019 the target ec and the injection rates of the cs were calculated by nutrisense the obtained values were introduced to the controlling system of the fertigation system whenever a new chemical analysis of the ds was introduced as input data to nutrisense the plants were pruned into one stem system with gradual descending of the stem fruits and lateral shoots were removed up to a height of 50 cm to encourage vigorous early vegetative growth essential for maximum fruit production above the 50 cm level all lateral branches were pruned out leaving one fruit per node through weekly removal of old leaves a constant number of leaves was maintained on each plant which ranged between 13 and 16 aiming at a leaf area index of 3 3 5 xiaolei and zhifeng 2004 the air temperature c and relative humidity were monitored at 15 minute intervals throughout the cultivation period the minimum day and night temperature was set at 23 and 17 c respectively as suggested by grimstad and frimanslund 1993 the ec and ph levels in the ds as well as the drainage fraction volume of ds to volume of supplied ns were recorded every two days the mineral concentrations in the ds were measured in samples collected separately from each channel a sample of ds was collected from each experimental unit at 67 88 116 and 130 dat subsequently the samples were analysed to determine the ec and ph levels and the concentrations of k ca 2 mg 2 no3 n p fe mn zn cu b na cl and hco3 the ec ds m 1 and ph levels in the samples were measured using a bluelab combo meter plus bluelab new zealand the concentrations of ca2 mg2 fe mn zn and cu were measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aa 7000 shimadzu corporation japan the concentrations of k and na were determined by flame photometry sherwood model 410 cambridge uk the concentrations of no3 n p b and cl were measured photometrically using a 96 position microplate spectrophotometer anthos zenyth 200 biochrom ma usa nitrates were determined according to the vanadium chloride method at 540 nm schnetger and lehners 2014 and phosphorous was determined photometrically according to the murphy riley method at 880 nm murphy and riley 1962 boron was determined according to the azomethine h method zenki et al 1989 at 420 nm while chloride was determined according to the mercury thiocyanate iron method iwasaki et al 1952 zall et al 1956 at 480 nm statistical analysis was performed using the statistica 12 5 for windows statsoft inc tulsa usa in the cucumber case study the concentrations in the ds that were measured after the first use of nutrisense to readjust the as were subjected to linear regression analysis the aim of the regression analysis was to assess the deviation of the measured data from the target value which was constant over time as well as the deviation of the line slope from zero the graphical representation of data was carried out using thegraphpad prism 8 sofware graphpad sofware united states 3 results 3 1 pilot study in table 2 the readjusted nutrient concentrations in the as c ar are shown which were calculated by nutrisense taking into consideration the composition of the currently applied as c ac the mineral composition of the ds in the n 1 and the n sampling dates c dp and c dc respectively and the target nutrient concentrations in the rs and ds c dt when comparing the readjusted values with the currently applied values i e c ar vs c ac in the as differences ranging from 13 7 12 6 are observed the largest decrease in the c ar compared to the c ac was calculated by nutrisense for mg2 13 7 followed by b 9 6 and p 8 4 while the largest

implement a readjusted as according to the standard method applied in the current study first blending the ds with raw water and subsequently injecting cs of fertilisers to the mix to obtain the ss the ec values of the as e a the mix of ds and raw water e m and the ss e t should be also readjusted the e ar values calculated by nutrisense after the n 1 and n sampling dates using eq 11 were 2 07

was 2 62 and 2 59 ds m 1 in the readjustments performed after the n 1 and n sampling dates respectively 3 2 scenario analysis the scenario of an up to 50 discrepancy in the volume sum of rs and ds v d l plant 1 from the true value revealed that the corresponding change in c ar is appreciably lower than that of v d ranging up to 98 for k and 102 for no3 n fig 2a b this means that a deviation of v d up to 10 from the true value resulted in an error of only 2 in the calculation of c ar similarly when the volume of as v a l plant 1 d 1 varied within a range of 50 the estimated c ar values ranged from 95 to 102 for k and no3 n with reference to the true values shown in table 2 fig 2c d c ar is linearly related to v d indicating that both the overestimation and the underestimation of v d imposes proportionally equal changes to c ra however the relationship of c ar with v a is curvilinear indicating that an underestimation of v a results in larger discrepancies between the estimated and the true c ar compared to an overestimation of v a fig 3a and b show the scenario of obtaining c dp values from a chemical laboratory that deviate up to 20 from the true values while the v a value introduced to nutrisense is either the true value v a or underestimated up to 50 0 5v a or overestimated up to 50 1 5v a when the introduced v a value is true and c dp deviates up to 20 from the true value the discrepancy of the calculated c ar from the true value does not exceed 4 from 96 to 104 of the true value for k and 5 from 95 to 105 of the true value for no3 n when v a is underestimated down to 50 of the true value a deviation of c dp of up to 20 from the true value overestimates the calculated c ar values to a maximum of 4 for k 100 104 of the true c ar and 5 for no3 n 100 105 of the true c ar moreover when v a is overestimated by 50 of the true value the corresponding range of c ar when c dp varies within 20 of the true value is from 92 to 104 of the true c ar value for k and from 90 to 106 for no3 n the c dc values introduced to nutrisense also can deviate from the corresponding true values as they also originate from routine laboratory analyses thus a scenario analysis has been conducted assuming a deviation of the measured c dc values up to 20 from the true c dc values as shown in fig 3c and d c ar changed from 91 to 109 of the true k value 9 deviation as the c dc of k varied within a range of 20 from the true value and v d was the true value while the corresponding range for no3 n extended from 88 to 112 12 deviation when v a was underestimated down to 50 0 5v a the variation of c dc by 20 of the true value resulted in a shorter variation of c ar than that obtained with the true v d which ranged from 98 to 107 of the true c ar value for k and from 96 to 108 for no3 n in contrast when v d was overestimated to 50 of the true v d value 1 5v d the variation of c ar due to variation of c dc by 20 of the true value was substantially larger compared to that estimated with the true v d value ranging from 84 to 112 for k and from 79 to 116 for no3 n 3 3 case study to assess the efficiency of the current algorithm to maintain the mineral composition of the

algorithm developed and tested as a component of the dss nutrisense in the current study successfully readjusted the ec and the nutrient concentrations in the as i e the solution constituting the net nutrient input to the crop grown in the cls this conclusion is mainly based on the composition of the ds on the n sampling date in the pilot study which was closer to the target levels than in the n 1 sampling date compare the c dp and the c dc values with the c dt values in table 2 furthermore this was demonstrated also in the case study in which nutrisense successfully maintained the ec the ph and the concentrations of k ca2 mg2 no3 n and p within the target range in the rs as determined in the ds during the time it was used to regularly readjust the composition of the as several models and dss have been developed to simulate nutrient uptake by vegetable crops some of them are based on simulation of crop growth and plant biomass production in combination with tissue nutrient concentrations to predict nutrient requirements conversa et al 2015 elia and conversa 2015 gallardo et al 2021 2020 2016 ramírez pérez et al 2018 other models and algorithms including the algorithm presented in the current study are mainly based on estimations of the nutrient status in the root environment and the changes occurring during the cropping period due to nutrient uptake by plants savvas 2002 massa et al 2011 moreira barradas et al 2018 most of these models either were developed mainly to simulate nutrient uptake in soil grown crops conversa et al 2015 elia and conversa 2015 or are not specific for either soil grown or soilless crops gallardo et al 2016 2020 2021 only few models and algorithms were specifically developed for soilless crops savvas and adamidis 1999 2000 pardossi et al 2004 savvas et al 2005 silberbush et al 2005 katsoulas et al 2015 and even less are commissioned to optimise nutrition in clss savvas 2002 savvas et al 2005 katsoulas et al 2015 savvas et al 2021 however to our knowledge there is hardly any report in peer reviewed journals on integrated models or algorithms operating via dss to control nutrition in crops cultivated in clss the only relevant references seem to be the reports on the dutch nutrient recommendation system dnrs which is widely used in the netherlands to readjust the nutrient supply during the cropping period in soilless culture systems de kreij et al 1999 blok et al 2023 nutrisense shares a similar approach with the dnrs as it is also based on standard recommendations for the compositions of two interdependent nss particularly the as and the rs which are specific for each crop species thus both the dnrs and nutrisense consider the composition of the as a starting set of target values constituting a standard composition sonneveld and voogt 2009 the standard composition is regularly readjusted during the cropping period aiming to maintain an optimal composition in the rs which is the strategic target for optimal nutrient supply to the crop blok et al 2023 however in the dnrs the exact magnitude of the changes required for the corrections has been established experimentally in single crop single element experiments blok et al 2023 the current algorithm as part of the dss nutrisense goes beyond that approach as it is based on a series of mass balance models to accurately estimate the nutrient uptake by the current crop this is achieved by taking into consideration not only the composition of the latest ds sample n sampling date but also the composition of the ds collected in the previous sampling date n 1 the use of data from both sampling dates enables a quantification of the nutrient to water uptake ratios during the interval between the n 1 and the n sampling date thus the corrections in nutrient supply rates are no longer based on standard estimations from previous model experiments with different cultivars that have been grown in a different environment but on actual measurement of the nutrient uptake in the current crop in addition to the estimation of the current nutrient uptake the algorithm presented here includes a component eq 4 to estimate the change in the concentration of each nutrient in the as that is needed to re establish its target concentration in the rs the dnrs follows a similar approach to compensate the variations of nutrient levels in the root zone aiming at a target duration of 14 days for completion of the compensation action blok et al 2023 as a result the nutrient concentrations in the root solution fluctuate within an acceptable range from the one to the next sampling date which is anticyclic to the variations of the corresponding nutrients in the as and the ss in commercial greenhouses inaccuracies in the estimation of the volume sum of rs and ds per plant v d and the volume of supplied as per plant per day v a are likely in the current study the impact of such inaccuracies was tested by considering scenarios with a 50 deviation of both v d and v a from the true value which is much larger than the anticipated range the results showed that the algorithm tested in the current study is highly forgiving to inaccuracies in these parameters indeed even a 50 deviation in v d resulted in an inaccuracy of 2 in the estimation of c ar for k and no3 n similarly an underestimation of v a by 50 underestimated by only 5 the c ar values of k and no3 n while the overestimation of v a by 50 overestimated c ar by only 2 for k and no3 n low errors in the estimation of the readjusted concentrations in the as were obtained also with all other nutrients data not shown these results show that the readjusted composition of the as is fully credible even when the v d and v a values introduced to nutrisense are rough estimations which may be frequently the case in low tech greenhouses furthermore the curvilinear pattern of the relationship between v a and c ar indicates that an overestimation of v a introduced to nutrisense renders smaller deviations between the estimated and the true optimal c ar value than its underestimation another likely source of errors when readjusting the composition of the as is the possible inaccuracy in analytical results obtained from commercial laboratories that are used to feed the current algorithm although the results from accredited laboratories generally show a high level of confidence cantarella et al 2006 deviations of the measured from the true c dp and c dc values are likely in some cases in the present study scenarios with deviations of c dp and c dc ranging up to a maximum of 20 were tested indicatively for k and no3 n the results showed a fairly low sensitivity of the algorithm to errors in the c dp values measured in laboratories with deviations of the estimated c ar from the true value that did not exceed 5 for an error of 20 in c dp however an error of 20 in the measurement of c dc rendered higher deviations between the estimated and the true c ar values which ranged up to 9 for k and 12 for no3 n these results indicate that an accurate measurement of the nutrient concentrations in the ds is important for a precise readjustment of the as nevertheless small errors ranging up to 10 in the c dc introduced to the algorithm impose only minor deviations between the estimated and the true optimal c ar values the errors in the readjustment of the as composition are not additive over time indeed in the next sampling date any errors in the analytical results obtained from laboratories are again of the same magnitude i e 9 for k and 12 for no3 n in the current study thus the discrepancies between the target and the actual concentrations in the rs are maintained within this rather low range when the composition of the as is regularly readjusted using the current algorithm in contrast if the composition of the as is not regularly readjusted the discrepancies between the nutrient supply and the nutrient uptake rates result in accumulation or depletion of nutrients that is cumulative over time miller et al 2020 voogt and bar yosef 2019 as a result serious nutrient imbalances may occur that may be detrimental for a crop hence the use of a suitable dss such as nutrisense to regularly readjust the composition of the as in clss is valuable for maintaining a balanced nutrient status in the root zone as suggested in credible literature sources e g sonneveld and voogt 2009 this is valid even if the readjusted composition of the as exhibits some discrepancies from the true optimal composition due to inaccuracies in analytical results used as input data in commercial practice deviations in the introduced c dp and or c dc values may coexist with inaccuracies in the introduced v d and or v a values the analysis of this scenario in the current study showed that the discrepancies of the estimated output values c ar from the true c ar values due to simultaneous errors in c dc and v d or c dp and v d are not additive only when v d is overestimated by 50 deviations of the introduced c dp or c dc from the respective true value of about 10 or more render c ar values deviating more than 10 from the true optimal c ar value these results suggest that it is much more important to avoid an overestimation than an underestimation of the v d value introduced to nutrisense in the current paper results from only one case study are reported due to limitations in time and financial resources the case study indicated that when the ds was recycled frequent determination of its mineral composition and subsequent readjustment of the as using the current algorithm as part of the dss nutrisense could effectively maintain the nutrient concentrations within the target range in the root zone rs the frequent readjustment of the nutrient supply using nutrisense maintained the ec ph and the concentrations of the main macronutrients k ca2 mg2 no3 n p within the target range only the sulphate concentration in the ds dropped to substantially lower levels than the target range in the two last readjustments of the as this happened because the so4 2 s concentration in the ad was not readjusted through the current algorithm but was automatically determined by nutrisense to equalise differences in the ionic balance which is a standard practice in nss for soilless crops sonneveld 2002 sulphate is the most suitable nutrient ion for electrochemically balancing a ns because the plants are well adapted within a wide range of sulphate concentrations in the root zone lopez et al 1996 thus even larger fluctuations of the sulphate level in the root zone than 10 of the optimal level are mostly not harmful to plants nevertheless a too low s supply may be harmful to plants martinez et al 1984 as implied by the results of the current study in exceptional cases the sulphate concentration in the as that is estimated through the anion to cation balance might be too low or too high due to additive deviations in the estimated concentrations of the other macronutrient ions although such discrepancies are corrected in the next readjustments of the as minimum and maximum acceptable concentrations for so4 2 s in the as could be set to fully prevent sub or supra optimal supply of so4 2 s when the so4 2 s value estimated for the as via anion to cation balance is out of the min max range the electrochemical balance can be completed through a commensurate change of the no3 n concentration in the as the algorithm presented in the current study estimates the mean nutrient ucs for the period between the last two ds samplings and assumes that these values will be valid also for the time until the next readjustment however due to changes in both climatic conditions and crop development some ucs may change slightly in the next days after the readjustment of the as and this may result in commensurate deviations between the actual and the target composition in the rs ds therefore small deviations between the target and the actual nutrient concentrations in the rs ds despite the use of nutrisense to optimise nutrition in a cls are reasonable however these deviations are not additive as they are detected and corrected in the next readjustment of the nutrient concentrations in the as appropriate readjustment of the nutrient supply in clss based on feedback from the root zone solution requires complicated calculations and a sound chemical mathematical and plant nutritional background thus even in the absence of yield benefits the current algorithm operating via nutrisense provides a novel tool for easy and accurate readjustment of the nutrient supply in clss that can be used not only by experts but also by growers with hardly any background in chemistry and mathematics nutrisense is available via internet at https nutrisense online and can thus be used any time by any professional working with any soilless culture system in any country worldwide 5 conclusions in the current study an algorithm consisting of a series of mass balance models was developed and used as a component of the decision support system nutrisense to optimise nutrition in crops grown in clss the algorithm improved the nutrient status in the root zone of a tomato crop grown in a cls after application of nutrient solution with composition readjusted using nutrisense a scenario analysis showed that the algorithm is not sensitive to inaccuracies of up to 50 in some parameters used to feed the models particularly the daily volume of nutrient solution supplied to the crop or the volume of available nutrient solution per plant in the soilless system deviations up to 20 in the drainage solution composition introduced to nutrisense due to inaccurate measurements in commercial laboratories render output values for the readjusted concentration of the added solution ranging within 10 from the true value which are acceptable a case study with cucumber grown in a cls and managed with nutrisense showed that the nutrient concentrations in the root zone were effectively maintained within the target range when the as was frequently readjusted based on the composition of the drainage solution only so4 2 s was lower that the optimal range because it was readjusted based on the anion to cation balance and not on the algorithm but this can fixed by setting minimum maximum acceptable levels for sulphate in the as declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

8888,soil water and salt contents are key soil physical parameters that play a crucial role in soil related hydrological ecological environmental and agricultural processes time domain reflectometry tdr is commonly used to measure in situ soil water and salt contents and provide possible solutions to quickly obtain soil bulk density bd however the measurement accuracy is greatly influenced by the interaction of soil water and salt contents on the measured soil dielectric constant and electrical conductivity especially for salinized soils to accurately estimate the soil gravimetric gwc and volumetric vwc water contents soil salt content ts and bd based on the tdr measurements we designed different model input schemes to quantify the effect of different soil factors and applied eight machine learning algorithms to map the non linear relationship between model inputs and each target soil property results of a case study in hetao irrigation district in northwest china indicated that soil particle size fractions psfs are important inputs to predict all the above soil properties furthermore bd mainly contributes to the prediction of soil gwc and soil surface temperature t is effective in improving the gwc and ts estimations among eight machine learning algorithms used extreme gradient boosting xgb and gradient boosting regression tree gbrt showed good robustness and strong learning capacity it is recommended to apply xgb to precisely estimate gwc and bd which resulted in the coefficients of determination r2 of 0 80 and 0 69 respectively on the other hand gbrt precisely estimated the vwc and ts with r2 of 0 71 and 0 84 respectively the evaluation of spatial distribution characteristic indicated that it is reliable to obtain the spatial distributions of the above soil properties from the tdr measurements based on the recommended model input schemes and machine learning algorithms graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil water soil salt soil bulk density machine learning time domain reflectometry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil is an important component of the lithosphere on the earth and terrestrial ecosystem as well as the basis for human lives beguin et al 2017 derakhshan babaei et al 2021 water and salt contents are considered as key physical parameters of soil that play a crucial role in soil related hydrological ecological environmental and agricultural processes kassaye et al 2021 shah et al 2022 walter et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to understand the spatiotemporal variations in soil water and salt contents to provide guidance for agricultural and environmental management several approaches are available to measure the soil water and salt contents the oven drying method is one of the most commonly used and accurate methods to measure soil water content but it is time consuming and can destroy the soil structure neutron probe has been used for in situ measurement of soil water content however its measurements in the surface soil layer are usually inaccurate and it may cause health hazard due to radioactive source bello et al 2019 robock et al 2000 the time domain reflectometry tdr was first used by topp et al 1980 to measure soil water content based on the soil dielectric property since then tdr has been widely used due to several advantages including its simplicity in operation its efficiency and its ability to conserve the soil topp and reynolds 1998 soil salinity is generally measured using two types of methods i e gravimetry and conductometry which form the basis for other measurement methods rhoades et al 1999 in addition to measuring the soil water content tdr has also been used to measure the soil bulk electrical conductivity and further calculate soil salinity based on the transformation formula dalton et al 1984 rhoades 1981 topp et al 1988 although tdr has some advantages over traditional soil water and salinity measurements the calibration process is still required before its application in general for the soil to be measured a regression curve between the soil dielectric constant measured by tdr and the soil water content by oven drying method can be developed similarly it is also necessary to develop a transformation relation between the soil electrical conductivity measured by tdr and soil salinity by gravimetry or conductometry however these two calibration processes are usually interconnected because both soil water and salt contents influence the soil dielectric constant and electrical conductivity for example the calibrated relation between soil water content and dielectric constant shows different regularities depending on the soil salinity levels cardenas lailhacar and dukes 2015 consequently the interaction of soil water and salt contents on soil dielectric constant and electrical conductivity should be considered in precise estimations of soil water and salt contents from tdr measurements especially for soils with higher salinity furthermore the calibration processes are also influenced by some other soil properties including soil particle size fractions soil bulk density and soil temperature oates et al 2017 usually the calibrated result for a specific soil type shows a good linear relationship however it illustrates nonlinearity when different types of soil are considered as a whole therefore it is necessary to develop more comprehensive models to depict the complicated relationships between the actual soil water salt contents and the tdr measurements applicable to different soils in other words more available soil properties should be combined with the tdr measurements in the precise modeling of the soil water and salt contents in addition to the soil water and salt contents the bulk density is also an important soil physical property that can also be measured by the tdr technique fu et al 2021 ochsner et al 2001 tian et al 2018 however the accuracy of bulk density estimation from tdr measurements is generally not as good as other soil properties how to accurately estimate soil bulk density from tdr measurements is a problem closely related with the soil water and salt contents estimations compared with traditional regression analysis methods various machine learning algorithms provide new insights for solving non linear problems k nearest neighbor knn is a simple method both for classification and regression problems based on the similarity between the predicted point and its nearest neighbors goydaragh et al 2021 artificial neural network ann is a traditional and strong tool to fit the non linear relationship between variables although it has many hyper parameters pudełko and chodak 2020 support vector machine svm is initially used to solve binary classification problems before being developed to solve non linear regression problems using the kernel trick jiang et al 2018 moreover tree based models including cubist random forest rf gradient boosting regression tree gbrt and extreme gradient boosting xgb are also popular in solving non linear problems goydaragh et al 2021 poppiel et al 2019 in practice soil salt samples usually present skewness in the probability distribution because soil in most farmlands is non or mild salinized with the soil salinity of less than 2 g kg and salinized soil generally scattered in other land use types gbrt and xgb are superior machine learning algorithms to deal with unbalanced datasets but they are barely used in the calibration of tdr keeping in view the above mentioned research gaps the main objective of the present study is to evaluate the performances of different model input schemes and machine learning algorithms in estimating the soil water and salt contents and soil bulk density based on the tdr measurements where the interaction of soil water and salt contents on soil dielectric constant and electrical conductivity and other available soil properties are considered 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the area of interest in this study is hetao irrigation district hid the largest irrigation district in the arid region of china the hid extends from 40 1 to 41 4 north and from 106 1 to 109 4 east in the western part of inner mongolia autonomous region of china fig 1 there are five sub irrigation districts in the hid namely wulanbuhe jiefangzha yongji yichang and wulate from west to east fig 1 the elevation declines from about 1091 m in the southwest to about 1000 m in the east fig 1 shows the land use maps of the hid in 2020 extracted from the globeland30 dataset http globallandcover com which is a high precision global land cover product developed by the ministry of natural resources of china chen et al 2014 the hid covers a total land area of 1 2 million ha comprised of approximately 75 cropland 4 5 grassland and shrubs 3 5 wetland and water bodies excluding the wuliangsuhai lake in the east 7 impervious surface of residential areas and 10 bare land that is mainly desert in the wulanbuhe sub irrigation district major soil textures include loam silt loam sandy loam sand and loamy sand which account for approximately 98 of the whole hid wan et al 2023 according to chinese national standard gb t 17296 2009 https std samr gov cn i e classification and codes for chinese soil the soil types in hid are mainly aquic cumulated irrigated soils the nationwide general soil survey office 1996 further the hid is characterized by arid continental climate with mean annual temperature of 7 5 9 1 mean annual precipitation of about 160 mm and mean annual evaporation of about 2240 mm measured by the 20 cm evaporation pan feng et al 2005 wen et al 2022 2 2 data collection soil data in this study was collected in two ways i e laboratory analysis of soil samples and in situ measurement during the field survey there were 59 and 114 sampling points during field surveys in september 2020 and may 2021 respectively resulting in a total of 173 soil samples covering the hid evenly and randomly fig 1 considering cropland being the predominant land use type most of the sampling sites were located in the cropland at each sampling site soil samples were collected from the surface soil layer of 20 cm depth during the field survey and brought back to the laboratory for further analysis soil bulk density bd was measured by the cutting ring method while soil gravimetric water content gwc was measured by the oven dying method the gwc was then multiplied by the corresponding bd to calculate volumetric water content vwc eight major ions co3 2 hco3 cl so42 ca2 mg2 k na were measured by titration methods wang et al 2021b which were then summed up to obtain the total soil salt content ts moreover the hydrometer method was conducted for the analysis of soil particle size fractions psfs including clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 2 mm fractions meanwhile a potable time domain reflectometry tdr system with intelligent microelements trime imko germany was used for in situ non destructive measurement of soil moisture content mc temperature t and electrical conductivity ec imko 2017 in the surface soil layer at each sampling site the probe sensor pico 64 is applied in trime with high frequency electromagnetic wave of 1 ghz which is the key technology to obtain the soil mc and ec the sensor rod length measured soil depth is 160 mm and the measurement diameter is 100 mm resulting in a soil measurement volume of 1 25 l besides three replications were conducted for each measurement and the average trime readings were used in the following analysis from laboratory analysis and in situ measurement available soil properties used for modeling are summarized in table s1 2 3 model development fig 2 shows the flowchart of the modeling procedures based on data collection described above which mainly include model development model input schemes and machine learning algorithms model evaluation and spatial analysis 2 3 1 design of model input schemes soil water content and salinity can be estimated from soil dielectric constant and electrical conductivity measured by the trime system respectively however the initial soil mc and ec measured by the trime generally have a lower accuracy due to the coupled effects of soil water and salt contents on dielectric constant and ec and the influence of other related soil properties to better understand the relationships among soil properties the correlation analysis was conducted then the relative importance scores of all the features properties were further calculated based on the rf algorithm which were then used as a reference to select appropriate model inputs consequently these correlated soil properties for the estimation of soil water and salt contents were divided into two types the first type was the basic features including only mc and ec while the second type was other influencing factors comprising the soil t bd and psfs clay silt and sand as a result a total of seven features i e mc ec t bd clay silt and sand were considered as candidate inputs for the prediction of gwc vwc and ts besides we also considered the possibility of predicting the bd from the above mentioned six features excluding bd several model schemes with different inputs table 1 were considered to better understand the influences of different factors initially mc and ec were used as input features which was the most common model and considered to be the basic model scheme m1 by adding t to m1 the second model scheme m2 was generated for assessing the influence of t then bd was added to m1 to devise the third model scheme m3 that assessed the influence of bd further t and bd were both added to m1 for the fourth model scheme m4 which can reflect the coupled influence of t and bd compared with m3 and m2 finally the influence of soil psfs was evaluated by adding the psfs to schemes from m1 to m4 which resulted in the corresponding new model schemes from m5 to m8 it is worth mentioning that bd was only incorporated in four schemes i e m1 m2 m5 and m6 among all the 8 schemes shown in table 1 the contribution of t can be evaluated by comparing the results of schemes m2 m4 m6 and m8 with those of m1 m3 m5 and m7 respectively similarly schemes m3 m4 m7 and m8 were used to evaluate the influence of bd while m5 m6 m7 and m8 were used to analyze the influence of soil psfs 2 3 2 machine learning algorithms there are several machine learning algorithms used for various purposes which are basically classified into three categories supervised learning unsupervised learning and reinforced learning supervised learning is widely used to solve classification and regression problems in this study we aim to infer the relationship between input features and each target soil property which is a typical regression problem of the supervised learning therefore eight regression algorithms are selected for the model development linear regression is the simplest machine learning algorithm which is easy to use and interpret in this study multiple linear regression mlr is used to explore the linear relationship between a target soil property and multiple input features however a major limitation of the mlr is that it is not suitable for modeling highly non linear data nguyen et al 2021 to deal with the non linear relationship between inputs and output several non linear regression methods are considered the knn is another simple method which is used for regression problems without the limitation of linear assumption the prediction by knn is derived from the mean value of the k nearest neighboring samples in the training dataset without the training process therefore knn is very sensitive to the training dataset the ann is a well known machine learning algorithm that excels at modeling complex non linear relationships abdallah et al 2020 beysolow ii 2017 considering multiple hidden layers in a multi layer perception mlp a deep neural network is developed to process different levels of abstraction of the dataset which has many hyper parameters to be tuned in this study the mlp model is organized with four layers one input two hidden and one output layers and relu activation function similarly svm is also applicable to non linear data which is implemented with the kernel trick for deriving a non linear decision boundary svm can avoid the problem of overfitting and thus reduces the model biases li et al 2010 furthermore tree based models are also skilled at dealing with non linear data including regression tree and model tree algorithms for regression problems cubist is a prediction oriented regression model with additional corrections based on the nearest neighbors in the training set quinlan 1993 1992 the cubist algorithm is basically a type of model tree that generates a set of rules with a linear regression model which may be more accurate than a regression tree moreover there are several ensemble learning algorithms based on the regression tree rf is a well known ensemble model based on the classification and regression tree cart which uses a bootstrap aggregation bagging technique to fit plenty of independent regression trees on random subsamples of the training dataset beguin et al 2017 taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2020 on the other hand boosting aggregation technique is used in the gbrt where the tree is fitted based on the residual of the former tree generally gbrt is effective in reducing biases avoiding overfitting and handling the uneven distribution of data attributes and has no assumptions on the input space however gbrt requires more hyper parameters tuning than rf wang et al 2021a further xgb algorithm is proposed based on the improvement of gbrt where the regularization term is embedded in the loss function to improve the generalization capability in addition xgb has a faster training speed especially for large samples the main limitation of xgb is that it has more hyper parameters chen et al 2022 chen and guestrin 2016 all eight algorithms mentioned above and the data processing were conducted with r programming r core team 2022 the mlr knn ann svm cubist rf gbrt and xgb algorithms were run by the car package fox and weisberg 2019 kknn package schliep and hechenbichler 2016 keras package allaire and chollet 2021 e1071 package meyer et al 2022 cubist package kuhn and quinlan 2022 randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 gbm package greenwell et al 2022 and xgboost package chen et al 2022 in the r programming respectively by combining 8 4 model schemes and 8 machine learning algorithms 64 prediction models for gwc vwc and ts and 32 for bd were developed these models were calibrated trained with the training dataset and further tested with the testing dataset the samples of input features and target soil properties were split into training and testing datasets with a ratio of 8 2 2 4 model evaluation criteria the performance of each model for training and testing datasets is evaluated using three commonly used indicators i e the root mean squared error rmse willmott 1982 normalized rmse nrmse jamieson et al 1991 and coefficient of determination r2 nagelkerke 1991 as shown in eqs 1 3 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n obs i pr e i 2 2 nrmse rmse max obs min obs 3 r 2 i 1 n obs i obs pre i pre 2 i 1 n obs i obs 2 i 1 n pre i pre 2 where n is the number of samples obs and pre are the observations and predictions respectively and obs and pre denote the averages of observations and predictions respectively generally a model performs better when rmse and nrmse are closer to 0 and r 2 is closer to 1 the model performance is further evaluated from the perspective of spatial characteristics since the samples are spatially distributed the differences in the spatial distributions of observed and predicted soil properties can also reflect the model performance it is important to derive a model with less error and keep similar spatial characteristics for observations and predictions especially when the modeling results are applied to studies on a regional scale in this study the global moran s i was applied to identify the spatial pattern of samples which is a widely used measure of spatial autocorrelation das and ghosh 2017 tabarej and minz 2022 numerically moran s i can be expressed as follows 4 moran s i n i 1 n y 1 n w i j x i x x j x i 1 n y 1 n w i j i 1 n x i x 2 where x i and x j are the observed or predicted values of a soil property at locations i and j respectively x is the mean value at all the sites n is the number of samples and w i j is the weight determined by the spatial similarity between locations i and j moran s i ranges between 1 and 1 moran s i and the corresponding p value and z score generated from the monte carlo simulation can be used to determine whether the data is randomly dispersed or not when the p value is greater than a specified level of significance α 0 01 is used here the null assumption that the data is randomly dispersed is accepted otherwise the null assumption of randomness is rejected inferring that the high and low values in the dataset are dispersed spatially when the z score is less than 2 58 and that the high and or low values are spatially clustered when the z score is more than 2 58 besides ordinary kriging ok was also applied to map the spatial distributions of the observed and predicted soil properties which is a basic and very popular interpolation method for spatial data li et al 2020 wan et al 2021 3 results 3 1 statistical analysis of the soil data from laboratory analysis and trime measurements the main statistics of measured soil properties are summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the mean value of gwc is less than vwc mainly resulting from the bd values of 1 19 1 80 g cm3 the mean value of ts is 1 66 g kg indicating mild soil salinity in average the mean values of silt and sand fractions are both around 41 and much higher than the clay fraction of 17 7 the mc values obtained from trime measurements depict an overestimation as compared with the vwc based on laboratory analysis furthermore there is a large difference in the degrees of variability among these soil properties the ts has the largest variation with the coefficient of variation cv of 0 73 while the cv of bd is the smallest from the probability distributions of different soil properties fig s1 in the supplementary materials the gwc and vwc are close to the normal distribution with fewer outliers both in the low and high tails the soil ts shows a skewed distribution with the mean value higher than the median because of some extreme values in the high tail for the bd there is no obvious skewness although some outliers appear in both tails soil particle size fractions show the different extents of skewness in the distribution the clay fraction concentrates around 18 where extreme values appear in the high tail the silt fraction has a long tail in the low values while the sand fraction has a long tail in the high values and they both have fewer outliers than the clay for the trime measurements no obvious skewness is observed in mc ec and t with fewer outliers overall there is no evident skewness for the soil properties except for the ts and clay fraction although the long tailed distribution may affect prediction precision no samples are omitted in the modeling to fully utilize the original data and evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms from the correlation coefficients r2 between different soil properties fig s2 in the supplementary materials the gwc shows a high correlation coefficient of 0 89 with the vwc a weak negative correlation with bd and almost no correlation with ts the vwc has almost no correlation with ts and bd meanwhile the correlation between ts and bd is very weak the particle size fractions have different correlations with the gwc vwc ts and bd gwc and vwc are both positively correlated with silt and clay fractions and negatively correlated with sand fraction but their correlation with clay fraction is weaker than that with the silt and sand fractions the ts is mainly correlated with clay and sand fractions but has almost no correlation with silt fraction meanwhile bd is mainly correlated with the silt and sand fractions but has a very weak correlation with clay fraction among the three particle size fractions the sand fraction is strongly correlated with clay and silt fractions while the correlation between clay and silt fractions is very weak indicating that there is a large difference in the variation trends of psfs for all samples actually the sand fraction plays a transitional role between clay and silt some samples present a strong correlation between sand and clay while some samples present a strong correlation between sand and silt which results in higher correlation coefficients for sand clay and sand silt for the whole samples for soil properties measured with the trime there is a strong correlation between the mc and ec but both of them have smaller correlation coefficients with the t besides mc demonstrates a strong correlation with gwc vwc and ts while a weak correlation with bd and particle size fractions the ec has higher a correlation with the ts and mc a weak correlation with bd and very weak correlation with other variables the t shows a weak correlation with all other variables in this study the gwc vwc ts and bd are selected as the soil properties to be predicted which are affected by different input variables or predictors the variable importance of predictors for each target soil property is shown in fig 3 which is dimensionless and measures the change of node purity in the random forest the orders of relative importance score are consistent for both gwc and vwc which indicates that mc is the most important feature for gwc and vwc because they are all indexes for soil water content the particle size fractions also make relatively greater contributions to the prediction of gwc and vwc and specifically clay fraction has less importance than silt and sand fractions it is worth noting that multicollinearity is likely to cause the overestimation of variable importance because the sand fraction has a strong correlation with clay and silt fractions the clay fraction and bd have similar correlations with gwc while the clay fraction shows a higher importance score the last three features are bd ec and t in descending order of importance score but there are no great differences among them in terms of ts prediction the ec and mc have the highest importance scores which corresponds to the results of the correlation analysis however there are not many differences in the importance scores of other variables unlike previous predictions the psfs are very important features for the prediction of bd especially silt and sand fractions while the importance of clay fraction is similar to that of mc and ec which is possibly overestimated due to multicollinearity it should be noted that t is always the least important feature for all soil properties although there may be multicollinearity between the psfs that results in difficulty in variable importance assessment the predictive ability of random forest is not influenced by the multicollinearity and the three particle size fractions are considered as a whole in our study generally the features having a higher correlation coefficient with a target soil property make more contribution to the prediction the results of the feature importance assessment are basically consistent with the result of correlation analysis the combination of mc and ec m1 provides the basic input features for all four target variables because they are influenced by both soil dielectric constant and electrical conductivity different soil psfs are interrelated and present significant importance and hence they are considered equally as input features bd is correlated with gwc and illustrates relatively less importance following soil psfs although the importance of t is the lowest among others it is a basic soil physical property and is further tested for the prediction of target soil properties fig s2 shows that different soil properties are usually correlated to each other with different correlation coefficients and fig 3 presents different importance scores of soil properties in estimating different target variables consequently soil psfs bd and t are considered as the influencing factors which are evaluated according to the performance of different model schemes table 1 3 2 model evaluation for different soil properties 3 2 1 soil gravimetric and volumetric water contents fig 4 a demonstrates the performance of different models to predict gwc based on various machine learning algorithms in training and testing datasets the comparison of eight machine learning methods based on r2 shows that xgb gbrt and rf perform better with the average r2 greater than 0 60 for the testing dataset followed by svm and ann with r2 of around 0 54 and finally cubist knn and mlr with the average r2 less than 0 50 furthermore the generalization capability is evaluated through the difference of r2 between the training and testing datasets it can be seen that r2 of rf for the training dataset is much greater than that for the testing dataset indicating severe overfitting of rf on the contrary under fitting is observed in cubist and mlr because some r2 of training datasets are lower than those of testing datasets it is noteworthy that there is no training performance evaluation for knn regression because of its inherent principle i e there is no training process required among the developed models m5 m6 m7 and m8 perform better with higher r2 in the testing datasets than others due to the contribution of particle size fractions overall m8 performs the best because of more input variables while m1 is the worst model as it has only two features as input fig 4 b shows the performance of different models to predict the vwc using various machine learning algorithms in training and testing datasets similar to gwc xgb gbrt and rf have the best performance to predict the vwc with the average r2 greater than 0 61 followed by svm ann cubist and knn with the average r2 over 0 40 mlr performs the worst with the r2 of about 0 38 further obvious overfitting is observed for rf and svm and partly underfitting for cubist and mlr overall m5 m6 m7 and m8 perform better than other models among which m8 is the best while m1 or m2 illustrates the worst performance further the contributions of t bd and particle size fractions to predict gwc and vwc for models using rf gbrt and xgb algorithms are shown in fig 5 in particular the difference in r2 for two model input schemes shown in table 1 with or without one feature is used as a quantitative indicator to assess the contribution of the feature to a target soil property for example the change of r2 from m1 to m2 expresses the contribution of t for the prediction of gwc t shows a positive contribution to different models in most cases especially from m1 to m2 and m7 to m8 however the contribution of t as input is relatively small where a maximal increase of about 0 06 is observed in r2 significant contribution to gwc is observed when bd is added as an input especially from model m5 to m7 and from m6 to m8 with the r2 increasing by more than 0 05 even more than 0 10 in some cases the comparison shows that there is an enormous improvement resulted from adding the three particle size fractions for the models using different algorithms which increases the r2 by 0 08 0 20 in the case of vwc both t and bd make positive contributions to m4 and m8 which increase the r2 by about 0 03 while particle size fractions significantly increase the r2 by 0 07 0 27 to better understand the contribution of adding different features fig 6 shows the r2 values for model input schemes m1 m5 m7 and m8 where inputs of m5 m7 and m8 are generated by successively adding psfs bd and t to the previous scheme according to the model order shown in fig 6 a r2 for gwc is increasing the performance of m5 is evidently much better than that of m1 indicating the greater importance of psfs besides there is a slight increase in r2 for m7 and m8 which depicts some contribution of bd to m7 and t to m8 the comparison shows that m8 has a greater r2 of more than 0 7 even close to 0 8 when using the xgb therefore it is recommended to use m8 for the prediction of gwc in terms of vwc fig 6 b demonstrates that there is a significant increase in r2 from m1 to m5 only and very slight changes for m7 and m8 these results indicate that the psfs are much more important than bd and t in predicting the vwc there is a slight difference between m5 and m8 however it is worth mentioning that m5 needs fewer input features to balance the model complexity and prediction precision we recommend m5 for the prediction of vwc 3 2 2 soil salt content r2 of training and testing datasets to predict soil ts using different models are shown in fig 7 the comparisons of the r2 of the testing set show that xgb gbrt and rf have better performance with average r2 of about 0 72 the accuracy of svm ann and cubist are similar with r2 of about 0 65 while knn and mlr perform the worst with r2 of about 0 45 the generalization capability of machine learning algorithms shows that svm has a great overfitting as seen from the large difference of r2 between the training and testing datasets similarly rf ann and cubist also have the problem of overfitting on the other hand xgb and gbrt show relatively good generalization performance undoubtedly mlr is the only model that results in underfitting with lower r2 for both training and testing datasets the comparison of different models shows that m5 m6 m7 and m8 have overall better performance than the others especially when xgb gbrt and rf algorithms are used their better performance is mainly resulted from the feature of particle size fractions finally the results show that m8 having the most input features performs the best while m1 demonstrates poorer performance due to the least inputs the contribution of t bd and particle size fractions is evaluated by the difference of r2 for two consecutive model input schemes with or without one feature fig 8 a b and c the feature t has a positive contribution to the models with an increase in r2 of about 0 03 and the increase even reaches 0 10 from m5 to m6 using the gbrt algorithms in contrast the contribution of bd is positive when the rf algorithm is used and negative when the gbrt and xgb algorithms are used which indicates there is a great uncertainty of this feature in predicting ts when adding the particle size fractions there is an obvious increase in r2 with the average increases of more than 0 05 using these three algorithms furthermore the change in r2 is shown in fig 8 d along with the model order of m1 m5 m6 and m8 where inputs of m5 m6 and m8 are generated by successively adding psfs t and bd to the previous model it can be observed that r2 has an increasing trend from m1 to m6 indicating the positive effect of adding the features psfs and t however there is no obvious increase in r2 from m6 to m8 and even a decline is seen with the gbrt algorithm overall m6 having the features of psfs and t performs the best which is recommended to predict ts 3 2 3 soil bulk density in contrast to other soil properties soil bd is predicted using only four model input schemes due to fewer input features the results of r2 for the four input schemes based on different machine learning algorithms in training and testing datasets are shown in fig 9 a overall xgb gbrt and rf algorithms perform better with the average r2 of about 0 5 for the testing dataset followed by svm ann cubist and knn with the average r2 of less than 0 40 in contrast mlr demonstrates poor prediction capability totally due to much lower r2 considering the generalization performance there is a large difference of r2 between the training and testing datasets for rf and svm algorithms indicating a substantial overfitting on the other hand ann cubist and mlr algorithms underfit in most cases besides xgb and gbrt are better in generalization capability especially for m5 and m6 it is also observed that m5 and m6 always perform better than m1 and m2 for all algorithms because the former two models have more input features furthermore the contribution of t and psfs to different models is shown in fig 9 b results indicate that the contribution of t is very limited and results in an increase of r2 by 0 06 from m1 to m2 and almost zero from m5 to m6 in contrast fig 9 c reveals a significant contribution of psfs from m1 to m5 and m2 to m6 the maximum increase of more than 0 30 in r2 is observed from m1 to m5 although m6 and m5 have similar performance m5 needs fewer input features and hence is recommended to predict soil bd 3 2 4 comparison of models for different soil properties and machine learning algorithms fig 10 shows the comparison of model performances based on r2 and nrmse values of the testing dataset for different target soil properties using the recommended model inputs to various machine learning algorithms the maximal r2 of 0 84 is observed in the ts prediction model using gbrt indicating the strong predictability of ts from the recommended predictors overall the r2 values of gwc are slightly less than that of ts where the maximum of 0 80 is observed for xgb the prediction accuracy of vwc and bd are slightly lower than those of gwc and ts with the maximal r2 of 0 71 and 0 69 respectively the differences in the model performances for different soil properties are mainly associated with different input features based on the selected model scheme however it is noted that models for ts perform better than gwc despite having fewer inputs on the other hand models for bd perform worse than vwc even though they both have the same input features therefore the characteristic of target variables such as statistical distribution also influences the model performance for different algorithms xgb and gbrt usually perform better while mlr or knn perform the worst for all the target properties in terms of nrmse fig 10 b ts has the lowest nrmse of less than 0 2 for all algorithms the svm rf gbrt and xgb models for gwc and vwc perform similarly and better than those for bd however the performances of knn cubist and ann models for gwc and vwc are worse than those for bd overall the results indicate that gbrt is the best algorithm for predicting vwc and ts with the nrmse of 0 12 and 0 09 respectively further xgb performs the best to predict gwc and bd with nrmse of 0 12 and 0 13 respectively fig 11 a demonstrates that gwc has a high r2 value of 0 80 for the training dataset and good generalization capability with similar performance on the training and testing datasets for the xgb vwc and bd possess similar precision and generalization capability the r2 for ts is greater but higher ts values are generally underestimated mainly because of the large variance and skewed distribution of samples in fig 11 b gbrt based models for gwc vwc and ts have higher r2 of more than 0 7 for the testing datasets while that for bd has a relatively lower r2 of 0 62 xgb has stronger generalization capability for gwc and bd similarly gbrt has superior performance for vwc and ts especially for higher values of ts therefore it is recommended to apply xgb to predict gwc and bd while gbrt to predict vwc and ts moreover it is worth noting that the models generally presented overestimation at low values and underestimation at high values because the slopes of the test train lines are less than 1 for all cases fig 11 which is a common problem for most regression models essentially machine learning algorithms used in this study including xgb and gbrt are linear or nonlinear regression models and their predictions generally tend towards the mean of observed samples consequently the prediction is overestimated at low observed values and underestimated at high observed values 3 3 spatial distribution of different soil properties values of global moran s i in table 3 show the spatial patterns of different soil properties both the observed and predicted gwc and vwc show positive global moran s i values with p value 0 01 and z score 2 58 suggesting the presence of clustered distribution in gwc and vwc in the study region autumn and spring irrigations are widely applied from mid september to early november and from april to may respectively soil sampling during the autumn spring irrigation periods results in the clustered distributions of higher gwc and vwc in the irrigated regions and lower gwc and vwc in the non irrigated regions however the moran s i values for ts and bd are both close to zero with p value 0 1 suggesting randomly dispersed distributions for the observed and predicted ts and bd consequently the results of global moran s i show there is no discrepancy in spatial patterns between the observed and predicted soil properties to further understand the models performances the spatial distributions of observed soil properties in april 2021 are compared with the corresponding predictions by the best combinations of model input scheme and machine learning algorithm fig 12 lower observed gwc values of about 0 1 g g are mainly distributed in the western part of the study area comprised of large area of desert while higher values of about 0 3 g g are observed in the eastern hid near the wuliangsuhai lake due to more spring irrigation in this region in the middle hid the observed gwc values are around 0 2 g g for most areas the predicted gwc has a similar spatial pattern as the observed one i e lower in the west and higher in the east although the predictions underestimate higher observation values in some areas the spatial distribution of the observed vwc is consistent with the gwc the lower vwc of about 0 15 cm3 cm3 is observed in the western hid while higher vwc of about 0 44 cm3 cm3 in the east and moderate of around 0 25 cm3 cm3 in the middle the predicted vwc shows some overestimations in the low observation area and underestimations in the high observation area however it keeps a similar spatial distribution pattern as the observed one as a whole the comparisons of gwc and vwc show that only part of the areas has higher soil moisture which is resulted from spring irrigation in the particular part of the study region the results of observed ts illustrate that most areas have ts values ranging from 0 8 to 4 0 g kg indicating a mild degree of soil salinization however higher ts values are scattered in the east and middle parts of the hid where some areas have high ts of even more than 6 g kg indicating severe soil salinization the predicted ts has a similar spatial pattern as the observed one but there are still some overestimations in the high observation areas the observed bd ranges from 1 4 to 1 5 g cm3 in most areas indicating a natural state of the soil there are also some low values of about 1 2 g cm3 possibly caused by spring plowing before the field survey and sampling higher bd values from 1 6 to 1 8 g cm3 are dispersedly distributed in the middle and western parts of the hid which are resulted from not plowing or lower water content for a long period the predicted bd has a similar spatial distribution characteristic to the observed bd most areas are in the natural state with the bd of about 1 5 g cm3 however some overestimations underestimations are observed in the low high bd observation areas respectively which is also clearly shown in fig 11 overall the model predicted soil properties have similar spatial distribution patterns with the observed ones which indicates that the recommended models are robust enough to capture the spatial patterns of the studied soil properties 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of machine learning algorithms in predicting soil properties model evaluation results fig 10 show that mlr has a lower potential to predict target soil properties whereas the other seven machine learning algorithms perform much better t had very small correlation coefficients with the target variables figs s2 and 3 while it still contributed positively to the prediction of gwc fig 6 this indicates that the relations between input features and predicted soil properties are non linear that cannot be fully represented by the linear correlation coefficient machine learning algorithms are inherently nonlinear kuhn and johnson 2013 and provide effective solutions to the estimation of the soil properties in this study furthermore the performance of different algorithms appears to differ significantly fig 10 knn is slightly better than mlr and shows great instability because of its sensitivity to the data samples cubist is superior to knn in most cases although there is small difference in their testing accuracy ann and svm show moderate performance with the average r2 of 0 6 which is better than knn and cubist on the other hand rf gbrt and xgb demonstrate higher accuracy in the testing dataset r2 0 65 indicating the advantages of these ensemble learning algorithms results about the generalization capability of these machine learning models figs 4 7 and 9 show that rf and svm have overfitting problem in most cases possibly because of the weak adjustability and fewer hyper parameters gbrt and xgb demonstrate a better generalization capability for all the predicted soil properties as can be seen from the close accuracy of the training and testing datasets generally the probability distributions of data samples also have some influences on the performance of machine learning algorithms a noteworthy observation in this study is that soil ts shows some unbalance distribution characteristics with more low values and less high values and some other input features also have different skewness fig s1 under these circumstances xgb and gbrt always show the best accuracy fig 10 mainly because of their robustness and strong learning capacity for unbalanced data wang et al 2021a 4 2 feasibility of the model schemes for the predicted soil properties soil particle size fractions psfs soil bulk density bd and soil temperature t show different impacts on the estimation of the soil properties soil psfs are significantly correlated with the target soil variables as shown in fig s2 consequently soil psfs play a critical role for all the predicted soil properties which is indispensable to the model input scheme however bd mainly contributes to the gwc estimation fig 5 while has little influence on the vwc and ts estimations adding t to the model input features is also effective in improving the accuracy for the estimation of gwc and ts figs 5 and 8 in practice the cost of obtaining all the soil features as model inputs is usually high therefore it should be considered to balance the number of features and the model performance in selecting the model inputs the recommended model scheme generally has a good accuracy with appropriate feature inputs for soil water content the model for gwc m8 requires more inputs than vwc m5 table 1 indicating higher cost and limitation in its application vwc on the other hand is widely used for soil water content in irrigation management hydrological models and crop planting thus the model of vwc is more likely to be recommended to estimate the soil water content although those schemes are proposed based on the soil samples in hid they are probably applicable to other regions especially cropland available studies generally developed linear regression models directly between the observed and the tdr measured soil water or salt contents topp et al 1980 zhou et al 2003 yu et al 2019 although their models performed well in the estimation of soil water and salt contents the models are generally applicable to a specified soil texture type soil bulk density and or soil temperature in our study we considered possible soil factors that influence soil water and salt contents and used machine learning algorithms to map the complex non linear relationship between soil water salt contents and tdr measurements the recommended nonlinear models for the estimation of soil water and salt contents performed much better than the linear model moreover we also made a successful attempt on the estimation of soil bd although its accuracy is not as good as soil water and salt contents moreover the soil samples were distributed in the whole irrigation district fig 1 and hence we evaluated the model results in term of spatial distribution patterns global moran s i indicated that the spatial distribution patterns of the observed and predicted soil properties are very close table3 from the interpolated maps using ok fig 12 although there are some overestimates or underestimates at local scale the overall spatial distributions of observation and estimation show much similarity therefore it is reliable to obtain the spatial distributions of soil properties based on the models recommended in this study which is very helpful in modeling the hydrological agricultural ecological and environmental processes at regional scale 5 conclusions to accurately estimate soil gravimetric water content gwc volumetric water content vwc total salt content ts and bulk density bd from soil sampling and in situ measurement by the trime we designed different model input schemes to quantify the effect of different influencing factors and evaluated the performances of different machine learning algorithms the main findings are summarized as follows 1 the appropriate model input schemes to predict soil properties are recommended which are m8 for soil gwc m5 for soil vwc and bd and m6 for soil ts results indicate that soil particle size fractions are generally important for all the predicted soil properties whereas bd primarily contributes to the gwc estimation and contributes little to the vwc and ts estimation adding t to the model features can also improve the performance of models to predict gws and ts 2 among different machine learning algorithms the ensemble learning algorithms i e rf gbrt and xgb demonstrate good performance in the testing dataset overfitting phenomenon is mainly observed for rf in most cases xgb and gbrt are always robust and show strong learning capacities for the unbalanced data it is therefore recommended to apply xgb to predict gwc and bd and gbrt to predict vwc and ts 3 based on the evaluation of spatial distribution characteristics it is reliable to obtain the spatial distributions of soil properties based on the models recommended in this study the resulted soil property maps are important in modeling the

8888,soil water and salt contents are key soil physical parameters that play a crucial role in soil related hydrological ecological environmental and agricultural processes time domain reflectometry tdr is commonly used to measure in situ soil water and salt contents and provide possible solutions to quickly obtain soil bulk density bd however the measurement accuracy is greatly influenced by the interaction of soil water and salt contents on the measured soil dielectric constant and electrical conductivity especially for salinized soils to accurately estimate the soil gravimetric gwc and volumetric vwc water contents soil salt content ts and bd based on the tdr measurements we designed different model input schemes to quantify the effect of different soil factors and applied eight machine learning algorithms to map the non linear relationship between model inputs and each target soil property results of a case study in hetao irrigation district in northwest china indicated that soil particle size fractions psfs are important inputs to predict all the above soil properties furthermore bd mainly contributes to the prediction of soil gwc and soil surface temperature t is effective in improving the gwc and ts estimations among eight machine learning algorithms used extreme gradient boosting xgb and gradient boosting regression tree gbrt showed good robustness and strong learning capacity it is recommended to apply xgb to precisely estimate gwc and bd which resulted in the coefficients of determination r2 of 0 80 and 0 69 respectively on the other hand gbrt precisely estimated the vwc and ts with r2 of 0 71 and 0 84 respectively the evaluation of spatial distribution characteristic indicated that it is reliable to obtain the spatial distributions of the above soil properties from the tdr measurements based on the recommended model input schemes and machine learning algorithms graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil water soil salt soil bulk density machine learning time domain reflectometry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil is an important component of the lithosphere on the earth and terrestrial ecosystem as well as the basis for human lives beguin et al 2017 derakhshan babaei et al 2021 water and salt contents are considered as key physical parameters of soil that play a crucial role in soil related hydrological ecological environmental and agricultural processes kassaye et al 2021 shah et al 2022 walter et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to understand the spatiotemporal variations in soil water and salt contents to provide guidance for agricultural and environmental management several approaches are available to measure the soil water and salt contents the oven drying method is one of the most commonly used and accurate methods to measure soil water content but it is time consuming and can destroy the soil structure neutron probe has been used for in situ measurement of soil water content however its measurements in the surface soil layer are usually inaccurate and it may cause health hazard due to radioactive source bello et al 2019 robock et al 2000 the time domain reflectometry tdr was first used by topp et al 1980 to measure soil water content based on the soil dielectric property since then tdr has been widely used due to several advantages including its simplicity in operation its efficiency and its ability to conserve the soil topp and reynolds 1998 soil salinity is generally measured using two types of methods i e gravimetry and conductometry which form the basis for other measurement methods rhoades et al 1999 in addition to measuring the soil water content tdr has also been used to measure the soil bulk electrical conductivity and further calculate soil salinity based on the transformation formula dalton et al 1984 rhoades 1981 topp et al 1988 although tdr has some advantages over traditional soil water and salinity measurements the calibration process is still required before its application in general for the soil to be measured a regression curve between the soil dielectric constant measured by tdr and the soil water content by oven drying method can be developed similarly it is also necessary to develop a transformation relation between the soil electrical conductivity measured by tdr and soil salinity by gravimetry or conductometry however these two calibration processes are usually interconnected because both soil water and salt contents influence the soil dielectric constant and electrical conductivity for example the calibrated relation between soil water content and dielectric constant shows different regularities depending on the soil salinity levels cardenas lailhacar and dukes 2015 consequently the interaction of soil water and salt contents on soil dielectric constant and electrical conductivity should be considered in precise estimations of soil water and salt contents from tdr measurements especially for soils with higher salinity furthermore the calibration processes are also influenced by some other soil properties including soil particle size fractions soil bulk density and soil temperature oates et al 2017 usually the calibrated result for a specific soil type shows a good linear relationship however it illustrates nonlinearity when different types of soil are considered as a whole therefore it is necessary to develop more comprehensive models to depict the complicated relationships between the actual soil water salt contents and the tdr measurements applicable to different soils in other words more available soil properties should be combined with the tdr measurements in the precise modeling of the soil water and salt contents in addition to the soil water and salt contents the bulk density is also an important soil physical property that can also be measured by the tdr technique fu et al 2021 ochsner et al 2001 tian et al 2018 however the accuracy of bulk density estimation from tdr measurements is generally not as good as other soil properties how to accurately estimate soil bulk density from tdr measurements is a problem closely related with the soil water and salt contents estimations compared with traditional regression analysis methods various machine learning algorithms provide new insights for solving non linear problems k nearest neighbor knn is a simple method both for classification and regression problems based on the similarity between the predicted point and its nearest neighbors goydaragh et al 2021 artificial neural network ann is a traditional and strong tool to fit the non linear relationship between variables although it has many hyper parameters pudełko and chodak 2020 support vector machine svm is initially used to solve binary classification problems before being developed to solve non linear regression problems using the kernel trick jiang et al 2018 moreover tree based models including cubist random forest rf gradient boosting regression tree gbrt and extreme gradient boosting xgb are also popular in solving non linear problems goydaragh et al 2021 poppiel et al 2019 in practice soil salt samples usually present skewness in the probability distribution because soil in most farmlands is non or mild salinized with the soil salinity of less than 2 g kg and salinized soil generally scattered in other land use types gbrt and xgb are superior machine learning algorithms to deal with unbalanced datasets but they are barely used in the calibration of tdr keeping in view the above mentioned research gaps the main objective of the present study is to evaluate the performances of different model input schemes and machine learning algorithms in estimating the soil water and salt contents and soil bulk density based on the tdr measurements where the interaction of soil water and salt contents on soil dielectric constant and electrical conductivity and other available soil properties are considered 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the area of interest in this study is hetao irrigation district hid the largest irrigation district in the arid region of china the hid extends from 40 1 to 41 4 north and from 106 1 to 109 4 east in the western part of inner mongolia autonomous region of china fig 1 there are five sub irrigation districts in the hid namely wulanbuhe jiefangzha yongji yichang and wulate from west to east fig 1 the elevation declines from about 1091 m in the southwest to about 1000 m in the east fig 1 shows the land use maps of the hid in 2020 extracted from the globeland30 dataset http globallandcover com which is a high precision global land cover product developed by the ministry of natural resources of china chen et al 2014 the hid covers a total land area of 1 2 million ha comprised of approximately 75 cropland 4 5 grassland and shrubs 3 5 wetland and water bodies excluding the wuliangsuhai lake in the east 7 impervious surface of residential areas and 10 bare land that is mainly desert in the wulanbuhe sub irrigation district major soil textures include loam silt loam sandy loam sand and loamy sand which account for approximately 98 of the whole hid wan et al 2023 according to chinese national standard gb t 17296 2009 https std samr gov cn i e classification and codes for chinese soil the soil types in hid are mainly aquic cumulated irrigated soils the nationwide general soil survey office 1996 further the hid is characterized by arid continental climate with mean annual temperature of 7 5 9 1 mean annual precipitation of about 160 mm and mean annual evaporation of about 2240 mm measured by the 20 cm evaporation pan feng et al 2005 wen et al 2022 2 2 data collection soil data in this study was collected in two ways i e laboratory analysis of soil samples and in situ measurement during the field survey there were 59 and 114 sampling points during field surveys in september 2020 and may 2021 respectively resulting in a total of 173 soil samples covering the hid evenly and randomly fig 1 considering cropland being the predominant land use type most of the sampling sites were located in the cropland at each sampling site soil samples were collected from the surface soil layer of 20 cm depth during the field survey and brought back to the laboratory for further analysis soil bulk density bd was measured by the cutting ring method while soil gravimetric water content gwc was measured by the oven dying method the gwc was then multiplied by the corresponding bd to calculate volumetric water content vwc eight major ions co3 2 hco3 cl so42 ca2 mg2 k na were measured by titration methods wang et al 2021b which were then summed up to obtain the total soil salt content ts moreover the hydrometer method was conducted for the analysis of soil particle size fractions psfs including clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 05 mm and sand 0 05 2 mm fractions meanwhile a potable time domain reflectometry tdr system with intelligent microelements trime imko germany was used for in situ non destructive measurement of soil moisture content mc temperature t and electrical conductivity ec imko 2017 in the surface soil layer at each sampling site the probe sensor pico 64 is applied in trime with high frequency electromagnetic wave of 1 ghz which is the key technology to obtain the soil mc and ec the sensor rod length measured soil depth is 160 mm and the measurement diameter is 100 mm resulting in a soil measurement volume of 1 25 l besides three replications were conducted for each measurement and the average trime readings were used in the following analysis from laboratory analysis and in situ measurement available soil properties used for modeling are summarized in table s1 2 3 model development fig 2 shows the flowchart of the modeling procedures based on data collection described above which mainly include model development model input schemes and machine learning algorithms model evaluation and spatial analysis 2 3 1 design of model input schemes soil water content and salinity can be estimated from soil dielectric constant and electrical conductivity measured by the trime system respectively however the initial soil mc and ec measured by the trime generally have a lower accuracy due to the coupled effects of soil water and salt contents on dielectric constant and ec and the influence of other related soil properties to better understand the relationships among soil properties the correlation analysis was conducted then the relative importance scores of all the features properties were further calculated based on the rf algorithm which were then used as a reference to select appropriate model inputs consequently these correlated soil properties for the estimation of soil water and salt contents were divided into two types the first type was the basic features including only mc and ec while the second type was other influencing factors comprising the soil t bd and psfs clay silt and sand as a result a total of seven features i e mc ec t bd clay silt and sand were considered as candidate inputs for the prediction of gwc vwc and ts besides we also considered the possibility of predicting the bd from the above mentioned six features excluding bd several model schemes with different inputs table 1 were considered to better understand the influences of different factors initially mc and ec were used as input features which was the most common model and considered to be the basic model scheme m1 by adding t to m1 the second model scheme m2 was generated for assessing the influence of t then bd was added to m1 to devise the third model scheme m3 that assessed the influence of bd further t and bd were both added to m1 for the fourth model scheme m4 which can reflect the coupled influence of t and bd compared with m3 and m2 finally the influence of soil psfs was evaluated by adding the psfs to schemes from m1 to m4 which resulted in the corresponding new model schemes from m5 to m8 it is worth mentioning that bd was only incorporated in four schemes i e m1 m2 m5 and m6 among all the 8 schemes shown in table 1 the contribution of t can be evaluated by comparing the results of schemes m2 m4 m6 and m8 with those of m1 m3 m5 and m7 respectively similarly schemes m3 m4 m7 and m8 were used to evaluate the influence of bd while m5 m6 m7 and m8 were used to analyze the influence of soil psfs 2 3 2 machine learning algorithms there are several machine learning algorithms used for various purposes which are basically classified into three categories supervised learning unsupervised learning and reinforced learning supervised learning is widely used to solve classification and regression problems in this study we aim to infer the relationship between input features and each target soil property which is a typical regression problem of the supervised learning therefore eight regression algorithms are selected for the model development linear regression is the simplest machine learning algorithm which is easy to use and interpret in this study multiple linear regression mlr is used to explore the linear relationship between a target soil property and multiple input features however a major limitation of the mlr is that it is not suitable for modeling highly non linear data nguyen et al 2021 to deal with the non linear relationship between inputs and output several non linear regression methods are considered the knn is another simple method which is used for regression problems without the limitation of linear assumption the prediction by knn is derived from the mean value of the k nearest neighboring samples in the training dataset without the training process therefore knn is very sensitive to the training dataset the ann is a well known machine learning algorithm that excels at modeling complex non linear relationships abdallah et al 2020 beysolow ii 2017 considering multiple hidden layers in a multi layer perception mlp a deep neural network is developed to process different levels of abstraction of the dataset which has many hyper parameters to be tuned in this study the mlp model is organized with four layers one input two hidden and one output layers and relu activation function similarly svm is also applicable to non linear data which is implemented with the kernel trick for deriving a non linear decision boundary svm can avoid the problem of overfitting and thus reduces the model biases li et al 2010 furthermore tree based models are also skilled at dealing with non linear data including regression tree and model tree algorithms for regression problems cubist is a prediction oriented regression model with additional corrections based on the nearest neighbors in the training set quinlan 1993 1992 the cubist algorithm is basically a type of model tree that generates a set of rules with a linear regression model which may be more accurate than a regression tree moreover there are several ensemble learning algorithms based on the regression tree rf is a well known ensemble model based on the classification and regression tree cart which uses a bootstrap aggregation bagging technique to fit plenty of independent regression trees on random subsamples of the training dataset beguin et al 2017 taghizadeh mehrjardi et al 2020 on the other hand boosting aggregation technique is used in the gbrt where the tree is fitted based on the residual of the former tree generally gbrt is effective in reducing biases avoiding overfitting and handling the uneven distribution of data attributes and has no assumptions on the input space however gbrt requires more hyper parameters tuning than rf wang et al 2021a further xgb algorithm is proposed based on the improvement of gbrt where the regularization term is embedded in the loss function to improve the generalization capability in addition xgb has a faster training speed especially for large samples the main limitation of xgb is that it has more hyper parameters chen et al 2022 chen and guestrin 2016 all eight algorithms mentioned above and the data processing were conducted with r programming r core team 2022 the mlr knn ann svm cubist rf gbrt and xgb algorithms were run by the car package fox and weisberg 2019 kknn package schliep and hechenbichler 2016 keras package allaire and chollet 2021 e1071 package meyer et al 2022 cubist package kuhn and quinlan 2022 randomforest package liaw and wiener 2002 gbm package greenwell et al 2022 and xgboost package chen et al 2022 in the r programming respectively by combining 8 4 model schemes and 8 machine learning algorithms 64 prediction models for gwc vwc and ts and 32 for bd were developed these models were calibrated trained with the training dataset and further tested with the testing dataset the samples of input features and target soil properties were split into training and testing datasets with a ratio of 8 2 2 4 model evaluation criteria the performance of each model for training and testing datasets is evaluated using three commonly used indicators i e the root mean squared error rmse willmott 1982 normalized rmse nrmse jamieson et al 1991 and coefficient of determination r2 nagelkerke 1991 as shown in eqs 1 3 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n obs i pr e i 2 2 nrmse rmse max obs min obs 3 r 2 i 1 n obs i obs pre i pre 2 i 1 n obs i obs 2 i 1 n pre i pre 2 where n is the number of samples obs and pre are the observations and predictions respectively and obs and pre denote the averages of observations and predictions respectively generally a model performs better when rmse and nrmse are closer to 0 and r 2 is closer to 1 the model performance is further evaluated from the perspective of spatial characteristics since the samples are spatially distributed the differences in the spatial distributions of observed and predicted soil properties can also reflect the model performance it is important to derive a model with less error and keep similar spatial characteristics for observations and predictions especially when the modeling results are applied to studies on a regional scale in this study the global moran s i was applied to identify the spatial pattern of samples which is a widely used measure of spatial autocorrelation das and ghosh 2017 tabarej and minz 2022 numerically moran s i can be expressed as follows 4 moran s i n i 1 n y 1 n w i j x i x x j x i 1 n y 1 n w i j i 1 n x i x 2 where x i and x j are the observed or predicted values of a soil property at locations i and j respectively x is the mean value at all the sites n is the number of samples and w i j is the weight determined by the spatial similarity between locations i and j moran s i ranges between 1 and 1 moran s i and the corresponding p value and z score generated from the monte carlo simulation can be used to determine whether the data is randomly dispersed or not when the p value is greater than a specified level of significance α 0 01 is used here the null assumption that the data is randomly dispersed is accepted otherwise the null assumption of randomness is rejected inferring that the high and low values in the dataset are dispersed spatially when the z score is less than 2 58 and that the high and or low values are spatially clustered when the z score is more than 2 58 besides ordinary kriging ok was also applied to map the spatial distributions of the observed and predicted soil properties which is a basic and very popular interpolation method for spatial data li et al 2020 wan et al 2021 3 results 3 1 statistical analysis of the soil data from laboratory analysis and trime measurements the main statistics of measured soil properties are summarized in table 2 it can be seen that the mean value of gwc is less than vwc mainly resulting from the bd values of 1 19 1 80 g cm3 the mean value of ts is 1 66 g kg indicating mild soil salinity in average the mean values of silt and sand fractions are both around 41 and much higher than the clay fraction of 17 7 the mc values obtained from trime measurements depict an overestimation as compared with the vwc based on laboratory analysis furthermore there is a large difference in the degrees of variability among these soil properties the ts has the largest variation with the coefficient of variation cv of 0 73 while the cv of bd is the smallest from the probability distributions of different soil properties fig s1 in the supplementary materials the gwc and vwc are close to the normal distribution with fewer outliers both in the low and high tails the soil ts shows a skewed distribution with the mean value higher than the median because of some extreme values in the high tail for the bd there is no obvious skewness although some outliers appear in both tails soil particle size fractions show the different extents of skewness in the distribution the clay fraction concentrates around 18 where extreme values appear in the high tail the silt fraction has a long tail in the low values while the sand fraction has a long tail in the high values and they both have fewer outliers than the clay for the trime measurements no obvious skewness is observed in mc ec and t with fewer outliers overall there is no evident skewness for the soil properties except for the ts and clay fraction although the long tailed distribution may affect prediction precision no samples are omitted in the modeling to fully utilize the original data and evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms from the correlation coefficients r2 between different soil properties fig s2 in the supplementary materials the gwc shows a high correlation coefficient of 0 89 with the vwc a weak negative correlation with bd and almost no correlation with ts the vwc has almost no correlation with ts and bd meanwhile the correlation between ts and bd is very weak the particle size fractions have different correlations with the gwc vwc ts and bd gwc and vwc are both positively correlated with silt and clay fractions and negatively correlated with sand fraction but their correlation with clay fraction is weaker than that with the silt and sand fractions the ts is mainly correlated with clay and sand fractions but has almost no correlation with silt fraction meanwhile bd is mainly correlated with the silt and sand fractions but has a very weak correlation with clay fraction among the three particle size fractions the sand fraction is strongly correlated with clay and silt fractions while the correlation between clay and silt fractions is very weak indicating that there is a large difference in the variation trends of psfs for all samples actually the sand fraction plays a transitional role between clay and silt some samples present a strong correlation between sand and clay while some samples present a strong correlation between sand and silt which results in higher correlation coefficients for sand clay and sand silt for the whole samples for soil properties measured with the trime there is a strong correlation between the mc and ec but both of them have smaller correlation coefficients with the t besides mc demonstrates a strong correlation with gwc vwc and ts while a weak correlation with bd and particle size fractions the ec has higher a correlation with the ts and mc a weak correlation with bd and very weak correlation with other variables the t shows a weak correlation with all other variables in this study the gwc vwc ts and bd are selected as the soil properties to be predicted which are affected by different input variables or predictors the variable importance of predictors for each target soil property is shown in fig 3 which is dimensionless and measures the change of node purity in the random forest the orders of relative importance score are consistent for both gwc and vwc which indicates that mc is the most important feature for gwc and vwc because they are all indexes for soil water content the particle size fractions also make relatively greater contributions to the prediction of gwc and vwc and specifically clay fraction has less importance than silt and sand fractions it is worth noting that multicollinearity is likely to cause the overestimation of variable importance because the sand fraction has a strong correlation with clay and silt fractions the clay fraction and bd have similar correlations with gwc while the clay fraction shows a higher importance score the last three features are bd ec and t in descending order of importance score but there are no great differences among them in terms of ts prediction the ec and mc have the highest importance scores which corresponds to the results of the correlation analysis however there are not many differences in the importance scores of other variables unlike previous predictions the psfs are very important features for the prediction of bd especially silt and sand fractions while the importance of clay fraction is similar to that of mc and ec which is possibly overestimated due to multicollinearity it should be noted that t is always the least important feature for all soil properties although there may be multicollinearity between the psfs that results in difficulty in variable importance assessment the predictive ability of random forest is not influenced by the multicollinearity and the three particle size fractions are considered as a whole in our study generally the features having a higher correlation coefficient with a target soil property make more contribution to the prediction the results of the feature importance assessment are basically consistent with the result of correlation analysis the combination of mc and ec m1 provides the basic input features for all four target variables because they are influenced by both soil dielectric constant and electrical conductivity different soil psfs are interrelated and present significant importance and hence they are considered equally as input features bd is correlated with gwc and illustrates relatively less importance following soil psfs although the importance of t is the lowest among others it is a basic soil physical property and is further tested for the prediction of target soil properties fig s2 shows that different soil properties are usually correlated to each other with different correlation coefficients and fig 3 presents different importance scores of soil properties in estimating different target variables consequently soil psfs bd and t are considered as the influencing factors which are evaluated according to the performance of different model schemes table 1 3 2 model evaluation for different soil properties 3 2 1 soil gravimetric and volumetric water contents fig 4 a demonstrates the performance of different models to predict gwc based on various machine learning algorithms in training and testing datasets the comparison of eight machine learning methods based on r2 shows that xgb gbrt and rf perform better with the average r2 greater than 0 60 for the testing dataset followed by svm and ann with r2 of around 0 54 and finally cubist knn and mlr with the average r2 less than 0 50 furthermore the generalization capability is evaluated through the difference of r2 between the training and testing datasets it can be seen that r2 of rf for the training dataset is much greater than that for the testing dataset indicating severe overfitting of rf on the contrary under fitting is observed in cubist and mlr because some r2 of training datasets are lower than those of testing datasets it is noteworthy that there is no training performance evaluation for knn regression because of its inherent principle i e there is no training process required among the developed models m5 m6 m7 and m8 perform better with higher r2 in the testing datasets than others due to the contribution of particle size fractions overall m8 performs the best because of more input variables while m1 is the worst model as it has only two features as input fig 4 b shows the performance of different models to predict the vwc using various machine learning algorithms in training and testing datasets similar to gwc xgb gbrt and rf have the best performance to predict the vwc with the average r2 greater than 0 61 followed by svm ann cubist and knn with the average r2 over 0 40 mlr performs the worst with the r2 of about 0 38 further obvious overfitting is observed for rf and svm and partly underfitting for cubist and mlr overall m5 m6 m7 and m8 perform better than other models among which m8 is the best while m1 or m2 illustrates the worst performance further the contributions of t bd and particle size fractions to predict gwc and vwc for models using rf gbrt and xgb algorithms are shown in fig 5 in particular the difference in r2 for two model input schemes shown in table 1 with or without one feature is used as a quantitative indicator to assess the contribution of the feature to a target soil property for example the change of r2 from m1 to m2 expresses the contribution of t for the prediction of gwc t shows a positive contribution to different models in most cases especially from m1 to m2 and m7 to m8 however the contribution of t as input is relatively small where a maximal increase of about 0 06 is observed in r2 significant contribution to gwc is observed when bd is added as an input especially from model m5 to m7 and from m6 to m8 with the r2 increasing by more than 0 05 even more than 0 10 in some cases the comparison shows that there is an enormous improvement resulted from adding the three particle size fractions for the models using different algorithms which increases the r2 by 0 08 0 20 in the case of vwc both t and bd make positive contributions to m4 and m8 which increase the r2 by about 0 03 while particle size fractions significantly increase the r2 by 0 07 0 27 to better understand the contribution of adding different features fig 6 shows the r2 values for model input schemes m1 m5 m7 and m8 where inputs of m5 m7 and m8 are generated by successively adding psfs bd and t to the previous scheme according to the model order shown in fig 6 a r2 for gwc is increasing the performance of m5 is evidently much better than that of m1 indicating the greater importance of psfs besides there is a slight increase in r2 for m7 and m8 which depicts some contribution of bd to m7 and t to m8 the comparison shows that m8 has a greater r2 of more than 0 7 even close to 0 8 when using the xgb therefore it is recommended to use m8 for the prediction of gwc in terms of vwc fig 6 b demonstrates that there is a significant increase in r2 from m1 to m5 only and very slight changes for m7 and m8 these results indicate that the psfs are much more important than bd and t in predicting the vwc there is a slight difference between m5 and m8 however it is worth mentioning that m5 needs fewer input features to balance the model complexity and prediction precision we recommend m5 for the prediction of vwc 3 2 2 soil salt content r2 of training and testing datasets to predict soil ts using different models are shown in fig 7 the comparisons of the r2 of the testing set show that xgb gbrt and rf have better performance with average r2 of about 0 72 the accuracy of svm ann and cubist are similar with r2 of about 0 65 while knn and mlr perform the worst with r2 of about 0 45 the generalization capability of machine learning algorithms shows that svm has a great overfitting as seen from the large difference of r2 between the training and testing datasets similarly rf ann and cubist also have the problem of overfitting on the other hand xgb and gbrt show relatively good generalization performance undoubtedly mlr is the only model that results in underfitting with lower r2 for both training and testing datasets the comparison of different models shows that m5 m6 m7 and m8 have overall better performance than the others especially when xgb gbrt and rf algorithms are used their better performance is mainly resulted from the feature of particle size fractions finally the results show that m8 having the most input features performs the best while m1 demonstrates poorer performance due to the least inputs the contribution of t bd and particle size fractions is evaluated by the difference of r2 for two consecutive model input schemes with or without one feature fig 8 a b and c the feature t has a positive contribution to the models with an increase in r2 of about 0 03 and the increase even reaches 0 10 from m5 to m6 using the gbrt algorithms in contrast the contribution of bd is positive when the rf algorithm is used and negative when the gbrt and xgb algorithms are used which indicates there is a great uncertainty of this feature in predicting ts when adding the particle size fractions there is an obvious increase in r2 with the average increases of more than 0 05 using these three algorithms furthermore the change in r2 is shown in fig 8 d along with the model order of m1 m5 m6 and m8 where inputs of m5 m6 and m8 are generated by successively adding psfs t and bd to the previous model it can be observed that r2 has an increasing trend from m1 to m6 indicating the positive effect of adding the features psfs and t however there is no obvious increase in r2 from m6 to m8 and even a decline is seen with the gbrt algorithm overall m6 having the features of psfs and t performs the best which is recommended to predict ts 3 2 3 soil bulk density in contrast to other soil properties soil bd is predicted using only four model input schemes due to fewer input features the results of r2 for the four input schemes based on different machine learning algorithms in training and testing datasets are shown in fig 9 a overall xgb gbrt and rf algorithms perform better with the average r2 of about 0 5 for the testing dataset followed by svm ann cubist and knn with the average r2 of less than 0 40 in contrast mlr demonstrates poor prediction capability totally due to much lower r2 considering the generalization performance there is a large difference of r2 between the training and testing datasets for rf and svm algorithms indicating a substantial overfitting on the other hand ann cubist and mlr algorithms underfit in most cases besides xgb and gbrt are better in generalization capability especially for m5 and m6 it is also observed that m5 and m6 always perform better than m1 and m2 for all algorithms because the former two models have more input features furthermore the contribution of t and psfs to different models is shown in fig 9 b results indicate that the contribution of t is very limited and results in an increase of r2 by 0 06 from m1 to m2 and almost zero from m5 to m6 in contrast fig 9 c reveals a significant contribution of psfs from m1 to m5 and m2 to m6 the maximum increase of more than 0 30 in r2 is observed from m1 to m5 although m6 and m5 have similar performance m5 needs fewer input features and hence is recommended to predict soil bd 3 2 4 comparison of models for different soil properties and machine learning algorithms fig 10 shows the comparison of model performances based on r2 and nrmse values of the testing dataset for different target soil properties using the recommended model inputs to various machine learning algorithms the maximal r2 of 0 84 is observed in the ts prediction model using gbrt indicating the strong predictability of ts from the recommended predictors overall the r2 values of gwc are slightly less than that of ts where the maximum of 0 80 is observed for xgb the prediction accuracy of vwc and bd are slightly lower than those of gwc and ts with the maximal r2 of 0 71 and 0 69 respectively the differences in the model performances for different soil properties are mainly associated with different input features based on the selected model scheme however it is noted that models for ts perform better than gwc despite having fewer inputs on the other hand models for bd perform worse than vwc even though they both have the same input features therefore the characteristic of target variables such as statistical distribution also influences the model performance for different algorithms xgb and gbrt usually perform better while mlr or knn perform the worst for all the target properties in terms of nrmse fig 10 b ts has the lowest nrmse of less than 0 2 for all algorithms the svm rf gbrt and xgb models for gwc and vwc perform similarly and better than those for bd however the performances of knn cubist and ann models for gwc and vwc are worse than those for bd overall the results indicate that gbrt is the best algorithm for predicting vwc and ts with the nrmse of 0 12 and 0 09 respectively further xgb performs the best to predict gwc and bd with nrmse of 0 12 and 0 13 respectively fig 11 a demonstrates that gwc has a high r2 value of 0 80 for the training dataset and good generalization capability with similar performance on the training and testing datasets for the xgb vwc and bd possess similar precision and generalization capability the r2 for ts is greater but higher ts values are generally underestimated mainly because of the large variance and skewed distribution of samples in fig 11 b gbrt based models for gwc vwc and ts have higher r2 of more than 0 7 for the testing datasets while that for bd has a relatively lower r2 of 0 62 xgb has stronger generalization capability for gwc and bd similarly gbrt has superior performance for vwc and ts especially for higher values of ts therefore it is recommended to apply xgb to predict gwc and bd while gbrt to predict vwc and ts moreover it is worth noting that the models generally presented overestimation at low values and underestimation at high values because the slopes of the test train lines are less than 1 for all cases fig 11 which is a common problem for most regression models essentially machine learning algorithms used in this study including xgb and gbrt are linear or nonlinear regression models and their predictions generally tend towards the mean of observed samples consequently the prediction is overestimated at low observed values and underestimated at high observed values 3 3 spatial distribution of different soil properties values of global moran s i in table 3 show the spatial patterns of different soil properties both the observed and predicted gwc and vwc show positive global moran s i values with p value 0 01 and z score 2 58 suggesting the presence of clustered distribution in gwc and vwc in the study region autumn and spring irrigations are widely applied from mid september to early november and from april to may respectively soil sampling during the autumn spring irrigation periods results in the clustered distributions of higher gwc and vwc in the irrigated regions and lower gwc and vwc in the non irrigated regions however the moran s i values for ts and bd are both close to zero with p value 0 1 suggesting randomly dispersed distributions for the observed and predicted ts and bd consequently the results of global moran s i show there is no discrepancy in spatial patterns between the observed and predicted soil properties to further understand the models performances the spatial distributions of observed soil properties in april 2021 are compared with the corresponding predictions by the best combinations of model input scheme and machine learning algorithm fig 12 lower observed gwc values of about 0 1 g g are mainly distributed in the western part of the study area comprised of large area of desert while higher values of about 0 3 g g are observed in the eastern hid near the wuliangsuhai lake due to more spring irrigation in this region in the middle hid the observed gwc values are around 0 2 g g for most areas the predicted gwc has a similar spatial pattern as the observed one i e lower in the west and higher in the east although the predictions underestimate higher observation values in some areas the spatial distribution of the observed vwc is consistent with the gwc the lower vwc of about 0 15 cm3 cm3 is observed in the western hid while higher vwc of about 0 44 cm3 cm3 in the east and moderate of around 0 25 cm3 cm3 in the middle the predicted vwc shows some overestimations in the low observation area and underestimations in the high observation area however it keeps a similar spatial distribution pattern as the observed one as a whole the comparisons of gwc and vwc show that only part of the areas has higher soil moisture which is resulted from spring irrigation in the particular part of the study region the results of observed ts illustrate that most areas have ts values ranging from 0 8 to 4 0 g kg indicating a mild degree of soil salinization however higher ts values are scattered in the east and middle parts of the hid where some areas have high ts of even more than 6 g kg indicating severe soil salinization the predicted ts has a similar spatial pattern as the observed one but there are still some overestimations in the high observation areas the observed bd ranges from 1 4 to 1 5 g cm3 in most areas indicating a natural state of the soil there are also some low values of about 1 2 g cm3 possibly caused by spring plowing before the field survey and sampling higher bd values from 1 6 to 1 8 g cm3 are dispersedly distributed in the middle and western parts of the hid which are resulted from not plowing or lower water content for a long period the predicted bd has a similar spatial distribution characteristic to the observed bd most areas are in the natural state with the bd of about 1 5 g cm3 however some overestimations underestimations are observed in the low high bd observation areas respectively which is also clearly shown in fig 11 overall the model predicted soil properties have similar spatial distribution patterns with the observed ones which indicates that the recommended models are robust enough to capture the spatial patterns of the studied soil properties 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of machine learning algorithms in predicting soil properties model evaluation results fig 10 show that mlr has a lower potential to predict target soil properties whereas the other seven machine learning algorithms perform much better t had very small correlation coefficients with the target variables figs s2 and 3 while it still contributed positively to the prediction of gwc fig 6 this indicates that the relations between input features and predicted soil properties are non linear that cannot be fully represented by the linear correlation coefficient machine learning algorithms are inherently nonlinear kuhn and johnson 2013 and provide effective solutions to the estimation of the soil properties in this study furthermore the performance of different algorithms appears to differ significantly fig 10 knn is slightly better than mlr and shows great instability because of its sensitivity to the data samples cubist is superior to knn in most cases although there is small difference in their testing accuracy ann and svm show moderate performance with the average r2 of 0 6 which is better than knn and cubist on the other hand rf gbrt and xgb demonstrate higher accuracy in the testing dataset r2 0 65 indicating the advantages of these ensemble learning algorithms results about the generalization capability of these machine learning models figs 4 7 and 9 show that rf and svm have overfitting problem in most cases possibly because of the weak adjustability and fewer hyper parameters gbrt and xgb demonstrate a better generalization capability for all the predicted soil properties as can be seen from the close accuracy of the training and testing datasets generally the probability distributions of data samples also have some influences on the performance of machine learning algorithms a noteworthy observation in this study is that soil ts shows some unbalance distribution characteristics with more low values and less high values and some other input features also have different skewness fig s1 under these circumstances xgb and gbrt always show the best accuracy fig 10 mainly because of their robustness and strong learning capacity for unbalanced data wang et al 2021a 4 2 feasibility of the model schemes for the predicted soil properties soil particle size fractions psfs soil bulk density bd and soil temperature t show different impacts on the estimation of the soil properties soil psfs are significantly correlated with the target soil variables as shown in fig s2 consequently soil psfs play a critical role for all the predicted soil properties which is indispensable to the model input scheme however bd mainly contributes to the gwc estimation fig 5 while has little influence on the vwc and ts estimations adding t to the model input features is also effective in improving the accuracy for the estimation of gwc and ts figs 5 and 8 in practice the cost of obtaining all the soil features as model inputs is usually high therefore it should be considered to balance the number of features and the model performance in selecting the model inputs the recommended model scheme generally has a good accuracy with appropriate feature inputs for soil water content the model for gwc m8 requires more inputs than vwc m5 table 1 indicating higher cost and limitation in its application vwc on the other hand is widely used for soil water content in irrigation management hydrological models and crop planting thus the model of vwc is more likely to be recommended to estimate the soil water content although those schemes are proposed based on the soil samples in hid they are probably applicable to other regions especially cropland available studies generally developed linear regression models directly between the observed and the tdr measured soil water or salt contents topp et al 1980 zhou et al 2003 yu et al 2019 although their models performed well in the estimation of soil water and salt contents the models are generally applicable to a specified soil texture type soil bulk density and or soil temperature in our study we considered possible soil factors that influence soil water and salt contents and used machine learning algorithms to map the complex non linear relationship between soil water salt contents and tdr measurements the recommended nonlinear models for the estimation of soil water and salt contents performed much better than the linear model moreover we also made a successful attempt on the estimation of soil bd although its accuracy is not as good as soil water and salt contents moreover the soil samples were distributed in the whole irrigation district fig 1 and hence we evaluated the model results in term of spatial distribution patterns global moran s i indicated that the spatial distribution patterns of the observed and predicted soil properties are very close table3 from the interpolated maps using ok fig 12 although there are some overestimates or underestimates at local scale the overall spatial distributions of observation and estimation show much similarity therefore it is reliable to obtain the spatial distributions of soil properties based on the models recommended in this study which is very helpful in modeling the hydrological agricultural ecological and environmental processes at regional scale 5 conclusions to accurately estimate soil gravimetric water content gwc volumetric water content vwc total salt content ts and bulk density bd from soil sampling and in situ measurement by the trime we designed different model input schemes to quantify the effect of different influencing factors and evaluated the performances of different machine learning algorithms the main findings are summarized as follows 1 the appropriate model input schemes to predict soil properties are recommended which are m8 for soil gwc m5 for soil vwc and bd and m6 for soil ts results indicate that soil particle size fractions are generally important for all the predicted soil properties whereas bd primarily contributes to the gwc estimation and contributes little to the vwc and ts estimation adding t to the model features can also improve the performance of models to predict gws and ts 2 among different machine learning algorithms the ensemble learning algorithms i e rf gbrt and xgb demonstrate good performance in the testing dataset overfitting phenomenon is mainly observed for rf in most cases xgb and gbrt are always robust and show strong learning capacities for the unbalanced data it is therefore recommended to apply xgb to predict gwc and bd and gbrt to predict vwc and ts 3 based on the evaluation of spatial distribution characteristics it is reliable to obtain the spatial distributions of soil properties based on the models recommended in this study the resulted soil property maps are important in modeling the

8889,recirculation of drainage solution reduces the emission of water nutrients and plant protection products from both substrate based and water based growing systems during cultivation deviations in nutrient ratios in the root environment may potentially affect yield and quality as well as motivate a grower to discharge the drainage solution our objective was to quantify imbalances in nutrient ratios and to assess what part of the nutrient imbalances can be prevented with practical measures results included daily balances for water and individual nutrients using data from a commercial cherry tomato grower the balances showed plant water uptake and uptake of individual nutrients were not strictly correlated it was also possible to establish individual relations between solar radiation sum and water uptake as well as uptake per individual nutrient after 200 days of production an adapted balance was prepared and then used as a model this model was used to compare various nutrient supply strategies to reduce daily fluctuations in nutrient ratios simulations showed the imbalances between supply and uptake could be halved compared with the original grower strategy this was realized by using a combination of drainage volume percentage the supply ec and the correlation of the supplied solution ec with solar radiation forecast the conclusion is that nutrient balances can deliver plant uptake data for water and individual nutrients which can then be correlated with solar radiation this can be used to identify and reduce deviations from targeted ratios between nutrients in the supplied solution as well as in the root solution these conclusions take advantage of information available in practice keywords hydroponic soilless cultivation recirculation nutrient

effective measure to both increase water use efficiency and reduce the emission of nutrients plant protection products and cleaning agents in the environment foley et al 2011 stanghellini 2014 attenborough 2020 blok et al 2023 recirculation of drainage solution has the potential to reduce the input of water and nutrients by over 30 and 50 respectively massa et al 2010 grewal et al 2011 recirculation of drainage solution is therefore an important contribution to reaching several of the united nations sustainable development goals zhou et al 2021 the collection of drainage solution is technically simple in soilless cultivation systems therefore total recirculation is easier when using growing media or nutrient solutions than when using soil as rooting environment however recirculation of drainage solution in soilless cultivation systems requires the simultaneous optimization of 16 nutrients present day recirculation systems require a high level of knowledge and skill which is slowing the worldwide introduction of drainage solution recirculation failsafe decision support systems promise to speed the introduction of drainage solution recirculation in some cases though the quality of the input water is too low for recirculation and the profit margins too low to allow pre treating the water blok et al 2023 after the drainage solution is collected it usually needs a correction of imbalances in nutrient ratios before being re used a list of terms used is provided table 1 imbalances are identified as differences between nutrient levels found in the actual root solution and a target root solution imbalances will occur when actual plant uptake deviates from an idealized target plant uptake as in all agriculture nutrient recommendation systems nrss are used to systematically match fertilizer dosing to observations of nutrients in the root environment nrss are also described with the more general term decision support system dss savvas and gruda 2018 gallardo et al 2020 in fig 1 a common recommendation system to deal with such imbalances is shown de kreij et al 1999 fig 1 shows the use of two target nutrient solutions the first is the target root solution which supplies the nutrient ratios and general nutrient level characterized by the electric conductivity ec which allows the plant to take up exactly those nutrients and ratios required for optimal growth the second is the target added solution the target added solution attempts to create exactly the solution the plant needs to take in for optimum growth the reason the target root solution and the target added solution differ is because plant uptake of some nutrients like calcium and magnesium is slower than for others thus nutrients like calcium and magnesium need to be present in the root environment in higher concentrations than in the target solution for better plant uptake sonneveld and voogt 1986 this difference in target root solution composition and target added solution composition is not only important in growing media based cultivation systems but also in water based cultivation systems such as nutrient flow technique or deep flow technique nutrient flow technique nft a cultivation system in which roots are positioned in a layer of running nutrient solution of generally 1 5 cm deep flow technique dft a cultivation system in which roots are hanging in a pond like structure with generally 20 50 cm deep nutrient solution furthermore the root solution is kept at ec levels higher than the ec taken in by the crop to promote some important quality characteristics such as dry matter and sugar content petersen et al 1998 pascale et al 2001 once an imbalance in the actual root solution is found the only way to correct it is changing the added solution to find the proper corrected added solution one needs to decide first how fast or slow the intended correction should result in full restoration of the balance the time needed for a correction to restore the target root solution can be calculated if the number of liters of solution in both the root system and the recirculation system is known fig 2 shows an example for calcium only once the corrections per nutrient are known the target added solution can be changed into an actual added solution for the required period after which a new correction cycle starts a version of this system has been described elsewhere sonneveld et al 1999 for the dutch nrs de kreij et al 1999 the ratio between the nutrients in added solution and root solution has been established in many plant uptake experiments sonneveld and voogt 2009 for many horticultural plant species concentration ranges per nutrient were tested to find the response of the root solution to a change in added solution this resulted in crop specific recipes for target added solutions and target root solutions including crop stage adjustments for added solutions de kreij et al 1999 the drainage solution is usually analyzed because the root solution can be difficult to sample the underlying relations between added solutions and root solutions were validated for drainage percentages between 20 and 40 of the supplied solution and a 14 day duration of corrections de kreij et al 1999 an example of the experimentally established relationship of root solution concentration versus added solution concentration is shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows the change in added solution content which will result in a correction of actual the root solution back to the target root solution for the actual chosen ec data such as in fig 3 served to create the tabulated recommendation system used de kreij et al 1999 feedback by sensors and or modelling is essential to run a system to correct for nutrient imbalances over time sensor feedback is provided daily for supplied irrigation volume drainage volume ec and ph the information on nutrients and nutrient ratios is in practice delivered every 14 days after sending drainage solution samples and sometimes supplied solution samples to a specialized laboratory given that nutrient shortages result in irrevocable damage after 1 5 7 days marcelis et al 2003 there is interest in faster methods including ion specific measurement tools bamsey et al 2012 feedback by models is provided every 5 60 min in commercial greenhouse systems several authors have designed models for automated fertigation in closed soilless culture heinen 2001 silberbush et al 2005 mathieu et al 2006 katsoulas et al 2015 savvas et al 2021 but their use is not common possibly due to the quantity of parameters that must be set a model to forecast the recirculating nutrient solution composition massa et al 2011 uses water uptake and nutrient uptake with nutrient uptake estimated by periodic laboratory analyses of drainage solution samples it is also possible and customary to adjust the added solution composition for crop stage and climate if a target added solution fails to represent the long term plant uptake this may result in nutritional disorders related to over or under supply marschner 2011 such as cation anion or specifically ammonium nitrate driven ph fluctuations haynes 1990 dickson et al 2016 however most target added solutions when combined with a system for feedback correction will prevent such nutritional disorders and ph problems even if the target added solution itself is mildly incorrect i e different from the actual plant uptake the corrections will change the target added solution towards the actual plant uptake this means that over time the average of all the actual added solutions will be an improved target added solution for this particular crop or variety such a converging system is inherently safe from accumulating errors what then is the benefit of more exact targets for added solution or root solution and or more frequent sampling the deviations in the root solution in this study are not large enough to cause nutrient deficiencies or toxicities the reason to dedicate research to such relatively small deviations is because ion uptake requires energy and more energy is required when the root solution ratios deviate more from the target root solution ratios poorter et al 1991 albornoz and lieth 2017 the plant can prevent nutrient disorders by spending energy on the additional uptake of individual nutrients rewald et al 2016 but only for so long as the resulting higher transport rate to the root meets the demand blok et al 2017 when the supply rate remains below the plant demand long enough the root environment is depleted and clear nutrient disorders emerge our objectives are a to quantify deviations in actual root solution as compared to the target root solution b to estimate what part of deviations between actual root solution and target root solution can be avoided with practical measures our hypothesis is that practical measures to reduce deviations in actual root solution can be based on above ground climate factors such as light temperature and carbon dioxide concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 the data collection the tabulated dutch nrs de kreij et al 1999 was used in combination with a balance system that registered fertigation data to allow us to monitor composition changes in the root solution over time a data set from a commercial grower in the venlo area was used 51 43 n 6 12 e the crop was 5 ha cherry tomato cultivar sassari rijk zwaan fijnaart the netherlands the crop was grown in a state of the art venlo type glass house using stone wool slabs as growing medium with heating carbon dioxide and assimilation light 22 24 c 700 ppm co2 and 100 150 µmol m 2 s 1 par by high pressure sodium lamps observation ran from 12 feb 2011 03 oct 2011 table 2 shows setpoint data for climate and fertigation parameters per crop stage as used in the nrs 2 2 water and nutrient balance the nutrient balance data for a single cultivation company includes a bi weekly list of actual added solutions root solution analyses received and daily root solution ec in addition a list of daily water volumes supplied drainage volume as well as the capacity of the drainage solution storage is required this data is then resampled to fit time intervals of 1 day for all nutrient nutrients ec and ph and volumes involved the general flow of information mimics the grower s situation table 3 and fig 4 each step in this information flow contains simultaneously water in l m 2 d 1 nutrient load in mmol m 2 d 1 and concentration in mmol l 1 this is why in the appendix a there are three columns for every term in fig 4 the flow volume and concentration are measured leaving the nutrient load to be calculated though several steps require the concentration to be calculated by dividing load over volume to calculate the plant uptake of water nutrients and resulting plant uptake concentration the calculations are 1 wateruse watersupply waterdrain in which wateruse in lˑm 2 the amount used for transpiration evaporation and leakage watersupply in lˑm 2the amount supplied to the plants by irrigation waterdrain in lˑm 2the amount received back from the plants after irrigation 2 nutrientuse nutrientsupply nutrientdrain in which nutrientuse in mmolˑm 2 the amount used for growth and leakage losses nutrientsupply in mmolˑm 2the amount supplied to the plants by irrigation nutrientdrain in mmolˑm 2the amount received back from the plants note that nutrients are measured as load rather than using concentration because concentration is known and load not concentration to nutrient load is calculated using 3 nutrientuse wateruse concentrationuse 4 nutrientsupply watersupply concentrationsupply 5 nutrientdrain waterdrain concentrationdrain in which concentrationuse in mmolˑl 1is the amount for growth and losses concentrationsupply in mmolˑl 1is the amount supplied to the plants concentrationdrain in mmolˑl 1is the amount received back from the plants in this system the concentrationuse must be calculated indirectly 6 concentrationuse nutrientsupply nutrientdrain watersupply waterdrain 2 2 1 the extended balance registration to find missing data once sufficient data was gathered the grower s data provided feedback on parameters in the nrs table 4 1 the average plant nutrient uptake of the tomato crop for any period of time in the data was calculated from the derived daily data this average uptake per nutrient was then used to calibrate the target added solution ec the resulting solution is a company and time specific estimate for the target added solution table 5 this procedure may be valuable for identifying varieties which differ in their uptake pattern from the standard target added solution 2 the relationship between the concentration in the added solution and the concentration in the root solution was calculated this relationship is compared to the relationship used in the nrs the relationship in the nrs is used to find the magnitude of corrections in the added solution as shown in fig 3 2 2 2 adding and processing climate data daily radiation sum data was recorded and the correlation between individual nutrient uptake and radiation was calculated the correlations could be made crop stage specific by specifying time intervals which correspond to the crop stages within the nrs climate parameters other than radiation could also have been selected for similar purposes 2 3 quantification of deviations the deviations between the plant uptake load and the supplied solution load were quantified by calculating the daily standard deviation as the square root of the daily variance used in the appendix a the standard deviation was corrected for the difference in average ec of plant uptake solution and the supplied solution 2 4 simulations to reduce deviations of fertigation data in the balance calculation drainage solution analyses are measured and plant uptake is the result when sufficient data is gathered it is possible to enter the balance into a model the previously established plant uptakes are used as measurement to make the drainage solution analysis dynamic balanced it is then possible to calculate what would happen if the added solution was changed in a different way assuming plant uptake was unaffected this approach was used to change the added solution using the previously found correlation between plant uptake ec and radiation this allowed the calculation of a supplied solution ec to be influenced by anticipated radiation after completing this simulation the standard deviations between the plant uptake load and the supplied solution load were again quantified and compared with the original situation 3 results 3 1 water and nutrient balance data both water and nutrient supply over the whole season surpass the plant needs generously table 4 the drainage is 35 of the supply by volume 4 4 lˑm 2ˑd 1 supply versus 2 8 lˑm 2ˑd 1 plant uptake to compare solutions composed of ions of different valences all solutions with multiple ions are expressed in mmol of ion charge when using mmol of charge in nutrient supply the drainage load is 56 of the supply load 129 mmolˑm 2ˑd 1 supply versus 56 8 mmolˑm 2ˑd 1 plant uptake combining the water and nutrient flows renders a supply ec of 3 0 dsˑm 1 and a plant uptake ec of 2 0 dsˑm 1 the 2 0 dsˑm 1 plant uptake ec is 40 higher than the 1 6 dsˑm 1 of the added solution ec de kreij et al 1999 when we compare the calculated plant uptake over the whole season and the target added solution at equal ec table 5 we find values within 5 of the target added solution for calcium and sulphate about 30 lower for nitrate and 40 lower for phosphate while the uptake is 25 higher for potassium and magnesium and 75 lower for ammonium table 5 the target added solution found with the grower s balance is therefore not very close to the target added solution of the nrs de kreij et al 1999 3 2 quantified deviations we assume it is advantageous if the ratios of nutrients in the supplied solution load and the ratios of nutrients in the plant uptake load follow each other smoothly to keep the energy costs of active ion uptake low however fig 5 indicates this is not the case as both values fluctuate with poor correlation the deviations were quantified by calculating the daily standard deviation between the supplied solution load and the plant uptake load expressed in mmol of ion charges the standard deviation in ion charges is 84 5 mmolˑm 2 as the supplied solution load is 56 larger than the plant uptake load there is a systematic difference between supplied solution load and plant uptake load once the systematic difference is removed the standard deviation in ion charges reduces to 43 3 mmolˑm 2 table 6 3 3 simulated deviations using the per day and per nutrient data from the water and nutrient balance correlations between daily radiation sum and daily uptake per nutrient were put in graphs appendix a this was also done for the relation between daily radiation and the plant uptake ec expressed in mmol of ion charges this relation was found to be highly correlated therefore it is possible to use a single value to describe the reaction of plant uptake to radiation sum by dividing the radiation sum per day by the plant uptake load in mmol of ion charges per day a simple load uptake constant is found of 0 26 mjˑm 2ˑmmol 1 the supplied solution ec is now replaced with a prediction based on the load uptake constant the actual radiation and the supplied water volume table 6 it is however necessary to use a constant of 0 12 mjˑm 2ˑmmol 1 to allow for a drainage load of about 56 as before this reduces the standard deviation in ion charges from 43 3 to 38 3 mmolˑm 2 if we allow for a load drainage of 35 by increasing the load uptake constant to 17 mjˑm 2ˑmmol 1 the standard deviation in ion charges decreases to 24 4 mmolˑm 2 however the supply ec then drops to the level of the plant uptake ec 2 1 dsˑm 1 3 3 1 estimates for assimilate costs for nutrient uptake directly measuring energy used or heat produced by roots is difficult the same applies for more indirect measurements like the energy carrier atp sugars or carbon dioxide thus oxygen consumption became an indirect measurement for energy use and assimilate consumption under aerobic circumstances energy is produced by oxidizing glucose in which one mole of glucose uses six moles of oxygen for energy consumption the relatively large portion of oxygen roots dedicate for ion uptake versus oxygen use for maintenance and growth makes it possible to measure effects of nutrient changes the energy cost of ion uptake is reported as 0 5 molˑmol 1 o2 per ion nitrate and 0 25 molˑmol 1 o2 per cation cannell and thornley 2000 table 7 using data from the cherry tomato cultivation nutrient plant uptake extended to a one year period is expressed in mmol ion charges about 40 mmolˑl 1 in 800 lˑm 2ˑy 1 which is about 32 000 mmolˑm 2ˑy 1 which is 32 molˑm 2ˑy 1 table 8 this allows us to calculate 12 molˑm 2ˑy 1 of oxygen needed for ion uptake table 8 to interpret the 12 molˑm 2ˑy 1 of oxygen needed for ion uptake the value needs to be compared to the total oxygen use by the root system in molˑm 2ˑy 1 the total oxygen use is based on a maximum use of 2 mgˑg 1ˑh 1 for fresh root mass morard et al 2000 bar yosef and lieth 2013 blok and gérard 2013 this can be recalculated into a root oxygen consumption of 71 molˑm 2ˑy 1 table 8 the amount of oxygen used for ion uptake is therefore about 17 of the total root oxygen consumption 4 discussion 4 1 water and nutrient balance the plant uptake ec in this 2011 experiment was 40 higher than the plant uptake ecs that the 1999 recommendation system was based upon de kreij et al 1999 this is believed to reflect a higher production level in 2011 than in 1999 partly related to the 100 150 µmol m 2 s 1 of assimilation light used on this crop not used in 1999 furthermore the cherry type tomato used in 2011 was not yet available in 1999 in the discussion of the extended balance registration 4 1 2 we will see how the registered nutrient uptake indeed differs from the expected target added solution as explained in the introduction this difference does not affect the proper functioning of the nrs as the system converges towards the actual plant uptake by design the drainage in volume and load 35 respectively 56 is high but as almost all drainage solution is recirculated there is no undesired emission of water or nutrients furthermore the amount of drainage must surpass 20 to even out differences between individual plants and growth differences caused by inhomogeneity in microclimate the drainage load cannot be reduced without lowering the root solution ec which could decrease production quality ehret and ho 1986 a possible way to proceed is to lower the drainage volume and drainage load proportionally by maintaining the root solution and drainage ec 4 1 1 the role of nutrient recommendation systems the choice for the dutch recommendation system offers the advantage of being based on experimental data de kreij et al 1999 sonneveld and voogt 2009 but other systems are also in practical use 1 compensation of the drain solution re use by bringing it back to the target root solution composition this is perhaps the most common system in global use it results in a constant ratio of nutrients in the supply solution whereas the dutch system oversupplies undersupplies those nutrients lacking or in excess in the actual root solution this system will add what the plants take in but deviations in the root solution must be on average larger than when based on measured relations between root solution deviations and changes in added solution 2 maintaining a set composition of the added solution regardless of the fluctuations in the root solution this system is easy to operate but may result in severe and long lasting depletion or accumulation problems when the actual plant uptake differs from the plant uptake expected based on the target root solution system 2 works well in free drainage situations or with frequent discharge some growers improve the system for recirculation by adding reducing the individual nutrients in excess or lacking in the root solution analyses based on gut feeling and experience which results in an approximation of system 1 more generally speaking the dutch system minimizes fluctuations in nutrient ratios in the root solution by accepting larger deviations in nutrient ratios within the supplied solution in contrast systems 1 and 2 attempt to keep nutrient ratios within the supplied solution stable by accepting larger deviations in nutrient ratios within the root solution the relationship between the observed deviation in root solution composition and the required adaptation in the added solution is still based on experiments de kreij et al 1999 or on experience there is room for a more accurate approach which calculates the load of individual nutrients present in the root environment plus drain collection system i e the resident volume and then calculates how long it takes for a chosen over supply in the irrigation load to bring the actual root solution back to the target root solution fig 2 the grower can then choose to correct the deviation faster but allowing for a large adaptation of the added solution alternatively the grower can choose to correct the deviation slower in which case the adaptation of the added solution is smaller such an approach would also circumvent the implicit assumptions in the dutch recommendation system which are fixed ratios for reuse and drainage of about 30 of the supplied volume and about 15 lˑm 2 of resident volume this was in line with the early cultivation systems with rooting media slabs which used one drainage solution analysis every 14 days and a single a and b tank with stock solution lasting 3 20 days obviously a more versatile recommendation system will better serve cultivation systems with high drainage percentages such as in nft or overhead irrigation of container plants free choice for drainage percentage and resident system volume will also serve cultivation systems with large resident volumes of nutrient solution such as in dft systems or very small resident volumes such as modern tomato crops with a v system of planting in the balance sheet we used mmol of ion charges to compare solutions composed of ions of different valences this also enabled us to use the relation between ec and the amount of ion charges per litre to convert between measurement types 1 0 dsˑm 1 was taken to be equivalent to 10 mmolˑl 1 of ion charge appendix a a more accurate method would use a method which uses activities of each specific ion for each general ec level mcneal et al 1970 nrss are a practical answer to many drawbacks of more physiologically oriented approaches le bot et al 1998 it does however implicitly assume physiological processes which are still debated such as ion uptake proportional to the outside concentration le deunff et al 2016 the basic assumptions of the nrss discussed here are related to target added solution and target root solution these are plant specific solutions characterized by fixed ratios between the individual nutrients steiner 1961 steiner 1966 these ratio recipes still must be measured for each plant species separately eventually physiologists may supply more in depth explanations for the ratios in the target added solution as well as for the per species relation between target added solution and target root solution 4 1 2 the extended balance registration and the target added solution the registered plant uptakes of individual nutrients still differed considerably from the target added solution table 5 the higher uptake concentration of potassium was expected as the cherry type of tomato is known to take in relatively more potassium than round type tomatoes the lower uptake concentration of ammonium is expected as the ammonium was cut back by the grower to prevent a ph drop in the rooting medium horchani et al 2010 dickson et al 2016 the higher uptake concentration of magnesium is not explained the lower values for nitrate and phosphorous uptake concentration in combination with the on average higher uptake concentration of cations mean the plant was using more cation charges than anion charges to maintain electro neutrality the plant had to take in other anions or excrete cations with hydrogen ion excretion as the most likely mechanism fisher et al 2014 this justifies the grower s aversion to the use of ammonium which would induce further acidification of the root solution based on the derived plant uptakes a more accurate target added solution could be modified to contain about 4 mmolˑl 1 extra potassium sulphate and 0 8 mmolˑl 1 magnesium sulphate this could lead to a too high uptake of those nutrients which the plant takes in more readily for this reason the nrs maintains corrections only for a set period or quantity of nutrient supply 4 1 3 the addition of climate data when using actual climate data the quality of the forecast will be incidentally lower than when using the climate data after the fact as used here in the model in this case the grower did reduce the ec with radiation level albeit rather conservatively fig 5 this makes sense because plant water uptake and plant nutrient uptake are different processes le bot et al 1998 marcelis et al 2003 which are preferably evaluated independently to arrive at an acceptable fertigation schedule plant water uptake has been studied in detail and allows automated systems to either predict plant water uptake with simple models de graaf and esmeijer 1998 or single factor effects of radiation temperature vapor pressure deficit wind velocity or carbon dioxide levels stanghellini et al 2019 and adjust the quantities supplied with system feedback by measuring the drainage returned van iersel et al 2013 plant nutrient uptake sometimes called plant uptake load has been used in combination with plant water uptake to balance supply and drainage solution nutrient ratios gallardo et al 2009 balendonck 2011 stanghellini et al 2019 in their approach the plant uptake concentration is the result of dividing plant nutrient uptake by plant water uptake however most commercial systems use only a water uptake model and for nutrient load rely on regular corrections based on ec ph and 14 day drainage solution analyses problems of not separating water uptake and nutrient uptake become apparent when plant production increases over time through factors such as an increased use of assimilation light selection of new plant varieties or carbon dioxide supplementation le bot et al 1998 gorbe and calatayud 2010 all such production increases result in higher nutrient uptakes but likely result in less than proportional increases or even decreases in water use this suggests the accuracy of the adaptations could be improved by a including more climate factors in the correlations to predict a better correction of the added solution and b splitting the corrections in by transpiration volume and nutrient load quantity 4 2 the quantification and minimization of deviations in supplied solution the analysis of standard deviations shows that the variation between the supply load and plant uptake load in mmol of ion charges is large 43 3 mmolˑm 2 and can be almost halved to 24 4 mmolˑm 2 by using a radiation factor based on the correlation between radiation and uptake load table 7 this indicates the actual nutrient supply as realized by the grower is not yet following radiation very closely the water supply of the grower in contrast is already closely following radiation when we allow the drainage load to be reduced from 56 to 35 the standard deviation between the supply load and plant uptake load is reduced but the drainage ec is also reduced to values too low to produce quality fruits 2 0 dsˑm 1 an acceptable reduction in standard deviation without effect on the drainage ec is possible if the supply volume is minorly reduced to drop the drainage volume from 35 4 to 30 1 the simulation tool is not meant to be used with one load uptake constant i e the ec for all nutrients the reduction of the standard deviation in table 6 can only be a demonstration of the order of magnitude of the decrease in standard deviations which can be expected in practical circumstances the risk of using the ec thereby using the same increase or reduction value for all nutrients is that the deviations of some individual nutrient loads may increase rapidly the deviation between the supplied solution load and plant uptake load was taken as a measure of mismatch in ion uptake the deviation before standardizing also delivers the direction of the mismatch if the summations of over and under supply over time are about equal this indicates the target added solution was about right but if the deviation is consistently one sided it means the target added solution either over or under estimated the actual plant uptake this is an indication that the target added solution needs to be corrected in the analysis the deviation between supplied solution and plant uptake was used this was done for the practical reason that reliable supplied ec levels were available for each day however should ion specific measurement devices become available bamsey et al 2012 it could be effective to include the daily deviations between actual root solution and target root solution 4 2 1 the quantification of energy costs related to deviations in root solution based on data reported for oxygen consumption per nutrient the amount of oxygen use for the recorded plant nutrient uptake was calculated by equating oxygen use with energy and assimilate use it was found that about 17 of oxygen used by the root is spent on nutrient uptake table 7 this is far below the 3070 reported based on the use of atp in roots of grass species veen 1980 van der werf et al 1988 poorter et al 1991 the lower value found seems plausible as the cherry tomato crop is selected for high fruit production and the cultivation system ensures a non limiting nutrient supply modelled uptake corrections potentially halved the measured standard deviations which themselves were about 30 of the total nutrient uptake this means the potential savings on energy for nutrient uptake are in the order of 2 4 of the total assimilates sent to the root or 0 5 1 of the total net assimilates is the amount of energy needed for uptake corrections of consequence for production the amount of carbon used for root respiration and growth is assumed to be 25 of the total net assimilated carbon in fast growing species poorter et al 1990 of the 25 assimilates sent to roots 16 is used for respiration including nutrient uptake and 9 for growth poorter et al 1991 if imbalance in the root solution increases the respiration for nutrient uptake and the total carbon available remains the same the above ground growth should decrease by the same proportion thus an increase in root assimilation use of 1 should lower the assimilates available for fruit yield by 1 assuming 70 of above ground assimilates is used for fruit production the yield reduction could be between 1 and 2 for tomato this means energy consequences of nutrient imbalances will be difficult to prove with direct experiments but may be relevant for commercial growing the energy cost for ion uptake was calculated based on several assumptions which still are debatable table 7 bouma and de visser 1993 bouma et al 1996 cannell and thornley 2000 1 the amount of oxygen kj atp or carbon required for the uptake of one mol nutrient is based on a limited number of measurements the measurements involved are quite complicated and require careful execution scheurwater et al 1998 roots are grown in a confined space and the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is measured on line while relative root growth is measured at intervals 2 the energy costs per mol of nutrient uptake are assumed to be independent of the cultivation environment and the relative abundance of other nutrients 3 a sub optimal ratio of a nutrient in the root solution will result in the inevitable uptake of a counter ion which then requires additional uptake energy 4 the amount of assimilates partitioned to the roots was assumed to be 20 25 of the total assimilates but for tomato with a high supply of nutrients this might be closer to the 15 mentioned for the dry mass partitioning to the roots de groot et al 2003 4 3 wider aspects of recirculation of drainage solution soilless growing can be sub divided into substrate based growing and water based growing in substrate based growing 10 50 of the irrigated volume must become drainage solution to flush nutrient imbalances in the root environment caused by site specific differences in plant uptake and site specific differences in irrigation supply raaphorst et al 2014 in water based growing site specific imbalances in the root environment can be corrected by mixing the supplied solution with the root solution much faster than in substrate based growing in practice however some nft systems suffer from accumulation or depletion of specific nutrients over the length of the system puerta et al 2007 while dft systems with dense root growth may encounter problems to evenly mix the root solution over the pond area and over pond depth shi et al 2007 in substrate based growing and nft the supplied solution consists of the added solution plus the recirculated drainage solution the recirculated drainage solution adds a large part of the nutrient load usually over 50 to realize the proper ec for quality in dft the added and supplied solution are the same as there is no separate drainage solution to recirculate the model as used here assumes plant uptake is explained by radiation and the target actual solution the relative level of an individual nutrient on the root surface is also a factor and even a factor which could eventually be modelled le deunff et al 2016 if the level of an nutrient such as potassium is higher than the target value then some extra uptake will result sometimes called luxurious consumption the relationship between the extra uptake and the surplus above the target value can be established and used in a more general version of the model 4 4 conclusions the objective to quantify deviations in actual root solution as compared to the target root solution proved possible calculating daily balances allowed the quantification of mild nutrient imbalances before risking nutrient deficiencies it was also possible to check on the recommended target added solutions and to find relationships between radiation and uptake of individual nutrients the second objective was to estimate what part of deviations in actual root solution can be avoided with practical measures simulations showed deviations in the nutrient balance can be halved by using a combination of drainage volume percentage supply ec variance and correlations of supplied solution ec with radiation forecast these parameters are already available in practice and can be recalculated with little additional effort as the ec is the summation of the contributions of individual nutrients it is expected using the individual nutrient loads rather than the ec will allow a further reduction of deviation however we did not validate that the use of individual nutrient data reduces or further reduces the deviations in nutrient ratios as radiation is the main but not the only factor influencing transpiration and growth there is room for further research using multiple climate factors in addition to radiation the hypothesis was that practical measures can reduce deviations in actual root solution when these measures are based on above ground climate factors such as light temperature and carbon dioxide this hypothesis was proven for the combination drainage percentage supply ec and the correlation supplied ec radiation it was not extended to other climate factors related to growth the correlations between single nutrients and radiation were also measured but these relationships were not yet

ratios and to assess what part of the nutrient imbalances can be prevented with practical measures results included daily balances for water and individual nutrients using data from a commercial cherry tomato grower the balances showed plant water uptake and uptake of individual nutrients were not strictly correlated it was also possible to establish individual relations between solar radiation sum and water uptake as well as uptake per individual nutrient after 200 days of production an adapted balance was prepared and then used as a model this model was used to compare various nutrient supply strategies to reduce daily fluctuations in nutrient ratios simulations showed the imbalances between supply and uptake could be halved compared with the original grower strategy this was realized by using a combination of drainage volume percentage the supply ec and the correlation of the supplied solution ec with solar radiation forecast the conclusion is that nutrient balances can deliver plant uptake data for water and individual nutrients which can then be correlated with solar radiation this can be used to identify and reduce deviations from targeted ratios between nutrients in the supplied solution as well as in the root solution these conclusions take advantage of information available in practice keywords hydroponic soilless cultivation recirculation nutrient uptake ion uptake energy root oxygen uptake data availability data is included in the appendix a 1 introduction recirculation of drainage solution in horticulture and possibly agriculture is a very effective measure to both increase water use efficiency and reduce the emission of nutrients plant protection products and cleaning agents in the environment foley et al 2011 stanghellini 2014 attenborough 2020 blok et al 2023 recirculation of drainage solution has the potential to reduce the input of water and nutrients by over 30 and 50 respectively massa et al 2010 grewal et al 2011 recirculation of drainage solution is therefore an important contribution to reaching several of the united nations sustainable development goals zhou et al 2021 the collection of drainage solution is technically simple in soilless cultivation systems therefore total recirculation is easier when using growing media or nutrient solutions than when using soil as rooting environment however recirculation of drainage solution in soilless cultivation systems requires the simultaneous optimization of 16 nutrients present day recirculation systems require a high level of knowledge and skill which is slowing the worldwide introduction of drainage solution recirculation failsafe decision support systems promise to speed the introduction of drainage solution recirculation in some cases though the quality of the input water is too low for recirculation and the profit margins too low to allow pre treating the water blok et al 2023 after the drainage solution is collected it usually needs a correction of imbalances in nutrient ratios before being re used a list of terms used is provided table 1 imbalances are identified as differences between nutrient levels found in the actual root solution and a target root solution imbalances will occur when actual plant uptake deviates from an idealized target plant uptake as in all agriculture nutrient recommendation systems nrss are used to systematically match fertilizer dosing to observations of nutrients in the root environment nrss are also described with the more general term decision support system dss savvas and gruda 2018 gallardo et al 2020 in fig 1 a common recommendation system to deal with such imbalances is shown de kreij et al 1999 fig 1 shows the use of two target nutrient solutions the first is the target root solution which supplies the nutrient ratios and general nutrient level characterized by the electric conductivity ec which allows the plant to take up exactly those nutrients and ratios required for optimal growth the second is the target added solution the target added solution attempts to create exactly the solution the plant needs to take in for optimum growth the reason the target root solution and the target added solution differ is because plant uptake of some nutrients like calcium and magnesium is slower than for others thus nutrients like calcium and magnesium need to be present in the root environment in higher concentrations than in the target solution for better plant uptake sonneveld and voogt 1986 this difference in target root solution composition and target added solution composition is not only important in growing media based cultivation systems but also in water based cultivation systems such as nutrient flow technique or deep flow technique nutrient flow technique nft a cultivation system in which roots are positioned in a layer of running nutrient solution of generally 1 5 cm deep flow technique dft a cultivation system in which roots are hanging in a pond like structure with generally 20 50 cm deep nutrient solution furthermore the root solution is kept at ec levels higher than the ec taken in by the crop to promote some important quality characteristics such as dry matter and sugar content petersen et al 1998 pascale et al 2001 once an imbalance in the actual root solution is found the only way to correct it is changing the added solution to find the proper corrected added solution one needs to decide first how fast or slow the intended correction should result in full restoration of the balance the time needed for a correction to restore the target root solution can be calculated if the number of liters of solution in both the root system and the recirculation system is known fig 2 shows an example for calcium only once the corrections per nutrient are known the target added solution can be changed into an actual added solution for the required period after which a new correction cycle starts a version of this system has been described elsewhere sonneveld et al 1999 for the dutch nrs de kreij et al 1999 the ratio between the nutrients in added solution and root solution has been established in many plant uptake experiments sonneveld and voogt 2009 for many horticultural plant species concentration ranges per nutrient were tested to find the response of the root solution to a change in added solution this resulted in crop specific recipes for target added solutions and target root solutions including crop stage adjustments for added solutions de kreij et al 1999 the drainage solution is usually analyzed because the root solution can be difficult to sample the underlying relations between added solutions and root solutions were validated for drainage percentages between 20 and 40 of the supplied solution and a 14 day duration of corrections de kreij et al 1999 an example of the experimentally established relationship of root solution concentration versus added solution concentration is shown in fig 3 fig 3 shows the change in added solution content which will result in a correction of actual the root solution back to the target root solution for the actual chosen ec data such as in fig 3 served to create the tabulated recommendation system used de kreij et al 1999 feedback by sensors and or modelling is essential to run a system to correct for nutrient imbalances over time sensor feedback is provided daily for supplied irrigation volume drainage volume ec and ph the information on nutrients and nutrient ratios is in practice delivered every 14 days after sending drainage solution samples and sometimes supplied solution samples to a specialized laboratory given that nutrient shortages result in irrevocable damage after 1 5 7 days marcelis et al 2003 there is interest in faster methods including ion specific measurement tools bamsey et al 2012 feedback by models is provided every 5 60 min in commercial greenhouse systems several authors have designed models for automated fertigation in closed soilless culture heinen 2001 silberbush et al 2005 mathieu et al 2006 katsoulas et al 2015 savvas et al 2021 but their use is not common possibly due to the quantity of parameters that must be set a model to forecast the recirculating nutrient solution composition massa et al 2011 uses water uptake and nutrient uptake with nutrient uptake estimated by periodic laboratory analyses of drainage solution samples it is also possible and customary to adjust the added solution composition for crop stage and climate if a target added solution fails to represent the long term plant uptake this may result in nutritional disorders related to over or under supply marschner 2011 such as cation anion or specifically ammonium nitrate driven ph fluctuations haynes 1990 dickson et al 2016 however most target added solutions when combined with a system for feedback correction will prevent such nutritional disorders and ph problems even if the target added solution itself is mildly incorrect i e different from the actual plant uptake the corrections will change the target added solution towards the actual plant uptake this means that over time the average of all the actual added solutions will be an improved target added solution for this particular crop or variety such a converging system is inherently safe from accumulating errors what then is the benefit of more exact targets for added solution or root solution and or more frequent sampling the deviations in the root solution in this study are not large enough to cause nutrient deficiencies or toxicities the reason to dedicate research to such relatively small deviations is because ion uptake requires energy and more energy is required when the root solution ratios deviate more from the target root solution ratios poorter et al 1991 albornoz and lieth 2017 the plant can prevent nutrient disorders by spending energy on the additional uptake of individual nutrients rewald et al 2016 but only for so long as the resulting higher transport rate to the root meets the demand blok et al 2017 when the supply rate remains below the plant demand long enough the root environment is depleted and clear nutrient disorders emerge our objectives are a to quantify deviations in actual root solution as compared to the target root solution b to estimate what part of deviations between actual root solution and target root solution can be avoided with practical measures our hypothesis is that practical measures to reduce deviations in actual root solution can be based on above ground climate factors such as light temperature and carbon dioxide concentration 2 materials and methods 2 1 the data collection the tabulated dutch nrs de kreij et al 1999 was used in combination with a balance system that registered fertigation data to allow us to monitor composition changes in the root solution over time a data set from a commercial grower in the venlo area was used 51 43 n 6 12 e the crop was 5 ha cherry tomato cultivar sassari rijk zwaan fijnaart the netherlands the crop was grown in a state of the art venlo type glass house using stone wool slabs as growing medium with heating carbon dioxide and assimilation light 22 24 c 700 ppm co2 and 100 150 µmol m 2 s 1 par by high pressure sodium lamps observation ran from 12 feb 2011 03 oct 2011 table 2 shows setpoint data for climate and fertigation parameters per crop stage as used in the nrs 2 2 water and nutrient balance the nutrient balance data for a single cultivation company includes a bi weekly list of actual added solutions root solution analyses received and daily root solution ec in addition a list of daily water volumes supplied drainage volume as well as the capacity of the drainage solution storage is required this data is then resampled to fit time intervals of 1 day for all nutrient nutrients ec and ph and volumes involved the general flow of information mimics the grower s situation table 3 and fig 4 each step in this information flow contains simultaneously water in l m 2 d 1 nutrient load in mmol m 2 d 1 and concentration in mmol l 1 this is why in the appendix a there are three columns for every term in fig 4 the flow volume and concentration are measured leaving the nutrient load to be calculated though several steps require the concentration to be calculated by dividing load over volume to calculate the plant uptake of water nutrients and resulting plant uptake concentration the calculations are 1 wateruse watersupply waterdrain in which wateruse in lˑm 2 the amount used for transpiration evaporation and leakage watersupply in lˑm 2the amount supplied to the plants by irrigation waterdrain in lˑm 2the amount received back from the plants after irrigation 2 nutrientuse nutrientsupply nutrientdrain in which nutrientuse in mmolˑm 2 the amount used for growth and leakage losses nutrientsupply in mmolˑm 2the amount supplied to the plants by irrigation nutrientdrain in mmolˑm 2the amount received back from the plants note that nutrients are measured as load rather than using concentration because concentration is known and load not concentration to nutrient load is calculated using 3 nutrientuse wateruse concentrationuse 4 nutrientsupply watersupply concentrationsupply 5 nutrientdrain waterdrain concentrationdrain in which concentrationuse in mmolˑl 1is the amount for growth and losses concentrationsupply in mmolˑl 1is the amount supplied to the plants concentrationdrain in mmolˑl 1is the amount received back from the plants in this system the concentrationuse must be calculated indirectly 6 concentrationuse nutrientsupply nutrientdrain watersupply waterdrain 2 2 1 the extended balance registration to find missing data once sufficient data was gathered the grower s data provided feedback on parameters in the nrs table 4 1 the average plant nutrient uptake of the tomato crop for any period of time in the data was calculated from the derived daily data this average uptake per nutrient was then used to calibrate the target added solution ec the resulting solution is a company and time specific estimate for the target added solution table 5 this procedure may be valuable for identifying varieties which differ in their uptake pattern from the standard target added solution 2 the relationship between the concentration in the added solution and the concentration in the root solution was calculated this relationship is compared to the relationship used in the nrs the relationship in the nrs is used to find the magnitude of corrections in the added solution as shown in fig 3 2 2 2 adding and processing climate data daily radiation sum data was recorded and the correlation between individual nutrient uptake and radiation was calculated the correlations could be made crop stage specific by specifying time intervals which correspond to the crop stages within the nrs climate parameters other than radiation could also have been selected for similar purposes 2 3 quantification of deviations the deviations between the plant uptake load and the supplied solution load were quantified by calculating the daily standard deviation as the square root of the daily variance used in the appendix a the standard deviation was corrected for the difference in average ec of plant uptake solution and the supplied solution 2 4 simulations to reduce deviations of fertigation data in the balance calculation drainage solution analyses are measured and plant uptake is the result when sufficient data is gathered it is possible to enter the balance into a model the previously established plant uptakes are used as measurement to make the drainage solution analysis dynamic balanced it is then possible to calculate what would happen if the added solution was changed in a different way assuming plant uptake was unaffected this approach was used to change the added solution using the previously found correlation between plant uptake ec and radiation this allowed the calculation of a supplied solution ec to be influenced by anticipated radiation after completing this simulation the standard deviations between the plant uptake load and the supplied solution load were again quantified and compared with the original situation 3 results 3 1 water and nutrient balance data both water and nutrient supply over the whole season surpass the plant needs generously table 4 the drainage is 35 of the supply by volume 4 4 lˑm 2ˑd 1 supply versus 2 8 lˑm 2ˑd 1 plant uptake to compare solutions composed of ions of different valences all solutions with multiple ions are expressed in mmol of ion charge when using mmol of charge in nutrient supply the drainage load is 56 of the supply load 129 mmolˑm 2ˑd 1 supply versus 56 8 mmolˑm 2ˑd 1 plant uptake combining the water and nutrient flows renders a supply ec of 3 0 dsˑm 1 and a plant uptake ec of 2 0 dsˑm 1 the 2 0 dsˑm 1 plant uptake ec is 40 higher than the 1 6 dsˑm 1 of the added solution ec de kreij et al 1999 when we compare the calculated plant uptake over the whole season and the target added solution at equal ec table 5 we find values within 5 of the target added solution for calcium and sulphate about 30 lower for nitrate and 40 lower for phosphate while the uptake is 25 higher for potassium and magnesium and 75 lower for ammonium table 5 the target added solution found with the grower s balance is therefore not very close to the target added solution of the nrs de kreij et al 1999 3 2 quantified deviations we assume it is advantageous if the ratios of nutrients in the supplied solution load and the ratios of nutrients in the plant uptake load follow each other smoothly to keep the energy costs of active ion uptake low however fig 5 indicates this is not the case as both values fluctuate with poor correlation the deviations were quantified by calculating the daily standard deviation between the supplied solution load and the plant uptake load expressed in mmol of ion charges the standard deviation in ion charges is 84 5 mmolˑm 2 as the supplied solution load is 56 larger than the plant uptake load there is a systematic difference between supplied solution load and plant uptake load once the systematic difference is removed the standard deviation in ion charges reduces to 43 3 mmolˑm 2 table 6 3 3 simulated deviations using the per day and per nutrient data from the water and nutrient balance correlations between daily radiation sum and daily uptake per nutrient were put in graphs appendix a this was also done for the relation between daily radiation and the plant uptake ec expressed in mmol of ion charges this relation was found to be highly correlated therefore it is possible to use a single value to describe the reaction of plant uptake to radiation sum by dividing the radiation sum per day by the plant uptake load in mmol of ion charges per day a simple load uptake constant is found of 0 26 mjˑm 2ˑmmol 1 the supplied solution ec is now replaced with a prediction based on the load uptake constant the actual radiation and the supplied water volume table 6 it is however necessary to use a constant of 0 12 mjˑm 2ˑmmol 1 to allow for a drainage load of about 56 as before this reduces the standard deviation in ion charges from 43 3 to 38 3 mmolˑm 2 if we allow for a load drainage of 35 by increasing the load uptake constant to 17 mjˑm 2ˑmmol 1 the standard deviation in ion charges decreases to 24 4 mmolˑm 2 however the supply ec then drops to the level of the plant uptake ec 2 1 dsˑm 1 3 3 1 estimates for assimilate costs for nutrient uptake directly measuring energy used or heat produced by roots is difficult the same applies for more indirect measurements like the energy carrier atp sugars or carbon dioxide thus oxygen consumption became an indirect measurement for energy use and assimilate consumption under aerobic circumstances energy is produced by oxidizing glucose in which one mole of glucose uses six moles of oxygen for energy consumption the relatively large portion of oxygen roots dedicate for ion uptake versus oxygen use for maintenance and growth makes it possible to measure effects of nutrient changes the energy cost of ion uptake is reported as 0 5 molˑmol 1 o2 per ion nitrate and 0 25 molˑmol 1 o2 per cation cannell and thornley 2000 table 7 using data from the cherry tomato cultivation nutrient plant uptake extended to a one year period is expressed in mmol ion charges about 40 mmolˑl 1 in 800 lˑm 2ˑy 1 which is about 32 000 mmolˑm 2ˑy 1 which is 32 molˑm 2ˑy 1 table 8 this allows us to calculate 12 molˑm 2ˑy 1 of oxygen needed for ion uptake table 8 to interpret the 12 molˑm 2ˑy 1 of oxygen needed for ion uptake the value needs to be compared to the total oxygen use by the root system in molˑm 2ˑy 1 the total oxygen use is based on a maximum use of 2 mgˑg 1ˑh 1 for fresh root mass morard et al 2000 bar yosef and lieth 2013 blok and gérard 2013 this can be recalculated into a root oxygen consumption of 71 molˑm 2ˑy 1 table 8 the amount of oxygen used for ion uptake is therefore about 17 of the total root oxygen consumption 4 discussion 4 1 water and nutrient balance the plant uptake ec in this 2011 experiment was 40 higher than the plant uptake ecs that the 1999 recommendation system was based upon de kreij et al 1999 this is believed to reflect a higher production level in 2011 than in 1999 partly related to the 100 150 µmol m 2 s 1 of assimilation light used on this crop not used in 1999 furthermore the cherry type tomato used in 2011 was not yet available in 1999 in the discussion of the extended balance registration 4 1 2 we will see how the registered nutrient uptake indeed differs from the expected target added solution as explained in the introduction this difference does not affect the proper functioning of the nrs as the system converges towards the actual plant uptake by design the drainage in volume and load 35 respectively 56 is high but as almost all drainage solution is recirculated there is no undesired emission of water or nutrients furthermore the amount of drainage must surpass 20 to even out differences between individual plants and growth differences caused by inhomogeneity in microclimate the drainage load cannot be reduced without lowering the root solution ec which could decrease production quality ehret and ho 1986 a possible way to proceed is to lower the drainage volume and drainage load proportionally by maintaining the root solution and drainage ec 4 1 1 the role of nutrient recommendation systems the choice for the dutch recommendation system offers the advantage of being based on experimental data de kreij et al 1999 sonneveld and voogt 2009 but other systems are also in practical use 1 compensation of the drain solution re use by bringing it back to the target root solution composition this is perhaps the most common system in global use it results in a constant ratio of nutrients in the supply solution whereas the dutch system oversupplies undersupplies those nutrients lacking or in excess in the actual root solution this system will add what the plants take in but deviations in the root solution must be on average larger than when based on measured relations between root solution deviations and changes in added solution 2 maintaining a set composition of the added solution regardless of the fluctuations in the root solution this system is easy to operate but may result in severe and long lasting depletion or accumulation problems when the actual plant uptake differs from the plant uptake expected based on the target root solution system 2 works well in free drainage situations or with frequent discharge some growers improve the system for recirculation by adding reducing the individual nutrients in excess or lacking in the root solution analyses based on gut feeling and experience which results in an approximation of system 1 more generally speaking the dutch system minimizes fluctuations in nutrient ratios in the root solution by accepting larger deviations in nutrient ratios within the supplied solution in contrast systems 1 and 2 attempt to keep nutrient ratios within the supplied solution stable by accepting larger deviations in nutrient ratios within the root solution the relationship between the observed deviation in root solution composition and the required adaptation in the added solution is still based on experiments de kreij et al 1999 or on experience there is room for a more accurate approach which calculates the load of individual nutrients present in the root environment plus drain collection system i e the resident volume and then calculates how long it takes for a chosen over supply in the irrigation load to bring the actual root solution back to the target root solution fig 2 the grower can then choose to correct the deviation faster but allowing for a large adaptation of the added solution alternatively the grower can choose to correct the deviation slower in which case the adaptation of the added solution is smaller such an approach would also circumvent the implicit assumptions in the dutch recommendation system which are fixed ratios for reuse and drainage of about 30 of the supplied volume and about 15 lˑm 2 of resident volume this was in line with the early cultivation systems with rooting media slabs which used one drainage solution analysis every 14 days and a single a and b tank with stock solution lasting 3 20 days obviously a more versatile recommendation system will better serve cultivation systems with high drainage percentages such as in nft or overhead irrigation of container plants free choice for drainage percentage and resident system volume will also serve cultivation systems with large resident volumes of nutrient solution such as in dft systems or very small resident volumes such as modern tomato crops with a v system of planting in the balance sheet we used mmol of ion charges to compare solutions composed of ions of different valences this also enabled us to use the relation between ec and the amount of ion charges per litre to convert between measurement types 1 0 dsˑm 1 was taken to be equivalent to 10 mmolˑl 1 of ion charge appendix a a more accurate method would use a method which uses activities of each specific ion for each general ec level mcneal et al 1970 nrss are a practical answer to many drawbacks of more physiologically oriented approaches le bot et al 1998 it does however implicitly assume physiological processes which are still debated such as ion uptake proportional to the outside concentration le deunff et al 2016 the basic assumptions of the nrss discussed here are related to target added solution and target root solution these are plant specific solutions characterized by fixed ratios between the individual nutrients steiner 1961 steiner 1966 these ratio recipes still must be measured for each plant species separately eventually physiologists may supply more in depth explanations for the ratios in the target added solution as well as for the per species relation between target added solution and target root solution 4 1 2 the extended balance registration and the target added solution the registered plant uptakes of individual nutrients still differed considerably from the target added solution table 5 the higher uptake concentration of potassium was expected as the cherry type of tomato is known to take in relatively more potassium than round type tomatoes the lower uptake concentration of ammonium is expected as the ammonium was cut back by the grower to prevent a ph drop in the rooting medium horchani et al 2010 dickson et al 2016 the higher uptake concentration of magnesium is not explained the lower values for nitrate and phosphorous uptake concentration in combination with the on average higher uptake concentration of cations mean the plant was using more cation charges than anion charges to maintain electro neutrality the plant had to take in other anions or excrete cations with hydrogen ion excretion as the most likely mechanism fisher et al 2014 this justifies the grower s aversion to the use of ammonium which would induce further acidification of the root solution based on the derived plant uptakes a more accurate target added solution could be modified to contain about 4 mmolˑl 1 extra potassium sulphate and 0 8 mmolˑl 1 magnesium sulphate this could lead to a too high uptake of those nutrients which the plant takes in more readily for this reason the nrs maintains corrections only for a set period or quantity of nutrient supply 4 1 3 the addition of climate data when using actual climate data the quality of the forecast will be incidentally lower than when using the climate data after the fact as used here in the model in this case the grower did reduce the ec with radiation level albeit rather conservatively fig 5 this makes sense because plant water uptake and plant nutrient uptake are different processes le bot et al 1998 marcelis et al 2003 which are preferably evaluated independently to arrive at an acceptable fertigation schedule plant water uptake has been studied in detail and allows automated systems to either predict plant water uptake with simple models de graaf and esmeijer 1998 or single factor effects of radiation temperature vapor pressure deficit wind velocity or carbon dioxide levels stanghellini et al 2019 and adjust the quantities supplied with system feedback by measuring the drainage returned van iersel et al 2013 plant nutrient uptake sometimes called plant uptake load has been used in combination with plant water uptake to balance supply and drainage solution nutrient ratios gallardo et al 2009 balendonck 2011 stanghellini et al 2019 in their approach the plant uptake concentration is the result of dividing plant nutrient uptake by plant water uptake however most commercial systems use only a water uptake model and for nutrient load rely on regular corrections based on ec ph and 14 day drainage solution analyses problems of not separating water uptake and nutrient uptake become apparent when plant production increases over time through factors such as an increased use of assimilation light selection of new plant varieties or carbon dioxide supplementation le bot et al 1998 gorbe and calatayud 2010 all such production increases result in higher nutrient uptakes but likely result in less than proportional increases or even decreases in water use this suggests the accuracy of the adaptations could be improved by a including more climate factors in the correlations to predict a better correction of the added solution and b splitting the corrections in by transpiration volume and nutrient load quantity 4 2 the quantification and minimization of deviations in supplied solution the analysis of standard deviations shows that the variation between the supply load and plant uptake load in mmol of ion charges is large 43 3 mmolˑm 2 and can be almost halved to 24 4 mmolˑm 2 by using a radiation factor based on the correlation between radiation and uptake load table 7 this indicates the actual nutrient supply as realized by the grower is not yet following radiation very closely the water supply of the grower in contrast is already closely following radiation when we allow the drainage load to be reduced from 56 to 35 the standard deviation between the supply load and plant uptake load is reduced but the drainage ec is also reduced to values too low to produce quality fruits 2 0 dsˑm 1 an acceptable reduction in standard deviation without effect on the drainage ec is possible if the supply volume is minorly reduced to drop the drainage volume from 35 4 to 30 1 the simulation tool is not meant to be used with one load uptake constant i e the ec for all nutrients the reduction of the standard deviation in table 6 can only be a demonstration of the order of magnitude of the decrease in standard deviations which can be expected in practical circumstances the risk of using the ec thereby using the same increase or reduction value for all nutrients is that the deviations of some individual nutrient loads may increase rapidly the deviation between the supplied solution load and plant uptake load was taken as a measure of mismatch in ion uptake the deviation before standardizing also delivers the direction of the mismatch if the summations of over and under supply over time are about equal this indicates the target added solution was about right but if the deviation is consistently one sided it means the target added solution either over or under estimated the actual plant uptake this is an indication that the target added solution needs to be corrected in the analysis the deviation between supplied solution and plant uptake was used this was done for the practical reason that reliable supplied ec levels were available for each day however should ion specific measurement devices become available bamsey et al 2012 it could be effective to include the daily deviations between actual root solution and target root solution 4 2 1 the quantification of energy costs related to deviations in root solution based on data reported for oxygen consumption per nutrient the amount of oxygen use for the recorded plant nutrient uptake was calculated by equating oxygen use with energy and assimilate use it was found that about 17 of oxygen used by the root is spent on nutrient uptake table 7 this is far below the 3070 reported based on the use of atp in roots of grass species veen 1980 van der werf et al 1988 poorter et al 1991 the lower value found seems plausible as the cherry tomato crop is selected for high fruit production and the cultivation system ensures a non limiting nutrient supply modelled uptake corrections potentially halved the measured standard deviations which themselves were about 30 of the total nutrient uptake this means the potential savings on energy for nutrient uptake are in the order of 2 4 of the total assimilates sent to the root or 0 5 1 of the total net assimilates is the amount of energy needed for uptake corrections of consequence for production the amount of carbon used for root respiration and growth is assumed to be 25 of the total net assimilated carbon in fast growing species poorter et al 1990 of the 25 assimilates sent to roots 16 is used for respiration including nutrient uptake and 9 for growth poorter et al 1991 if imbalance in the root solution increases the respiration for nutrient uptake and the total carbon available remains the same the above ground growth should decrease by the same proportion thus an increase in root assimilation use of 1 should lower the assimilates available for fruit yield by 1 assuming 70 of above ground assimilates is used for fruit production the yield reduction could be between 1 and 2 for tomato this means energy consequences of nutrient imbalances will be difficult to prove with direct experiments but may be relevant for commercial growing the energy cost for ion uptake was calculated based on several assumptions which still are debatable table 7 bouma and de visser 1993 bouma et al 1996 cannell and thornley 2000 1 the amount of oxygen kj atp or carbon required for the uptake of one mol nutrient is based on a limited number of measurements the measurements involved are quite complicated and require careful execution scheurwater et al 1998 roots are grown in a confined space and the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is measured on line while relative root growth is measured at intervals 2 the energy costs per mol of nutrient uptake are assumed to be independent of the cultivation environment and the relative abundance of other nutrients 3 a sub optimal ratio of a nutrient in the root solution will result in the inevitable uptake of a counter ion which then requires additional uptake energy 4 the amount of assimilates partitioned to the roots was assumed to be 20 25 of the total assimilates but for tomato with a high supply of nutrients this might be closer to the 15 mentioned for the dry mass partitioning to the roots de groot et al 2003 4 3 wider aspects of recirculation of drainage solution soilless growing can be sub divided into substrate based growing and water based growing in substrate based growing 10 50 of the irrigated volume must become drainage solution to flush nutrient imbalances in the root environment caused by site specific differences in plant uptake and site specific differences in irrigation supply raaphorst et al 2014 in water based growing site specific imbalances in the root environment can be corrected by mixing the supplied solution with the root solution much faster than in substrate based growing in practice however some nft systems suffer from accumulation or depletion of specific nutrients over the length of the system puerta et al 2007 while dft systems with dense root growth may encounter problems to evenly mix the root solution over the pond area and over pond depth shi et al 2007 in substrate based growing and nft the supplied solution consists of the added solution plus the recirculated drainage solution the recirculated drainage solution adds a large part of the nutrient load usually over 50 to realize the proper ec for quality in dft the added and supplied solution are the same as there is no separate drainage solution to recirculate the model as used here assumes plant uptake is explained by radiation and the target actual solution the relative level of an individual nutrient on the root surface is also a factor and even a factor which could eventually be modelled le deunff et al 2016 if the level of an nutrient such as potassium is higher than the target value then some extra uptake will result sometimes called luxurious consumption the relationship between the extra uptake and the surplus above the target value can be established and used in a more general version of the model 4 4 conclusions the objective to quantify deviations in actual root solution as compared to the target root solution proved possible calculating daily balances allowed the quantification of mild nutrient imbalances before risking nutrient deficiencies it was also possible to check on the recommended target added solutions and to find relationships between radiation and uptake of individual nutrients the second objective was to estimate what part of deviations in actual root solution can be avoided with practical measures simulations showed deviations in the nutrient balance can be halved by using a combination of drainage volume percentage supply ec variance and correlations of supplied solution ec with radiation forecast these parameters are already available in practice and can be recalculated with little additional effort as the ec is the summation of the contributions of individual nutrients it is expected using the individual nutrient loads rather than the ec will allow a further reduction of deviation however we did not validate that the use of individual nutrient data reduces or further reduces the deviations in nutrient ratios as radiation is the main but not the only factor influencing transpiration and growth there is room for further research using multiple climate factors in addition to radiation the hypothesis was that practical measures can reduce deviations in actual root solution when these measures are based on above ground climate factors such as light temperature and carbon dioxide this hypothesis was proven for the combination drainage percentage supply ec and the correlation supplied ec radiation it was not extended to other climate factors related to growth the correlations between single nutrients and radiation were also measured but these relationships were not yet
