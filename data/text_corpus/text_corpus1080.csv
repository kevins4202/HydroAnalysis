5400,surface soil under various land uses covers plays an important pool of n discharge in a watershed soil temperature and moisture drive soil n cycling especially important for the watersheds with anthropogenic manipulations not all of the ongoing process based models consider topographic factors of known importance when simulating soil moisture but most of them simulate soil temperature typically derived from empirical relations with air temperature these assumptions might lead to underestimate the n discharge in the watersheds this study employed an energy balanced soil temperature module and a slope introduced soil moisture module in coupling with a conceptual model of hydro bio geochemical process based watershed life cycle analysis i e the watershed inorganic nitrogen dynamic wind to simulate soil n cycling across forest land farmland and urban bare land in an urbanizing watershed in southern china the model was calibrated and validated by two individual survey events in 2013 and 2016 17 respectively using moisture and inorganic n in surface soil 0 10 cm of the watershed with determination coefficients r2 above 0 7 significantly higher soil temperature arose when using the energy balanced module in comparison to the air temperature module meanwhile soil moisture declining with land slope became significant above 15 steepness estimates of surface soil n cycling across all land uses were significantly altered importantly land uses determined the extents of their alterations the wind provides insights into drivers of hot spot hot moment hydro bio geochemical processes of soil inorganic n for land uses in the watershed more generally as the findings inform a better constraint of parameters in other physics based watershed scale water quality models they also potentially directly contribute to improved strategies for sustainable management of inorganic n discharges under the predicted climate changes keywords inorganic n dynamics surface soil dynamic life cycle analysis soil moisture land use type watershed 1 introduction nitrogen n is one of the essential elements stabilizing natural ecosystems vitousek and howarth 1991 human activities however have dramatically altered the global n cycle with increasing n loads in the environment galloway and cowling 2002 nitrogen in surface soil of various land use types serves as a source of n loading in the aquatic ecosystem of a watershed gao et al 2013 excess n from surface soil with increasing anthropogenic n inputs e g extensive n deposition and n fertilization have caused serious ecological and environmental problems in watersheds including greenhouse gas emission congreves et al 2016 and water eutrophication kaushal et al 2011 threatening the watershed sustainability and eventually putting human health at risk the n source sink complexity in a watershed can be elaborated by water confluence via integrating spatiotemporal distribution of n loading hydrological regime soil physicochemical properties and biogeochemical processes lin et al 2018 understanding how to best manipulate the n source sink relationship is of considerable concern for water quality and watershed sustainable management worldwide congreves et al 2016 besides n substrates n biogeochemical processes are highly regulated by environmental abiotic factors such as soil temperature and moisture yu and ehrenfeld 2010 ehrenfeld and yu 2012 ahmed et al 2019 morugan coronado et al 2019 for example potentials of biological n fixation and denitrification in orchard soils were improved by increased soil moisture in the proximity of the dripping irrigation morugan coronado et al 2019 soil moisture in turn has a dynamic relationship with soil temperature partitioning energy and radiation that reach land surface berg et al 2014 hauser et al 2016 surface soil moisture is on the other side highly influenced by land slope qiu et al 2001 which determines the routing of water either infiltrating the soil profile or as surface runoff during rainfall or irrigation events in other words the land slope changes soil moisture and runoff hydrological regime simultaneously stieglitz et al 2003 vaezi et al 2017 steep topography can result in rapid surface runoff and considerable subsurface drainage which lead to substantial n loss into watershed aquatic ecosystems wu et al 2018 numerous process based models have been used to track n dynamics at a watershed scale including the agricultural nonpoint source pollution agnps annagnps li et al 2015 the soil water plant drainage systems swpd matinzadeh et al 2017 the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 the model of acidification of groundwater in catchments magic oulehle et al 2012 and the integrated nitrogen in catchments inca wade et al 2002 among them soil n biogeochemical processes are highly considered and incorporated with distributed hydrological models such as swat inca and annagnps the existing watershed n dynamic models provide comprehensive simulations on water and n movements but simplify soil n biogeochemical processes in various ways such as annagnps only including mineralization and denitrification processes and inca and swat with mineralization nitrification and denitrification processes costa et al 2020 meanwhile soil temperature and moisture are critical factors of soil n biogeochemical processes agehara and warncke 2005 butterbach bahl et al 2013 as well as hydrological processes nanda et al 2019 simulations on soil temperature and moisture are diverse among these existing models as well except the swat and annagnps most of the watershed n dynamic models seldom consider the indirect effect of land slope on soil moisture not even on associated n dynamic processes although its effect on hydrological regime has been well recognized wade et al 2002 soil temperature however is included in most of the process based models for soil hydro thermal processes soil mass transportation soil structure and soil microbes mediating n processes agehara and warncke 2005 butterbach bahl et al 2013 costa et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 given constraints of scaling up field observations tempo spatially to a watershed scale soil temperature has often been simulated by a variety of empirical approaches mainly using air temperature bai et al 2014 huang et al 2018a for instance inca uses a sine function of air temperature and average annual temperature amplitude to simulation soil temperature and swat uses weighting functions based on average annual air temperature and current day s soil surface temperature costa et al 2020 wade et al 2002 kwon and koo 2017 found that surface soil temperature was simultaneously determined by air temperature and solar radiation and the air temperature only empirical models led to soil temperature consistently lower than air temperature however the field measurement found that surface soil temperature was higher than the air temperature during the daylight time qi et al 2019 energy balance models with solar radiation further revealed that soil temperature is correlated to soil moisture and heat flux herb et al 2008 kettridge and baird 2008 on the other side land use cover type determines an intensity of solar radiation to reach surface soil herb et al 2008 therefore the air temperature based simulation might lead to underestimates of surface soil temperature in turn which might further impede the accuracy of the above mentioned various models in simulating n cycling in a watershed with mixed land use cover as fundamental parameters in controlling watershed n cycling accuracy of soil temperature and soil moisture simulations is of fundamental importance for the model output this study developed a slope introduced soil moisture module and an energy balanced soil temperature module to integrate a watershed inorganic n dynamic wind model materialized from the hydro bio geo chemical process based lca conceptual model lin et al 2018 the wind model was calibrated and validated by two field survey events in 2013 and 2016 2017 respectively in an urbanizing watershed in xiamen southeastern china with the energy balanced soil temperature and the slope introduced soil moisture the wind model is hypothesized to delineate differences of n cycling processes across various land use cover types i e forest farmland and urban bare land in the studied watershed except their differences from the empirical air temperature based soil temperature routine and non slope introduced soil moisture i e the slope at 0 meanwhile rates of the n cycling processes in surface soil from the studied watershed were freshly measured by a consecutive n transformation approach i e mineralization nitrification and denitrification using urea as the only n source instead of the traditional and individual substrate enriched potential methods it assumed to provide real parameters for the simulations findings from this study will contribute strategies and tools for sustainable watershed n cycle via manipulating hot spot hot moment of n source sink relationships groffman et al 2002 to mitigate against their adverse effects under the predicted global warming 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region an urbanizing watershed the bantou reservoir watershed in jimei district xiamen southeastern china was

in a watershed two sampling events of surface soil 0 10 cm were undertaken during march april 2013 and november 2016 march 2017 respectively in total 137 sites were sampled from patches of the three land use types 25 surface soil samples from forest land 49 surface soil samples from farmland and 63 surface soil samples from urban bare land for each sampling event fig 1 at each site five samples were taken from a 10 m 10 m quadrate and mixed as one composite soil sample one cutting ring sample for bulk density measurement was randomly selected from the quadrate at each site all samples were sealed in ziploc polyethylene bags and transported to the laboratory on ice each composite soil sample was divided into three subsamples one was passed through a mesh 10 sieve and oven dried at 105 c to reach a constant weight for soil moisture measurement one passed through the mesh 10 sieve to measured rates of microbial n transformation processes denitrification nitrification and mineralization in a sealed microcosm incubation system with helium substitution to nitrogen in headspace the remaining subsample was air dried and passed through the mesh 10 and mesh 100 sieve for chemical analyses

analyzer vario max elementar gmbh germany nitrate no3 n and ammonium nh4 n were measured in filtrates through a 0 45 μm membrane filter after an extraction with 2 m kcl for one hour reciprocatory shaking using a flow injection analyzer fia qc5000 lachat usa the contents of soil nh4 n and no3 n were calculated as mg n per kg oven dried soil and then converted into kg km 2 with soil bulk density the microbial n transformation rates were measured based on aerobic incubation of 10 g homogenized field moisture soil samples in a sealed air water soil microcosm headspace of the microcosm was vacuumed and flushed 3 times with pure helium gas one milliliter of urea was injected into each vacuumed microcosm to reach the n content at 1 mg n per microcosm and an equal volume of deionized water

2018 the wind model simulated daily changes in inorganic n nh4 n and no3 n dynamics in surface soil under three land uses forest farmland and urban bare land uses briefly external inputs of soil inorganic n include atmospheric deposition lightning n2 fixation and fertilization while internal transformations of soil n are assumed mostly as mineralization of organic n into nh4 which is thereafter taken up by plants and lost via nh3 volatilization surface runoff and infiltration or oxidized into no3 through nitrification under aerobic condition no3 can be also taken up by plants exported via surface runoff and infiltration to surface and ground water or returned to the atmosphere by denitrifiers under hypoxic or anaerobic condition fig 2 mathematical equations of these

2 5 model calibration and validation for both configurations of the wind model the parameter sets consisting of 12 parameters for soil water balances and 22 parameters for soil inorganic n dynamic balances were manually calibrated and validated against the soil measurement data from 2013 and 2016 2017 respectively table s2 the parameters plant potential factor model coefficient of runoff

analysis data were transformed using a box cox method to meet the normality using shapiro wilk test the t test was employed to explore statistical significance of differences in daily surface soil temperature between entemp and airtemp and daily inorganic n pool in surface soil between the two soil temperature simulations in the period of 2013 2017 one way analysis of variance anova was carried out for soil moisture and inorganic n pool in surface soil along a land slope gradient of 0 30 for each land use type with tukey s post hoc test significance level alpha 0 05 while n way anova was applied to testify effects of land use types and the land slope gradient significance level alpha 0 05 multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the contributions of soil moisture and

and the slope introduced daily soil moisture smoist a median slope at 15 for forest land and 5 for farmland and urban bare land respectively module demonstrated promising performance fig 3 upper with better fitness of the validations red line all f values above 1 6 and slight small aic values for inorganic n pools in surface soil than the ones with the air temperature based daily soil temperature airtemp and soil moisture at slope of 0 nsmoist black line f values ranging from 1 063 to 1 669 and slight large aic values both inorganic n forms nh4 n or no3 n in the three land use types showed the same trend evident difference between combined daily soil temperature and soil moisture was found for nh4 n in farmland and for no3 n in urban bare land fig 3 upper suggesting inorganic n cycling in different land use types might have differing sensitive processes to soil temperature and moisture the slope introduced soil moisture module also had good validation fitness for surface soil moisture

37 37 versus 26 57 while the farm land had similar fitness f 1 55 and aic 31 4 fig 3 lower suggesting that land use cover and topological condition might influence soil moisture 3 2 slope effect on soil moisture and inorganic n pools in surface soil of various land use types the three land use types showed a similar declining pattern of daily soil moisture under daily rainfall in 2013 2017 along the land slope gradient of 0 to 30 simulated by the slope introduced soil moisture module smoist fig 4 upper the daily soil moisture declines with the land slope became significant when daily rainfall volume above 50 mm and the land slope above 15 urban bare land use even significantly above 10 fig 4 upper according to anova with tukey s post hoc test p 0 05 under the maximum daily rainfall 173 mm of 2013 2017 the daily soil moisture declined with land slope from 65 0 10 to 41 3 mm 30 for forest land from 64 7 0 to 34 5 mm 30 for farmland and from 54 8 0 to 24 4 mm 30 for urban bare land fig 4 upper however the daily soil moisture without rainfall was relatively stable over the land slope gradient i e soil moisture of forest land and farmland consistently at 13 1 mm and 10 6 mm respectively while urban bare land had a relatively wide range of soil moisture of 13 8 0 11 0 30 mm fig 4 upper in response to the slope introduced soil moisture change inorganic n pools in surface soil showed significant declines with increasing soil moisture but varied with land use type and inorganic n form fig 4 lower a steep decline of daily inorganic n pools was observed as soil moisture increased from 10 to 40 mm then gradually down when soil moisture above 40 mm for forest land and farmland and above 30 mm for urban bare land similarly the declines of daily inorganic n pools became quick with land slope increasing from 0 to 30 fig 4 lower the decrease in median nh4 n for forest land from 907 kg km 2 0 to 772 kg km 2 30 was greater than for farmland from 756 to 714 kg km 2 and urban bare land from 425 to 335 kg km 2 whereas the decrease in median no3 n for urban bare land from 1323 kg km 2 0 to 1038 kg km 2 30 was greater than forest land from 459 to 399 kg km 2 and farmland from 877 to 802 kg km 2 3 3 differences of soil temperature simulated by entemp and airtemp and its effects on inorganic n pools in surface soil of various land use types surface soil temperature simulated by the energy balanced soil temperature module entemp was significantly higher than when simulated by the air temperature based soil temperature module airtemp in the period of 2013 2017 with the sampling events 1825 days p 0 001 fig 5 upper the increment of surface soil temperature between entemp and airtemp is dependent upon land use type i e surface soil of urban bare land had a greater increment of soil temperature than those of farmland and forest land the median increments between entemp and airtemp were 2 c for forest land 5 c for farmland and 6 c for urban bare land over the period with the increase of soil temperature entemp versus airtemp at the median slope of each land use type as above mentioned the simulated inorganic n pools in surface soil were significantly but differently shifted by land use type in the period of 2013 2017 both nh4 n and no3 n pool sizes were significantly increased in surface soil of forest land and urban bare land but declined in surface soil of farmland with fertilization over the period with entemp versus airtemp 1825 days p 0 001 fig 5 lower the median increment of nh4 n pool size between entemp and airtemp was 2 3 times greater in farmland 148 kg km 2 than in the forest land 50 kg km 2 and urban bare land 68 kg km 2 whereas the median increment of no3 n pool size was the greatest in urban bare land 235 kg km 2 which was almost 12 times higher than in the forest land 19 kg km 2 and farmland 20 kg km 2 3 4 nitrogen cycling in surface soil under various land use types of the studied watershed simulated by the wind model with entemp and smoist modules differences in moisture temperature inorganic n pool nh4 n and no3 n multi process rates of n cycling and daily n losses in surface soil of the three land use types in the studied watershed were consecutively simulated in the period of 2013 2017 by the wind model with entemp and smoist modules fig 6 the slope for the smoist simulation used the median value of each land use type in the watershed i e 15 for forest land 5 for both farmland and urban bare land the daily no3 n pool in surface soil median at 1318 kg n km 2 was consistently and remarkably greater than the daily nh4 n pool median at 423 kg n km 2 in the urban bare land 1825 days p 0 001 while the forest land had a reverse pattern with a nearly double daily pool size of nh4 n median at 875 kg n km 2 as that of daily no3 n pool median at 446 kg n km 2 in surface soil 1825 days p 0 001 the farmland was balanced with comparative daily pools of nh4 n median at 755 kg n km 2 and no3 n median at 875 kg n km 2 in surface soil meanwhile the urban bare land had the greatest daily no3 n pool in surface soil among the three land use types in the studied watershed daily rates of n cycling processes mineralization nitrification and volatilization were significantly shifted with soil temperature entemp pattern partial r2 ranging from 0 117 to 0 937 and slightly integrated with soil moisture smoist pattern partial r2 ranging from 0 008 to 0 414 1825 days p 0 0001 fig 6 table s3 the farmland with fertilization and cropping practices had the most active and diverse n cycling processes even denitrification which contributed negligibly to n cycling in upland surface soil of forest land and urban bare land daily medians of mineralization nitrification volatilization and denitrification rates in surface soil of the farmland were 68 kg n km 2 day 1 43 kg n km 2 day 1 30 kg n km 2 day 1 and 4 kg n km 2 day 1 respectively daily n cycling in surface soil of forest land was dominated by mineralization median at 57 kg n km 2 day 1 and followed by nitrification median at 16 kg n km 2 day 1 and volatilization median at 8 kg n km 2 day 1 on the other hand daily n cycling in surface soil of urban bare land was integratively dominated by mineralization median at 43 kg n km 2 day 1 and nitrification median at 30 kg n km 2 day 1 1825 days p 0 001 fig 6 surface runoff was the predominant daily n loss pathway from surface soil regardless of land use types with means of 39 kg n km 2 day 1 for forest land 44 kg n km 2 day 1 for farmland and 57 kg n km 2 day 1 for urban bare land fig 6 vegetation uptake was a considerable daily n loss pathway from surface soil of farmland median at 102 kg n km 2 day 1 over 6 times that of forest land median at 17 kg n km 2 day 1 without the vegetation uptake infiltration became a major pathway of daily n loss from surface soil of urban bare land median at 9 kg n km 2 day 1 greater than farmland median at 8 kg n km 2 day 1 and forest land median 6 kg n km 2 day 1 annual n fluxes in surface soil can be classified as input and output for the three land use types in the study watershed fig 7 except fertilization in farmland mineralization contributed a profound nh4 n input to the inorganic n pool of surface soil average annual at 262 kg n ha 1 yr 1 54 2 of annual total inorganic n atin pool for farmland 214 kg n ha 1 yr 1 79 7 of atin pool for forest land and 169 kg n ha 1 yr 1 62 4 of atin pool for urban bare land which significantly differed among the three land use types p 0 001 n 5 fig 7 as the daily mineralization rates mentioned above fig 6 other sources such as no3 n air deposition and n2 lightning fixation were important for inorganic n pool in surface soil of urban bare land 58 4 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 21 5 of atin pool and 21 9 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 8 1 of atin pool respectively but negligible for forest land and farmland 12 2 of atin pool fig 7 average annual output flux of no3 n via surface runoff was considerably high in urban bare land 158 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 58 1 of atin pool significantly greater than farmland 86 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 12 4 of atin pool and forest land 47 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 17 5 of atin pool p 0 001 n 5 fig 7 at the same time surface runoffs also exported nh4 n annually from surface soil of forest land mean of 94 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 34 9 of atin pool significantly less than no3 n output via surface runoff p 0 001 n 5 farmland 75 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 10 8 of atin pool and urban bare land 48 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 17 7 of atin pool which significantly differed among the land use types p 0 05 n 5 on the other hand average annual nh4 n output via nh3 volatilization was significantly greater in surface soil of farm land 107 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 15 6 of atin pool which was over three times of forest land 31 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 11 8 of atin pool and near 6 times of urban bare land 18 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 7 1 of atin pool fig 7 p 0 001 n 5 average annual n loss via denitrification was relatively small in comparison with above mentioned processes 16 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in surface soil of farmland 5 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in surface soil of forest land and 3 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in surface soil of urban bare land respectively which were significantly differentiated among land use types p 0 001 n 5 with vegetation annual plant uptake accounted for 202 kg nh4 n ha 1 yr 1 and 175 kg no3 n ha 1 yr 1 consisting of 36 0 nh4 n and 59 9 no3 n outputs from surface soil of farmland respectively while surface soil n in forest land was taken up by plants annually at 31 kg nh4 n ha 1 yr 1 13 3 of output and 32 kg no3 n ha 1 yr 1 34 6 of output fig 7 4 discussion as hypothesized that nitrogen in surface soil 0 10 cm is actively involved in watershed n cycle the wind model with entemp and smoist modules evidently differentiates the inorganic n pool of surface soil under three land use types not only in speciation and flux but also in process and process based annual contribution to inorganic n cycle figs 6 7 urban bare land was characterized with higher no3 n flux in surface soil and greater no3 n loss via surface runoff by the wind which is coincident to greater no3 n export via surface runoff from urban subwatersheds 2 49 0 35 mg n l 1 than forest ones 1 10 0 45 mg n l 1 in the jiulong river watershed fujian china huang et al 2018b shi et al 2019 also confirmed that inorganic n export to waterways was often enhanced by land use change due to urbanization up to 15 6 mg n l 1 in the wei river watershed northwest china upland agriculture with fertilization also exported considerable no3 n in surface water with the wind simulation in the studied watershed farmland with fertilization mainly agricultural uplands had a comparable pool size between no3 n and nh4 n medians at 875 and 755 kg n ha 1 in 2013 2017 respectively but with considerable no3 n loss via surface runoff from its surface soil averagely 86 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 12 4 of atin pool figs 6 7 it is comparable but greater than no3 n loss via surface runoff in baltimore lter watershed usa where average output at 39 kg n ha 1 yr 1 was observed kaushal et al 2008 considerable surface runoff losses of nh4 n from surface soil of agricultural land have also been observed 2 87 mg n l 1 in an agricultural subwatershed heidingzi of the songhua river jilin province china zhao et al 2017 0 53 0 6 mg n l 1 in agricultural subwatersheds of jiulong river fujian province china huang et al 2018b and 1 8 mg n l 1 in an agricultural catchment of the lake poyang watershed jiangxi province china tang et al 2008 the simulation in the studied watershed interestingly indicated that despite surface soil of farmland and forest land having comparable daily nh4 n pool sizes 1825 day medians of 755 kg n km 2 and 875 kg n km 2 respectively yet farmland had less nh4 n loss via surface runoff at 75 kg n ha 1 yr 1 10 8 of atin pool than forest land 94 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 34 9 of atin pool averages of 1825 days figs 6 7 this was double the flux from urban bare land we observed that inorganic n in stream water of the studied watershed was dominated by nh4 n back to 2012 gao et al 2013 when the watershed with over 45 forest coverage had experienced an escalating urbanization interactions between pools and losses of inorganic n in surface soil are multifactor dependent but mainly driven by microbial processes in soil and soil plant root interface buckeridge and jefferies 2007 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 most process based soil n cycling models fixed the microbial process rates or were considered only as a parameter li et al 2000 arnold et al 2012 oulehle et al 2012 in this study a new approach of measuring rates of soil n processes was employed and enable to provide real process based simulation for n cycling in surface soil under various land use types especially for denitrification including both n2 and n2o fluxes fig 6 with the wind model a clear pattern differed among three land use types in the period of 2013 2017 i e daily n cycling in farmland surface soil predominantly driven by mineralization nitrification and volatilization while daily soil n cycling was dominated by mineralization for forest land and by both mineralization and nitrification for urban bare land fig 6 the simulated mineralization rates in surface soil of the studied watershed a subtropical zone were comparable to the rates in agricultural lands of southwestern spain vazquez et al 2019 in the 65 arable cropping field experiments in france clivot et al 2017 and in forest lands in alberta canada lang et al 2019 and in subtropical australia zhang et al 2018 table 2 meanwhile net soil nitrification rate in farmland by the wind simulation in this study ranged from 8 36 to 116 96 kg n km 2 day 1 equivalent to 0 10 0 88 mg n kg 1 day 1 comparable to the rates of paddy soils 0 36 0 48 mg n kg 1 day 1 in jiangxi china yang et al 2018 however the simulated nitrification rate in surface soils of forest and urban bare lands was less than rates of corresponding land uses in minhang district shanghai china yan et al 2019 and in archipelago japan urakawa et al 2015 given that net denitrification rate was calculated by the sum of n2 n2o n in this study the simulated net denitrification rate in surface soil of urban bare land and forest land were greater than those in xiamen by measuring n2o n alone urban soil 0 08 0 46 kg n2o n km 2 day 1 xu et al 2019 and guangdong china forest soil 0 0001 0 003 mg kg 1 day 1 tang et al 2019 but the simulated denitrification rate in surface soil of farmland of this study was less than the xiamen agricultural soil 0 6 444 kg n2o n km 2 day 1 xu et al 2019 and paddy soil from yingtan china 0 33 0 08 mg n kg 1 day 1 lan et al 2015 all the comparisons of inorganic n transformation rates were listed in table 2 soil microbial n processes are temperature sensitive guntiñas et al 2012 sun et al 2013 and mostly high temperature within its certain extent promotes n metabolic activity of microbes schimel et al 2004 findings from the wind model that entemp by the energy balance module was greater than airtemp by the air temperature module fig 5 by which soil temperature was consistently lower than air temperature were confirmed by field measurements and simulations from other studies for instance soil temperature higher than air temperature during daylight time qi et al 2019 the increment between entemp and airtemp in this study differed among land use types i e 2 1 0 9 c for forest land 6 3 3 5 c for farmland and 7 2 3 3 c for urban bare land all greater than that in surface soil 5 10 cm of the choptank river watershed maryland usa 0 4 to 1 1 c averagely 0 6 0 2 c qi et al 2019 table 2 on the other hand differences of daily soil temperature among land use types found in this study for example 0 2 to 18 c and averagely 5 c between forest land and urban bare land were coincident to the simulated daily soil surface temperature increments between forest land and bare land in albertville minnesota usa by the energy balance 1 to 12 c herb et al 2008 the temperature increments between vegetated and bare soil is determined by short wave length radiation which is blocked by vegetation herb et al 2008 ni et al 2019 findings from this study and others suggest that the energy balance simulation might be appropriate for surface soil temperature rather than the air temperature module meanwhile the energy balance module for surface soil temperature includes soil moisture as an important factor which is highly determined by soil water holding capacity chen et al 2007 in this study the forest soil had higher moisture than urban bare soil because of larger soil water holding capacity fig 4 on the other hand soil moisture is influenced by land slope a hydrological factor which determines surface runoff and water infiltration under various land coverage table s1 a negative relationship between soil moisture and land slope has been reported in few studies including farmland and forest land of hilly jiegou catchment in shanxi china yu et al 2018 and yan river catchment in shanxi china yang et al 2017 this study also demonstrated the negative relationship between soil moisture and land slope which was influenced by daily rainfall volume fig 4 evapotranspiration by vegetation is another important pathway influencing soil moisture gómez plaza et al 2001 ni et al 2019 the forest land and farmland in this study had greater soil moisture in surface soil than urban bare soil even though forest land had the greatest land slope fig 4 the findings of the present study suggest that soil moisture is strongly determined by water holding capacity instead of land slope and vegetation land cover however land slope critically determined surface runoff and infiltration of water as well as n movement zhu et al 2018 as a model the wind model has its assumptions and limitations the wind only estimates inorganic n dynamics in surface soil and does not touch organic n speciation because most n losses are inorganic forms via surface runoff and surface soil erosion and gaseous emissions therefore organic n cycling and n dynamics in subsurface soil are not considered which is one of the limitations for the wind model meanwhile the slope introduction to soil moisture simulation is specific to a mountainous watershed or catchment as this study explored that the slope effect on soil moisture and associated n transformation becomes evident at a steepness above 15 and varies by vegetation covers fig 3 it suggests that in a flat watershed or catchment the wind might have similar estimates as other models which consider solar radiation for soil moisture simulation at last the current study successfully testified the wind model differentiating the land use types on inorganic n cycling processes but scaling these results up to a watershed or catchment should considered more aspects of various land use patches such as exposure and length of slope and inter and intra drainage networks in short the wind model also requires a conditional application as other models 5 conclusions land use type shifts soil n cycling due to its effects on altering soil temperature and moisture for an urbanizing case study watershed the wind model which included an energy balanced soil temperature module entemp and slope introduced soil moisture module smoist clearly illustrated the differences of inorganic n pools and n transformation rates and pathways in surface soil under three land uses figs 6 7 influences of soil temperature soil moisture and land slope on inorganic n pools were also testified and clarified using the wind model for forest land farmland and urban bare land figs 4 5 besides giving better simulation on watershed n cycling findings from the modelling will assist strategies for watershed n management under climate changes although some uncertainties should be considered for this study hopefully these findings of the wind might also be useful to constrain parameterization of swat and agnps and the other catchment nutrient models such as that the energy balanced simulation might be appropriate for surface soil temperature rather than the air temperature module credit authorship contribution statement xiaodan lin software validation formal analysis

5400,surface soil under various land uses covers plays an important pool of n discharge in a watershed soil temperature and moisture drive soil n cycling especially important for the watersheds with anthropogenic manipulations not all of the ongoing process based models consider topographic factors of known importance when simulating soil moisture but most of them simulate soil temperature typically derived from empirical relations with air temperature these assumptions might lead to underestimate the n discharge in the watersheds this study employed an energy balanced soil temperature module and a slope introduced soil moisture module in coupling with a conceptual model of hydro bio geochemical process based watershed life cycle analysis i e the watershed inorganic nitrogen dynamic wind to simulate soil n cycling across forest land farmland and urban bare land in an urbanizing watershed in southern china the model was calibrated and validated by two individual survey events in 2013 and 2016 17 respectively using moisture and inorganic n in surface soil 0 10 cm of the watershed with determination coefficients r2 above 0 7 significantly higher soil temperature arose when using the energy balanced module in comparison to the air temperature module meanwhile soil moisture declining with land slope became significant above 15 steepness estimates of surface soil n cycling across all land uses were significantly altered importantly land uses determined the extents of their alterations the wind provides insights into drivers of hot spot hot moment hydro bio geochemical processes of soil inorganic n for land uses in the watershed more generally as the findings inform a better constraint of parameters in other physics based watershed scale water quality models they also potentially directly contribute to improved strategies for sustainable management of inorganic n discharges under the predicted climate changes keywords inorganic n dynamics surface soil dynamic life cycle analysis soil moisture land use type watershed 1 introduction nitrogen n is one of the essential elements stabilizing natural ecosystems vitousek and howarth 1991 human activities however have dramatically altered the global n cycle with increasing n loads in the environment galloway and cowling 2002 nitrogen in surface soil of various land use types serves as a source of n loading in the aquatic ecosystem of a watershed gao et al 2013 excess n from surface soil with increasing anthropogenic n inputs e g extensive n deposition and n fertilization have caused serious ecological and environmental problems in watersheds including greenhouse gas emission congreves et al 2016 and water eutrophication kaushal et al 2011 threatening the watershed sustainability and eventually putting human health at risk the n source sink complexity in a watershed can be elaborated by water confluence via integrating spatiotemporal distribution of n loading hydrological regime soil physicochemical properties and biogeochemical processes lin et al 2018 understanding how to best manipulate the n source sink relationship is of considerable concern for water quality and watershed sustainable management worldwide congreves et al 2016 besides n substrates n biogeochemical processes are highly regulated by environmental abiotic factors such as soil temperature and moisture yu and ehrenfeld 2010 ehrenfeld and yu 2012 ahmed et al 2019 morugan coronado et al 2019 for example potentials of biological n fixation and denitrification in orchard soils were improved by increased soil moisture in the proximity of the dripping irrigation morugan coronado et al 2019 soil moisture in turn has a dynamic relationship with soil temperature partitioning energy and radiation that reach land surface berg et al 2014 hauser et al 2016 surface soil moisture is on the other side highly influenced by land slope qiu et al 2001 which determines the routing of water either infiltrating the soil profile or as surface runoff during rainfall or irrigation events in other words the land slope changes soil moisture and runoff hydrological regime simultaneously stieglitz et al 2003 vaezi et al 2017 steep topography can result in rapid surface runoff and considerable subsurface drainage which lead to substantial n loss into watershed aquatic ecosystems wu et al 2018 numerous process based models have been used to track n dynamics at a watershed scale including the agricultural nonpoint source pollution agnps annagnps li et al 2015 the soil water plant drainage systems swpd matinzadeh et al 2017 the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 the model of acidification of groundwater in catchments magic oulehle et al 2012 and the integrated nitrogen in catchments inca wade et al 2002 among them soil n biogeochemical processes are highly considered and incorporated with distributed hydrological models such as swat inca and annagnps the existing watershed n dynamic models provide comprehensive simulations on water and n movements but simplify soil n biogeochemical processes in various ways such as annagnps only including mineralization and denitrification processes and inca and swat with mineralization nitrification and denitrification processes costa et al 2020 meanwhile soil temperature and moisture are critical factors of soil n biogeochemical processes agehara and warncke 2005 butterbach bahl et al 2013 as well as hydrological processes nanda et al 2019 simulations on soil temperature and moisture are diverse among these existing models as well except the swat and annagnps most of the watershed n dynamic models seldom consider the indirect effect of land slope on soil moisture not even on associated n dynamic processes although its effect on hydrological regime has been well recognized wade et al 2002 soil temperature however is included in most of the process based models for soil hydro thermal processes soil mass transportation soil structure and soil microbes mediating n processes agehara and warncke 2005 butterbach bahl et al 2013 costa et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 given constraints of scaling up field observations tempo spatially to a watershed scale soil temperature has often been simulated by a variety of empirical approaches mainly using air temperature bai et al 2014 huang et al 2018a for instance inca uses a sine function of air temperature and average annual temperature amplitude to simulation soil temperature and swat uses weighting functions based on average annual air temperature and current day s soil surface temperature costa et al 2020 wade et al 2002 kwon and koo 2017 found that surface soil temperature was simultaneously determined by air temperature and solar radiation and the air temperature only empirical models led to soil temperature consistently lower than air temperature however the field measurement found that surface soil temperature was higher than the air temperature during the daylight time qi et al 2019 energy balance models with solar radiation further revealed that soil temperature is correlated to soil moisture and heat flux herb et al 2008 kettridge and baird 2008 on the other side land use cover type determines an intensity of solar radiation to reach surface soil herb et al 2008 therefore the air temperature based simulation might lead to underestimates of surface soil temperature in turn which might further impede the accuracy of the above mentioned various models in simulating n cycling in a watershed with mixed land use cover as fundamental parameters in controlling watershed n cycling accuracy of soil temperature and soil moisture simulations is of fundamental importance for the model output this study developed a slope introduced soil moisture module and an energy balanced soil temperature module to integrate a watershed inorganic n dynamic wind model materialized from the hydro bio geo chemical process based lca conceptual model lin et al 2018 the wind model was calibrated and validated by two field survey events in 2013 and 2016 2017 respectively in an urbanizing watershed in xiamen southeastern china with the energy balanced soil temperature and the slope introduced soil moisture the wind model is hypothesized to delineate differences of n cycling processes across various land use cover types i e forest farmland and urban bare land in the studied watershed except their differences from the empirical air temperature based soil temperature routine and non slope introduced soil moisture i e the slope at 0 meanwhile rates of the n cycling processes in surface soil from the studied watershed were freshly measured by a consecutive n transformation approach i e mineralization nitrification and denitrification using urea as the only n source instead of the traditional and individual substrate enriched potential methods it assumed to provide real parameters for the simulations findings from this study will contribute strategies and tools for sustainable watershed n cycle via manipulating hot spot hot moment of n source sink relationships groffman et al 2002 to mitigate against their adverse effects under the predicted global warming 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region an urbanizing watershed the bantou reservoir watershed in jimei district xiamen southeastern china was

water source for the xiamen municipal since 2002 the watershed covers approximately 205 km2 and is characterized by the asian subtropical monsoon climate with a mean annual precipitation of 1462 mm and a mean annual daily temperature of 22 c during 2013 2017 an obvious urbanization in the watershed started since 2005 according to the time series satellite image interpretation the watershed is dominated by lateritic soil and is consisted of four types of the 1st categorical land uses interpreted in 2013 and 2017 as farmland mainly vegetable and orchard upland 108 patches with median size of

in a watershed two sampling events of surface soil 0 10 cm were undertaken during march april 2013 and november 2016 march 2017 respectively in total 137 sites were sampled from patches of the three land use types 25 surface soil samples from forest land 49 surface soil samples from farmland and 63 surface soil samples from urban bare land for each sampling event fig 1 at each site five samples were taken from a 10 m 10 m quadrate and mixed as one composite soil sample one cutting ring sample for bulk density measurement was randomly selected from the quadrate at each site all samples were sealed in ziploc polyethylene bags and transported to the laboratory on ice each composite soil sample was divided into three subsamples one was passed through a mesh 10 sieve and oven dried at 105 c to reach a constant weight for soil moisture measurement one passed through the mesh 10 sieve to measured rates of microbial n transformation processes denitrification nitrification and mineralization

shaking using a flow injection analyzer fia qc5000 lachat usa the contents of soil nh4 n and no3 n were calculated as mg n per kg oven dried soil and then converted into kg km 2 with soil bulk density the microbial n transformation rates were measured based on aerobic incubation of 10 g homogenized field moisture soil samples in a sealed air water soil microcosm headspace of the microcosm was vacuumed and flushed 3 times with pure helium gas one milliliter of urea was injected into each vacuumed microcosm to reach the n content at 1 mg n per microcosm and an equal volume of deionized water was injected into the control microcosm for each surface soil sample then the helium gassed headspace of the microcosm was balanced with a syringe of 50 ml o2 by push and pull for 5 min the microcosms were incubated in the dark for 72 96 and 120 h at room temperature the headspace air of the timed microcosms was then determined for n2 n2o co2 and ch4 using a gas chromatography system agilent 7890a

2018 the wind model simulated daily changes in inorganic n nh4 n and no3 n dynamics in surface soil under three land uses forest farmland and urban bare land uses briefly external inputs of soil inorganic n include atmospheric deposition lightning n2 fixation and fertilization while internal transformations of soil n are assumed mostly as mineralization of organic n into nh4 which is thereafter taken up by plants and lost via nh3 volatilization surface runoff and infiltration or oxidized into no3 through nitrification under aerobic condition no3 can be also taken up by plants exported via surface runoff and infiltration to surface and ground water or returned to the atmosphere by denitrifiers under hypoxic or anaerobic condition fig 2 mathematical equations of these

2 5 model calibration and validation for both configurations of the wind model the parameter sets consisting of 12 parameters for soil water balances and 22 parameters for soil inorganic n dynamic balances were manually calibrated and validated against the soil measurement data from 2013 and 2016 2017 respectively table s2 the parameters plant potential factor model coefficient of runoff

out for soil moisture and inorganic n pool in surface soil along a land slope gradient of 0 30 for each land use type with tukey s post hoc test significance level alpha 0 05 while n way anova was applied to testify effects of land use types and the land slope gradient significance level alpha 0 05 multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the contributions of soil moisture and

same trend evident difference between combined daily soil temperature and soil moisture was found for nh4 n in farmland and for no3 n in urban bare land fig 3 upper suggesting inorganic n cycling in different land use types might have differing sensitive processes to soil temperature and moisture the slope introduced soil moisture module also had good validation fitness for surface soil moisture

soil moisture and inorganic n pools in surface soil of various land use types the three land use types showed a similar declining pattern of daily soil moisture under daily rainfall in 2013 2017 along the land slope gradient of 0 to 30 simulated by the slope introduced soil moisture module smoist fig 4 upper the daily soil moisture declines with the land slope became significant when daily rainfall volume above 50 mm and the land slope above 15 urban bare land use even significantly above 10 fig 4 upper according to anova with tukey s post hoc test p 0 05 under the maximum daily rainfall 173 mm of 2013 2017 the daily soil moisture declined with land slope from 65 0 10 to 41 3 mm 30 for forest land from 64 7 0 to 34 5 mm 30 for farmland and from 54 8 0 to 24 4 mm 30 for urban bare land fig 4 upper however the daily soil moisture without rainfall was relatively stable over the land slope gradient i e soil moisture of forest land and farmland consistently at 13 1 mm and 10 6 mm respectively while urban bare land had a relatively wide range of soil moisture of 13 8 0 11 0 30 mm fig 4 upper in response to the slope introduced soil moisture change inorganic n pools in surface soil showed significant declines with increasing soil moisture but varied with land use type and inorganic n form fig 4 lower a steep decline of daily inorganic n pools was observed as soil moisture increased from 10 to 40 mm then gradually down when soil moisture above 40 mm for forest land and farmland and above 30 mm for urban bare land similarly the declines of daily inorganic n pools became quick with land slope increasing from 0 to 30 fig 4 lower the decrease in median nh4 n for forest land from 907 kg km 2 0 to 772 kg km 2 30 was greater than for farmland from 756 to 714 kg km 2 and urban bare land from 425 to 335 kg km 2 whereas the decrease in median no3 n for urban bare land from 1323 kg km 2 0 to 1038 kg km 2 30 was greater than forest land from 459 to 399 kg km 2 and farmland from 877 to 802 kg km 2 3 3 differences of soil temperature simulated by entemp and airtemp and its effects on inorganic n pools in surface soil of various land use types surface soil temperature simulated by the energy balanced soil temperature module entemp was significantly higher than when simulated by the air temperature based soil temperature module airtemp in the period of 2013 2017 with the sampling events 1825 days p 0 001 fig 5 upper the increment of surface soil temperature between entemp and airtemp is dependent upon land use type i e surface soil of urban bare land had a greater increment of soil temperature than those of farmland and forest land the median increments between entemp and airtemp were 2 c for forest land 5 c for farmland and 6 c for urban bare land over the period with the increase of soil temperature entemp versus airtemp at the median slope of each land use type as above mentioned the simulated inorganic n pools in surface soil were significantly but differently shifted by land use type in the period of 2013 2017 both nh4 n and no3 n pool sizes were significantly increased in surface soil of forest land and urban bare land but declined in surface soil of farmland with fertilization over the period with entemp versus airtemp 1825 days p 0 001 fig 5 lower the median increment of nh4 n pool size between entemp and airtemp was 2 3 times greater in farmland 148 kg km 2 than in the forest land 50 kg km 2 and urban bare land 68 kg km 2 whereas the median increment of no3 n pool size was the greatest in urban bare land 235 kg km 2 which was almost 12 times higher than in the forest land 19 kg km 2 and farmland 20 kg km 2 3 4 nitrogen cycling in surface soil under various land use types of the studied watershed simulated by the wind model with entemp and smoist modules differences in moisture temperature inorganic n pool nh4 n and no3 n multi process rates of n cycling and daily n losses in surface soil of the three land use types in the studied watershed were consecutively simulated in the period of 2013 2017 by the wind model with entemp and smoist modules fig 6 the slope for the smoist simulation used the median value of each land use type in the watershed i e 15 for forest land 5 for both farmland and urban bare land the daily no3 n pool in surface soil median at 1318 kg n km 2 was consistently and remarkably greater than the daily nh4 n pool median at 423 kg n km 2 in the urban bare land 1825 days p 0 001 while the forest land had a reverse pattern with a nearly double daily pool size of nh4 n median at 875 kg n km 2 as that of daily no3 n pool median at 446 kg n km 2 in surface soil 1825 days p 0 001 the farmland was balanced with comparative daily pools of nh4 n median at 755 kg n km 2 and no3 n median at 875 kg n km 2 in surface soil meanwhile the urban bare land had the greatest daily no3 n pool in surface soil among the three land use types in the studied watershed daily rates of n cycling processes mineralization nitrification and volatilization were significantly shifted with soil temperature entemp pattern partial r2 ranging from 0 117 to 0 937 and slightly integrated with soil moisture smoist pattern partial r2 ranging from 0 008 to 0 414 1825 days p 0 0001 fig 6 table s3 the farmland with fertilization and cropping practices had the most active and diverse n cycling processes even denitrification which contributed negligibly to n cycling in upland surface soil of forest land and urban bare land daily medians of mineralization nitrification volatilization and denitrification rates in surface soil of the farmland were 68 kg n km 2 day 1 43 kg n km 2 day 1 30 kg n km 2 day 1 and 4 kg n km 2 day 1 respectively daily n cycling in surface soil of forest land was dominated by mineralization median at 57 kg n km 2 day 1 and followed by nitrification median at 16 kg n km 2 day 1 and volatilization median at 8 kg n km 2 day 1 on the other hand daily n cycling in surface soil of urban bare land was integratively dominated by mineralization median at 43 kg n km 2 day 1 and nitrification median at 30 kg n km 2 day 1 1825 days p 0 001 fig 6 surface runoff was the predominant daily n loss pathway from surface soil regardless of land use types with means of 39 kg n km 2 day 1 for forest land 44 kg n km 2 day 1 for farmland and 57 kg n km 2 day 1 for urban bare land fig 6 vegetation uptake was a considerable daily n loss pathway from surface soil of farmland median at 102 kg n km 2 day 1 over 6 times that of forest land median at 17 kg n km 2 day 1 without the vegetation uptake infiltration became a major pathway of daily n loss from surface soil of urban bare land median at 9 kg n km 2 day 1 greater than farmland median at 8 kg n km 2 day 1 and forest land median 6 kg n km 2 day 1 annual n fluxes in surface soil can be classified as input and output for the three land use types in the study watershed fig 7 except fertilization in farmland mineralization contributed a profound nh4 n input to the inorganic n pool of surface soil average annual at 262 kg n ha 1 yr 1 54 2 of annual total inorganic n atin pool for farmland 214 kg n ha 1 yr 1 79 7 of atin pool for forest land and 169 kg n ha 1 yr 1 62 4 of atin pool for urban bare land which significantly differed among the three land use types p 0 001 n 5 fig 7 as the daily mineralization rates mentioned above fig 6 other sources such as no3 n air deposition and n2 lightning fixation were important for inorganic n pool in surface soil of urban bare land 58 4 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 21 5 of atin pool and 21 9 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 8 1 of atin pool respectively but negligible for forest land and farmland 12 2 of atin pool fig 7 average annual output flux of no3 n via surface runoff was considerably high in urban bare land 158 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 58 1 of atin pool significantly greater than farmland 86 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 12 4 of atin pool and forest land 47 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 17 5 of atin pool p 0 001 n 5 fig 7 at the same time surface runoffs also exported nh4 n annually from surface soil of forest land mean of 94 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 34 9 of atin pool significantly less than no3 n output via surface runoff p 0 001 n 5 farmland 75 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 10 8 of atin pool and urban bare land 48 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 17 7 of atin pool which significantly differed among the land use types p 0 05 n 5 on the other hand average annual nh4 n output via nh3 volatilization was significantly greater in surface soil of farm land 107 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 15 6 of atin pool which was over three times of forest land 31 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 11 8 of atin pool and near 6 times of urban bare land 18 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 7 1 of atin pool fig 7 p 0 001 n 5 average annual n loss via denitrification was relatively small in comparison with above mentioned processes 16 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in surface soil of farmland 5 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in surface soil of forest land and 3 kg n ha 1 yr 1 in surface soil of urban bare land respectively which were significantly differentiated among land use types p 0 001 n 5 with vegetation annual plant uptake accounted for 202 kg nh4 n ha 1 yr 1 and 175 kg no3 n ha 1 yr 1 consisting of 36 0 nh4 n and 59 9 no3 n outputs from surface soil of farmland respectively while surface soil n in forest land was taken up by plants annually at 31 kg nh4 n ha 1 yr 1 13 3 of output and 32 kg no3 n ha 1 yr 1 34 6 of output fig 7 4 discussion as hypothesized that nitrogen in surface soil 0 10 cm is actively involved in watershed n cycle the wind model with entemp and smoist modules evidently differentiates the inorganic n pool of surface soil under three land use types not only in speciation and flux but also in process and process based annual contribution to inorganic n cycle figs 6 7 urban bare land was characterized with higher no3 n flux in surface soil and greater no3 n loss via surface runoff by the wind which is coincident to greater no3 n export via surface runoff from urban subwatersheds 2 49 0 35 mg n l 1 than forest ones 1 10 0 45 mg n l 1 in the jiulong river watershed fujian china huang et al 2018b shi et al 2019 also confirmed that inorganic n export to waterways was often enhanced by land use change due to urbanization up to 15 6 mg n l 1 in the wei river watershed northwest china upland agriculture with fertilization also exported considerable no3 n in surface water with the wind simulation in the studied watershed farmland with fertilization mainly agricultural uplands had a comparable pool size between no3 n and nh4 n medians at 875 and 755 kg n ha 1 in 2013 2017 respectively but with considerable no3 n loss via surface runoff from its surface soil averagely 86 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 12 4 of atin pool figs 6 7 it is comparable but greater than no3 n loss via surface runoff in baltimore lter watershed usa where average output at 39 kg n ha 1 yr 1 was observed kaushal et al 2008 considerable surface runoff losses of nh4 n from surface soil of agricultural land have also been observed 2 87 mg n l 1 in an agricultural subwatershed heidingzi of the songhua river jilin province china zhao et al 2017 0 53 0 6 mg n l 1 in agricultural subwatersheds of jiulong river fujian province china huang et al 2018b and 1 8 mg n l 1 in an agricultural catchment of the lake poyang watershed jiangxi province china tang et al 2008 the simulation in the studied watershed interestingly indicated that despite surface soil of farmland and forest land having comparable daily nh4 n pool sizes 1825 day medians of 755 kg n km 2 and 875 kg n km 2 respectively yet farmland had less nh4 n loss via surface runoff at 75 kg n ha 1 yr 1 10 8 of atin pool than forest land 94 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 34 9 of atin pool averages of 1825 days figs 6 7 this was double the flux from urban bare land we observed that inorganic n in stream water of the studied watershed was dominated by nh4 n back to 2012 gao et al 2013 when the watershed with over 45 forest coverage had experienced an escalating urbanization interactions between pools and losses of inorganic n in surface soil are multifactor dependent but mainly driven by microbial processes in soil and soil plant root interface buckeridge and jefferies 2007 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 most process based soil n cycling models fixed the microbial process rates or were considered only as a parameter li et al 2000 arnold et al 2012 oulehle et al 2012 in this study a new approach of measuring rates of soil n processes was employed and enable to provide real process based simulation for n cycling in surface soil under various land use types especially for denitrification including both n2 and n2o fluxes fig 6 with the wind model a clear pattern differed among three land use types in the period of 2013 2017 i e daily n cycling in farmland surface soil predominantly driven by mineralization nitrification and volatilization while daily soil n cycling was dominated by mineralization for forest land and by both mineralization and nitrification for urban bare land fig 6 the simulated mineralization rates in surface soil of the studied watershed a subtropical zone were comparable to the rates in agricultural lands of southwestern spain vazquez et al 2019 in the 65 arable cropping field experiments in france clivot et al 2017 and in forest lands in alberta canada lang et al 2019 and in subtropical australia zhang et al 2018 table 2 meanwhile net soil nitrification rate in farmland by the wind simulation in this study ranged from 8 36 to 116 96 kg n km 2 day 1 equivalent to 0 10 0 88 mg n kg 1 day 1 comparable to the rates of paddy soils 0 36 0 48 mg n kg 1 day 1 in jiangxi china yang et al 2018 however the simulated nitrification rate in surface soils of forest and urban bare lands was less than rates of corresponding land uses in minhang district shanghai china yan et al 2019 and in archipelago japan urakawa et al 2015 given that net denitrification rate was calculated by the sum of n2 n2o n in this study the simulated net denitrification rate in surface soil of urban bare land and forest land were greater than those in xiamen by measuring n2o n alone urban soil 0 08 0 46 kg n2o n km 2 day 1 xu et al 2019 and guangdong china forest soil 0 0001 0 003 mg kg 1 day 1 tang et al 2019 but the simulated denitrification rate in surface soil of farmland of this study was less than the xiamen agricultural soil 0 6 444 kg n2o n km 2 day 1 xu et al 2019 and paddy soil from yingtan china 0 33 0 08 mg n kg 1 day 1 lan et al 2015 all the comparisons of inorganic n transformation rates were listed in table 2 soil microbial n processes are temperature sensitive guntiñas et al 2012 sun et al 2013 and mostly high temperature within its certain extent promotes n metabolic activity of microbes schimel et al 2004 findings from the wind model that entemp by the energy balance module was greater than airtemp by the air temperature module fig 5 by which soil temperature was consistently lower than air temperature were confirmed by field measurements and simulations from other studies for instance soil temperature higher than air temperature during daylight time qi et al 2019 the increment between entemp and airtemp in this study differed among land use types i e 2 1 0 9 c for forest land 6 3 3 5 c for farmland and 7 2 3 3 c for urban bare land all greater than that in surface soil 5 10 cm of the choptank river watershed maryland usa 0 4 to 1 1 c averagely 0 6 0 2 c qi et al 2019 table 2 on the other hand differences of daily soil temperature among land use types found in this study for example 0 2 to 18 c and averagely 5 c between forest land and urban bare land were coincident to the simulated daily soil surface temperature increments between forest land and bare land in albertville minnesota usa by the energy balance 1 to 12 c herb et al 2008 the temperature increments between vegetated and bare soil is determined by short wave length radiation which is blocked by vegetation herb et al 2008 ni et al 2019 findings from this study and others suggest that the energy balance simulation might be appropriate for surface soil temperature rather than the air temperature module meanwhile the energy balance module for surface soil temperature includes soil moisture as an important factor which is highly determined by soil water holding capacity chen et al 2007 in this study the forest soil had higher moisture than urban bare soil because of larger soil water holding capacity fig 4 on the other hand soil moisture is influenced by land slope a hydrological factor which determines surface runoff and water infiltration under various land coverage table s1 a negative relationship between soil moisture and land slope has been reported in few studies including farmland and forest land of hilly jiegou catchment in shanxi china yu et al 2018 and yan river catchment in shanxi china yang et al 2017 this study also demonstrated the negative relationship between soil moisture and land slope which was influenced by daily rainfall volume fig 4 evapotranspiration by vegetation is another important pathway influencing soil moisture gómez plaza et al 2001 ni et al 2019 the forest land and farmland in this study had greater soil moisture in surface soil than urban bare soil even though forest land had the greatest land slope fig 4 the findings of the present study suggest that soil moisture is strongly determined by water holding capacity instead of land slope and vegetation land cover however land slope critically determined surface runoff and infiltration of water as well as n movement zhu et al 2018 as a model the wind model has its assumptions and limitations the wind only estimates inorganic n dynamics in surface soil and does not touch organic n speciation because most n losses are inorganic forms via surface runoff and surface soil erosion and gaseous emissions therefore organic n cycling and n dynamics in subsurface soil are not considered which is one of the limitations for the wind model meanwhile the slope introduction to soil moisture simulation is specific to a mountainous watershed or catchment as this study explored that the slope effect on soil moisture and associated n transformation becomes evident at a steepness above 15 and varies by vegetation covers fig 3 it suggests that in a flat watershed or catchment the wind might have similar estimates as other models which consider solar radiation for soil moisture simulation at last the current study successfully testified the wind model differentiating the land use types on inorganic n cycling processes but scaling these results up to a watershed or catchment should considered more aspects of various land use patches such as exposure and length of slope and inter and intra drainage networks in short the wind model also requires a conditional application as other models 5 conclusions land use type shifts soil n cycling due to its effects on altering soil temperature and moisture for an urbanizing case study watershed the wind model which included an energy balanced soil temperature module entemp and slope introduced soil moisture module smoist clearly illustrated the differences of inorganic n pools and n transformation rates and pathways in surface soil under three land uses figs 6 7 influences of soil temperature soil moisture and land slope on inorganic n pools were also testified and clarified using the wind model for forest land farmland and urban bare land figs 4 5 besides giving better simulation on watershed n cycling findings from the modelling will assist strategies for watershed n management under climate changes although some uncertainties should be considered for this study hopefully these findings of the wind might also be useful to constrain parameterization of swat and agnps and the other catchment nutrient models such as that the energy balanced simulation might be appropriate for surface soil temperature rather than the air temperature module credit authorship contribution statement xiaodan lin software validation formal analysis

5401,in this study 3h 3he ages in the intertidal zone based on both field measurements and numerical simulations are presented to provide insights into the flow and transport behavior within the subterranean estuary of a meso tidal high energy beach in a systematic modelling approach important hydrogeological parameters dispersivity hydraulic conductivity and fresh groundwater flux were varied in a cross shore transect at a beach on spiekeroog island in north western germany both measured and simulated salinity and age distribution within the intertidal zone suggest the existence of two at least temporally occurring saltwater recirculation cells accompanied by two fresh discharge location this is in contrast to the state of the art concept of a ste under tidal influence and is caused by a runnel and ridge system at the study site which is a rather wide spread type of beach morphology with topographical highs and interfering lows in the intertidal zone residence times within the two saline plumes were between weeks and several months freshwater from the island s freshwater lens resided up to 18 years in the brackish beach aquifer before exfiltrating at the discharge points field measurements confirmed the discharge of decade old water at the discharge points model results were highly dependent on the tested model parameters a change between a one and two plume system as well as overlapping conditions at the study site dependent on the change in beach topography are likely keywords subterranean estuary high energy beach meso tidal 3h 3he ages submarine groundwater discharge 1 introduction coastal areas provide living space for almost a quarter of the global population small and nicholls 2003 hence sustainable resource management in the transition zone between land and ocean is of great importance especially in view of a rising sea level robinson et al 2018 coastal aquifers are characterized by the presence of terrestrial fresh groundwater and circulating seawater thereby terrestrial groundwater can contain elevated concentrations of nutrients which locally effect coastal ecosystems burnett et al 2003 cho et al 2018 moore 1999 valiela et al 1997 for sandy beaches several studies suggested water sediment interactions to significantly contribute to coastal carbon nutrient and or trace element cycling e g anschutz et al 2009 heiss et al 2014 or santos et al 2009 the redistribution in beach sediments can be large especially under high energy conditions thereby the interplay between wave energy beach slope tidal range and sediment size may enable the formation of characterizing beach structures at low gradient sandy beaches the intertidal zone may be subject to strong morphodynamics with interfering lows mulrennan 1992 which was first referred to as runnel and ridge beach morphology by king and williams 1949 and found to be occurring all over the world e g davis et al 1972 mulrennan 1992 owens and frobel 1977 the subterranean mixing zone of fresh and saline water was termed subterranean estuary ste by moore 1999 based on its characteristics comparable to surface estuaries if affected by tides the ste generally consists of a freshwater discharge tube fdt as well as a tide induced upper saline plume usp and a density induced saltwater wedge both confining the fdt from above and below robinson et al 2006 fig 1 seawater infiltrates around the high water line hwl and passes through the usp before it exfiltrates as saline submarine groundwater discharge sgd around the low water line lwl in addition fresh terrestrial groundwater from the fdt and recirculating seawater from the wedge exfiltrate as fresh and saline sgd respectively typically somewhere below the lwl robinson et al 2006 the occurrence spatial dimensions and shape of usp fdt and wedge as well as the sgd fluxes depend on a number of hydrological and hydrogeological parameters i e hydraulic conductivity terrestrial freshwater flux tidal amplitude wave heights beach slope and aquifer depth e g abarca et al 2013 evans and wilson 2016 greskowiak 2014 heiss and michael 2014 michael et al 2005 robinson et al 2007 röper et al 2015 residence times of the water recirculating in the usp were generally found to be small ranging from days to weeks abarca et al 2013 anschutz et al 2009 heiss and michael 2014 michael et al 2005 robinson et al 2007 but can be also in the range of months beck et al 2017 lenkopane et al 2009 and even years seidel et al 2015 depending on the hydrogeological setting nevertheless meteoric groundwater arriving at the fdt is typically older with groundwater ages mostly in the order of years to many decades as shown in simulations by seidel et al 2015 and beck et al 2017 numerical simulations also showed that recirculated seawater from the saltwater wedge discharging below the lwl is considerably older ranging from decades beck et al 2017 robinson et al 2007 xin et al 2010 to centuries seidel et al 2017 and even millennia in case of offshore sgd post et al 2013 the mixing of different waters of distinctly different groundwater ages and their interaction with the sediment makes the ste a highly reactive bioreactor largely controlling the offshore sgd s water composition anschutz et al 2009 kim et al 2017 mcallister et al 2015 seidel et al 2015 quantification of the reactive processes requires a quantitative understanding of the residence times and mixing in the ste so far residence times in the ste have mostly been estimated by means of numerical modeling except in a very few cases i e in the studies of abarca et al 2013 and heiss et al 2014 where the residence times within the usp were deduced from tracer experiments with uranine na fluorescein and bromide respectively in both of these cases a rather shallow and small usp and a calm micro tidal environment were present posing ideal conditions for successful carrying out a tracer experiment within a short time frame and with a high chance of tracer detection along the flow path and discharge location in meso to macro tidal environments and high energy wave conditions however tracer experiments are likely to fail due to the strong dynamics of such systems a method for estimating water residence times in aquifers is age dating with environmental tracers like radioactive isotopes or inert substances of anthropogenic origin cffs sf6 a suitable tracer for younger groundwater of ages up to 60 years is tritium 3h in combination with its decay product helium 3he it provides an age measure independent of the tritium input cook and solomon 1997 tritium was released between the late 1950s and early 1960s in high amounts mainly into the stratosphere by thermonuclear bomb tests schlosser et al 1988 the method generates the so called apparent 3h 3he age of the groundwater sample i e the time the sampled water resided in the aquifer without contact to the atmosphere in the last 30 years numerous groundwater investigations used this approach to date groundwater bodies and delineate flow patterns e g darling et al 2017 massmann et al 2009 post et al 2013 röper et al 2012 schlosser et al 1988 solomon and sudicky 1991 all these studies investigated rather steady low dynamic systems so far this technique has not been applied to date groundwater and resolve flow patterns in highly dynamic environments such as stes at high energy beaches where groundwater of different origins and ages mixes in the presented study we aim to resolve and understand the groundwater flow patterns and residence times at a meso tidal high energy beach based on observed salinity distributions and measured apparent 3h 3he ages in combination with explorative field scale numerical density dependent groundwater flow modeling we hypothesize that the observed field data can be explained by a realistic numerical representation of the investigated ste further we aim to understand the sensitivity of groundwater flow and salinity patterns as well as groundwater ages to intertidal topography and hydrogeological parameters e g hydrodynamic dispersivity or meteoric groundwater flux as we hypothesize that these will have an impact especially in high energy systems the investigated field site located at the northern beach of spiekeroog island germany serves as an ideal example for meso tidal high energy conditions waska et al 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and previous work the presented study was conducted in the intertidal zone at the northern beach of spiekeroog which is part of the east frisian island chain and located in front of the north german coastline fig 2 spiekeroog has a size of approximately 21 km2 and is separated from other islands by the otzumer inlet in the west and the harle inlet in the east streif 1990 precipitation averages around 808 mm a 1 oowv 2012 and infiltrates almost immediately into the dunes which consist of fine to medium grained holocene sands above pleistocene deposits streif 1990 surface runoff is negligible and based on previous tritium helium age data röper et al 2012 calculated a mean groundwater recharge rate of 350 mm a 1 for spiekeroog groundwater recharge feeds a freshwater lens which is also used for the islands drinking water production at a depth of about 40 m below sea level a clay layer confines the lens towards its base röper et al 2012 the lens exhibits groundwater ages of up to 51 years seibert et al 2018 exfiltration of the lens freshwater was observed in the intertidal zone of the northern beach investigated in this study waska et al 2019 the beach is affected by semidiurnal tides with a tidal range of 2 7 m which corresponds to meso tidal conditions beck et al 2017 according to dobrynin et al 2010 the offshore wave spectrum generally fluctuates between 0 5 and 2 m and up to 11 m during storm conditions the northern beach facing the open north sea is characterized by shoreline parallel sand banks and troughs flemming and davis 1994 which we in the following refer to as runnel ridge type although the criteria of king and williams 1949 are not completely fulfilled with respect to macro tidal conditions at the study site the runnel is present in approximately 50 to 70 m distance from the hwl followed by a sandbar ridge in approximately 100 to 200 m distance beck et al 2017 waska et al 2019 fig 3 the ridge is always inundated during high tide and exposed during low tide due to the strong morphodynamics at this site runnel and ridge do not have a stable position instead they relocate and are variably distinct within the course of a year waska et al 2019 for the study site beck et al 2017 described the typical hydrological zonation with an usp a fdt and a saltwater wedge fig 1 observed salinity patterns in may 2014 and numerical modeling along a cross shore transect suggested that all fresh groundwater from the freshwater lens discharges into the runnel this was explained by the presence of the ridge acting as local groundwater divide during non inundated times preventing the arriving fresh groundwater from flowing towards the lwl further seaward in contrast extended hydrogeochemical investigations of waska et al 2019 who sampled the intertidal zone over a 200 200 m grid for three consecutive times october 2016 march 2017 and august 2017 found patches of brackish water down to 16 psu at the lwl this suggests that the groundwater divide at the ridge is less strong and or less stable than previously thought allowing some of the fresh groundwater to pass underneath the ridge and pinch out at the lwl while some seems to discharge into the runnel this indicates that the fdt splits up within the ste presumably into two main branches waska et al 2019 fig 3 nevertheless observed salinity patterns in the intertidal zone were rather complex occasionally low salinity spots were even found at the top of the ridge waska et al 2019 this indicates that other processes e g strong morphodynamics density dependent flow as well as heterogeneity of aquifer properties further complicate the overall groundwater flow patterns waska et al 2019 2 2 sampling shallow monitoring wells high density polyethylene ø 63 mm were installed along two south north orientated transects from hwl to lwl during three campaigns in october 2016 march 2017 and august 2017 their filter screens extended from 50 to 100 cm below beach surface in order to reduce sand accumulation inside the piezometers a filter sleeve was used the piezometers were partially equipped with data

a conversion factor which was found to be 0 6768 at spiekeroog according to holt et al 2017 in october 2016 and march 2017 samples for tritium and helium isotopes were taken with a submersible pump eijkelkamp and collected in 1 l pe polyethylene bottles for tritium and 40 ml copper tubes for helium analysis the tube volume was exchanged several times before the actual sampling was conducted to prevent degassing a transparent tube with a hose clamp was attached to the outlet of the copper tube in order to increase the pressure in the tube while flushing the copper tubes were pinched off

referred to as stable tritium 2 4 numerical model several model cases were set up with the density dependent groundwater flow model seawat langevin et al 2008 seawat couples the groundwater flow simulation software modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 and the transport simulator mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 and has been successfully used in many previous ste studies before greskowiak 2014 heiss et al 2017 robinson et al 2006 a two dimensional vertical cross section model from the dune base towards the sea including the study site was created for simulating the groundwater flow as well as the salt transport and the tritium decay to helium note that the simplified model was not subject to calibration rather in an explorative manner many simulations were carried out for a realistic and reasonable range of model parameter values as specified further below and discussed with respect to the observed field data 2 4 1 model concept and setup the horizontal extent of the model domain was 700 m starting from the dune base with a horizontal cell size of 2 5 m fig s1 in vertical direction the model extended to a depth of 40 m below sea level where a continuous clay layer functioning as an aquitard is expected röper et al 2012 the vertical discretization varied from 0 5 m in the shallow part to 1 m in the deepest part of the aquifer a higher resolution was chosen in the upper model part in order to facilitate a comparison to the shallow piezometers that were installed during the field campaigns the top of the model was set equal to the average topography that was measured during three field campaigns in october 2016 march 2017 and august 2017 fig s2 with a stonex s9 iii plus gnss differential gps waska et al 2019 hence we did not account for a transient intertidal topography the reasons for this were that i we did not have continuous topography data but data from three field campaigns only with a gap of several months in between and ii the characteristic topographic feature of this site i e the runnel ridge system appears to be always present beck et al 2017 waska et al 2019 2 4 1 1 flow and salt transport boundary conditions it was previously shown that the hydraulic heads in the shallow beach aquifer are strongly linked to the intertidal topography and the actual seawater level e g heiss and michael 2014 riedel et al 2010 vandenbohede et al 2005 vandenbohede and lebbe 2006 2007 this was also found at the here investigated field site during falling tide the hydraulic heads follow the tidal signal until they reach the respective topographic height and subsequently stay constant at this height even though the tidal signal decreases further fig s3 deviations were observed in the expected infiltration areas around the hwl infiltration area in 1 and at the top of the ridge infiltration area in 2 at these locations the measured groundwater table declined slowly beyond the respective topographic height down to 36 cm at the hwl and 16 cm at the top of the ridge fig s3 the hydraulic heads recovered and started to increase as soon as the seawater level exceeded the surface level during rising tide to be able to carry out long term simulations in the order of decades in a reasonable time frame we employed phase averaged fixed heads 1st type at the ocean boundary i e at the top of the model on the stretch from the hwl to 700 m from the dune base encompassing the intertidal zone fig s1 this approach has previously been found to adequately simulate the mean groundwater flow field in the intertidal zone heiss et al 2017 kim et al 2017 seidel et al 2015 vandenbohede and lebbe 2006 thereby significantly saving computation time e g see supporting information of seidel et al 2015 the so computed water residence times within the ste see results were in very good agreement to those identified by previous tide resolved numerical groundwater flow and transport modeling of beck et al 2017 at the same site note that in beck et al 2007 the tide resolved simulation time was a little under 2 years ensuring that the simulation results were at a dynamic equilibrium and independent from the initial conditions the residence times presented in beck et al 2017 were calculated by particle tracking from the dynamic flow field an approach different to the simulation of the tritium transport and decay in this study we calculated the phase averaged hydraulic heads with respect to the averaged topography and a generic diurnal tide signal with a mean tidal amplitude of 1 37 m as illustrated in fig 4 thereby we accounted for the decline of the groundwater table below the beach surface at the hwl and the ridge during the time when the beach surface at the respective location was not inundated at the hwl we employed a mean decline of 20 cm while at the top of the ridge three different decline scenarios were considered declines of dcl 0 cm scenario 1 dcl 10 cm scenario 2 and dcl 20 cm scenario 3 this was done in order to reflect that the ridge has a variably height during the year affecting the strength of the local groundwater divide at that location with this the phase averaged head calculated for scenario 3 20 cm decline deviated 7 cm from the phase averaged head for scenario 1 zero decline as illustrated in figure s 4 towards the exfiltration areas ex 1 and ex 2 fig 4 the decline of the groundwater table during ebb tide gradually decreases and approaches zero at the transition from infiltration to exfiltration areas the fixed heads along in 1 were computed by linear interpolation between the phase averaged head at the hwl and the phase averaged head at transition point in 1 ex 1 the fixed heads along in 2 were computed by spline interpolation between the phase averaged heads at the top of the ridge and the two transition points in 2 ex 1 and in 2 ex 2 respectively this was done to avoid an abrupt change of the hydraulic gradient at the top of the ridge for the salt transport model a non dispersive flux boundary zheng and bennett 2002 was assigned at the ocean thereby the salt mass flux was calculated from the water flux in or out of the model domain and its respective salinity under inflow conditions the salinity was set to 31 and for outflow conditions it was set to the salinity calculated by the transport model at the respective outflow cell at the upper beach i e above the hwl the top boundary of the flow model was defined as specified flux boundary 2nd type assigning a groundwater recharge rate of 350 mm a 1 for the transport model a non dispersive flux boundary condition was applied where the salinity of the inflowing recharge water was set to zero at the vertical boundary in the south a fresh groundwater inflow from the freshwater lens was implemented as specified flux boundary 2nd type in the flow model in the transport model it was defined as non dispersive flux boundary and assigned a salinity of 0 each the bottom of the aquifer and the northern vertical boundary were defined as no flow boundaries for both the flow and the transport model the initial seawater freshwater interface was set vertically in the middle of the model domain with freshwater in the southern and seawater in the northern part 2 4 1 2 reactive transport of tritium and helium the transport of two tracers was modelled 1 the decaying tritium with its natural decay constant of 0 0562 year 1 2 a fictive non reactive stable tritium equivalent to the sum of 3h and 3hetrit this was done because in the standard version of seawat the daughter product of a decaying substance cannot be directly computed as at this investigated field site the pore water velocities are orders of magnitude above 1 m per year beck et al 2017 the effect of molecular diffusion of 3h and 3he on groundwater age can be neglected at the ocean boundary a concentration of 29 tu was assigned for both stable and decaying tritium based on a sea water sample from march 2017 due to discharge from the nuclear reprocessing plants la hague in the english channel the southern north sea showed a remarkably higher tritium concentration than precipitation did since the late 1990s meyerjürgens 2016 at the upper beach the concentrations of 3h and 3hetrit in the fresh groundwater recharge were set to 11 tu and 0 tu respectively fig s1 based on the stable tritium concentration found in the shallowest groundwater monitoring wells within the freshwater lens seibert et al 2018 the freshwater arriving from the island s freshwater lens was characterized by depth dependent stable and decaying tritium concentrations with 3h 9 tu and 3h 3he 11 tu age 4 years in the shallowest part and 3h 7 tu and 3h 3he 123 tu close to the deepest part of the aquifer age 51 years seibert et al 2018 based on these values stable and decaying tritium concentrations along the vertical freshwater inflow boundary were assigned by linear interpolation as illustrated in fig s1b the initial concentrations of tritium and helium were set to 1 tu for all model cells in order to prevent numerical errors with an initial concentration of 0 tu a relatively long simulation time of 60 years was selected in order to cover an extended time scale of residence times which were expected to occur within the ste at the study site 2 4 1 3 simulation cases in total 54 different model cases were set up in order to assess the model uncertainty and sensitivity against variation in model parameters the following parameters were varied 1 longitudinal dispersivity αl 1 2 and 4 m and 2 vertical transversal dispersivity αvt 0 01 0 1 and 0 4 m 3 horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh 5 5 11 and 22 m d 1 and 4 terrestrial fresh groundwater flux qf 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 m3 d 1m 1 to the authors knowledge these values cover a realistic range for parameters which influence the groundwater flow patterns in a ste below sandy beaches greskowiak 2014 robinson et al 2007 and at this site beck et al 2017 the cases also include the three different scenarios that varied the strength of groundwater divide via the decline of the water table below the ridge in a first batch of 27 simulations only the longitudinal and vertical dispersivities were varied while leaving the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and the fresh groundwater flux constant at kh 11 m d 1 and qf 0 5 m3 d 1 m 1 which were previously identified by model calibration at the same site by beck et al 2017 for the second batch of 27 simulations kh and qf were varied and αl and αvt were fixed to 4 m and 0 4 m respectively note that the selected dispersivities especially αvt were noticeably higher than in other beach simulations beck et al 2017 röper et al 2015 vandenbohede and lebbe 2006 this was done because recent investigations of rau et al 2018 showed that in wave affected beach aquifers the apparent dispersion is considerably higher than in typically less dynamic terrestrial aquifers according to rau et al 2018 this must be regarded as an additional factor in beach transport models in order to quantify mixing and biogeochemical processes in this highly dynamic zone correctly for all the 54 simulations the vertical anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity was set to 2 as previously calibrated by beck et al 2017 the porosity was set to 0 3 röper et al 2015 and the aquifer was assumed to be homogenous all model parameters are given in table s1 3 results discussion 3 1 topography salinity and 3h 3he ages as described before in flemming and davis 1994 and seen in waska et al 2019 the ridge and runnel system at the study site exists throughout the entire year however the shape and location of this system seems to vary likely depending on prior storm floods or the actual weather wind conditions fig 5 thereby the location of the in and exfiltration areas in the intertidal zone can deviate over several tens of meters and influence the residence times of the groundwater samples taken in march 2017 for example the topography was less pronounced than in october 2016 fig 5 also lower topographic areas of the previous investigation could not be reached due to neap tide low salinities 25 g l 1 in pore water were mainly found in the runnel as well as around the lwl fig 5 compare also waska et al 2019 the apparent 3h 3hetrit ages showed a general increase with decreasing surface elevation at the sampling site for both campaigns in 2016 and 2017 fig 5 the calculated ages in the runnel were between nearly 1 and 8 years p1 p3 p6 p7 table s2 the ages around the lwl varied between 11 and 21 years p4 p5 table s2 in general apparent 3h 3hetrit ages increased with decreasing salinity in the shallow groundwater wells around the lwl the lowest salinity approximately 16 g l 1 was measured around the higher ridge area the apparent 3h 3hetrit age determined was under a year p8 table s2 the intertidal zone of a wave exposed high energy beach is subject to strong dynamics regarding sediment transport and mixing of different endmembers both fresh and saline thereby a simple closed system behavior for the groundwater age cannot be expected phillips and castro 2003 however the measured apparent 3h 3hetrit ages indicate discharge positions into the runnel and lwl as well as infiltrating conditions in the ridge area thus supporting the findings of beck et al 2017 and waska et al 2019 3 2 groundwater flow and transport fig 6 displays the simulated salinity distribution within the studied ste and its sensitivity against changes in model parameters as explained above for the three scenarios of water table decrease at the top of the ridge considering a 0 cm and 10 cm decline in water table below the ridge strong water divide generates the classical picture of a single fdt beneath an usp independent of the selected dispersivity except for case 18 fig 6a in all cases the plume extends up to 30 m vertically and approximately 80 m horizontally and is therefore rather deep in comparison to other studies e g heiss et al 2017 robinson et al 2007 in contrast case 18 αl 4 m and αvt 0 4 m as well as cases with a larger decline in water table on top of the ridge i e 20 cm weak water divide in addition to enhanced dispersive mixing cases 23 to 27 indicate the existence of a second freshwater discharge area towards the lwl this leads to the formation of two separated usps these cases look very similar to the conceptual model proposed by waska et al 2019 for the site fig 3 overall it appears that lower dispersivities lead to a one plume system while higher dispersivities promote the generation of a two plume system in this runnel ridge setup the same is true for a larger and lower decline of the ridge groundwater table respectively all two plume simulations indicate an enlarged first usp starting at the hwl up to a depth of 30 m and a smaller usp under the ridge up to 20 m previous numerical studies of the usp showed that higher density gradients due to smaller dispersive mixing favor free convection and thus the generation of salt fingering flow in the ste greskowiak 2014 röper et al 2015 to a very limited extent this can be also noticed in cases 1 3 10 12 and 19 with αl 4 m and αvt 0 4 m i e cases 28 54 the simulated flow pattern seems rather sensitive to the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and fresh groundwater flux fig 6b expect for case 46 all three scenarios of water table decrease at the top of the ridge in combination with lowest hydraulic conductivity 5 5 m d 1 consistently lead to a one plume system regardless of the selected fresh groundwater flux hydraulic conductivities of at least 11 m d 1 in combination with a small freshwater flux 0 25 m3 d 1 m 1 lead to a two plume system for all water table scenarios whereas greater fluxes occasionally also indicate the one plume system cases 33 36 42 and 51 note that an increase in fresh groundwater flux from the island generally leads to smaller size of recirculation cells e g cases 28 to 30 corresponding simulations of the 3h 3he age distribution in the cross sectional model can be seen in fig s5 for all model cases the measured apparent 3h he3 ages in combination with measured salinities confirm a two plume system with freshwater discharge at the lwl for october 2016 where brackish old groundwater was detected at the lwl fig 5 for march however lower beach areas around the lwl could not be reached because of neap tide it is therefore unclear whether the flat topography at the time lead to a one or two plume system compared to the october results the water age in the runnel was 8 years and thus substantially older and less saline in march this however displays the variability of the system as roughly the same location was sampled in both campaigns in and exfiltrating areas seem to move depending on the ridge position thus migrating within the intertidal zone further it appears that depending on the strength of the local groundwater divide at the ridge there is a tipping point in hydraulic gradients pushing the groundwater flow field either towards a one or a two plume system this switch may happen many times over the year the simulated cases represent therefore quasi steady state conditions in either one or the other state exemplarily model cases 9 and 27 were selected to compare the one plume system to the two plume system with respect to the age distribution in the intertidal zone fig 7 model parameters include a fresh groundwater flow of 0 5 m3 d 1 m 1 to the beach a hydraulic conductivity of 11 m d 1 a longitudinal dispersivity of 4 m and a vertical dispersivity of 0 1 m respectively we chose these cases as the model parameters resemble those identified in the previous modeling exercise of beck et al 2017 except for the slightly larger dispersivity which seems to be more realistic for such a dynamic environment rau et al 2018 the two cases only differ with regard to the decrease of water table 0 versus 20 cm below the ridge within the first usp starting around the hwl the residence times range between weeks and months for both systems getting larger with depth fig 7b this is remarkably higher than identified at other field sites but supported by the simulated 3h 3he ages for example robinson et al 2007 postulated exemplary piston flow ages in the range of days increasing with depth inside the saline plume however the horizontal and vertical extent of the simulated plume was significantly smaller compared to the beach of spiekeroog which additionally shows a relatively flat slope the travel times of the fresh groundwater from the dune base towards the runnel vary between 12 and 16 years depending on the depth of the flow path the fresh proportion that discharges towards the lwl in model case 27 suggests travel times within the ste of about 18 years starting at the dunes as the groundwater of the freshwater lens already is decades old seibert et al 2018 the total freshwater age will of course be larger note that flow velocities drastically increase towards the exfiltration point as soon as the water enters the discharge tube under the ridge residence times show the biggest difference between both systems with up to 24 years in case 9 and 210 days in case 27 for model case 9 the simulated 3h 3he ages indicate older groundwater discharging into the runnel 20 years as compared to case 27 10 years fig 7b this is caused by its higher proportion of old freshwater from the island s lens in case 9 fig 7a however the simulated age distribution seems rather stringent for both cases caused by a very sharp freshwater interface within the simulations hence even small changes in the proportion of recirculating sea water result in younger 3h 3he ages this is supported by field measurements where 3h 3he ages at the same location in the runnel varied between 2 years october 2016 salinity 30 and 8 years march 2017 salinity 20 g l 1 additionally both simulated and measured 3h 3he ages on top of the ridge were under 1 year confirming infiltrating conditions for both the one and two plume system a freshwater discharge contribution around the lwl was only encountered in case 27 confirming measured salinity 16 and calculated 3h 3he ages of up to 21 years in october 2016 model case 9 in turn showed seawater salinity 31 g l 1 and significantly younger groundwater ages around the lwl the relation between apparent 3h 3hetrit ages and salinity for the shallow intertidal zone at the study site uppermost model layer is shown in fig 7c for both exfiltration zones runnel lwl of the conceptional model from waska et al 2019 compare figs 3 and 4 simulated salinity and apparent 3h 3hetrit ages fluctuated between 15 g l 1 and seawater salinity 31 g l 1 and 0 and 25 years respectively in general both simulated and measured 3h 3hetrit ages increase with decreasing salinity whereby the two plume system showed a better correlation we assume mixing of freshwater with different ages from the lens vertically age stratification according to seibert et al 2018 inside the fdt which then mixes with the young saltwater of the usp and the very old saltwater from the saltwater wedge the porewater salinity data of the study of waska et al 2019 i e data from the three field campaigns was projected onto the model transect and compared to the simulated salinity in 25 cm depths fig 8 due to morphological changes from one sampling campaign to the other infiltration and exfiltration zones shift over time thus overlap of these zones is expected and can be well seen in fig 8 this was most notable for the runnel area nevertheless especially the october 2016 and august 2017 campaigns show many data points of lower salinities plotting in both the runnel and lwl area while in the ridge area there are fewer of such points this promotes the conceptual model of a two plume system e g case 27 rather than a one plume system where all freshwater discharges in the runnel e g case 9 the respective 3h 3he ages in the groundwater in the runnel and at the lwl can be attributed to a higher freshwater proportion in the sample the use of an averaged topography leads for all model cases to relatively fixed and distinct discharge points the fact that the study site is highly dynamic and constantly undergoes sediment redistribution results in a highly dynamic beach morphology the effect on the groundwater flow is yet unclear the same applies for waves spring and neap tides or storm floods therefore moving discharge areas and or change from one to two plume system as well as an overlapping of these scenarios are possible in order to evaluate to what degree tide resolved simulations including wave setup would lead to different simulation results than a tide averaged model especially with respect to the groundwater ages additional tide resolved simulations with and without wave setup were carried out fig s6 this was done exemplarily for model case 27 as it resembles the conceptual model proposed by waska et al 2019 well although the shape and extension of both plumes were slightly different for tide averaged and tide resolved with and without wave setup estimated groundwater ages based on the transport of 3h and stable 3h were comparable for both the recirculation cells and the freshwater discharge tubes the tide resolved simulation led to more dispersion due to the fluctuating flow field therefore the simulated higher freshwater related groundwater age at the lwl was somewhat lowered due to increased mixing with the younger water from the usp in the tide resolved case 27c with wave setup the upstream usp between hwl and runnel occupied a larger volume compared to case 27b without wave setup this effect is a result of higher water flux within the usp when wave setup is considered e g xin et al 2010 as the combined increase of water flux and flow through area have a compensating effect with respect to the residence time simulated groundwater ages in case 27b and case 27c were quite similar overall the cases 27a b and c give a coherent picture thus a tide averaged 1st type boundary at the aquifer ocean interface seems to be sufficient to simulate the principle salinity distribution and groundwater age patterns for boundary conditions that resemble those of the here investigated field site 3 3 calculated sgd rates adequate sgd mass export calculation requires detailed knowledge with respect to the volumes of water discharging into the ocean the model chosen case 27 appeared to be the most realistic one based on shallow salinity measurements and the conceptional model proposed by waska et al 2019 thus this model was used to estimate the water flux through the ste per 1 m of shoreline the total amount of discharging groundwater is 5 5 m3 per m per day the fresh proportion is given by the southern inland boundary condition and fresh groundwater recharge at the upper beach with 0 7 m3 per m per day modelled seawater circulating through the plumes is 4 m3 per m per day the remaining sgd proportion i e 0 8 m3 per m per day is delivered from the saltwater wegde a comparison to the one plume system case 9 reveals that the summarized volumes circulating through the ste are nearly the same for both simulations but differ with respect to the fresh endmember s proportion in the respective exfiltration area to assess the relevance of sgd both fresh and salty on a larger scale water fluxes from case 27 were assumed to be representative for the beaches of all barrier islands that are facing the open north sea and are connected to a freshwater lens therefore the rates were extrapolated to the entire east frisian barrier island chain from borkum to wangerooge covering a length of approximately 56 km based on previous estimations from beck et al 2017 compared to the combined discharge of the rivers ems weser and elbe into the german bright which is about 1200 m3 per second becker et al 1999 the sgd proportion fresh and salty from the east frisian barrier island chain is 0 3 of the riverine discharge this first comparison shows that concentrations of nutrients or trace metals that enter the north sea via sgd must reach concentrations of more than 100 fold higher to become nearly as relevant as riverine inputs 4 conclusions and limitations the focus of this study is on groundwater flow and transport within the intertidal zone it provides insights into the age and salinity distribution within a ste at a meso tidal high energy beach it is the first study so far presenting measured and modelled 3h 3he ages of the discharging groundwater in the intertidal zone brackish water samples in topographically lower areas were up to 21 years old and older than those in the other beach compartments residence times within the usp were estimated to be between weeks and several months freshwater from the islands freshwater lens remains up to 18 years in the ste before exfiltrating at the discharge locations the results confirm the existence of two at least temporally occurring saltwater recirculation cells in the ste accompanied by two fresh discharge locations at the lwl and the runnel as first proposed by waska et al 2019 it was possible to explain the observed field data by a realistic numerical representation of the investigated ste model results were highly dependent on the varied model parameters dispersivity hydraulic conductivity and fresh groundwater flux strong morphodynamics make alternations between one and two plume systems as well as overlapping conditions likely at the study site our findings provide a basis for future investigations with respect to groundwater flow and transport behavior within the ste in this study both numerical simulations and field data suggest that the tidally influenced ste effected by topographical ups and downs in the intertidal zone is not limited to one recirculation cell as the runnel and ridge beach morphology is not unique to spiekeroog but occurs globally e g vandenbohede and lebbe 2007 the results are likely transferable to other coastal regions mixing of different waters at the salt freshwater interface their contact time as well as the residence times within the usp influence to what extent hydrobiogeochemical reactions occur in the ste e g anwar et al 2014 heiss et al 2017 two or more upss elongate the fresh saline interfaces as well as subsurface residence times thus it can be assumed that biogeochemical turnover and the extent of reactions are larger in two or more plume systems which may have important implications on the solute mass fluxes across the aquifer ocean interface in the intertidal zone note that for limitations with regard to computational power and time neither storm floods nor spring and neap tides or waves were considered in our approach however exemplarily tide resolved simulations with and without wave setup showed that the effect of waves on the residence times and groundwater age pattern is not very pronounced and that the chosen model approach seems to be sufficient to simulate the salinity and 3h 3he age distribution at the here investigated field site the fact that the physical model parameters hydraulic conductivity effective porosity dispersivity were assumed to be homogenous for the whole study site is of course a simplification a larger number of salinity and age measurements in greater depths are required to enable continuous improvement of transport models additional measurements of beach topography should be conducted and implemented dynamically mutable head calculation in the model the same is true for spring neap tide and wave information all in all further investigation with respect to salinities

5401,in this study 3h 3he ages in the intertidal zone based on both field measurements and numerical simulations are presented to provide insights into the flow and transport behavior within the subterranean estuary of a meso tidal high energy beach in a systematic modelling approach important hydrogeological parameters dispersivity hydraulic conductivity and fresh groundwater flux were varied in a cross shore transect at a beach on spiekeroog island in north western germany both measured and simulated salinity and age distribution within the intertidal zone suggest the existence of two at least temporally occurring saltwater recirculation cells accompanied by two fresh discharge location this is in contrast to the state of the art concept of a ste under tidal influence and is caused by a runnel and ridge system at the study site which is a rather wide spread type of beach morphology with topographical highs and interfering lows in the intertidal zone residence times within the two saline plumes were between weeks and several months freshwater from the island s freshwater lens resided up to 18 years in the brackish beach aquifer before exfiltrating at the discharge points field measurements confirmed the discharge of decade old water at the discharge points model results were highly dependent on the tested model parameters a change between a one and two plume system as well as overlapping conditions at the study site dependent on the change in beach topography are likely keywords subterranean estuary high energy beach meso tidal 3h 3he ages submarine

zone between land and ocean is of great importance especially in view of a rising sea level robinson et al 2018 coastal aquifers are characterized by the presence of terrestrial fresh groundwater and circulating seawater thereby terrestrial groundwater can contain elevated concentrations of nutrients which locally effect coastal ecosystems burnett et al 2003 cho et al 2018 moore 1999 valiela et al

2014 or santos et al 2009 the redistribution in beach sediments can be large especially under high energy conditions thereby the interplay between wave energy beach slope tidal range and sediment size

amplitude wave heights beach slope and aquifer depth e g abarca et al 2013 evans and wilson 2016 greskowiak 2014 heiss and michael 2014 michael et al 2005 robinson et al 2007 röper et al 2015 residence times of the water recirculating in the usp were generally found to be small ranging from days to weeks abarca et al 2013 anschutz et al 2009 heiss and michael 2014 michael et al 2005 robinson et al 2007 but can be also in the range of months beck et al 2017 lenkopane et al 2009 and even years seidel et al 2015 depending on the hydrogeological setting nevertheless meteoric groundwater arriving at the fdt is typically older with groundwater ages mostly in the order of years to many decades as shown in simulations by seidel et al 2015 and beck et al 2017 numerical simulations also showed that recirculated seawater from the saltwater wedge discharging below the lwl is considerably older ranging from decades beck et al 2017 robinson et al 2007 xin et al 2010 to centuries seidel et al 2017 and even millennia in case of offshore sgd post et al 2013 the mixing of different waters of distinctly different groundwater ages and their interaction with the sediment makes the ste a highly reactive bioreactor largely controlling the offshore sgd s water composition anschutz et al 2009 kim et al 2017 mcallister et al 2015 seidel et al 2015 quantification of the reactive processes requires a quantitative understanding of the residence times and mixing in the ste so far residence times in the ste have mostly been estimated by means of numerical modeling except in a very few cases i e in the studies of abarca et al 2013 and heiss et al 2014 where the residence times within the usp were deduced from tracer experiments with uranine na fluorescein and bromide respectively in both of these cases a rather shallow and small usp and a calm micro tidal environment were present posing ideal conditions for successful carrying out a tracer experiment within a short time frame and with a high chance of tracer detection along the flow path and discharge location in meso to macro tidal environments and high energy wave conditions however tracer experiments are likely to fail due to the strong dynamics of such systems a method for estimating water residence times in aquifers is age dating with environmental tracers like radioactive isotopes or inert substances of anthropogenic origin cffs sf6 a suitable tracer for younger groundwater of ages up to 60 years is tritium 3h in combination with its decay product helium 3he it provides an age measure independent of the tritium input cook and solomon 1997 tritium was released between the late 1950s and early 1960s in high amounts mainly into the stratosphere by thermonuclear bomb tests schlosser et al 1988 the method generates the so called apparent 3h 3he age of the groundwater sample i e the time the sampled water resided in the aquifer without contact to the atmosphere in the last 30 years numerous groundwater investigations used this approach to date groundwater bodies and delineate flow patterns e g darling et al 2017 massmann et al 2009 post et al 2013 röper et al 2012 schlosser et al 1988 solomon and sudicky 1991 all these studies investigated rather steady low dynamic systems so far this technique has not been applied to date groundwater and resolve flow patterns in highly dynamic environments such as stes at high energy beaches where groundwater of different origins and ages mixes in the presented study we aim to resolve and understand the groundwater flow patterns and residence times at a meso tidal high energy beach based on observed salinity distributions and measured apparent 3h 3he ages in combination with explorative field scale numerical density dependent groundwater flow modeling we hypothesize that the observed field data can be explained by a realistic numerical representation of the investigated ste further we aim to understand the sensitivity of groundwater flow and salinity patterns as well as groundwater ages to intertidal topography and hydrogeological parameters e g hydrodynamic dispersivity or meteoric groundwater flux as we hypothesize that these will have an impact especially in high energy systems the investigated field site located at the northern beach of spiekeroog island germany serves as an ideal example for meso tidal high energy conditions waska et al 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and previous work the presented study was conducted in the intertidal zone at the northern beach of spiekeroog which is part of the east frisian island chain and located in front of the north german coastline fig 2 spiekeroog has a size of approximately 21 km2 and is separated from other islands by the otzumer inlet in the west and the harle inlet in the east streif 1990 precipitation averages around 808 mm a 1 oowv 2012 and infiltrates almost immediately into the dunes which consist of fine to medium grained holocene sands above pleistocene deposits streif 1990 surface runoff is negligible and based on previous tritium helium age data röper et al 2012 calculated a mean groundwater recharge rate of 350 mm a 1 for spiekeroog groundwater recharge feeds a freshwater lens which is also used for the islands drinking water production at a depth of about 40 m below sea level a clay layer confines the lens towards its base röper et al 2012 the lens exhibits groundwater ages of up to 51 years seibert et al 2018 exfiltration of the lens freshwater was observed in the intertidal zone of the northern beach investigated in this study waska et al 2019 the beach is affected by semidiurnal tides with a tidal range of 2 7 m which corresponds to meso tidal conditions beck et al 2017 according to dobrynin et al 2010 the offshore wave spectrum generally fluctuates between 0 5 and 2 m and up to 11 m during storm conditions the northern beach facing the open north sea is characterized by shoreline parallel sand banks and troughs flemming and davis 1994 which we in the following refer to as runnel ridge type although the criteria of king and williams 1949 are not completely fulfilled with respect to macro tidal conditions at the study site the runnel is present in approximately 50 to 70 m distance from the hwl followed by a sandbar ridge in approximately 100 to 200 m distance beck et al 2017 waska et al 2019 fig 3 the ridge is always inundated during high tide and exposed during low tide due to the strong morphodynamics at this site runnel and ridge do not have a stable position instead they relocate and are variably distinct within the course of a year waska et al 2019 for the study site beck et al 2017 described the typical hydrological zonation with an usp a fdt and a saltwater wedge fig 1 observed salinity patterns in may 2014 and numerical modeling along a cross shore transect suggested that all fresh groundwater from the freshwater lens discharges into the runnel this was explained by the presence of the ridge acting as local groundwater divide during non inundated times preventing the arriving fresh groundwater from flowing towards the lwl further seaward in contrast extended hydrogeochemical investigations of waska et al 2019 who sampled the intertidal zone over a 200 200 m grid for three consecutive times october 2016 march 2017 and august 2017 found patches of brackish water down to 16 psu at the lwl this suggests that the groundwater divide at the ridge is less strong and or less stable than previously thought allowing some of the fresh groundwater to pass underneath the ridge and pinch out at the lwl while some seems to discharge into the runnel this indicates that the fdt splits up within the ste presumably into two main branches waska et al 2019 fig 3 nevertheless observed salinity patterns in the intertidal zone were rather complex occasionally low salinity spots were even found at the top of the ridge waska et al 2019 this indicates that other processes e g strong morphodynamics density dependent flow as well as heterogeneity of aquifer properties further complicate the overall groundwater flow patterns waska et al 2019 2 2 sampling shallow monitoring wells high density polyethylene ø 63 mm were installed along two south north orientated transects from hwl to lwl during three campaigns in october 2016 march 2017 and august 2017 their filter screens extended from 50 to 100 cm below beach surface in order to reduce sand accumulation inside the piezometers a filter sleeve was used the piezometers were partially equipped with data loggers schlumberger ctd electrical conductivity temperature and depth diver to measure electric conductivity temperature and pressure with a frequency of five minutes august 2017 based on the method of stuyfzand 1993 the electrical conductivity was converted into salinity g l 1 1 salinity f e c 25 whereby e c 25 describes the measured electric conductivity μs cm 1 of the water sample at 25 c f is a conversion factor which was found to be 0 6768 at spiekeroog according to holt et al 2017 in october 2016 and march 2017 samples for tritium and helium isotopes were taken with a submersible pump eijkelkamp and collected in 1 l pe polyethylene bottles for tritium and 40 ml copper tubes for helium analysis the tube volume was exchanged several times before the actual sampling was conducted to prevent degassing a transparent tube with a hose clamp was attached to the outlet of the copper tube in order to increase the pressure in the tube while flushing the copper tubes were pinched off starting at the outlet duplicates were taken for the noble gas measurements despite of the use of a submersible pump differences in gas concentration of duplicates were 1 for 3he 4he and ne analysis was conducted at the university of bremen based on the method described in sültenfuß et al 2009 2 3 calculation of apparent 3h 3he ages tritium concentrations in water are commonly reported as tu

component have to be separated to determine the 3he produced from tritium decay 3hetrit sültenfuß and massmann 2004 in this study no terrigenic nor mantle helium was detected the sum of 3h and 3he is referred to as stable tritium 2 4 numerical model several model cases were set up with the density dependent groundwater flow model seawat langevin et al 2008 seawat couples the groundwater flow simulation software modflow 2000 harbaugh et al 2000 and the transport simulator mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 and has been successfully used in many previous ste studies before greskowiak 2014 heiss et al 2017 robinson et al 2006 a two dimensional vertical cross section model from the dune base towards the sea including the study site was created for simulating the groundwater flow as well as the salt transport and the tritium decay to helium note that the simplified model was not subject to calibration rather in an explorative manner many simulations were carried out for a realistic and reasonable range of model parameter values as specified further below and discussed with respect to the observed field data 2 4 1 model concept and setup the horizontal extent of the model domain was 700 m starting from the dune base with a horizontal cell size of 2 5 m fig s1 in vertical direction the model extended to a depth of 40 m below sea level where a continuous clay layer functioning as an aquitard is expected röper et al 2012 the vertical discretization varied from 0 5 m in the shallow part to 1 m in the deepest part of the aquifer a higher resolution was chosen in the upper model part in order to facilitate a comparison to the shallow piezometers that were installed during the field campaigns the top of the model was set equal to the average topography that was measured during three field campaigns in october 2016 march 2017 and august 2017 fig s2 with a stonex s9 iii plus gnss differential gps waska et al 2019 hence we did not account for a transient intertidal topography the reasons for this were that i we did not have continuous topography data but data from three field campaigns only with a gap of several months in between and ii the characteristic topographic feature of this site i e the runnel ridge system appears to be always present beck et al 2017 waska et al 2019 2 4 1 1 flow and salt transport boundary conditions it was previously shown that the hydraulic heads in the shallow beach aquifer are strongly linked to the intertidal topography and the actual seawater level e g heiss and michael 2014 riedel et al 2010 vandenbohede et al 2005 vandenbohede and lebbe 2006 2007 this was also found at the here investigated field site during falling tide the hydraulic heads follow the tidal signal until they reach the respective topographic height and subsequently stay constant at this height even though the tidal signal decreases further fig s3 deviations were observed in the expected infiltration areas around the hwl infiltration area in 1 and at the top of the ridge infiltration area in 2 at these locations the measured groundwater table declined slowly beyond the respective topographic height down to 36 cm at the hwl and 16 cm at the top of the ridge fig s3 the hydraulic heads recovered and started to increase as soon as the seawater level exceeded the surface level during rising tide to be able to carry out long term simulations in the order of decades in a reasonable time frame we employed phase averaged fixed heads 1st type at the ocean boundary i e at the top of the model on the stretch from the hwl to 700 m from the dune base encompassing the intertidal zone fig s1 this approach has previously been found to adequately simulate the mean groundwater flow field in the intertidal zone heiss et al 2017 kim et al 2017 seidel et al 2015 vandenbohede and lebbe 2006 thereby significantly saving computation time e g see supporting information of seidel et al 2015 the so computed water residence times within the ste see results were in very good agreement to those identified by previous tide resolved numerical groundwater flow and transport modeling of beck et al 2017 at the same site note that in beck et al 2007 the tide resolved simulation time was a little under 2 years ensuring that the simulation results were at a dynamic equilibrium and independent from the initial conditions the residence times presented in beck et al 2017 were calculated by particle tracking from the dynamic flow field an approach different to the simulation of the tritium transport and decay in this study we calculated the phase averaged hydraulic heads with respect to the averaged topography and a generic diurnal tide signal with a mean tidal amplitude of 1 37 m as illustrated in fig 4 thereby we accounted for the decline of the groundwater table below the beach surface at the hwl and the ridge during the time when the beach surface at the respective location was not inundated at the hwl we employed a mean decline of 20 cm while at the top of the ridge three different decline scenarios were considered declines of dcl 0 cm scenario 1 dcl 10 cm scenario 2 and dcl 20 cm scenario 3 this was done in order to reflect that the ridge has a variably height during the year affecting the strength of the local groundwater divide at that location with this the phase averaged head calculated for scenario 3 20 cm decline deviated 7 cm from the phase averaged head for scenario 1 zero decline as illustrated in figure s 4 towards the exfiltration areas ex 1 and ex 2 fig 4 the decline of the groundwater table during ebb tide gradually decreases and approaches zero at the transition from infiltration to exfiltration areas the fixed heads along in 1 were computed by linear interpolation between the phase averaged head at the hwl and the phase averaged head at transition point in 1 ex 1 the fixed heads along in 2 were computed by spline interpolation between the phase averaged heads at the top of the ridge and the two transition points in 2 ex 1 and in 2 ex 2 respectively this was done to avoid an abrupt change of the hydraulic gradient at the top of the ridge for the salt transport model a non dispersive flux boundary zheng and bennett 2002 was assigned at the ocean thereby the salt mass flux was calculated from the water flux in or out of the model domain and its respective salinity under inflow conditions the salinity was set to 31 and for outflow conditions it was set to the salinity calculated by the transport model at the respective outflow cell at the upper beach i e above the hwl the top boundary of the flow model was defined as specified flux boundary 2nd type assigning a groundwater recharge rate of 350 mm a 1 for the transport model a non dispersive flux boundary condition was applied where the salinity of the inflowing recharge water was set to zero at the vertical boundary in the south a fresh groundwater inflow from the freshwater lens was implemented as specified flux boundary 2nd type in the flow model in the transport model it was defined as non dispersive flux boundary and assigned a salinity of 0 each the bottom of the aquifer and the northern vertical boundary were defined as no flow boundaries for both the flow and the transport model the initial seawater freshwater interface was set vertically in the middle of the model domain with freshwater in the southern and seawater in the northern part 2 4 1 2 reactive transport of tritium and helium the transport of two tracers was modelled 1 the decaying tritium with its natural decay constant of 0 0562 year 1 2 a fictive non reactive stable tritium equivalent to the sum of 3h and 3hetrit this was done because in the standard version of seawat the daughter product of a decaying substance cannot be directly computed as at this investigated field site the pore water velocities are orders of magnitude above 1 m per year beck et al 2017 the effect of molecular diffusion of 3h and 3he on groundwater age can be neglected at the ocean boundary a concentration of 29 tu was assigned for both stable and decaying tritium based on a sea water sample from march 2017 due to discharge from the nuclear reprocessing plants la hague in the english channel the southern north sea showed a remarkably higher tritium concentration than precipitation did since the late 1990s meyerjürgens 2016 at the upper beach the concentrations of 3h and 3hetrit in the fresh groundwater recharge were set to 11 tu and 0 tu respectively fig s1 based on the stable tritium concentration found in the shallowest groundwater monitoring wells within the freshwater lens seibert et al 2018 the freshwater arriving from the island s freshwater lens was characterized by depth dependent stable and decaying tritium concentrations with 3h 9 tu and 3h 3he 11 tu age 4 years in the shallowest part and 3h 7 tu and 3h 3he 123 tu close to the deepest part of the aquifer age 51 years seibert et al 2018 based on these values stable and decaying tritium concentrations along the vertical freshwater inflow boundary were assigned by linear interpolation as illustrated in fig s1b the initial concentrations of tritium and helium were set to 1 tu for all model cells in order to prevent numerical errors with an initial concentration of 0 tu a relatively long simulation time of 60 years was selected in order to cover an extended time scale of residence times which were expected to occur within the ste at the study site 2 4 1 3 simulation cases in total 54 different model cases were set up in order to assess the model uncertainty and sensitivity against variation in model parameters the following parameters were varied 1 longitudinal dispersivity αl 1 2 and 4 m and 2 vertical transversal dispersivity αvt 0 01 0 1 and 0 4 m 3 horizontal hydraulic conductivity kh 5 5 11 and 22 m d 1 and 4 terrestrial fresh groundwater flux qf 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 m3 d 1m 1 to the authors knowledge these values cover a realistic range for parameters which influence the groundwater flow patterns in a ste below sandy beaches greskowiak 2014 robinson et al 2007 and at this site beck et al 2017 the cases also include the three different scenarios that varied the strength of groundwater divide via the decline of the water table below the ridge in a first batch of 27 simulations only the longitudinal and vertical dispersivities were varied while leaving the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and the fresh groundwater flux constant at kh 11 m d 1 and qf 0 5 m3 d 1 m 1 which were previously identified by model calibration at the same site by beck et al 2017 for the second batch of 27 simulations kh and qf were varied and αl and αvt were fixed to 4 m and 0 4 m respectively note that the selected dispersivities especially αvt were noticeably higher than in other beach simulations beck et al 2017 röper et al 2015 vandenbohede and lebbe 2006 this was done because recent investigations of rau et al 2018 showed that in wave affected beach aquifers the apparent dispersion is considerably higher than in typically less dynamic terrestrial aquifers according to rau et al 2018 this must be regarded as an additional factor in beach transport models in order to quantify mixing and biogeochemical processes in this highly dynamic zone correctly for all the 54 simulations the vertical anisotropy of the hydraulic conductivity was set to 2 as previously calibrated by beck et al 2017 the porosity was set to 0 3 röper et al 2015 and the aquifer was assumed to be homogenous all model parameters are given in table s1 3 results discussion 3 1 topography salinity and 3h 3he ages as described before in flemming and davis 1994 and seen in waska et al 2019 the ridge and runnel system at the study site exists throughout the entire year however the shape and location of this system seems to vary likely depending on prior storm floods or the actual weather wind conditions fig 5 thereby the location of the in and exfiltration areas in the intertidal zone can deviate over several tens of meters and influence the residence times of the groundwater samples taken in march 2017 for example the topography was less pronounced than in october 2016 fig 5 also lower topographic areas of the previous investigation could not be reached due to neap tide low salinities 25 g l 1 in pore water were mainly found in the runnel as well as around the lwl fig 5 compare also waska et al 2019 the apparent 3h 3hetrit ages showed a general increase with decreasing surface elevation at the sampling site for both campaigns in 2016 and 2017 fig 5 the calculated ages in the runnel were between nearly 1 and 8 years p1 p3 p6 p7 table s2 the ages around the lwl varied between 11 and 21 years p4 p5 table s2 in general apparent 3h 3hetrit ages increased with decreasing salinity in the shallow groundwater wells around the lwl the lowest salinity approximately 16 g l 1 was measured around the higher ridge area the apparent 3h 3hetrit age determined was under a year p8 table s2 the intertidal zone of a wave exposed high energy beach is subject to strong dynamics regarding sediment transport and mixing of different endmembers both fresh and saline thereby a simple closed system behavior for the groundwater age cannot be expected phillips and castro 2003 however the measured apparent 3h 3hetrit ages indicate discharge positions into the runnel and lwl as well as infiltrating conditions in the ridge area thus supporting the findings of beck et al 2017 and waska et al 2019 3 2 groundwater flow and transport fig 6 displays the simulated salinity distribution within the studied ste and its sensitivity against changes in model parameters as explained above for the three scenarios of water table decrease at the top of the ridge considering a 0 cm and 10 cm decline in water table below the ridge strong water divide generates the classical picture of a single fdt beneath an usp independent of the selected dispersivity except for case 18 fig 6a in all cases the plume extends up to 30 m vertically and approximately 80 m horizontally and is therefore rather deep in comparison to other studies e g heiss et al 2017 robinson et al 2007 in contrast case 18 αl 4 m and αvt 0 4 m as well as cases with a larger decline in water table on top of the ridge i e 20 cm weak water divide in addition to enhanced dispersive mixing cases 23 to 27 indicate the existence of a second freshwater discharge area towards the lwl this leads to the formation of two separated usps these cases look very similar to the conceptual model proposed by waska et al 2019 for the site fig 3 overall it appears that lower dispersivities lead to a one plume system while higher dispersivities promote the generation of a two plume system in this runnel ridge setup the same is true for a larger and lower decline of the ridge groundwater table respectively all two plume simulations indicate an enlarged first usp starting at the hwl up to a depth of 30 m and a smaller usp under the ridge up to 20 m previous numerical studies of the usp showed that higher density gradients due to smaller dispersive mixing favor free convection and thus the generation of salt fingering flow in the ste greskowiak 2014 röper et al 2015 to a very limited extent this can be also noticed in cases 1 3 10 12 and 19 with αl 4 m and αvt 0 4 m i e cases 28 54 the simulated flow pattern seems rather sensitive to the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and fresh groundwater flux fig 6b expect for case 46 all three scenarios of water table decrease at the top of the ridge in combination with lowest hydraulic conductivity 5 5 m d 1 consistently lead to a one plume system regardless of the selected fresh groundwater flux hydraulic conductivities of at least 11 m d 1 in combination with a small freshwater flux 0 25 m3 d 1 m 1 lead to a two plume system for all water table scenarios whereas greater fluxes occasionally also indicate the one plume system cases 33 36 42 and 51 note that an increase in fresh groundwater flux from the island generally leads to smaller size of recirculation cells e g cases 28 to 30 corresponding simulations of the 3h 3he age distribution in the cross sectional model can be seen in fig s5 for all model cases the measured apparent 3h he3 ages in combination with measured salinities confirm a two plume system with freshwater discharge at the lwl for october 2016 where brackish old groundwater was detected at the lwl fig 5 for march however lower beach areas around the lwl could not be reached because of neap tide it is therefore unclear whether the flat topography at the time lead to a one or two plume system compared to the october results the water age in the runnel was 8 years and thus substantially older and less saline in march this however displays the variability of the system as roughly the same location was sampled in both campaigns in and exfiltrating areas seem to move depending on the ridge position thus migrating within the intertidal zone further it appears that depending on the strength of the local groundwater divide at the ridge there is a tipping point in hydraulic gradients pushing the groundwater flow field either towards a one or a two plume system this switch may happen many times over the year the simulated cases represent therefore quasi steady state conditions in either one or the other state exemplarily model cases 9 and 27 were selected to compare the one plume system to the two plume system with respect to the age distribution in the intertidal zone fig 7 model parameters include a fresh groundwater flow of 0 5 m3 d 1 m 1 to the beach a hydraulic conductivity of 11 m d 1 a longitudinal dispersivity of 4 m and a vertical dispersivity of 0 1 m respectively we chose these cases as the model parameters resemble those identified in the previous modeling exercise of beck et al 2017 except for the slightly larger dispersivity which seems to be more realistic for such a dynamic environment rau et al 2018 the two cases only differ with regard to the decrease of water table 0 versus 20 cm below the ridge within the first usp starting around the hwl the residence times range between weeks and months for both systems getting larger with depth fig 7b this is remarkably higher than identified at other field sites but supported by the simulated 3h 3he ages for example robinson et al 2007 postulated exemplary piston flow ages in the range of days increasing with depth inside the saline plume however the horizontal and vertical extent of the simulated plume was significantly smaller compared to the beach of spiekeroog which additionally shows a relatively flat slope the travel times of the fresh groundwater from the dune base towards the runnel vary between 12 and 16 years depending on the depth of the flow path the fresh proportion that discharges towards the lwl in model case 27 suggests travel times within the ste of about 18 years starting at the dunes as the groundwater of the freshwater lens already is decades old seibert et al 2018 the total freshwater age will of course be larger note that flow velocities drastically increase towards the exfiltration point as soon as the water enters the discharge tube under the ridge residence times show the biggest difference between both systems with up to 24 years in case 9 and 210 days in case 27 for model case 9 the simulated 3h 3he ages indicate older groundwater discharging into the runnel 20 years as compared to case 27 10 years fig 7b this is caused by its higher proportion of old freshwater from the island s lens in case 9 fig 7a however the simulated age distribution seems rather stringent for both cases caused by a very sharp freshwater interface within the simulations hence even small changes in the proportion of recirculating sea water result in younger 3h 3he ages this is supported by field measurements where 3h 3he ages at the same location in the runnel varied between 2 years october 2016 salinity 30 and 8 years march 2017 salinity 20 g l 1 additionally both simulated and measured 3h 3he ages on top of the ridge were under 1 year confirming infiltrating conditions for both the one and two plume system a freshwater discharge contribution around the lwl was only encountered in case 27 confirming measured salinity 16 and calculated 3h 3he ages of up to 21 years in october 2016 model case 9 in turn showed seawater salinity 31 g l 1 and significantly younger groundwater ages around the lwl the relation between apparent 3h 3hetrit ages and salinity for the shallow intertidal zone at the study site uppermost model layer is shown in fig 7c for both exfiltration zones runnel lwl of the conceptional model from waska et al 2019 compare figs 3 and 4 simulated salinity and apparent 3h 3hetrit ages fluctuated between 15 g l 1 and seawater salinity 31 g l 1 and 0 and 25 years respectively in general both simulated and measured 3h 3hetrit ages increase with decreasing salinity whereby the two plume system showed a better correlation we assume mixing of freshwater with different ages from the lens vertically age stratification according to seibert et al 2018 inside the fdt which then mixes with the young saltwater of the usp and the very old saltwater from the saltwater wedge the porewater salinity data of the study of waska et al 2019 i e data from the three field campaigns was projected onto the model transect and compared to the simulated salinity in 25 cm depths fig 8 due to morphological changes from one sampling campaign to the other infiltration and exfiltration zones shift over time thus overlap of these zones is expected and can be well seen in fig 8 this was most notable for the runnel area nevertheless especially the october 2016 and august 2017 campaigns show many data points of lower salinities plotting in both the runnel and lwl area while in the ridge area there are fewer of such points this promotes the conceptual model of a two plume system e g case 27 rather than a one plume system where all freshwater discharges in the runnel e g case 9 the respective 3h 3he ages in the groundwater in the runnel and at the lwl can be attributed to a higher freshwater proportion in the sample the use of an averaged topography leads for all model cases to relatively fixed and distinct discharge points the fact that the study site is highly dynamic and constantly undergoes sediment redistribution results in a highly dynamic beach morphology the effect on the groundwater flow is yet unclear the same applies for waves spring and neap tides or storm floods therefore moving discharge areas and or change from one to two plume system as well as an overlapping of these scenarios are possible in order to evaluate to what degree tide resolved simulations including wave setup would lead to different simulation results than a tide averaged model especially with respect to the groundwater ages additional tide resolved simulations with and without wave setup were carried out fig s6 this was done exemplarily for model case 27 as it resembles the conceptual model proposed by waska et al 2019 well although the shape and extension of both plumes were slightly different for tide averaged and tide resolved with and without wave setup estimated groundwater ages based on the transport of 3h and stable 3h were comparable for both the recirculation cells and the freshwater discharge tubes the tide resolved simulation led to more dispersion due to the fluctuating flow field therefore the simulated higher freshwater related groundwater age at the lwl was somewhat lowered due to increased mixing with the younger water from the usp in the tide resolved case 27c with wave setup the upstream usp between hwl and runnel occupied a larger volume compared to case 27b without wave setup this effect is a result of higher water flux within the usp when wave setup is considered e g xin et al 2010 as the combined increase of water flux and flow through area have a compensating effect with respect to the residence time simulated groundwater ages in case 27b and case 27c were quite similar overall the cases 27a b and c give a coherent picture thus a tide averaged 1st type boundary at the aquifer ocean interface seems to be sufficient to simulate the principle salinity distribution and groundwater age patterns for boundary conditions that resemble those of the here investigated field site 3 3 calculated sgd rates adequate sgd mass export calculation requires detailed knowledge with respect to the volumes of water discharging into the ocean the model chosen case 27 appeared to be the most realistic one based on shallow salinity measurements and the conceptional model proposed by waska et al 2019 thus this model was used to estimate the water flux through the ste per 1 m of shoreline the total amount of discharging groundwater is 5 5 m3 per m per day the fresh proportion is given by the southern inland boundary condition and fresh groundwater recharge at the upper beach with 0 7 m3 per m per day modelled seawater circulating through the plumes is 4 m3 per m per day the remaining sgd proportion i e 0 8 m3 per m per day is delivered from the saltwater wegde a comparison to the one plume system case 9 reveals that the summarized volumes circulating through the ste are nearly the same for both simulations but differ with respect to the fresh endmember s proportion in the respective exfiltration area to assess the relevance of sgd both fresh and salty on a larger scale water fluxes from case 27 were assumed to be representative for the beaches of all barrier islands that are facing the open north sea and are connected to a freshwater lens therefore the rates were extrapolated to the entire east frisian barrier island chain from borkum to wangerooge covering a length of approximately 56 km based on previous estimations from beck et al 2017 compared to the combined discharge of the rivers ems weser and elbe into the german bright which is about 1200 m3 per second becker et al 1999 the sgd proportion fresh and salty from the east frisian barrier island chain is 0 3 of the riverine discharge this first comparison shows that concentrations of nutrients or trace metals that enter the north sea via sgd must reach concentrations of more than 100 fold higher to become nearly as relevant as riverine inputs 4 conclusions and limitations the focus of this study is on groundwater flow and transport within the intertidal zone it provides insights into the age and salinity distribution within a ste at a meso tidal high energy beach it is the first study so far presenting measured and modelled 3h 3he ages of the discharging groundwater in the intertidal zone brackish water samples in topographically lower areas were up to 21 years old and older than those in the other beach compartments residence times within the usp were estimated to be between weeks and several months freshwater from the islands freshwater lens remains up to 18 years in the ste before exfiltrating at the discharge locations the results confirm the existence of two at least temporally occurring saltwater recirculation cells in the ste accompanied by two fresh discharge locations at the lwl and the runnel as first proposed by waska et al 2019 it was possible to explain the observed field data by a realistic numerical representation of the investigated ste model results were highly dependent on the varied model parameters dispersivity hydraulic conductivity and fresh groundwater flux strong morphodynamics make alternations between one and two plume systems as well as overlapping conditions likely at the study site our findings provide a basis for future investigations with respect to groundwater flow and transport behavior within the ste in this study both numerical simulations and field data suggest that the tidally influenced ste effected by topographical ups and downs in the intertidal zone is not limited to one recirculation cell as the runnel and ridge beach morphology is not unique to spiekeroog but occurs globally e g vandenbohede and lebbe 2007 the results are likely transferable to other coastal regions mixing of different waters at the salt freshwater interface their contact time as well as the residence times within the usp influence to what extent hydrobiogeochemical reactions occur in the ste e g anwar et al 2014 heiss et al 2017 two or more upss elongate the fresh saline interfaces as well as subsurface residence times thus it can be assumed that biogeochemical turnover and the extent of reactions are larger in two or more plume systems which may have important implications on the solute mass fluxes across the aquifer ocean interface in the intertidal zone note that for limitations with regard to computational power and time neither storm floods nor spring and neap tides or waves were considered in our approach however exemplarily tide resolved simulations with and without wave setup showed that the effect of waves on the residence times and groundwater age pattern is not very pronounced and that the chosen model approach seems to be sufficient to simulate the salinity and 3h 3he age distribution at the here investigated field site the fact that the physical model parameters hydraulic conductivity effective porosity dispersivity were assumed to be homogenous for the whole study site is of course a simplification a larger number of salinity and age measurements in greater depths are required to enable continuous improvement of transport models additional measurements of beach topography should be conducted and implemented dynamically mutable head calculation in the model the same is true for spring neap tide and wave information all in all further investigation with respect to salinities

5402,understanding the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall is vital for water resources planning and management flood and drought mitigation and erosion control among others despite the progress in this direction through proposal of many different approaches and their applications to rainfall data at various regions around the world our knowledge of the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall remains limited studies in this direction have largely focused on the amount of rainfall and its spatial patterns and investigations of spatiotemporal variability at multiscale are limited in this study we introduce a novel measure standardized variability index svi based on the concept of entropy to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of gridded rainfall in the indian subcontinent at different timescales the results show distinct spatial patterns in the inter annual rainfall variability at all timescales also the intra annual variability of rainfall amount as well as rainy days is found to increase from east to west of india the mann kendall trend test at different timescales reveals significant increase in rainfall variability in addition coupling the mean annual rainfall with svi enables a relative assessment of the water resources availability keywords rainfall variability marginal entropy apportionment entropy intensity entropy standardized variability index mann kendall test 1 introduction rainfall is the primary component of the hydrological cycle representing the transfer of mass and energy from the earth to the atmosphere and vice versa brunsell 2010 understanding the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall is vital for water resources planning and management flood and drought mitigation and soil erosion control among others coumou rahmstorf 2012 karmakar et al 2017 pendergrass et al 2017 kurths et al 2019 however quantifying the variability of rainfall is a highly challenging task owing to the complex nature of the climatic variables that influence rainfall dynamics and their spatiotemporal variability and nonlinear interactions guntu et al 2020 jin and wang 2017 liu et al 2013 sivakumar et al 2014 yaduvanshi et al 2019 in addition global warming induced climate change has triggered substantial changes in rainfall intensity spatial and temporal distribution and average rainfall amount at various places across the globe as a consequence there have been significant changes in the frequency magnitude and pattern of extreme rainfall related hydrological extremes such as floods and droughts clark 1999 barnett et al 2005 trenberth 2011 loo et al 2015 agilan and umamahesh 2017 furthermore many studies have already proven that the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall dynamics is nonlinear and carry multiscale features that are time varying in nature all these together make the quantification of rainfall variability tedious and demand in depth understanding in the past few decades india has experienced significant spatiotemporal changes in rainfall pattern leading to fewer rainy days and more extreme rainfall which many studies have attributed to global climate change and anthropogenic influences kurths et al 2019 such rainfall extremes have impacted the lives and property in many different ways for instance it was reported that 33 million people had been affected by flooding from 1953 to 2000 the planning commission of india planning commission 2011 reported that 13 78 of india s geographical area is subjected to flood disaster due to extreme rainfall caused by climate change as well as anthropogenic activities in general rainfall variability has substantial impacts on water availability agricultural productivity and welfare of the 1 2 billion people in india goyal and surampalli 2018 jin and wang 2017 because agriculture in india feeds about 17 2 of the global population and more than 56 of the agricultural land is rain fed singh et al 2014 also the indian economy depends on the monsoon rainfall and accounts for 17 of india s gross domestic product gadgil 2003 mishra et al 2012 paul et al 2016 sahany et al 2018 therefore there has been an urgent need to more accurately quantify the variability of rainfall in india towards a more reliable assessment of water availability for irrigation and mitigation of the impacts of floods and droughts in view of this a number of studies have recently attempted to quantify the rainfall variability in india for instance mondal et al 2014 calculated the trend of annual rainfall in india and reported a decreasing trend across the northwestern and peninsular india singh et al 2014 observed a significant decreasing trend 10 significance level in the mean rainfall during the southwest monsoon period june to september from the year 1951 especially in the months of july and august which co occurred with a statistical increase in the daily scale rainfall variability asoka et al 2017 discussed the potential changes in the precipitation patterns and their significant impact on the groundwater storage they reported based on gravity recovery climate experiment data grace a decrease of 2 cm year in groundwater storage in northern india and an increase of 1 2 cm year in southern india despite their importance for modeling rainfall variability in india these studies have mainly focused on the amount of rainfall and its spatial patterns recently sahany et al 2018 analyzed 113 years 1901 2013 of daily rainfall over india to investigate spatiotemporal variability of rainfall seasonality at the monthly time scale fukushima et al 2019 investigated the inter annual variations of seasonal precipitation during southwest monsoon swm and northeast monsoon nem periods in india and their relation to atmospheric circulation to our knowledge rainfall studies investigating the inter annual variability and intra annual variability in particular at multiple time scales for 113 years 1901 2013 for the indian subcontinent are minimal a quantitative assessment of the spatiotemporal variability at multiple time scales using the entropic measures can be of great scientific interest and societal relevance in addition it would be beneficial to develop classification of water resources based on rainfall magnitude and its variability considering a long 113 year period duration these provide the motivation for the present study in general variability is defined as the quality of unevenness and lack of uniformity over different intervals mishra et al 2009 sang et al 2012 spatial variability characterizes the values of a variable at multiple geographic locations in a region whereas temporal variability is the unevenness of a variable over different time intervals there is a plethora of measures in the literature for measuring the variability of a time series including variance diversity indices and information theory based measures mishra et al 2009 in recent years the information theory based measure entropy shannon 1948 has gained significant attention in hydrology and water resources see reviews by singh 1997 2011 owing to their strengths koutsoyiannis 2005 zhang et al 2016 one of the main advantages of entropy based measures is that they do not make any prior assumptions on the probability distribution or statistical properties of the data and thus they are applicable to any type of data maruyama et al 2005 and can be applied to any system pechlivanidis et al 2016 in the field of hydrological engineering entropy has been used for the monitoring and evaluation of rainfall network design see review by keum et al 2017 assessment of hydrological fluxes brunsell 2010 cheng et al 2017 feng et al 2013 gong et al 2014 liu et al 2013 mishra et al 2009 molini et al 2006 pechlivanidis et al 2016 rodrigues da silva et al 2016 roushangar et al 2019 2018 sahany et al 2018 sang et al 2012 tongal and sivakumar 2019 weijs et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2011 spatiotemporal analysis of drought and potential evapotranspiration hao and singh 2013 hong et al 2014 huang et al 2014 hydrologic regionalization and clustering of catchments agarwal et al 2016 roushangar et al 2018 tongal and sivakumar 2017 climate downscaling sehgal et al 2016 complexity analysis of rainfall runoff modeling chen et al 2013 chou 2012 el nino forecasting meng et al 2020 and classification of a region japan into different zones based on rainfall distribution kawachi et al 2001 maruyama et al 2005 in addition chapman 1986 recommended the ratio of mutual information to the marginal entropy as a model performance measure for hydrological processes pachepsky et al 2016 and pechlivanidis et al 2016 applied entropy based metrics as an objective function for the hydrological model calibration kawachi et al 2001 proposed shannon entropy as a measure for the temporal rainfall apportionment maruyama et al 2005 defined the intensity entropy and apportionment entropy as the information measures for rainfall variability the most important component in the computation of entropy is the estimation of probability generally the estimation of the probability can be distribution based or cell probability based the estimation of shannon entropy based on distribution depends upon the appropriate binning for estimating the probability densities from the data gong et al 2014 tongal and sivakumar 2019 a detailed account of the evolution of the different density estimation methods including bin counting average shifted histogram and kernel density estimator was provided by silverman 1986 among others gong et al 2014 discussed the four problems of distribution based estimation in hydrological time series that could result in biased entropy estimation these are optimal bin width zero values measurement error and skewness effect weijs et al 2013 suggested that the optimal bin width consideration for evaluating the probability density function depends on the question one wishes to answer mishra et al 2009 applied for the first time the above information measures to the decadal annual seasonal and monthly time series to investigate the inter variability and intra variability of daily rainfall to measure the variability they proposed a disorder index based on the entropy as the difference between maximum possible entropy and the entropy obtained for a time series the disorder index has been used by many studies for assessing the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall cheng et al 2017 rodrigues da silva et al 2016 roushangar et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2011 the outcomes of these studies are certainly encouraging as they have provided useful information about the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall in different regions around the world however it is also important to highlight that most of these studies e g mishra et al 2009 zhao et al 2011 cheng et al 2017 roushangar et al 2019 have used the non normalized indices for estimating the rainfall variability and hence the outcomes cannot be used for comparison at different timescales and different data lengths to address this issue in the present study we apply a standardized index for assessing the rainfall variability the standardized index determines the variability within a finite range of zero to one contour color map of the standardized index provides information on the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of a particular variable e g rainfall the complexity of a particular variable can also be estimated by using this measure with these we apply this standardized measure to rainfall in india with an aim to offer a better quantitative assessment of the spatiotemporal rainfall variability at different timescales viz daily monthly seasonal and annual we attempt to achieve this through addressing the following specific objectives 1 to propose a normalized entropy based index for investigating the rainfall variability at multiple timescales 2 to investigate the variability of rainfall using entropy based measures and to highlight the locations with high variability and 3 to explore the trend and significance of intra annual variability based on apportionment entropy and intensity entropy for implementation we use the 0 25 0 25 imd india meteorological department gridded rainfall data for the entire indian sub continent region as the application of entropy based measures to study the spatiotemporal rainfall variability in india is very limited the present analysis and the outcomes can significantly enhance our knowledge in this area 2 study area and data the present study focuses on the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall in the indian subcontinent the indian subcontinent lies approximately between 8 and 37 n latitude and 68 98 e longitude covering an area of 3 287 590 km2 the climate of india comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic scale and varied topography making generalization indeed difficult based on the köppen system pai et al 2014 india hosts six major climatic subtypes ranging from arid deserts in the west alpine tundra and glaciers in the north and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and the island territories however the country s meteorological department imd follows the international standard of four climatological seasons with some local adjustments winter december january and february spring march april and may a southwest monsoon means summer season june to september and a post monsoon period means fall october to november many regions in india have starkly different microclimates making it one of the most climatically diverse countries in the world the indian summer monsoon ism is mainly controlled by large scale ocean atmosphere processes agarwal et al 2017 tamaddun et al 2019 the major portion of the total rainfall occurs in the monsoon season gadgil 2003 the mean annual rainfall over the country as a whole is 1120 mm but the spatial distribution of rainfall is highly uneven the maximum mean annual rainfall of 5280 mm was observed at mawsynram meghalaya 25 25 n latitude 91 25 e longitude which is the highest rainfall receiving region in the world the minimum mean annual rainfall of 161 mm was observed near jaisalmer rajasthan 27 75 n latitude 70 25 e longitude which is one of the driest regions in the world the geo physiographic features of india vary from one region to another barik et al 2017 the digital elevation model dem obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data mukul et al 2017 yang et al 2011 along with gridded points with a spatial resolution of 30 m is presented in fig a 1 the elevation ranges from the mean sea level to as high as 8685 m in this study we use the gridded data of daily average rainfall mm developed by pai et al 2014 with a high spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 for a spatial domain of 66 5 e to 100 e and 6 5 n to 38 5 n covering the mainland region of india the daily data were obtained for a period of 113 years 1901 2013 which was available in the archive of national data centre india meteorological department imd pune the gridded data was generated from the observed data of 6995 gauging stations across india using spatial interpolation for the period 1901 2013 in the past several studies have used the same dataset which include downscaling lakhanpal et al 2017 sehgal et al 2016 extreme rainfall clustering agarwal et al 2018 kurths et al 2019 spatial diversity of indian rainfall teleconnections kurths et al 2019 and rainfall variability krishnamurthy and shukla 2000 among others this shows that the data are highly accurate and capable of capturing the spatial distribution of rainfall over the country in the present study the four seasons are defined in terms of months as follows march april may mam which is the summer season june july august jja which is the southwest monsoon season september october november son which is the autumn or fall season during which much of the northeast monsoon also occurs and december january february djf which is the winter season we investigate the inter annual and intra annual variability of the rainfall at different scales for the inter annuacl variability we consider the monthly seasonal and annual timescales variability of seasonal rainfall e g summer over the 113 years in this study provides an understanding on how the summer rainfall varies over time similarly monthly rainfall e g june over the years helps in quantifying the rainfall variability in june over the 113 years on the other hand for the intra annual variability the daily scale provides the information about the daily distribution of rainfall within a year similarly monthly and seasonal timescales quantify the distribution over 12 months and 4 seasons respectively within a year this detailed investigation of the rainfall patterns would provide a comprehensive picture of the spatiotemporal rainfall variability 3 methodology in this section the concept of entropy and three entropy based measures marginal entropy me apportionment entropy ae and intensity entropy ie are reviewed further the concept of standardized variability index svi and its applicability to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall are described the mann kendall trend analysis test employed herein to detect the presence of a significant trend in the standardized variability index time series is also presented 3 1 shannon entropy shannon 1948 formulated the information entropy now called shannon entropy to quantify the information with respect to a thought called surprise within the context of communication engineering generally speaking entropy shannon 1948 can be considered as a measure of dispersion uncertainty disorder and diversification singh 1997 discussed the use strengths and limitations of shannon entropy and suggested that it can serve as a decision making tool in hydrology and water resources over the last few decades shannon entropy has been applied to study many different problems in hydrology and water resources the generalized equation for defining shannon entropy h for a discrete random variable x which takes on values x 1 x 2 x n with respective probabilities p 1 p 2 p n is given as 1 h x k i 1 n p x i log 2 p x i where h x is the entropy of x n is the sample size and k is a parameter whose value depends on the base of the logarithm the unit of entropy depends on the base of the logarithm for example the unit of h is bits when the base is 2 napier for base e and decibel for base 10 in the present study we adopt the logarithm with base 2 and entropy is measured in bits in general k can be taken as unity and therefore eq 1 becomes 2 h x i 1 n p x i log 2 p x i where h x represents the average information content of the random variable x and log2 p xi directly represents the information content surprise about the value xi occurring with probability p xi gong et al 2014 for a fully deterministic random variable x the probability p x i is one and correspondingly to this h x 0 this case refers to absolute certainty on the other hand if the distribution is uniform then eq 2 yields maximum uncertainty since every outcome has the same probability of occurrence thus the value of h x varies from zero to log2 n i e from absolute certainty to maximum uncertainty or complete information to no information about the system s state viewed in this manner intuitively shannon entropy can be used for measuring the spatiotemporal variability associated with any geophysical time series kawachi et al 2001 in the present study three different entropy measures namely marginal entropy me apportionment entropy ae and intensity entropy ie are considered individually to quantify the inter year and intra year rainfall variability over different timescales 3 2 marginal entropy me mishra et al 2009 defined the marginal entropy me as the average information content of a random variable x with the probability distribution p x to measure the uncertainty this term basically calculates the marginal entropy of a single time series for example when the historical monthly time series of a station is considered for the calculation of the marginal entropy it gives randomness associated with the entire length of the time series for more details refer to mishra et al 2009 in the present study me is applied to the indian rainfall data at three different timescales i e annual seasonal and monthly to assess the interannual variability associated with the individual timescales the mathematical expression for evaluating me is given by 3 me i 1 n c r i r l o g 2 r i r where ri denotes the rainfall amount for the i th year and r denotes the total rainfall for the period 1901 2013 eq 3 can be applied to estimate the marginal entropy at monthly and seasonal scales by considering the rainfall at the corresponding months and seasons respectively 3 3 apportionment entropy ae apportionment entropy ae proposed by maruyama et al 2005 measures the distribution of the total rainfall amount p in terms of daily monthly seasonal timescales pi within a given year the likelihood will be pi p the ae is estimated for each year at all rainfall grid locations according to 4 ae i 1 n c p i p l o g 2 p i p where p is the total amount of rainfall for a given year p i is the rainfall amount during the considered timescale for the corresponding year and n c is the number of class intervals i e n c 365 for daily timescale n c 12 for monthly timescale and n c 4 for seasonal timescale for equally likely events ae would become maximum hmax and log 2 nc hmax changes with the time scale of evaluation for example hmax would be log 2365 for the daily scale hmax would be log212 for the monthly scale and hmax would be log24 for the seasonal timescale further explanation on how to calculate ae and aemax is given in appendix b here ae measures the intra annual rainfall amount distribution i e intra annual variability associated with the individual timescales fig 1 a and b illustrates how a given rainfall distribution translates into ae fig 1 a represents a hypothetical rainfall distribution with the rainfall amount equal in all the months 1 to 12 for this case since the probability of occurrence is the same for each month ae will be the maximum on the contrary ae becomes zero when the entire rainfall occurs during only one month see fig 1 b this indicates that ae takes on a value within the finite range of zero to log n c where zero corresponds to high variability of rainfall and log n c represents low variability i e rainfall amount is uniformly distributed 3 4 intensity entropy ie intensity entropy ie also proposed by maruyama et al 2005 measures the variability of rainy days m i of a month or season within a year to the total number of rainy days in that year m the likelihood will be m i m the ie is estimated for each year at all rainfall grid locations using 5 ie i 1 n c m i m log 2 m i m where nc is the number of class intervals for instance nc 12 for monthly timescale and nc 4 for seasonal timescale since the outcome is the number of rainy days ie at the daily scale is not considered here ie is used to measure the intra annual variability in terms of intra annual rainy day s distribution fig 1 c and d illustrates a simple example of translating a given rainy day distribution into intensity entropy if the number of rainy days is the same for all the months see fig 1 c then ie will be the maximum on the other hand if the total number of rainy days gets concentrated in a certain month then ie will be zero this indicates that ie takes on a value within the finite range of zero to log nc where zero corresponds to high variability and log nc represents low variability i e rainy days are equally distributed it is evident from eq 3 that the maximum entropy is a function of the sample size of the data and from eqs 4 and 5 that the maximum entropy is dependent on the timescale of evaluation hence in order to compare the entropy variability of time series of different data lengths and different timescales one needs an additional measure to this end in this study we propose a normalized index which can be used for comparing variability at multiple timescales as presented next 3 5 standardized variability index svi in the present study we propose the measure of redundancy developed by singh 2013 as the standardized variability index svi to calculate the normalized variability we define the svi as 6 svi h max h h max where hmax is the maximum possible entropy and h is the entropy obtained for the given time series hmax in eq 6 is equal to log 2 n and it is dependent on the length of the data as well as the time scale for different time scales hmax will be different to overcome this limitation eq 6 has been developed the svi determines the variability associated with the individual series with reference to the maximum possible variability from the definition svi takes on a value within a finite range of 0 to 1 where zero corresponds to no variability and one represents high variability i e maximum certainty to maximum uncertainty since the svi has a finite range it can be very useful for inter comparison of results between different time series and at multiple timescales the greater the svi the higher the variability thus using the svi one can compare the rainfall variability at different locations and different timescales on a fixed scale in the present study me ae and ie are expressed in terms of svi and are denoted as svime sviae and sviie respectively 3 6 mann kendall mk statistic in order to test the presence of a trend in the svi time series obtained for each of the rainfall grids considered in the present study we use the mann kendall mk test the non parametric mk test proposed by kendall 1975 and mann 1945 is found to be robust in the trend detection analysis since it does not require any prior assumption on the distributional form of the data the test statistic s is calculated with the variance as 7 s p 1 n 1 q p 1 n s g n x q x p 8 v a r s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 j p q t p t p 1 2 t p 5 where n is the length of the time series xq and xp represent the sequential data points sgn k is a sign function and takes values of 1 0 1 for k 0 k 0 and k 0 respectively tp is the number of ties for the p th value and q is the number of tied values the standardized test statistic is given by z s 1 v a r s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 v a r s if s 0 at a significant level of α 0 05 the null hypothesis that no trend exists should be rejected if the absolute value of z is greater than z 1 α 2 1 96 a positive value of z indicates an upward trend whereas a negative value indicates a downward trend 4 results and discussion 4 1 inter year rainfall variability over different timescales to investigate the relative variability of annual seasonal and monthly rainfall the marginal entropy and correspondingly svime is calculated based on the amount of rainfall for each considered grid location the svime gives us an understanding of the variability obtained out of the maximum variability possible that can be associated with a particular time series i e the relative variability the svime is calculated for the annual time series over the period 1901 2013 at every rainfall grid point 4443 grid points in total fig 2 a shows the spatial distribution of svime the mean annual precipitation for the period 1901 2013 is depicted in fig 2 b the results indicate that in general mean annual rainfall decreases westwards in northern india and eastwards in peninsular india but it seems to increase in the coastal regions high values of mean annual rainfall are observed in the northeastern regions and the west coast of the country while the northwestern region shows low mean annual rainfall from the spatial distribution of svime fig 2 a it is observed that grid points with high variability are observed in the low rainfall regions and vice versa the grid points located in the northern region have the highest variability coinciding with the lowest rainfall the grid points with low variability are identified in the northeastern region and in the west coast of the country coinciding with high rainfall similarly svime is also computed for rainfall time series at the seasonal and monthly timescales fig 3 a d presents the spatial distribution of svime at seasonal and monthly timescales and table 1 presents the statistical properties of svime for the seasonal and monthly time series individual seasons are compared to examine the interannual variability of seasonal rainfall within the year helps in understanding the season s responsible for the annual variability mishra et al 2009 in the winter season except for the far south and himalayan regions the rest of the country has high variability fig 3 d the variability is low in the southern part since it receives regular rainfall from the northeast monsoon rajeevan et al 2012 sreekala et al 2011 and in the case of the himalayas and its surrounding regions trade winds travel from the mediterranean sea western disturbances causing significant rainfall during winter season shukla et al 2019 however the other parts of the country receive unseasonal rains in an irregular manner with no uniform pattern causing high variability in the spatial extent of 20 n to 32 n rajeevan et al 2012 sreekala et al 2011 thus the winter season contributes the most to the annual relative variability and summer contributes the least see table 1 on the other hand the summer season contributes the highest percentage to the annual rainfall and winter the least as expected it is interesting to note that even though a majority of the annual rainfall 75 80 comes from the summer season the variability in the annual rainfall is contributed mainly by the winter season the winter and spring seasons have high relative variability concentrated in the western region of central india see fig 3 a and d examining the intervariability of rainfall of the months within the season helps in understanding the month s responsible for the seasonal variability mishra et al 2009 the results herein reveal that overall entropy based relative variability of seasonal time series is always lower than that of its constituent months see table 1 for instance svime for the spring season is lower than that for march april and may individually fig 3 a and this is due to the fact that the inter annual variability will be larger at a smaller time scale and becomes smaller at a larger time scale i e at an annual time scale mishra et al 2009 generally the variability dampens when we move from finer to coarser time scales since svime captures the inter annual variability across the 113 years high svime indicates a possibility that the rainfall amounts may be highly varying in march april and may due to shifts in the rainfall patterns but considering the spring season as whole this may not get captured a similar pattern is also observed in other seasons this observation clearly reflects that the spatial distribution of the svime varies with the seasons as well as with the months higher values of svime at the monthly timescale are observed in the western region and some traces in the eastern coastal region during mam the spatial distribution of the svime in fig 3 b and c clearly shows that the variability in the indian summer monsoon rainfall june july august and september months is relatively low and thus suggests lower uncertainty associated with the summer rainfall when compared to the other seasons it can be said that for the entire 113 year duration period there is only a minimal variation in the summer monsoon rainfall and it is a good signature for the field of agriculture as a large part of the agricultural productivity comes from the monsoon rainfall in case of ondjf months high variability is observed in the northwestern and coastal regions see fig 3 c and d the reason for high inter annual variability in coastal areas is due to the fact that the entire coast is affected by tropical cyclones with varying frequency and intensity over the years mohapatra et al 2012 fig a 2 is the rainfall time series of a station 73 50 e 16 25 n along the west coast during the winter season and it reveals that rainfall is not regular and the years with rainfall are typically due to cyclonic activities rainfall due to cyclones and hurricanes is not part of the regular monsoon but affects the coastal area and these cyclones are unseasonal rains and consequently there is high temporal variability across coastal areas during the post monsoon season only southern parts of the country will receive rainfall during the winter season in conjunction with this low pressure will be created in the extreme northern parts of the indian subcontinent and it receives rainfall due to the western disturbances from fig 3 d it unravels that southern and northern parts of the country have low variability and the rest of the country has high variability since for the rest of the country rainfall is not expected during this season 4 2 intra year variability of rainfall over different timescales after assessing the inter year variability of rainfall at different timescales over the entire study period 1901 2013 we further examine the intra year variability of rainfall distribution in terms of the rainfall amount and the number of rainy days intra year variability of rainfall amount the apportionment entropy ae and consequently the sv i ae are calculated at the daily monthly and seasonal timescales for every rainfall grid point for each year covering the entire length of the data i e 113 sv i ae values at each of daily monthly and seasonal timescales for the purpose of illustration here results are shown only for five randomly selected grids given in fig a 3 a whose geographical coordinates are given in table c 1 fig a 3 b presents the sv i ae obtained for these grids at the daily top monthly middle and seasonal bottom timescales the results indicate that a much higher fluctuation of variability is observed at the seasonal scale compared to that at the monthly and daily timescales in almost all of the rainfall grid locations considered we further compute the mean of sv i ae for the period 1901 2013 at each rainfall grid location and at each timescale fig 4 a c the spatial patterns of the mean sviae at the daily scale see fig 4 a reveal a higher value in the range of 0 45 0 65 in the northwestern region of the country and lowest in the northeastern and west coast regions of the country the region with higher sviae at the daily scale indicates concentration of rainfall during only a few days of the year whereas lower values indicate that the rainfall is throughout the year which is generally the situation in the northeast peninsular and coastal regions the northwestern part of the country receives its total annual rainfall in a few days and therefore the region encounters higher variability in rainfall at the monthly scale see fig 4 b rainfall grid locations with high variability extend to the western and central india indicating that rainfall in a major part of the country occurs only during a few months at the seasonal scale the pattern becomes more prominent and most parts of the country show high variability in the range of 0 4 0 8 see fig 4 c interestingly the mean annual rainfall for the west coast and the northeastern parts of the country is almost the same see fig 2 b but the rainfall variability is quite different see fig 4 a c at the daily timescale fig 4 a the values are low in both the regions however at the seasonal timescale fig 4 c the values are high on the western coast this difference at the seasonal and daily timescales is due to the seasonal distribution of the rainfall across the country these results reveal that the pattern of the rainfall variability becomes more prominent when the timescale changes from finer to coarser i e from daily 365 bins to seasonal timescale 4 bins a comparison of the statistical properties of the sv i ae presented in table 2 shows that the mean sv i ae is highest at the seasonal scale and lowest at the daily scale in addition at all scales the mean svi is found to decrease from west to east of the country signifying higher variability in the western part of the country due to the sharp seasonality of rainfall in time over the year and it is attributed to high normalized rainfall over coastal regions most of which occur during summer monsoon season notably over the western ghats both normalized rainfall and svi are high thus leading to very high values of intra annual variability the intriguing relationship between the rainfall seasonality apprehended by the svi and the mean annual rainfall captured by the svi is quite evident in the spatial map of the apportionment entropy relative intra year variability of rainy days the intensity entropy ie and correspondingly the sv i ie are calculated at the monthly and seasonal timescales at each of the rainfall grid locations for each year i e 113 sv i ie values at monthly and seasonal timescales the temporal mean of sv i ie for all the 113 years is computed at the monthly and seasonal timescales the spatial distribution of the mean sviie at the monthly scale see fig 4 d shows that a low variability is concentrated around peninsular india at the seasonal scale see fig 4 e high variability regions are located in the western and central india it is observed that the sviie pattern is similar to that of the sviae at both the monthly and the seasonal timescales we also observe a distinct pattern of decrease from the western part to the eastern part of the indian subcontinent high variability in terms of sviie indicates that the rainy days are concentrated only within a certain period of the year and low variability shows that the rainy days are distributed or scattered across the year further the results based on the statistical characteristics mean minimum and maximum of the sviie obtained at all the rainfall grid locations indicate that the variability is high at the seasonal timescale compared to that at the monthly timescale see table 2 for instance the mean value of sviie at the monthly scale is 0 2860 whereas it is 0 4863 at the seasonal scale overall based on sviae and sviie values the summer season and the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr months jjas are found to be having a low variability at the monthly and seasonal timescales according to sahany et al 2018 these months contribute 75 80 of the total annual rainfall in india this implies that the significant quantum of annual rainfall has low variability and is highly certain on the other hand the winter season experiences high variability and consequently shows a low level of certainty the spatial variability pattern of sviae and sviie show higher values over the western and central india indicating that the total annual rainfall in these regions is concentrated to certain seasons only it is also observed that the pattern of variability refer to fig 4 a c is different at all the three timescales analyzed daily monthly and seasonal which highlights the multiscale variability of the rainfall pattern grid points concentrated in the east coast peninsular and northern parts of the country at the daily scale as well as east coast at the seasonal scale have high values compared to that at the monthly scale refer to fig 4 a c from the svi values presented in table 2 it may be concluded that the relative variability varies from scale to scale 4 3 spatial variation of inter year variability svi in order to investigate the spatial pattern of the rainfall variability obtained using the above three entropy measures we study the relationship between the different svis and latitude longitude and elevation we first plot the relationship between all three svis and latitude fig 5 by averaging the svis corresponding to all longitudes taken across a specific latitude fig 5 a d shows the variation of the svime with latitude for the different seasons and months it is evident that there is a prominent but different pattern for every season for example during the fall season the variability is low for the latitudes between 10 n 15 n and is high for the rest of the latitudes see fig 5 c this clearly shows that the regions 10 n 15 n under the northeast monsoon have low rainfall variability and therefore less uncertain similar plots of the variation of the svi in terms of ae and ie at different timescales are shown in fig 5 e and f respectively the plots reveal that there is no significant trend at the daily scale however at the monthly and seasonal scales the sviae has an increasing trend from 8 25 n to 23 n and from there onwards has a decreasing trend up to 36 75 n see fig 5 e a similar pattern of variation is observed also for sviie see fig 5 f similarly fig 6 shows the variation of the svis against the longitude the plots indicate that the svime decreases with the longitude for the annual seasonal and monthly timescales see fig 6 a d the sviae and sviie also follow a decreasing trend with the longitude moving from west to east see fig 6 e f the relationship between the svi measures svime svi ae and sviie and elevation is helpful to gain understanding about the relative variability of rainfall with the topography in this study the qgis3 4 software with point sampling tool is employed to extract the elevations of every grid point from srtm 30 m digital elevation model dem the elevation vs svime at annual seasonal and monthly scales does not yield any significant relationship figures not shown here however for sviae and sviie there is a definite relationship with the elevation fig 7 shows the variation of the sviae and sviie against elevation the results show that the sviae is high in the elevation range of 0 to 150 m at the daily monthly and seasonal scales and is in the range 0 0 3 beyond 1000 m elevation see fig 7 a c considering the sviie the monthly and seasonal scales have a similar kind of trend that is observed for sviae see fig 7 d e 4 4 entropy based classification of water resources availability we further make an attempt to use the entropy based measures derived above to classify the spatial regions in terms of their water resources availability for this purpose we couple the sviae with the annual average rainfall since such a coupling would result in delineating the regions according to rainfall amount and variability a similar approach has been adopted by kawachi et al 2001 for japan to identify regions with potential water resources availability fig 8 a shows the scatter plot constructed between sviae at the daily scale and the annual average rainfall mm year the entire plot is classified into four regions by the lines passing through the mean values of sviae 0 34 and the average annual rainfall 1120 mm these four regions are denoted as class a class b class c and class d as shown in fig 8 a it is noted that the rainfall grid locations falling under class a receive rainfall more than the average value and the variability in terms of sviae is less than its mean value this indicates that these locations have high rainfall amount with low variability and therefore water resources are abundant and perennially available at these grid points similarly the locations falling under class b receive a low amount of rainfall with low variability indicating that the water resources are moderate but perennial in these locations water resources development and management are required to raise availability during the spells of high water demand kawachi et al 2001 in the case of the locations falling under class c it can be said that these regions receive a low amount of rainfall but with high variability resulting in low and ephemeral water resources availability to meet the perennial water demand at these locations there is a need to increase the disposable water resources by the construction of water storage facilities the regions under class d on the other hand receive a high amount of rainfall with high variability at these locations the majority of the rainfall is mostly concentrated in certain seasons suggesting the necessity of flood management in parallel with the storage of surplus water in the reservoirs fig 8 b shows the geographical distribution of the four regions in india highlighted in fig 8 a this classification is a result of simple clustering through average annual rainfall and its relative variability measure in terms of entropy s v i a e regions falling under class a are in the western coast central northeastern region and some parts of indo gangetic plains in these regions the mean annual rainfall and rainfall seasonality are found to be high when compared to all india s average annual rainfall sahany et al 2018 class a receives rainfall from both swm and nem bringing more amount of rainfall fukushima et al 2019 and the daily timescale variability of rainfall is also low in these regions in the case of class b the regions are scattered across the country and have low intra annual variability and the mean annual rainfall is low due to a decrease in the strength of swm class c covers the northwest southern and northernmost parts of india regions in the northwest of the country receive rainfall only from swm and the magnitude is very low and intra annual variability is also high regions in the northwest of the country receive rainfall only in swm and the magnitude is very low and intra annual variability is also high the regions in the southern part receive rainfall in both swm and nem but its magnitude is less than the mean annual rainfall of entire india fukushima et al 2019 in the case of class d the regions are in some parts of coastal areas central india and indo gangetic plains the regions in coastal areas receive excess rainfall due to tropical cyclones forming in the bay of bengal and arabian sea resulting in high variability mohapatra et al 2012 however in central india and the indo gangetic plains rainfall primarily occurs from swm with rainfall seasonality becoming sharper since the 1950s leading to high intra annual variability this finding is in agreement with the observation made by many earlier studies bhatla et al 2019 goswami et al 2006 malik et al 2016 roxy et al 2017 thus implying potentially a significant increase in extreme rainfall events over central india and the indo gangetic plains in the near future 4 5 trend analysis of apportionment and intensity entropies to understand the temporal pattern of the rainfall variability at every grid location we evaluate the trends of sviae and sviie using the non parametric mann kendall mk method we conduct a trend analysis with a 95 confidence limit directly on the different svis spatial representation of the rainfall grid locations with a significant trend at the monthly and seasonal timescales both for sviae and s v i i e are presented in fig a 4 the red color positive trend represents an increase in rainfall variability over the years which in turn indicates that rainfall gets more concentrated only during certain period of the year on the other hand a light green color negative trend indicates that the spread of rainfall within a year increases similarly fig 9 for instance presents the grid points with the significant trend of sviae at the daily timescale at the daily scale the mk test detects a positive trend in central india northeast and southern peninsular parts of india whereas a negative trend in north india west coast and east coast regions a summary of the grid locations having significant increasing and decreasing trends based on the mann kendall test for the different scales considered in the study are given in table c 2 as seen the number of locations with positive and negative trends varies substantially from the daily scale to the seasonal scale we notice that at all timescales grid points with a positive trend are mostly concentrated in central india and grid points with a negative trend are present in the northernmost parts of the country this can be attributed to the increasing heterogeneity in rainfall over india after 1950s which has also been reported by several previous studies goswami et al 2006 roxy et al 2017 overall the results from the trend analysis indicate that the number of grid locations with positive and negative trends varies from scale to scale with the number of points having significant trend being highest at the daily scale this suggests that the change in intra annual rainfall dynamics can be understood in a better way at the daily scale than at coarser timescales for a further in depth investigation of the change in the variability of rainfall amount we randomly select a grid location 76 75 e 14 25 n marked with black star in fig 9 and analyze the actual distribution of the rainfall amount for this location the time series of the number of rainy days sviae and the total amount of rainfall for the period 1901 2013 are plotted in fig 10 there is a temporally decreasing trend of rainy days and an increasing trend of sviae clearly there exists an inverse relationship between rainy days and the entropy based svi measure in addition to the above it would also be interesting to study the rainfall distribution of the years having similar rainfall amounts to this end we select four different sets of years 1905 and 1960 1902 and 1971 1928 and 2006 and 1948 and 2013 for a total of eight years with each set having similar rainfall amount fig 11 shows the rainfall distribution for these eight years and the number of rainy days is given in table c 3 as seen for instance while the years 1905 and 1960 have the same amount of rainfall 313 mm the distribution of rainfall and the number of rainy days are significantly different from each other indicating a change in the rainfall pattern similar observations can also be made for the other three sets of years these observations seem to indicate that there is a significant decrease in the number of rainy days in the latter part of the last century after 1950 when compared to the earlier part and that such an aspect is revealed by the increasing trend of svi from the sviae trend analysis our null hypothesis i e increase in rainfall variability at a daily scale is accepted for 1476 grid points 30 land area at 95 confidence limit in particular most of the grid points lie in central india see fig 9 in conformity with earlier studies goswami et al 2006 rajeevan et al 2008 roxy et al 2017 indicating that the frequency of extreme rainfall events over central india has increased by about 75 during the period 1950 2015 this implies that the amount of rain gets concentrated in just a few days rainy days are decreasing sahany et al 2018 reported a decrease of 15 rainy days per century in central india based on the second moment of rainfall monthly accumulation analysis kumar and jain 2011 based on an analysis of the number of rainy days for the period 1951 2004 reported a decrease in the number of rainy days in 15 major river basins in india and an increase in the number of rainy days in 4 major river basins the results from the present study are therefore certainly in line with the observations made by kumar and jain 2011 these observations seem to suggest that extreme rainfall events will likely increase across the country in the near future especially due to an increasing rainfall variability this is a very significant point to note especially from a hydrological point of view since it suggests the possibility of extreme floods over a few days in a year and droughts during the rest of the year comparing the results obtained from the trend analysis fig 9 with the water availability map fig 8 b it is found that a majority of the grid points falling under class a and class b experience a positive trend in the svi which implies that these locations will have an increased variability of rainfall in the near future this seems to suggest that these grid points located in class a and class b might move into class d and class c respectively this entails that a majority of the annual rainfall might get concentrated to fewer and fewer days resulting in more extreme events which is indeed an alarming situation the above results and observations suggest that the proposed entropy based svi measures proposed in the study have the ability to capture the inter annual and intra annual variability at different timescales further the svi based analysis shows that the rainfall variability in the indian subcontinent is highly complex and varies both spatially and temporally the results also reveal that there is an increasing trend in the intra annual variability at certain locations in the indian subcontinent this is particularly relevant in the context of global warming induced climate changes that exercise different influences on the strength or weakness of summer monsoons as well as their onset duration termination temporal and spatial distributions number of rainy days time interval between rainy days and amount of summer rainfall therefore there is a great scope to use the proposed svi measures to investigate the variability of rainfall under new emerging dynamics and patterns such an investigation and the outcomes can be of great importance for undertaking proper agricultural practices and water management policies and decisions in the future 5 conclusions we applied the entropy based standardized variability index svi to characterize the spatial variability of indian rainfall at multiple timescales the svi measure has immense potential over the disorder index as it allows comparison of the rainfall variability at multiple scales furthermore its application is independent of the temporal scale and data length based on the results the following major conclusions are drawn 1 the rainfall variability had a distinct decreasing pattern from the west to the east at all timescales showing larger variability in western india analysis of data at the seasonal scale revealed that winter season contributed the most to the annual variability and summer the least however the strength of the seasonal contribution to the annual variability also varied spatially 2 the pattern of the rainfall variability in terms of sviae became more prominent as we moved from finer i e daily to coarser i e seasonal scale at all scales the mean svi was found to decrease from the west to the east of the country signifying higher variability in the western part of the country and higher uncertainty the spatial distribution of the mean sviie at the monthly scale indicated that a relatively low variability was concentrated in peninsular india at the seasonal scale high relative variability regions were found to be located in the western and central india 3 trend analysis revealed a significant increase in rainfall variability at the daily timescale in most parts of the indian subcontinent this observation was best supported by the shrinking nature of the rainfall distribution and a decrease in the number of rainy days in the latter part of the twentieth century after 1950 when compared to the former 4 from the water availability map it was observed that approximately 40 of the country fell under class a rainfall average value sviae mean value and class d rainfall average value sviae mean value and the remaining 60 of the country under the class b rainfall average value sviae mean value and class c rainfall average value sviae mean value coupling water availability map with trend analysis suggested that amajority of the annual rainfall increasingly gets concentrated to fewer days resulting in a greater number of extreme events which would lead to an alarming situation declaration of

5402,understanding the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall is vital for water resources planning and management flood and drought mitigation and erosion control among others despite the progress in this direction through proposal of many different approaches and their applications to rainfall data at various regions around the world our knowledge of the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall remains limited studies in this direction have largely focused on the amount of rainfall and its spatial patterns and investigations of spatiotemporal variability at multiscale are limited in this study we introduce a novel measure standardized variability index svi based on the concept of entropy to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of gridded rainfall in the indian subcontinent at different timescales the results show distinct spatial patterns in the inter annual rainfall variability at all timescales also the intra annual variability of rainfall amount as well as rainy days is found to increase from east to west of india the mann kendall trend test at different timescales reveals significant increase in rainfall variability in addition coupling the mean annual rainfall with svi enables a relative assessment of the water resources availability keywords rainfall variability marginal entropy apportionment entropy intensity entropy standardized variability index mann kendall test 1 introduction rainfall is the primary component of the hydrological cycle representing the transfer of mass and energy from the earth to the atmosphere and vice versa brunsell 2010 understanding the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall is vital for water resources planning and management flood and drought mitigation and soil erosion control among others coumou rahmstorf 2012 karmakar et al 2017 pendergrass et al 2017 kurths et al 2019 however quantifying the variability of rainfall is a highly challenging task owing to the complex nature of the climatic variables that influence rainfall dynamics and their spatiotemporal variability and nonlinear interactions guntu et al 2020 jin and wang 2017 liu et al 2013 sivakumar et al 2014 yaduvanshi et al 2019 in addition global warming induced climate change has triggered substantial changes in rainfall intensity spatial and temporal distribution and average rainfall amount at various places across the globe as a consequence there have been significant changes in the frequency magnitude and pattern of extreme rainfall related hydrological extremes such as floods and droughts clark 1999 barnett et al 2005 trenberth 2011 loo et al 2015 agilan and umamahesh 2017 furthermore many studies have already proven that the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall dynamics is nonlinear and carry multiscale features that are time varying in nature all these together make the quantification of rainfall variability tedious and demand in depth understanding in the past few decades india has experienced significant spatiotemporal changes in rainfall pattern leading to fewer rainy days and more extreme rainfall which many studies have attributed to global climate change and anthropogenic influences kurths et al 2019 such rainfall extremes have impacted the lives and property in many different ways for instance it was reported that 33 million people had been affected by flooding from 1953 to 2000 the planning commission of india planning commission 2011 reported that 13 78 of india s geographical area is subjected to flood disaster due to extreme rainfall caused by climate change as well as anthropogenic activities in general rainfall variability has substantial impacts on water availability agricultural productivity and welfare of the 1 2 billion people in india goyal and surampalli 2018 jin and wang 2017 because agriculture in india feeds about 17 2 of the global population and more than 56 of the agricultural land is rain fed singh et al 2014 also the indian economy depends on the monsoon rainfall and accounts for 17 of india s gross domestic product gadgil 2003 mishra et al 2012 paul et al 2016 sahany et al 2018 therefore there has been an urgent need to more accurately quantify the variability of rainfall in india towards a more reliable assessment of water availability for irrigation and mitigation of the impacts of floods and droughts in view of this a number of studies have recently attempted to quantify the rainfall variability in india for instance mondal et al 2014 calculated the trend of annual rainfall in india and reported a decreasing trend across the northwestern and peninsular india singh et al 2014 observed a significant decreasing trend 10 significance level in the mean rainfall during the southwest monsoon period june to september from the year 1951 especially in the months of july and august which co occurred with a statistical increase in the daily scale rainfall variability asoka et al 2017 discussed the potential changes in the precipitation patterns and their significant impact on the groundwater storage they reported based on gravity recovery climate experiment data grace a decrease of 2 cm year in groundwater storage in northern india and an increase of 1 2 cm year in southern india despite their importance for modeling rainfall variability in india these studies have mainly focused on the amount of rainfall and its spatial patterns recently sahany et al 2018 analyzed 113 years 1901 2013 of daily rainfall over india to investigate spatiotemporal variability of rainfall seasonality at the monthly time scale fukushima et al 2019 investigated the inter annual variations of seasonal precipitation during southwest monsoon swm and northeast monsoon nem periods in india and their relation to atmospheric circulation to our knowledge rainfall studies investigating the inter annual variability and intra annual variability in particular at multiple time scales for 113 years 1901 2013 for the indian subcontinent are minimal a quantitative assessment of the spatiotemporal variability at multiple time scales using the entropic measures can be of great scientific interest and societal relevance in addition it would be beneficial to develop classification of water resources based on rainfall magnitude and its variability considering a long 113 year period duration these provide the motivation for the present study in general variability is defined as the quality of unevenness and lack of uniformity over different intervals mishra et al 2009 sang et al 2012 spatial variability characterizes the values of a variable at multiple geographic locations in a region whereas temporal variability is the unevenness of a variable over different time intervals there is a plethora of measures in the literature for measuring the variability of a time series including variance diversity indices and information theory based measures mishra et al 2009 in recent years the information theory based measure entropy shannon 1948 has gained significant attention in hydrology and water resources see reviews by singh 1997 2011 owing to their strengths koutsoyiannis 2005 zhang et al 2016 one of the main advantages of entropy based measures is that they do not make any prior assumptions on the probability distribution or statistical properties of the data and thus they are applicable to any type of data maruyama et al 2005 and can be applied to any system pechlivanidis et al 2016 in the field of hydrological engineering entropy has been used for the monitoring and evaluation of rainfall network design see review by keum et al 2017 assessment of hydrological fluxes brunsell 2010 cheng et al 2017 feng et al 2013 gong et al 2014 liu et al 2013 mishra et al 2009 molini et al 2006 pechlivanidis et al 2016 rodrigues da silva et al 2016 roushangar et al 2019 2018 sahany et al 2018 sang et al 2012 tongal and sivakumar 2019 weijs et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2011 spatiotemporal analysis of drought and potential evapotranspiration hao and singh 2013 hong et al 2014 huang et al 2014 hydrologic regionalization and clustering of catchments agarwal et al 2016 roushangar et al 2018 tongal and sivakumar 2017 climate downscaling sehgal et al 2016 complexity analysis of rainfall runoff modeling chen et al 2013 chou 2012 el nino forecasting meng et al 2020 and classification of a region japan into different zones based on rainfall distribution kawachi et al 2001 maruyama et al 2005 in addition chapman 1986 recommended the ratio of mutual information to the marginal entropy as a model performance measure for hydrological processes pachepsky et al 2016 and pechlivanidis et al 2016 applied entropy based metrics as an objective function for the hydrological model calibration kawachi et al 2001 proposed shannon entropy as a measure for the temporal rainfall apportionment maruyama et al 2005 defined the intensity entropy and apportionment entropy as the information measures for rainfall variability the most important component in the computation of entropy is the estimation of probability generally the estimation of the probability can be distribution based or cell probability based the estimation of shannon entropy based on distribution depends upon the appropriate binning for estimating the probability densities from the data gong et al 2014 tongal and sivakumar 2019 a detailed account of the evolution of the different density estimation methods including bin counting average shifted histogram and kernel density estimator was provided by silverman 1986 among others gong et al 2014 discussed the four problems of distribution based estimation in hydrological time series that could result in biased entropy estimation these are optimal bin width zero values measurement error and skewness effect weijs et al 2013 suggested that the optimal bin width consideration for evaluating the probability density function depends on the question one wishes to answer mishra et al 2009 applied for the first time the above information measures to the decadal annual seasonal and monthly time series to investigate the inter variability and intra variability of daily rainfall to measure the variability they proposed a disorder index based on the entropy as the difference between maximum possible entropy and the entropy obtained for a time series the disorder index has been used by many studies for assessing the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall cheng et al 2017 rodrigues da silva et al 2016 roushangar et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2011 the outcomes of these studies are certainly encouraging as they have provided useful information about the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall in different regions around the world however it is also important to highlight that most of these studies e g mishra et al 2009 zhao et al 2011 cheng et al 2017 roushangar et al 2019 have used the non normalized indices for estimating the rainfall variability and hence the outcomes cannot be used for comparison at different timescales and different data lengths to address this issue in the present study we apply a standardized index for assessing the rainfall variability the standardized index determines the variability within a finite range of zero to one contour color map of the standardized index provides information on the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of a particular variable e g rainfall the complexity of a particular variable can also be estimated by using this measure with these we apply this standardized measure to rainfall in india with an aim to offer a better quantitative assessment of the spatiotemporal rainfall variability at different timescales viz daily monthly seasonal and annual we attempt to achieve this through addressing the following specific objectives 1 to propose a normalized entropy based index for investigating the rainfall variability at multiple timescales 2 to investigate the variability of rainfall using entropy based measures and to highlight the locations with high variability and 3 to explore the trend and significance of intra annual variability based on apportionment entropy and intensity entropy for implementation we use the 0 25 0 25 imd india meteorological department gridded rainfall data for the entire indian sub continent region as the application of entropy based measures to study the spatiotemporal rainfall variability in india is very limited the present analysis and the outcomes can significantly enhance our knowledge in this area 2 study area and data the present study focuses on the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall in the indian subcontinent the indian subcontinent lies approximately between 8 and 37 n latitude and 68 98 e longitude covering an area of 3 287 590 km2 the climate of india comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic scale and varied topography making generalization indeed difficult based on the köppen system pai et al 2014 india hosts six major climatic subtypes ranging from arid deserts in the west alpine tundra and glaciers in the north and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and the island territories however the country s meteorological department imd follows the international standard of four climatological seasons with some local adjustments winter december january and february spring march april and may a southwest monsoon means summer season june to september and a post monsoon period means fall october to november many regions in india have starkly different microclimates making it one of the most climatically diverse countries in the world the indian summer monsoon ism is mainly controlled by large scale ocean atmosphere processes agarwal et al 2017 tamaddun et al 2019 the major portion of the total rainfall occurs in the monsoon season gadgil 2003 the mean annual rainfall over the country as a whole is 1120 mm but the spatial distribution of rainfall is highly uneven the maximum mean annual rainfall of 5280 mm was observed at mawsynram meghalaya 25 25 n latitude 91 25 e longitude which is the highest rainfall receiving region in the world the minimum mean annual rainfall of 161 mm was observed near jaisalmer rajasthan 27 75 n latitude 70 25 e longitude which is one of the driest regions in the world the geo physiographic features of india vary from one region to another barik et al 2017 the digital elevation model dem obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data mukul et al 2017 yang et al 2011 along with gridded points with a spatial resolution of 30 m is presented in fig a 1 the elevation ranges from the mean sea level to as high as 8685 m in this study we use the gridded data of daily average rainfall mm developed by pai et al 2014 with a high spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 for a spatial domain of 66 5 e to 100 e and 6 5 n to 38 5 n covering the mainland region of india the daily data were obtained for a period of 113 years 1901 2013 which was available in the archive of national data centre india meteorological department imd pune the gridded data was generated from the observed data of 6995 gauging stations across india using spatial interpolation for the period 1901 2013 in the past several studies have used the same dataset which include downscaling lakhanpal et al 2017 sehgal et al 2016 extreme rainfall clustering agarwal et al 2018 kurths et al 2019 spatial diversity of indian rainfall teleconnections kurths et al 2019 and rainfall variability krishnamurthy and shukla 2000 among others this shows that the data are highly accurate and capable of capturing the spatial distribution of rainfall over the country in the present study the four seasons are defined in terms of months as follows march april may mam which is the summer season june july august jja which is the southwest monsoon season september october november son which is the autumn or fall season during which much of the northeast monsoon also occurs and december january february djf which is the winter season we investigate the inter annual and intra annual variability of the rainfall at different scales for the inter annuacl variability we consider the monthly seasonal and annual timescales variability of seasonal rainfall e g summer over the 113 years in this study provides an understanding on how the summer rainfall varies over time similarly monthly rainfall e g june over the years helps in quantifying the rainfall variability in june over the 113 years on the other hand for the intra annual variability the daily scale provides the information about the daily distribution of rainfall within a year similarly monthly and seasonal timescales quantify the distribution over 12 months and 4 seasons respectively within a year this detailed investigation of the rainfall patterns would provide a comprehensive picture of the spatiotemporal rainfall variability 3 methodology in this section the concept of entropy and three entropy based measures marginal entropy me apportionment entropy ae and intensity entropy ie are reviewed further the concept of standardized variability index svi and its applicability to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall are described the mann kendall trend analysis test employed herein to detect the presence of a significant trend in the standardized variability index time series is also presented 3 1 shannon entropy shannon 1948 formulated the information entropy now called shannon entropy to quantify the information with respect to a thought called surprise within the context of communication engineering generally speaking entropy shannon 1948 can be considered as a measure of dispersion uncertainty disorder and diversification singh 1997 discussed the use strengths and limitations of shannon entropy and suggested that it can serve as a decision making tool in hydrology and water resources over the last few decades shannon entropy has been applied to study many different problems in hydrology and water resources the generalized equation for defining shannon entropy h for a discrete random variable x which takes on values x 1 x 2 x n with respective probabilities p 1 p 2 p n is given as 1 h x k i 1 n p x i log 2 p x i where h x is the entropy of x n is the sample size and k is a parameter whose value depends on the base of the logarithm the unit of entropy depends on the base of the logarithm for example the unit of h is bits when the base is 2 napier for base e and decibel for base 10 in the present study we adopt the logarithm with base 2 and entropy is measured in bits in general k can be taken as unity and therefore eq 1 becomes 2 h x i 1 n p x i log 2 p x i where h x represents the average information content of the random variable x and log2 p xi directly represents the information content surprise about the value xi occurring with probability p xi gong et al 2014 for a fully deterministic random variable x the probability p x i is one and correspondingly to this h x 0 this case refers to absolute certainty on the other hand if the distribution is uniform then eq 2 yields maximum uncertainty since every outcome has the same probability of occurrence thus the value of h x varies from zero to log2 n i e from absolute certainty to maximum uncertainty or complete information to no information about the system s state viewed in this manner intuitively shannon entropy can be used for measuring the spatiotemporal variability associated with any geophysical time series kawachi et al 2001 in the present study three different entropy measures namely marginal entropy me apportionment entropy ae and intensity entropy ie are considered individually to quantify the inter year and intra year rainfall variability over different timescales 3 2 marginal entropy me mishra et al 2009 defined the marginal entropy me as the average information content of a random variable x with the probability distribution p x to measure the uncertainty this term basically calculates the marginal entropy of a single time series for example when the historical monthly time series of a station is considered for the calculation of the marginal entropy it gives randomness associated with the entire length of the time series for more details refer to mishra et al 2009 in the present study me is applied to the indian rainfall data at three different timescales i e annual seasonal and monthly to assess the interannual variability associated with the individual timescales the mathematical expression for evaluating me is given by 3 me i 1 n c r i r l o g 2 r i r where ri denotes the rainfall amount for the i th year and r denotes the total rainfall for the period 1901 2013 eq 3 can be applied to estimate the marginal entropy at monthly and seasonal scales by considering the rainfall at the corresponding months and seasons respectively 3 3 apportionment entropy ae apportionment entropy ae proposed by maruyama et al 2005 measures the distribution of the total rainfall amount p in terms of daily monthly seasonal timescales pi within a given year the likelihood will be pi p the ae is estimated for each year at all rainfall grid locations according to 4 ae i 1 n c p i p l o g 2 p i p where p is the total amount of rainfall for a given year p i is the rainfall amount during the considered timescale for the corresponding year and n c is the number of class intervals i e n c 365 for daily timescale n c 12 for monthly timescale and n c 4 for seasonal timescale for equally likely events ae would become maximum hmax and log 2 nc hmax changes with the time scale of evaluation for example hmax would be log 2365 for the daily scale hmax would be log212 for the monthly scale and hmax would be log24 for the seasonal timescale further explanation on how to calculate ae and aemax is given in appendix b here ae measures the intra annual rainfall amount distribution i e intra annual variability associated with the individual timescales fig 1 a and b illustrates how a given rainfall distribution translates into ae fig 1 a represents a hypothetical rainfall distribution with the rainfall amount equal in all the months 1 to 12 for this case since the probability of occurrence is the same for each month ae will be the maximum on the contrary ae becomes zero when the entire rainfall occurs during only one month see fig 1 b this indicates that ae takes on a value within the finite range of zero to log n c where zero corresponds to high variability of rainfall and log n c represents low variability i e rainfall amount is uniformly distributed 3 4 intensity entropy ie intensity entropy ie also proposed by maruyama et al 2005 measures the variability of rainy days m i of a month or season within a year to the total number of rainy days in that year m the likelihood will be m i m the ie is estimated for each year at all rainfall grid locations using 5 ie i 1 n c m i m log 2 m i m where nc is the number of class intervals for instance nc 12 for monthly timescale and nc 4 for seasonal timescale since the outcome is the number of rainy days ie at the daily scale is not considered here ie is used to measure the intra annual variability in terms of intra annual rainy day s distribution fig 1 c and d illustrates a simple example of translating a given rainy day distribution into intensity entropy if the number of rainy days is the same for all the months see fig 1 c then ie will be the maximum on the other hand if the total number of rainy days gets concentrated in a certain month then ie will be zero this indicates that ie takes on a value within the finite range of zero to log nc where zero corresponds to high variability and log nc represents low variability i e rainy days are equally distributed it is evident from eq 3 that the maximum entropy is a function of the sample size of the data and from eqs 4 and 5 that the maximum entropy is dependent on the timescale of evaluation hence in order to compare the entropy variability of time series of different data lengths and different timescales one needs an additional measure to this end in this study we propose a normalized index which can be used for comparing variability at multiple timescales as presented next 3 5 standardized variability index svi in the present study we propose the measure of redundancy developed by singh 2013 as the standardized variability index svi to calculate the normalized variability we define the svi as 6 svi h max h h max where hmax is the maximum possible entropy and h is the entropy obtained for the given time series hmax in eq 6 is equal to log 2 n and it is dependent on the length of the data as well as the time scale for different time scales hmax will be different to overcome this limitation eq 6 has been developed the svi determines the variability associated with the individual series with reference to the maximum possible variability from the definition svi takes on a value within a finite range of 0 to 1 where zero corresponds to no variability and one represents high variability i e maximum certainty to maximum uncertainty since the svi has a finite range it can be very useful for inter comparison of results between different time series and at multiple timescales the greater the svi the higher the variability thus using the svi one can compare the rainfall variability at different locations and different timescales on a fixed scale in the present study me ae and ie are expressed in terms of svi and are denoted as svime sviae and sviie respectively 3 6 mann kendall mk statistic in order to test the presence of a trend in the svi time series obtained for each of the rainfall grids considered in the present study we use the mann kendall mk test the non parametric mk test proposed by kendall 1975 and mann 1945 is found to be robust in the trend detection analysis since it does not require any prior assumption on the distributional form of the data the test statistic s is calculated with the variance as 7 s p 1 n 1 q p 1 n s g n x q x p 8 v a r s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 j p q t p t p 1 2 t p 5 where n is the length of the time series xq and xp represent the sequential data points sgn k is a sign function and takes values of 1 0 1 for k 0 k 0 and k 0 respectively tp is the number of ties for the p th value and q is the number of tied values the standardized test statistic is given by z s 1 v a r s if s 0 0 if s 0 s 1 v a r s if s 0 at a significant level of α 0 05 the null hypothesis that no trend exists should be rejected if the absolute value of z is greater than z 1 α 2 1 96 a positive value of z indicates an upward trend whereas a negative value indicates a downward trend 4 results and discussion 4 1 inter year rainfall variability over different timescales to investigate the relative variability of annual seasonal and monthly rainfall the marginal entropy and correspondingly svime is calculated based on the amount of rainfall for each considered grid location the svime gives us an understanding of the variability obtained out of the maximum variability possible that can be associated with a particular time series i e the relative variability the svime is calculated for the annual time series over the period 1901 2013 at every rainfall grid point 4443 grid points in total fig 2 a shows the spatial distribution of svime the mean annual precipitation for the period 1901 2013 is depicted in fig 2 b the results indicate that in general mean annual rainfall decreases westwards in northern india and eastwards in peninsular india but it seems to increase in the coastal regions high values of mean annual rainfall are observed in the northeastern regions and the west coast of the country while the northwestern region shows low mean annual rainfall from the spatial distribution of svime fig 2 a it is observed that grid points with high variability are observed in the low rainfall regions and vice versa the grid points located in the northern region have the highest variability coinciding with the lowest rainfall the grid points with low variability are identified in the northeastern region and in the west coast of the country coinciding with high rainfall similarly svime is also computed for rainfall time series at the seasonal and monthly timescales fig 3 a d presents the spatial distribution of svime at seasonal and monthly timescales and table 1 presents the statistical properties of svime for the seasonal and monthly time series individual seasons are compared to examine the interannual variability of seasonal rainfall within the year helps in understanding the season s responsible for the annual variability mishra et al 2009 in the winter season except for the far south and himalayan regions the rest of the country has high variability fig 3 d the variability is low in the southern part since it receives regular rainfall from the northeast monsoon rajeevan et al 2012 sreekala et al 2011 and in the case of the himalayas and its surrounding regions trade winds travel from the mediterranean sea western disturbances causing significant rainfall during winter season shukla et al 2019 however the other parts of the country receive unseasonal rains in an irregular manner with no uniform pattern causing high variability in the spatial extent of 20 n to 32 n rajeevan et al 2012 sreekala et al 2011 thus the winter season contributes the most to the annual relative variability and summer contributes the least see table 1 on the other hand the summer season contributes the highest percentage to the annual rainfall and winter the least as expected it is interesting to note that even though a majority of the annual rainfall 75 80 comes from the summer season the variability in the annual rainfall is contributed mainly by the winter season the winter and spring seasons have high relative variability concentrated in the western region of central india see fig 3 a and d examining the intervariability of rainfall of the months within the season helps in understanding the month s responsible for the seasonal variability mishra et al 2009 the results herein reveal that overall entropy based relative variability of seasonal time series is always lower than that of its constituent months see table 1 for instance svime for the spring season is lower than that for march april and may individually fig 3 a and this is due to the fact that the inter annual variability will be larger at a smaller time scale and becomes smaller at a larger time scale i e at an annual time scale mishra et al 2009 generally the variability dampens when we move from finer to coarser time scales since svime captures the inter annual variability across the 113 years high svime indicates a possibility that the rainfall amounts may be highly varying in march april and may due to shifts in the rainfall patterns but considering the spring season as whole this may not get captured a similar pattern is also observed in other seasons this observation clearly reflects that the spatial distribution of the svime varies with the seasons as well as with the months higher values of svime at the monthly timescale are observed in the western region and some traces in the eastern coastal region during mam the spatial distribution of the svime in fig 3 b and c clearly shows that the variability in the indian summer monsoon rainfall june july august and september months is relatively low and thus suggests lower uncertainty associated with the summer rainfall when compared to the other seasons it can be said that for the entire 113 year duration period there is only a minimal variation in the summer monsoon rainfall and it is a good signature for the field of agriculture as a large part of the agricultural productivity comes from the monsoon rainfall in case of ondjf months high variability is observed in the northwestern and coastal regions see fig 3 c and d the reason for high inter annual variability in coastal areas is due to the fact that the entire coast is affected by tropical cyclones with varying frequency and intensity over the years mohapatra et al 2012 fig a 2 is the rainfall time series of a station 73 50 e 16 25 n along the west coast during the winter season and it reveals that rainfall is not regular and the years with rainfall are typically due to cyclonic activities rainfall due to cyclones and hurricanes is not part of the regular monsoon but affects the coastal area and these cyclones are unseasonal rains and consequently there is high temporal variability across coastal areas during the post monsoon season only southern parts of the country will receive rainfall during the winter season in conjunction with this low pressure will be created in the extreme northern parts of the indian subcontinent and it receives rainfall due to the western disturbances from fig 3 d it unravels that southern and northern parts of the country have low variability and the rest of the country has high variability since for the rest of the country rainfall is not expected during this season 4 2 intra year variability of rainfall over different timescales after assessing the inter year variability of rainfall at different timescales over the entire study period 1901 2013 we further examine the intra year variability of rainfall distribution in terms of the rainfall amount and the number of rainy days intra year variability of rainfall amount the apportionment entropy ae and consequently the sv i ae are calculated at the daily monthly and seasonal timescales for every rainfall grid point for each year covering the entire length of the data i e 113 sv i ae values at each of daily monthly and seasonal timescales for the purpose of illustration here results are shown only for five randomly selected grids given in fig a 3 a whose geographical coordinates are given in table c 1 fig a 3 b presents the sv i ae obtained for these grids at the daily top monthly middle and seasonal bottom timescales the results indicate that a much higher fluctuation of variability is observed at the seasonal scale compared to that at the monthly and daily timescales in almost all of the rainfall grid locations considered we further compute the mean of sv i ae for the period 1901 2013 at each rainfall grid location and at each timescale fig 4 a c the spatial patterns of the mean sviae at the daily scale see fig 4 a reveal a higher value in the range of 0 45 0 65 in the northwestern region of the country and lowest in the northeastern and west coast regions of the country the region with higher sviae at the daily scale indicates concentration of rainfall during only a few days of the year whereas lower values indicate that the rainfall is throughout the year which is generally the situation in the northeast peninsular and coastal regions the northwestern part of the country receives its total annual rainfall in a few days and therefore the region encounters higher variability in rainfall at the monthly scale see fig 4 b rainfall grid locations with high variability extend to the western and central india indicating that rainfall in a major part of the country occurs only during a few months at the seasonal scale the pattern becomes more prominent and most parts of the country show high variability in the range of 0 4 0 8 see fig 4 c interestingly the mean annual rainfall for the west coast and the northeastern parts of the country is almost the same see fig 2 b but the rainfall variability is quite different see fig 4 a c at the daily timescale fig 4 a the values are low in both the regions however at the seasonal timescale fig 4 c the values are high on the western coast this difference at the seasonal and daily timescales is due to the seasonal distribution of the rainfall across the country these results reveal that the pattern of the rainfall variability becomes more prominent when the timescale changes from finer to coarser i e from daily 365 bins to seasonal timescale 4 bins a comparison of the statistical properties of the sv i ae presented in table 2 shows that the mean sv i ae is highest at the seasonal scale and lowest at the daily scale in addition at all scales the mean svi is found to decrease from west to east of the country signifying higher variability in the western part of the country due to the sharp seasonality of rainfall in time over the year and it is attributed to high normalized rainfall over coastal regions most of which occur during summer monsoon season notably over the western ghats both normalized rainfall and svi are high thus leading to very high values of intra annual variability the intriguing relationship between the rainfall seasonality apprehended by the svi and the mean annual rainfall captured by the svi is quite evident in the spatial map of the apportionment entropy relative intra year variability of rainy days the intensity entropy ie and correspondingly the sv i ie are calculated at the monthly and seasonal timescales at each of the rainfall grid locations for each year i e 113 sv i ie values at monthly and seasonal timescales the temporal mean of sv i ie for all the 113 years is computed at the monthly and seasonal timescales the spatial distribution of the mean sviie at the monthly scale see fig 4 d shows that a low variability is concentrated around peninsular india at the seasonal scale see fig 4 e high variability regions are located in the western and central india it is observed that the sviie pattern is similar to that of the sviae at both the monthly and the seasonal timescales we also observe a distinct pattern of decrease from the western part to the eastern part of the indian subcontinent high variability in terms of sviie indicates that the rainy days are concentrated only within a certain period of the year and low variability shows that the rainy days are distributed or scattered across the year further the results based on the statistical characteristics mean minimum and maximum of the sviie obtained at all the rainfall grid locations indicate that the variability is high at the seasonal timescale compared to that at the monthly timescale see table 2 for instance the mean value of sviie at the monthly scale is 0 2860 whereas it is 0 4863 at the seasonal scale overall based on sviae and sviie values the summer season and the indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr months jjas are found to be having a low variability at the monthly and seasonal timescales according to sahany et al 2018 these months contribute 75 80 of the total annual rainfall in india this implies that the significant quantum of annual rainfall has low variability and is highly certain on the other hand the winter season experiences high variability and consequently shows a low level of certainty the spatial variability pattern of sviae and sviie show higher values over the western and central india indicating that the total annual rainfall in these regions is concentrated to certain seasons only it is also observed that the pattern of variability refer to fig 4 a c is different at all the three timescales analyzed daily monthly and seasonal which highlights the multiscale variability of the rainfall pattern grid points concentrated in the east coast peninsular and northern parts of the country at the daily scale as well as east coast at the seasonal scale have high values compared to that at the monthly scale refer to fig 4 a c from the svi values presented in table 2 it may be concluded that the relative variability varies from scale to scale 4 3 spatial variation of inter year variability svi in order to investigate the spatial pattern of the rainfall variability obtained using the above three entropy measures we study the relationship between the different svis and latitude longitude and elevation we first plot the relationship between all three svis and latitude fig 5 by averaging the svis corresponding to all longitudes taken across a specific latitude fig 5 a d shows the variation of the svime with latitude for the different seasons and months it is evident that there is a prominent but different pattern for every season for example during the fall season the variability is low for the latitudes between 10 n 15 n and is high for the rest of the latitudes see fig 5 c this clearly shows that the regions 10 n 15 n under the northeast monsoon have low rainfall variability and therefore less uncertain similar plots of the variation of the svi in terms of ae and ie at different timescales are shown in fig 5 e and f respectively the plots reveal that there is no significant trend at the daily scale however at the monthly and seasonal scales the sviae has an increasing trend from 8 25 n to 23 n and from there onwards has a decreasing trend up to 36 75 n see fig 5 e a similar pattern of variation is observed also for sviie see fig 5 f similarly fig 6 shows the variation of the svis against the longitude the plots indicate that the svime decreases with the longitude for the annual seasonal and monthly timescales see fig 6 a d the sviae and sviie also follow a decreasing trend with the longitude moving from west to east see fig 6 e f the relationship between the svi measures svime svi ae and sviie and elevation is helpful to gain understanding about the relative variability of rainfall with the topography in this study the qgis3 4 software with point sampling tool is employed to extract the elevations of every grid point from srtm 30 m digital elevation model dem the elevation vs svime at annual seasonal and monthly scales does not yield any significant relationship figures not shown here however for sviae and sviie there is a definite relationship with the elevation fig 7 shows the variation of the sviae and sviie against elevation the results show that the sviae is high in the elevation range of 0 to 150 m at the daily monthly and seasonal scales and is in the range 0 0 3 beyond 1000 m elevation see fig 7 a c considering the sviie the monthly and seasonal scales have a similar kind of trend that is observed for sviae see fig 7 d e 4 4 entropy based classification of water resources availability we further make an attempt to use the entropy based measures derived above to classify the spatial regions in terms of their water resources availability for this purpose we couple the sviae with the annual average rainfall since such a coupling would result in delineating the regions according to rainfall amount and variability a similar approach has been adopted by kawachi et al 2001 for japan to identify regions with potential water resources availability fig 8 a shows the scatter plot constructed between sviae at the daily scale and the annual average rainfall mm year the entire plot is classified into four regions by the lines passing through the mean values of sviae 0 34 and the average annual rainfall 1120 mm these four regions are denoted as class a class b class c and class d as shown in fig 8 a it is noted that the rainfall grid locations falling under class a receive rainfall more than the average value and the variability in terms of sviae is less than its mean value this indicates that these locations have high rainfall amount with low variability and therefore water resources are abundant and perennially available at these grid points similarly the locations falling under class b receive a low amount of rainfall with low variability indicating that the water resources are moderate but perennial in these locations water resources development and management are required to raise availability during the spells of high water demand kawachi et al 2001 in the case of the locations falling under class c it can be said that these regions receive a low amount of rainfall but with high variability resulting in low and ephemeral water resources availability to meet the perennial water demand at these locations there is a need to increase the disposable water resources by the construction of water storage facilities the regions under class d on the other hand receive a high amount of rainfall with high variability at these locations the majority of the rainfall is mostly concentrated in certain seasons suggesting the necessity of flood management in parallel with the storage of surplus water in the reservoirs fig 8 b shows the geographical distribution of the four regions in india highlighted in fig 8 a this classification is a result of simple clustering through average annual rainfall and its relative variability measure in terms of entropy s v i a e regions falling under class a are in the western coast central northeastern region and some parts of indo gangetic plains in these regions the mean annual rainfall and rainfall seasonality are found to be high when compared to all india s average annual rainfall sahany et al 2018 class a receives rainfall from both swm and nem bringing more amount of rainfall fukushima et al 2019 and the daily timescale variability of rainfall is also low in these regions in the case of class b the regions are scattered across the country and have low intra annual variability and the mean annual rainfall is low due to a decrease in the strength of swm class c covers the northwest southern and northernmost parts of india regions in the northwest of the country receive rainfall only from swm and the magnitude is very low and intra annual variability is also high regions in the northwest of the country receive rainfall only in swm and the magnitude is very low and intra annual variability is also high the regions in the southern part receive rainfall in both swm and nem but its magnitude is less than the mean annual rainfall of entire india fukushima et al 2019 in the case of class d the regions are in some parts of coastal areas central india and indo gangetic plains the regions in coastal areas receive excess rainfall due to tropical cyclones forming in the bay of bengal and arabian sea resulting in high variability mohapatra et al 2012 however in central india and the indo gangetic plains rainfall primarily occurs from swm with rainfall seasonality becoming sharper since the 1950s leading to high intra annual variability this finding is in agreement with the observation made by many earlier studies bhatla et al 2019 goswami et al 2006 malik et al 2016 roxy et al 2017 thus implying potentially a significant increase in extreme rainfall events over central india and the indo gangetic plains in the near future 4 5 trend analysis of apportionment and intensity entropies to understand the temporal pattern of the rainfall variability at every grid location we evaluate the trends of sviae and sviie using the non parametric mann kendall mk method we conduct a trend analysis with a 95 confidence limit directly on the different svis spatial representation of the rainfall grid locations with a significant trend at the monthly and seasonal timescales both for sviae and s v i i e are presented in fig a 4 the red color positive trend represents an increase in rainfall variability over the years which in turn indicates that rainfall gets more concentrated only during certain period of the year on the other hand a light green color negative trend indicates that the spread of rainfall within a year increases similarly fig 9 for instance presents the grid points with the significant trend of sviae at the daily timescale at the daily scale the mk test detects a positive trend in central india northeast and southern peninsular parts of india whereas a negative trend in north india west coast and east coast regions a summary of the grid locations having significant increasing and decreasing trends based on the mann kendall test for the different scales considered in the study are given in table c 2 as seen the number of locations with positive and negative trends varies substantially from the daily scale to the seasonal scale we notice that at all timescales grid points with a positive trend are mostly concentrated in central india and grid points with a negative trend are present in the northernmost parts of the country this can be attributed to the increasing heterogeneity in rainfall over india after 1950s which has also been reported by several previous studies goswami et al 2006 roxy et al 2017 overall the results from the trend analysis indicate that the number of grid locations with positive and negative trends varies from scale to scale with the number of points having significant trend being highest at the daily scale this suggests that the change in intra annual rainfall dynamics can be understood in a better way at the daily scale than at coarser timescales for a further in depth investigation of the change in the variability of rainfall amount we randomly select a grid location 76 75 e 14 25 n marked with black star in fig 9 and analyze the actual distribution of the rainfall amount for this location the time series of the number of rainy days sviae and the total amount of rainfall for the period 1901 2013 are plotted in fig 10 there is a temporally decreasing trend of rainy days and an increasing trend of sviae clearly there exists an inverse relationship between rainy days and the entropy based svi measure in addition to the above it would also be interesting to study the rainfall distribution of the years having similar rainfall amounts to this end we select four different sets of years 1905 and 1960 1902 and 1971 1928 and 2006 and 1948 and 2013 for a total of eight years with each set having similar rainfall amount fig 11 shows the rainfall distribution for these eight years and the number of rainy days is given in table c 3 as seen for instance while the years 1905 and 1960 have the same amount of rainfall 313 mm the distribution of rainfall and the number of rainy days are significantly different from each other indicating a change in the rainfall pattern similar observations can also be made for the other three sets of years these observations seem to indicate that there is a significant decrease in the number of rainy days in the latter part of the last century after 1950 when compared to the earlier part and that such an aspect is revealed by the increasing trend of svi from the sviae trend analysis our null hypothesis i e increase in rainfall variability at a daily scale is accepted for 1476 grid points 30 land area at 95 confidence limit in particular most of the grid points lie in central india see fig 9 in conformity with earlier studies goswami et al 2006 rajeevan et al 2008 roxy et al 2017 indicating that the frequency of extreme rainfall events over central india has increased by about 75 during the period 1950 2015 this implies that the amount of rain gets concentrated in just a few days rainy days are decreasing sahany et al 2018 reported a decrease of 15 rainy days per century in central india based on the second moment of rainfall monthly accumulation analysis kumar and jain 2011 based on an analysis of the number of rainy days for the period 1951 2004 reported a decrease in the number of rainy days in 15 major river basins in india and an increase in the number of rainy days in 4 major river basins the results from the present study are therefore certainly in line with the observations made by kumar and jain 2011 these observations seem to suggest that extreme rainfall events will likely increase across the country in the near future especially due to an increasing rainfall variability this is a very significant point to note especially from a hydrological point of view since it suggests the possibility of extreme floods over a few days in a year and droughts during the rest of the year comparing the results obtained from the trend analysis fig 9 with the water availability map fig 8 b it is found that a majority of the grid points falling under class a and class b experience a positive trend in the svi which implies that these locations will have an increased variability of rainfall in the near future this seems to suggest that these grid points located in class a and class b might move into class d and class c respectively this entails that a majority of the annual rainfall might get concentrated to fewer and fewer days resulting in more extreme events which is indeed an alarming situation the above results and observations suggest that the proposed entropy based svi measures proposed in the study have the ability to capture the inter annual and intra annual variability at different timescales further the svi based analysis shows that the rainfall variability in the indian subcontinent is highly complex and varies both spatially and temporally the results also reveal that there is an increasing trend in the intra annual variability at certain locations in the indian subcontinent this is particularly relevant in the context of global warming induced climate changes that exercise different influences on the strength or weakness of summer monsoons as well as their onset duration termination temporal and spatial distributions number of rainy days time interval between rainy days and amount of summer rainfall therefore there is a great scope to use the proposed svi measures to investigate the variability of rainfall under new emerging dynamics and patterns such an investigation and the outcomes can be of great importance for undertaking proper agricultural practices and water management policies and decisions in the future 5 conclusions we applied the entropy based standardized variability index svi to characterize the spatial variability of indian rainfall at multiple timescales the svi measure has immense potential over the disorder index as it allows comparison of the rainfall variability at multiple scales furthermore its application is independent of the temporal scale and data length based on the results the following major conclusions are drawn 1 the rainfall variability had a distinct decreasing pattern from the west to the east at all timescales showing larger variability in western india analysis of data at the seasonal scale revealed that winter season contributed the most to the annual variability and summer the least however the strength of the seasonal contribution to the annual variability also varied spatially 2 the pattern of the rainfall variability in terms of sviae became more prominent as we moved from finer i e daily to coarser i e seasonal scale at all scales the mean svi was found to decrease from the west to the east of the country signifying higher variability in the western part of the country and higher uncertainty the spatial distribution of the mean sviie at the monthly scale indicated that a relatively low variability was concentrated in peninsular india at the seasonal scale high relative variability regions were found to be located in the western and central india 3 trend analysis revealed a significant increase in rainfall variability at the daily timescale in most parts of the indian subcontinent this observation was best supported by the shrinking nature of the rainfall distribution and a decrease in the number of rainy days in the latter part of the twentieth century after 1950 when compared to the former 4 from the water availability map it was observed that approximately 40 of the country fell under class a rainfall average value sviae mean value and class d rainfall average value sviae mean value and the remaining 60 of the country under the class b rainfall average value sviae mean value and class c rainfall average value sviae mean value coupling water availability map with trend analysis suggested that amajority of the annual rainfall increasingly gets concentrated to fewer days resulting in a greater number of extreme events which would lead to an alarming situation declaration of

times and it is closely related to the development of the national economy the water level reflects the content reserve capacity of the hydrological system which can determine the load capacity and self regulation limit of the hydrological system for example navigation power has to first examine the water level the size of water volume has a direct impact on the scale of local economic development and the carrying capacity of the population the first thing to consider in people s life and production is the amount of water resources in this area if the utilization of water resources is overloaded it will become the bottleneck of development therefore the efficient management of the hydrological system the real time monitoring of water level height and the stability control of water quantity are all very important as a consequence it is particularly vital to predict the water level height in advance in order to realize early warning the prediction method of water level height is mainly divided into process driven model and data driven model based on the professional knowledge of hydrology the process driven prediction model simulates the changing process of river water level height so as to establish a mathematical model for water level prediction on the other hand the data driven prediction model does not take into account the hydrological background of the change of water level height which depends on the historical data of water level height and realizes the prediction by learning the relationship between the historical data and the future data of water level at present the process driven model and data driven model are both applied in the hydrology application fields abrahart et al 2012 blöschl et al 2019 while the hydrological post processing for hydrological forecasting is the primary work of national hydro meteorological agencies papacharalampous et al 2019 according to the complexity of the models it is known as single model and hybrid model chang et al 2016 nourani and mousavi 2016 sahoo et al 2017 supreetha et al 2015 hybrid models generally include prediction methods based on pre processing methods or post processing methods by preprocessing the original data the pre processing method makes the series more stable and reduces the complexity of the prediction procedure which usually includes decomposition algorithm elimination of anomalies denoising and etc seo et al applied the wavelet decomposition algorithm into the prediction framework to construct two hybrid water level prediction models for daily water level forecasting the results showed that the wavelet decomposition methods could effectively improve the prediction accuracy seo et al 2015 yang et al used classification method and factor analysis to preprocess the data eliminated the secondary variables to determine the key variables and reduced the difficulty of model prediction the experimental results demonstrated that this pretreatment idea could improve the performance of the proposed five water level prediction models yang et al 2017 in addition wavelet decomposition wd altunkaynak 2014 moosavi et al 2014 shafaei and kisi 2016 empirical mode decomposition emd kisi et al 2014 wavelet packet decomposition wpd seo et al 2016 sujay raghavendra and deka 2015 in the decomposition algorithm wavelet denoising chou 2011 in the denoising method and filtering madsen and skotner 2005 zijl et al 2015 in the data assimilation method have been proved to be integrated into the water level prediction model to ameliorate the prediction effect of the model the post processing method is to obtain the error sequence of the predicted values use the error sequence to build a model to standardize the range of prediction error and improve the prediction accuracy lópez et al utilized the quantile regression technique as a statistical post processor to optimize the prediction accuracy of the water level forecasting model the results indicated that the four developed post processing strategies were effective lópez lópez et al 2014 madadgar et al compared the post processor based on copula function with the improved quantile mapping qm method and proved that the former post processing method was more effective in ameliorating the forecasting performance of hydrological prediction model madadgar et al 2014 other post processing methods such as error correction bogner and kalas 2008 kalman filtering kf shen et al 2015 and etc have also been applied in the field of water level prediction the main idea of the ensemble learning method is to heighten the forecasting accuracy of the hybrid model by constructing several base predictors and using the weighted method to integrate all or part of the base predictors to obtain the meta predictor ensemble learning methods include the boosting algorithm barzegar et al 2017 friedman 2001 stacking algorithm tyralis et al 2019 wolpert 1992 random forest rf breiman 2001 li et al 2016 and etc sun and trevor proposed adopting the simple average methods sam method to combine the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis algorithm artificial neural network ann and multiple linear regression mlr model and compared with the corresponding single model the results verified the superiority of the combined model sun and trevor 2018 besides the prediction modeling and weighted integration of the unused water level monitoring data is the mainstream idea of the integrated prediction algorithm in this field nourani et al 2011 through the analysis of literature review it can be seen that it is important to realize the water level short term forecasting for the river management and it is also feasible to use the ensemble learning modeling to obtain the water level forecasting results 2 methodology 2 1 framework of the proposed hybrid model in this study a novel hybrid water level forecasting model is developed based on the ssa method the gmdh neural networks the wiad ensemble algorithm and the kelm algorithm the purpose of the proposed model in the study is to build the relationships between the historical water level data and their corresponding future data to realize the water level forecasting which means the study presents a model that forecasts based on previous values in the proposed model the original water level series is reconstructed into a new series with better smoothness by the ssa method before forecasted by the gmdh base predictors the wiad algorithm integrates the selected base predictors and the kelm algorithm models the error of the result after the first prediction to test the forecasting performance of the ssa wiad gmdh kelm model some other models are selected as the comparison models which comprise of the single gmdh model ssa gmdh model ssa wiad gmdh model and ssa gmdh kelm model by comparing the performance of the proposed model on different occasions the optimal window length of the ssa method and the optimal integrated parameter are determined according to the error evaluation indices applied in the study besides the xiangjiang river and yuanjiang river of china is the study area where four groups of original water level data in four monitoring stations are selected to test the accuracy of the proposed model the modeling process of the proposed hybrid prediction model in the paper is shown in fig 1 there are four groups of original water level time series both including 800 sample points in the study they are divided into the following datasets dataset n1 for training ssa decomposition and gmdh based predictors including the 1st 600th sample points where dataset m1 is utilized to train all the gmdh based predictors and dataset m2 is utilized to verify the trained base predictors so as to calculate the accuracy and diversity indices of base predictors dataset n2 for verifying and testing the trained ssa wiad gmdh predictor including the 601st 800th sample points dataset n3 for constructing error sequence and training kelm error modeling method including the 601st 700th sample points dataset n4 is utilized to test the final hybrid prediction model which contains the 701st 800th sample points the specific partition result is shown in fig 2 in the study the data splitting strategy is proposed to match with the computational process of the proposed water level forecasting model the proposed model consists of the computational components of ssa gmdh wiad and kelm in the proposed ssa gmdh wiad framework the ssa is used to preprocess the original data the gmdh is adopted for the forecasting computation and the wiad is utilized to select the most suitable gmdh base predictors from the initial gmdh base predictors by considering both of the fitting accuracy and diversity capacity of each built base predictor for the computation of the ssa gmdh wiad framework the original water level data are divided into the training set n1 and the validation set n2 since even the best base predictor still will have predicting errors in the proposed water level forecasting model the kelm is further presented to realize the error series forecasting and error correction for the ssa gmdh wiad combination this is the reason why the validation set n2 is further divided into the second training set n3 and the test set n4 the kelm is a machine learning algorithm which needs the training data based on the data splitting strategy the proposed water level forecasting model promotes the usage value of the original water level data as well as the diversity of the base predictors so that the forecasting performance can be finally promoted the main contributions of the study are provided as follows 1 the gmdh neural networks for water level forecasting is studied 2 the wiad method integrating base predictors are first proposed which has excellent ability to improve the prediction accuracy and generalization ability of the model 3 the pre processing method ssa and the post processing method kelm are comprehensively adopted to construct the hybrid model which greatly improves the forecasting performance 4 the proposed hybrid model provides a new idea and method for the prediction and early warning of river water level height to a certain extent the prediction accuracy of river water level is enhanced the structure of this essay is organized as shown below section 2 shows the theoretical basis of ssa gmdh wiad and kelm methods and explains the study object demonstrates the experimental process and determines the optimal parameters of the ssa method and wiad algorithm section 3 presents the prediction results of water level analyzes the forecasting performance and compares the main hybrid models with the proposed model section 4 concludes the study 2 2 model construction step 1 standardize four groups of original water level series data and divide the processed data into training set and test set according to the data partitioning method in section 3 1 2 where the standardized processing is to convert four groups of the training set data into the interval of 0 1 namely normalization operation to avoid a large deviation in the evaluation of the prediction results due to the difference in the order of magnitude of the original data the forecasting time scale of the prediction model is set to 1 h that is each forecasting process is one step ahead step 2 obtain the components of four groups of training set series by ssa and construct n gmdh based predictors take the components of training sets as the input of the base predictors and the corresponding training process prediction values are output for each training process of the predictor the input is the water level data of the components from the mth sample point to the nth sample point of each group of water level series obtained by four stations and the output of the model is the water level data at the n 1 th sample point of each group of water level series which means the number of the input nodes of the proposed model is n m 1 step 3 through the verification results on the dataset m2 in the n1 training set calculate the accuracy index and diversity index of each gmdh base predictor according to the method in section 2 3 obtain the wiad value of each base predictor by weighted fusion and select the first m base predictors according to the descending order of wiad value step 4 use the m base predictors selected in step 3 to predict the test set and the predicted values of the output are averaged to get the predicted value of water level the specific process is to firstly add the prediction results of m base predictors and then divide by m to get the output water level prediction value step 5 calculate the error sequence of the test set by subtracting the predicted values of the water level obtained in step 4 from the actual value in which dataset n3 are used as the training set of the error correction model kelm and dataset n4 as the test set step 6 acquire the error predicted values of the error sequence by using the process of training model and testing model add the error predicted values to the predicted values of dataset n4 in step 4 and the final water level predicted values of the proposed model are obtained 2 3 theoretical basis of method components 2 3 1 singular spectrum analysis singular spectrum analysis ssa is a kind of processing method which is used to analyze and study nonlinear time series in recent years it constructs the trajectory matrix of the original series and decomposes and reconstructs the matrix to obtain the principal component information of the original series in the paper the ssa method is used to preprocess the original water level data series the specific process is as follows 1 step 1 embedding selecting the appropriate window length l 2 l n the original water level series x x x 1 x 2 xn is transformed into a multi dimensional series and the trajectory matrix m is obtained as shown below 1 m x 1 x 2 x 3 x l x 2 x 3 x 4 x t 1 x m x m 1 x m 2 x n m n l 1 where l is the window length and n is the length of the original water level series 2 step 2 singular value decomposition svd supposing that there is a matrix s satisfying eq 2 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix are solved and the calculation process is shown in eq 3 2 s u v t where u is the orthogonal matrix of l l v is the orthogonal matrix of m m and is the diagonal matrix of l m 3 s t s v i λ i v i 4 σ i λ i 5 μ i 1 σ i s v i where v represents the right singular vector σ is the singular value and μ is the left singular vector the first r larger singular values are used to approximately describe the matrix as follows 6 s u l r r r v r m t where r is a number much smaller than l and m 3 step 3 grouping supposing there are n singular values σ 1 σ 2 σn define the contribution rate of the ith singular value as follows 7 co n σ i σ i i 1 n σ i according to the calculated contribution rate they are arranged in descending order and the first r singular values whose cumulative contribution rate is greater than the threshold are selected 4 step 4 reconstruction the matrix reconstruction is completed according to the above equations and then the original water level series is reconstructed according to the following equations

follows the principle of polynomial approximation based on the self organizing idea of the multi layer neural network the k g polynomial of the nonlinear system is fitted by the continuous binary combination of neurons in each layer of the neural network the ultimate goal is to find the optimal function expression to converge to the real unknown mapping kim et al 2009 mo et al 2018 10 y α 0 i 1 n α i x i i 1 n j 1 n α ij x i x j i 1 n j 1 n k 1 n α ijk x i x j x k where x x x 1 x 2 xn represents the input variable of the network α α α 1 α 2 αn represents the weight and y represents the output variable the establishment of k g polynomials is realized by passing input variables layer by layer any neuron in the gmdh network receives input variables from the upper layer such as xni and xnj and uses local functions such as fitting polynomials to generate output variables 11 y n α 0 α 1 x ni α 2 x nj α 3 x ni 2 α 4 x nj 2 α 5 x ni x nj for the first layer of neurons xni and xnj represent the input variables of the network the calculation of weight α 1 α 2 α 3 α 4 α 5 is acquired by minimizing the mean square error mse between the actual values and the neuron estimated output values mo et al 2018 12 min e n 1 n y n y n 2 n where the sample size of the training set is recorded as n after the weight is obtained by minimizing the mse the optimal transfer function of the node is obtained then a number of neurons are selected from the new generation of neurons as the input of the next layer of neurons screening criteria generally use the following methods 1 prediction error square sum criterion 13 pess t 1 n y t y t 2 2 aic criterion 14 aic n ln s k 2 2 k c s k 2 t 1 n y t y t 2 n where c is a constant and k is the number of independently adjustable parameters 3 weighted error square criterion in prediction domain 15 mwss t 1 n λ 1 l w λ e 2 λ where w λ is the weighted function of the λ step ahead and e 2 λ represents the prediction error of the λ step ahead in the time t repeat such a process of dominance inheritance competitive survival and evolution until the minimum error of a certain layer reaches the termination condition or the number of layers reaches the size limit of the network and the optimal model is obtained the termination condition can be determined by the weighted error square criterion in the above prediction domain the method is as follows 16 mwss k min j m w s s k j where nwss k j represents the nwss value calculated for the jth neuron polynomial at layer k if a k satisfies the following formula the screening process will stop 17 mwss k mwss k 1 mwss k ε where ε is determined by experience the structure of the gmdh network changes during training fig 3 shows a typical gmdh network structure after training 2 3 3 weighted integration based on accuracy and diversity the formation of the wiad method comes from the idea of selective ensemble method ensemble learning refers to the algorithm of building multiple base predictors to enhance the generalization ability of the whole model while the purpose of the selective ensemble method is to integrate fewer base predictors to achieve better prediction and generalization performance tumer et al pointed out that the diversity between base predictors and the accuracy of base predictors are two important factors that determine the generalization performance of integrated systems tumer and ghosh 1996 the selective ensemble method in the paper is based on these two factors 1 diversity measurement diversity measurement is also called inconsistency measurement for discrete time series prediction the diversity between different base predictors is mainly reflected in the differences in the parameters and structure of the model but these are unpredictable and measured the difference between the two is usually judged by comparing the correlation between the prediction results generated by different base predictors liu and yao 1998 the commonly used methods are person correlation coefficient diversity measurement spearman correlation coefficient diversity measurement etc considering the fusion of the accuracy measurement index the paper uses mutual information mi to measure the diversity between base predictors supposing that the predicted outputs of the two base predictors oi and oj are yi y i 1 y i 2 y i n and yj y j 1 y j 2 y j n respectively the process of measuring the diversity between the two base predictors is shown below barman and kwon 2017 18 di v i j m i y i y j y j y j y i y i p y i y j log p y i y j p y i p y j where p y i y j is the joint probability distribution function of yi and yj while p y i and p y j are the edge probability distribution functions of yi and yj respectively since the mutual information of the base predictor itself is 1 the average diversity measure of each base predictor is shown below 19 di v i j 1 m di v i j 1 m 1 where m represents the number of base predictors 2 accuracy measurement the accuracy measurement of the base predictor is relatively simple which can be measured directly by using the mean absolute percentage error mape index of the base predictor to the original series supposing that the prediction output of the base predictor oi is y y 1 y 2 y n and the actual value is y y 1 y 2 yn the accuracy measure of the base predictor is as follows liu et al 2017 20 ac c i m a p e i i 1 n y i y i y i n 100 3 weighted harmonic average measurement based on accuracy and diversity because the variation rules of the diversity index and accuracy index of the base predictors are as follows the smaller the diversity index is the greater the diversity between the base predictors will be özöğür akyüz et al 2015 the smaller the accuracy index is the greater the accuracy of the base predictors will be in addition the impact of diversity and accuracy on the performance of the whole model is not clear therefore the paper uses the weighted harmonic average method to integrate the diversity and accuracy of the base predictors the ensemble process is as follows 21 wia d i δ di v i 1 δ ac c i where δ represents the weight of the diversity index of base predictors the pseudo code of the wiad method is shown as follows algorithm weighted integration based on accuracy and diversity 1 set the number of base predictors n and the number of selected base predictors m 2 divide the original data into training samples and test samples and n ssa gmdh base predictors are used to train the training samples 3 calculate the prediction accuracy index of each base predictor acc and the prediction output of each base predictor 4 calculate the average diversity index div of each base predictor 5 calculate the wiad measurement index of each base predictor according to eq 21 6 integrate the base predictors with the first m of the wiad measurement index 7 use the selected partial basis predictor to test the test samples and the prediction results of the model are obtained 2 3 4 kernel extreme learning machine extreme learning machine elm is known due to the fast learning speed good generalization performance and strong ability to search for global optimal solution dong et al 2017 the extreme learning machine can randomly generate the connection weights of the input layer and the hidden layer and the bias of the hidden layer and there is no need to adjust in the learning process huang and chen 2007 given n samples as xk xk yk k 1 2 n where xk is the input data yk is the actual values f is transfer function and n is the number of nodes in the hidden layer the solution process of the elm is shown below dong et al 2017 22 o j i 1 n λ i f w i x k b i k 1 2 n where oj is the output value of the elm wi ω i 1 ω i 2 ω in is the connection weight between the input node and the i th hidden layer node bi is the bias of the i th node of the hidden layer λ i is the connection weight between the i th hidden layer node and the output node moreover the transfer function in eq 22 can be expressed in the form of hidden layer output matrix and the kernel extreme learning machine replaces it with the kernel matrix compared with the elm it is not necessary to preset the number of nodes in the hidden layer the initial weight and the offset of the kelm 3 case study 3 1 study area and original data 3 1 1 study area the xiangjiang river and yuanjiang river located in china are selected as the research objects of river water level forecasting in the paper both xiangjiang river and yuanjiang river belong to the dongting lake system in the yangtze river basin the length of the mainstream of the xiangjiang river is 844 km with a basin area of 94 660 square kilometers and a drop of about 450 m tian et al 2018 the mainstream of the yuanjiang river has a total length of 1033 km and a basin area of 89 163 square kilometers with a drop of 1462 m zhou et al 2019 both the two rivers belong to pacific monsoon humid climate rainy in spring and summer dry in autumn and winter and the average annual precipitations are both above 1000 mm in recent years the water levels of the xiangjiang river and yuanjiang river have continuously reached record highs which has a certain negative impact on the life of residents near the rivers the hourly water level data from four monitoring stations chosen along the watershed of the xiangjiang river and the yuanjiang river which are located in taoyuan county yuanjiang city qidong county and zhuzhou county hunan province respectively are obtained from the hydrological information system operated by the water conservancy department of hunan province china fig 4 shows the geographical location of the four water level monitoring stations 3 1 2 original water level data for modeling the water level data of four monitoring stations in a certain period of time in 2019 are selected in the study the four groups of data include 800 sample points with a sampling interval of 1 h among them the 1st 600th sample points are used to train the proposed model and the 601st 800th sample points are used to test the trained forecasting model the four sets of data are recorded as 1 2 3 and 4 respectively fig 5 shows the changes in the four sets of original water level data and their corresponding box diagrams it can be seen from the diagram that the four groups of water level sequences fluctuate irregularly in a certain amplitude range reflecting the characteristics of strong randomness and non stationarity combined with the box diagrams of four groups of water level data it can be concluded that the fluctuation range of 1 is the largest 3 ranks second 2 and 4 have the smallest fluctuation range and the data distribution is the most concentrated 2 and 3 present obvious right skewness distribution with outliers concentrated on the side of larger values while 4 tended to be more symmetrical therefore before training model it is necessary to standardize the original data in order to reduce the impact of abnormal values on the prediction performance of the proposed model through the above data acquisition and analysis it can be seen that among the four groups of original water level data the geographical location of the data collection stations is different the fluctuation trend of the data is various covering several water level height sections there is diversity in the distribution of extreme values and the information contained in four groups of data is very different in summary the water level data in this study is quite representative additionally the xiangjiang river and yuanjiang river are the two main rivers in hunan province china and other rivers are basically their tributaries their hydrological characteristics are highly representative and have both research value and engineering value 3 2 forecasting experiment according to the modeling method in section 3 2 the simulation experiment of the proposed ssa wiad gmdh kelm hybrid model is carried out and the experimental data are four groups of original water level data in section 3 1 2 in order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid model the gmdh model ssa gmdh model ssa wiad gmdh model and gmdh kelm model are selected as comparison models and for the purpose of ensuring the consistency of the comparison results only 701st 800th sample points are utilized as the final test set in the section mape mae rmse sde and r are chosen as the evaluation indices of the forecasting results to quantify the prediction performance of all prediction models all the simulation experiments are carried out on the matlab platform and in the course of the experiment the ssa function alonso 2005 of the wavelet toolbox and the gmdh function yarpiz 2015 and kernel elm function huang 2010 of the neural network toolbox are adopted 3 3 influence analysis of model parameters 3 3 1 window length of ssa impact analysis the window length is the most pivotal factor affecting the performance of the singular spectrum analysis method which is also closely related to the forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid prediction model in order to ensure that the performance of ssa in the study is optimal to a certain extent the influence mechanism of window length on the prediction performance of the proposed model is studied and the regression fitting analysis of the original water level data 1 is carried out the result is shown in fig 6 it can be seen from the figure that except that the window length is 400 namely 1 2 of the length of the original water level series the impact level of the other window lengths on the forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid model are basically of the same order of magnitude when the window length is equal to 720 the forecasting performance of the hybrid model is optimal and the regression r value equals to 0 99118 therefore in the follow up study of the paper the ssa window length for the original water level data 1 is uniformly set to 720 furthermore it is determined by the same experimental method above for the original water level data 2 3 and 4 the window length of the ssa method are both set to 720 3 3 2 integrated parameter impact analysis for the wiad ensemble learning method the weight of the accuracy index of the base predictors and the diversity measurement index and the extraction ratio of the base predictors are the two key factors that affect the ensemble effect and the forecasting performance of the hybrid model in order to explore the influence mechanism of two parameters and ensure the prediction efficiency of the proposed hybrid model simulation experiments on four groups of water level series are carried out to explore the influence mechanism for the water level data 1 the extraction ratio of the base predictors varies from 0 1 to 0 9 and the accuracy index weight of the base predictors varies from 0 to 1 the prediction accuracy of the proposed hybrid model with two different integrated parameters is calculated and the results are shown in fig 7 it can be seen from the figure that when the two integrated parameters change within the set range the forecasting performance of the hybrid model is obviously affected but the regularity is not strong when the accuracy index weight of the base predictors equals to 0 6 and the extraction ratio of the base predictor equals to 0 3 the prediction accuracy of the hybrid model is the highest and the mape value is 0 0297 in order to avoid the above results being limited by the contingency of the original data set the influence of the accuracy index weight of the base predictors is analyzed according to the water level data 2 3 and 4 respectively when the extraction ratio of the base predictor is set to 0 3 the result is shown in fig 8 it can be seen from the figure that the results are consistent with the water level data 1 so the extraction ratio of the base predictors of the ssa wiad gmdh kelm hybrid model proposed in the paper is set to 0 3 and the weight of the accuracy index is set to 0 6 and the weight of diversity index is set to 0 4 3 4 forecasting results and discussion 3 4 1 forecasting results the prediction results of the proposed model and all comparative models for the original water level data 1 4 are shown in figs 9 12 3 4 2 forecasting performance analysis table 1 shows the forecasting performance index values of all models for four sets of raw water level data table 2 demonstrates the forecasting performance improvement of the proposed hybrid model compared with the ssa gmdh kelm model and ssa wiad gmdh model combining figs 8 11 and table 1 the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid model is the best for the four groups of original water level data 1 4 the performance of the ssa gmdh kelm model is the second and the prediction accuracy of the ssa wiad gmdh model ssa gmdh model and gmdh model decreases in turn it shows that the ensemble strategy of the four algorithms proposed in the paper is effective and has good generalization ability for water level data with different types and distribution fig 12 2 analyzing the forecasting performance index values and prediction result curve of the ssa gmdh model and gmdh model it can be proved that the ssa method can effectively improve the prediction effect of the hybrid model it is due to its ability to efficiently extract the main trend component in the original water level series eliminate the noise component and reduce the difficulty and complexity of the training and testing process of base predictors 3 comparing the ssa wiad gmdh kelm hybrid model with the ssa wiad gmdh model it can be seen that the kelm can make a great leap in the forecasting performance of the hybrid model and all the prediction indices are greatly improved the results show that the kelm algorithm as an error modeling method can further reduce the prediction error of the decomposition integrated predictor and standardize its error range which is a very effective post processing method 4 the prediction effect of the ssa wiad gmdh kelm hybrid model is also better than that of the ssa gmdh kelm model the wiad ensemble method takes into account the accuracy and mutual diversity of the base predictors and belongs to the consideration of the comprehensive performance to a certain extent which has a certain theoretical guiding significance 5 as a base predictor gmdh has a good ability to predict time series its prediction performance indices and curve fitting ability have achieved good results 6 the proposed hybrid prediction model can fit the main change trend of the four groups of original water level series to a higher extent but it still lacks the ability of high precision fitting in some peaks and troughs of the curve in addition there is a relatively weak time delay phenomenon which is more obvious in the prediction results of the original water level series 2 but in a word the proposed hybrid prediction model still has high practical application value in order to verify the high prediction accuracy of the proposed hybrid model the section proposes the prediction performance indices improvement percentage to compare and analyze the improvement of the prediction accuracy of the proposed model compared with ssa gmdh kelm model and ssa wiad gmdh model the specific calculation process is as follows 23 p mape m a p e 2 m a p e 1 m a p e 2 p mae m a e 2 m a e 1 m a e 2 p rmse r m s e 2 r m s e 1 r m s e 2 p sde s d e 2 s d e 1

the following conclusions can be obtained by interpreting table 2 and combining the information drawn above 1 by adjusting the relationship of base predictor combination arrangement by wiad algorithm using accuracy and difference index to classify and label all base predictors and filter them appropriately the integrated configuration of base predictors can be optimized and the ensemble efficiency can be improved the prediction performance of the hybrid model is improved which is strongly proved by the original water level series 1 and 2 although the optimization effect on datasets 3 and 4 is not obvious enough it is enough to see the predictive potential of the proposed model and still has good generalization ability 2 compared with the wiad algorithm the kelm is in a leading position in improving the performance of the hybrid model and its mape improvement effect on the original water level series 1 and 3 is even 20 and 15 71 this shows that after the prediction results of the original data set error modeling is very necessary which can further reduce the prediction error of the model and then improve the prediction performance 4 conclusions in this study a novel hybrid water level prediction model is proposed by using the ssa method gmdh neural network wiad ensemble method and kelm machine learning algorithm in the proposed model the ssa method can extract the main component of the original water level series and the gmdh network can realize the forecasting of the water level series as the base predictor the wiad ensemble method realizes the integration of the base predictors by considering the accuracy and diversity indices the kelm algorithm plays the role of error modeling in the hybrid computation to investigate the real performance of the proposed

times and it is closely related to the development of the national economy the water level reflects the content reserve capacity of the hydrological system which can determine the load capacity and self regulation limit of the hydrological system for example navigation power has to first examine the water level the size of water volume has a direct impact on the scale of local economic development and the carrying capacity of the population the first thing to consider in people s life and production is the amount of water resources in this area if the utilization of water resources is overloaded it will become the bottleneck of development therefore the efficient management of the hydrological system the real time monitoring of water level height and the stability control of water quantity are all very important as a consequence it is particularly vital to predict the water level height in advance in order to realize early warning the prediction method of water level height is mainly divided into process driven model and data driven model based on the professional knowledge of hydrology the process driven prediction model simulates the changing process of river water level height so as to establish a mathematical model for water level prediction on the other hand the data driven prediction model does not take into account the hydrological background of the change of water level height which depends on the historical data of water level height and realizes the prediction by learning the relationship between the historical data and the future data of water level at present the process driven model and data driven model are both applied in the hydrology application fields abrahart et al 2012 blöschl et al 2019 while the hydrological post processing for hydrological forecasting is the primary work of national hydro meteorological agencies papacharalampous et al 2019 according to the complexity of the models it is known as single model and hybrid model chang et al 2016 nourani and mousavi 2016 sahoo et al 2017 supreetha et al 2015 hybrid models generally include prediction methods based on pre processing methods or post processing methods by preprocessing the original data the pre processing method makes the series more stable and reduces the complexity of the prediction procedure which usually includes decomposition algorithm elimination of anomalies denoising and etc seo et al applied the wavelet decomposition algorithm into the prediction framework to construct two hybrid water level prediction models for daily water level forecasting the results showed that the wavelet decomposition methods could effectively improve the prediction accuracy seo et al 2015 yang et al used classification method and factor analysis to preprocess the data eliminated the secondary variables to determine the key variables and reduced the difficulty of model prediction the experimental results demonstrated that this pretreatment idea could improve the performance of the proposed five water level prediction models yang et al 2017 in addition wavelet decomposition wd altunkaynak 2014 moosavi et al 2014 shafaei and kisi 2016 empirical mode decomposition emd kisi et al 2014 wavelet packet decomposition wpd seo et al 2016 sujay raghavendra and deka 2015 in the decomposition algorithm wavelet denoising chou 2011 in the denoising method and filtering madsen and skotner 2005 zijl et al 2015 in the data assimilation method have been proved to be integrated into the water level prediction model to ameliorate the prediction effect of the model the post processing method is to obtain the error sequence of the predicted values use the error sequence to build a model to standardize the range of prediction error and improve the prediction accuracy lópez et al utilized the quantile regression technique as a statistical post processor to optimize the prediction accuracy of the water level forecasting model the results indicated that the four developed post processing strategies were effective lópez lópez et al 2014 madadgar et al compared the post processor based on copula function with the improved quantile mapping qm method and proved that the former post processing method was more effective in ameliorating the forecasting performance of hydrological prediction model madadgar et al 2014 other post processing methods such as error correction bogner and kalas 2008 kalman filtering kf shen et al 2015 and etc have also been applied in the field of water level prediction the main idea of the ensemble learning method is to heighten the forecasting accuracy of the hybrid model by constructing several base predictors and using the weighted method to integrate all or part of the base predictors to obtain the meta predictor ensemble learning methods include the boosting algorithm barzegar et al 2017 friedman 2001 stacking algorithm tyralis et al 2019 wolpert 1992 random forest rf breiman 2001 li et al 2016 and etc sun and trevor proposed adopting the simple average methods sam method to combine the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis algorithm artificial neural network ann and multiple linear regression mlr model and compared with the corresponding single model the results verified the superiority of the combined model sun and trevor 2018 besides the prediction modeling and weighted integration of the unused water level monitoring data is the mainstream idea of the integrated prediction algorithm in this field nourani et al 2011 through the analysis of literature review it can be seen that it is important to realize the water level short term forecasting for the river management and it is also feasible to use the ensemble learning modeling to obtain the water level forecasting results 2 methodology 2 1 framework of the proposed hybrid model in this study a novel hybrid water level forecasting model is developed based on the ssa method the gmdh neural networks the wiad ensemble algorithm and the kelm algorithm the purpose of the proposed model in the study is to build the relationships between the historical water level data and their corresponding future data to realize the water level forecasting which means the study presents a model that forecasts based on previous values in the proposed model the original water level series is reconstructed into a new series with better smoothness by the ssa method before forecasted by the gmdh base predictors the wiad algorithm integrates the selected base predictors and the kelm algorithm models the error of the result after the first prediction to test the forecasting performance of the ssa wiad gmdh kelm model some other models are selected as the comparison models which comprise of the single gmdh model ssa gmdh model ssa wiad gmdh model and ssa gmdh kelm model by comparing the performance of the proposed model on different occasions the optimal window length of the ssa method and the optimal integrated parameter are determined according to the error evaluation indices applied in the study besides the xiangjiang river and yuanjiang river of china is the study area where four groups of original water level data in four monitoring stations are selected to test the accuracy of the proposed model the modeling process of the proposed hybrid prediction model in the paper is shown in fig 1 there are four groups of original water level time series both including 800 sample points in the study they are divided into the following datasets dataset n1 for training ssa decomposition and gmdh based predictors including the 1st 600th sample points where dataset m1 is utilized to train all the gmdh based predictors and dataset m2 is utilized to verify the trained base predictors so as to calculate the accuracy and diversity indices of base predictors dataset n2 for verifying and testing the trained ssa wiad gmdh predictor including the 601st 800th sample points dataset n3 for constructing error sequence and training kelm error modeling method including the 601st 700th sample points dataset n4 is utilized to test the final hybrid prediction model which contains the 701st 800th sample points the specific partition result is shown in fig 2 in the study the data splitting strategy is proposed to match with the computational process of the proposed water level forecasting model the proposed model consists of the computational components of ssa gmdh wiad and kelm in the proposed ssa gmdh wiad framework the ssa is used to preprocess the original data the gmdh is adopted for the forecasting computation and the wiad is utilized to select the most suitable gmdh base predictors from the initial gmdh base predictors by considering both of the fitting accuracy and diversity capacity of each built base predictor for the computation of the ssa gmdh wiad framework the original water level data are divided into the training set n1 and the validation set n2 since even the best base predictor still will have predicting errors in the proposed water level forecasting model the kelm is further presented to realize the error series forecasting and error correction for the ssa gmdh wiad combination this is the reason why the validation set n2 is further divided into the second training set n3 and the test set n4 the kelm is a machine learning algorithm which needs the training data based on the data splitting strategy the proposed water level forecasting model promotes the usage value of the original water level data as well as the diversity of the base predictors so that the forecasting performance can be finally promoted the main contributions of the study are provided as follows 1 the gmdh neural networks for

model 3 the pre processing method ssa and the post processing method kelm are comprehensively adopted to construct the hybrid model which greatly improves the forecasting performance 4 the proposed hybrid model provides a new idea and method for the prediction and early warning of river water level height to a certain extent the prediction accuracy of river water level is enhanced the structure of this essay is organized as shown below section 2 shows the theoretical basis of ssa gmdh wiad and kelm methods and explains the study object demonstrates the experimental process and determines the optimal parameters of the ssa method and wiad algorithm section 3 presents the prediction results of water level analyzes the forecasting performance and compares the main hybrid models with the proposed model section 4 concludes the study 2 2 model construction step 1 standardize four groups of original water level series data and divide the processed data into training set and test set according to the data partitioning method in section 3 1 2 where the standardized processing is to convert four groups of the training set data into the interval of 0 1 namely normalization operation to avoid a large deviation in the evaluation of the prediction results due to the difference in the order of magnitude of the original data the forecasting time scale of the prediction model is set to 1 h that is each forecasting process is one step ahead step 2 obtain the components of four groups of training set series by ssa and construct n gmdh based predictors take the components of training sets as the input of the base predictors and the corresponding training process prediction values are output for each training process of the predictor the input is the water level data of the components from the mth sample point to the nth sample point of each group of water level series obtained by four stations and the output of the model is the water level data at the n 1 th sample point of each group of water level series which means the number of the input nodes of the proposed model is n m 1 step 3 through the verification results on the dataset m2 in the n1 training set calculate the accuracy index and diversity index of each gmdh base predictor according to the method in section 2 3 obtain the wiad value of each base predictor by weighted fusion and select the first m base predictors according to the descending order of wiad value step 4 use the m base predictors selected in step 3 to predict the test set and the predicted values of the output are averaged to get the predicted value of water level the specific process is to firstly add the prediction results of m base predictors and then divide by m to get the output water level prediction value step 5 calculate the error sequence of the test set by subtracting the predicted values of the water level obtained in step 4 from the actual value in which dataset n3 are used as the training set of the error correction model kelm and dataset n4 as the test set step 6 acquire the error predicted values of the error sequence by using the process of training model and testing model add the error predicted values to the predicted values of dataset n4 in step 4 and the final water level predicted values of the proposed model are obtained 2 3 theoretical basis of method components 2 3 1 singular spectrum analysis singular spectrum analysis ssa is a kind of processing method which is used to analyze and study nonlinear time series in recent years it constructs the trajectory matrix of the original series and decomposes and reconstructs the matrix to obtain the principal component information of the original series in the paper the ssa method is used to preprocess the original water level data series the specific process is as follows 1 step 1 embedding selecting the appropriate window length l 2 l n the original water level series x x x 1 x 2 xn is transformed into a multi dimensional series and the trajectory matrix m is obtained as shown below 1 m x 1 x 2 x 3 x l x 2 x 3 x 4 x t 1 x m x m 1 x m 2 x n m n l 1 where l is the window length and n is the length of the original water level series 2 step 2 singular value decomposition svd supposing that there is a matrix s satisfying eq 2 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix are solved and the calculation

follows the principle of polynomial approximation based on the self organizing idea of the multi layer neural network the k g polynomial of the nonlinear system is fitted by the continuous binary combination of neurons in each layer of the neural network the ultimate goal is to find the optimal function expression to converge to the real unknown mapping kim et al 2009 mo et al 2018 10 y α 0 i

integration based on accuracy and diversity the formation of the wiad method comes from the idea of selective ensemble method ensemble learning refers to the algorithm of building multiple base predictors to enhance the generalization ability of the whole model while the purpose of the selective ensemble method is to integrate fewer base predictors to achieve better prediction and generalization performance tumer et al pointed out that the diversity between base predictors and the accuracy of base predictors are two important factors that determine the generalization performance of integrated systems tumer and ghosh 1996 the selective ensemble method in the paper is based on these two factors 1 diversity measurement diversity measurement is also called inconsistency measurement for discrete time series prediction the diversity between different base predictors is mainly reflected in the differences in the parameters and structure of the model but these are unpredictable and measured the difference between the two is usually judged by comparing the correlation between the prediction results generated by different base predictors liu and yao 1998 the commonly used methods are person correlation coefficient diversity measurement spearman correlation coefficient diversity measurement etc considering the fusion of the accuracy measurement index the paper uses mutual information mi to measure the diversity between base predictors supposing that the predicted outputs of the two base predictors oi and oj are yi y i 1 y i 2 y i n and yj y j 1 y j 2 y j n respectively the process of measuring the diversity between the two base predictors is shown below barman and kwon 2017 18 di v i j m i y i y j y j y j y i y i p y i y j log p y i y j p y i p y j where p y i y j is the joint probability distribution function of yi and yj while p y i and p y j are the edge probability distribution functions of yi and yj respectively since the mutual information of the base predictor itself is 1 the average diversity measure of each base predictor is shown below 19 di v i j 1 m di v i j 1 m 1 where m represents the number of base predictors 2 accuracy measurement the accuracy measurement of the base predictor is relatively simple which can be measured directly by using the mean absolute percentage error mape index of the base predictor to the original series supposing that the prediction output of the base predictor oi is y y 1 y 2 y n and the actual value is y y 1 y 2 yn the accuracy measure of the base predictor is as follows liu et al 2017 20 ac c i m a p e i i 1 n y i y i y i n 100 3 weighted harmonic average measurement based on accuracy and diversity because the variation rules of the diversity index and accuracy index of the base predictors are as follows the smaller the diversity index is the greater the diversity between the base predictors will be özöğür akyüz et al 2015 the smaller the accuracy index is the greater the accuracy of the base predictors will be in addition the impact of diversity and accuracy on the performance of the whole model is not clear therefore the paper uses the weighted harmonic average method to integrate the diversity and accuracy of the base predictors the ensemble process is as follows 21 wia d i δ di v i 1 δ ac c i where δ represents the weight of the diversity index of base predictors the pseudo code of the wiad method is shown as follows algorithm weighted integration based on accuracy and diversity 1 set the number of base predictors n and the number of selected base predictors m 2 divide the original data into training samples and test samples and n ssa gmdh base predictors are used to train the training samples 3 calculate the prediction accuracy index of each base predictor acc and the prediction output of each base predictor 4 calculate the average diversity index div of each base predictor 5 calculate the wiad measurement index of each base predictor according to eq 21 6 integrate the base predictors with the first m of the wiad measurement index 7 use the selected partial basis predictor to test the test samples and the prediction results of the model are obtained 2 3 4 kernel extreme learning machine extreme learning machine elm is known due to the fast learning speed good generalization performance and strong ability to search for global optimal solution dong et al 2017 the extreme learning machine can randomly generate the connection weights of the input layer and the hidden layer and the bias of the hidden layer and there is no need to adjust in the learning process huang and chen 2007 given n samples as xk xk yk k 1 2 n where xk is the input data yk is the actual values f is transfer function and n is the number of nodes in the hidden layer the solution process of the elm is shown below dong et al 2017 22 o j i 1 n λ i f w i x k b i k 1 2 n where oj is the output value of the elm wi ω i 1 ω i 2 ω in is the connection weight between the input node and the i th hidden layer node bi is the bias of the i th node of the hidden layer λ i is the connection weight between the i th hidden layer node and the output node moreover the transfer function in eq 22 can be expressed in the form of hidden layer output matrix and the kernel extreme learning machine replaces it with the kernel matrix compared with the elm it is not necessary to preset the number of nodes in the hidden layer the initial weight and the offset of the kelm 3 case study 3 1 study area and original data 3 1 1 study area the xiangjiang river and

operated by the water conservancy department of hunan province china fig 4 shows the geographical location of the four water level monitoring stations 3 1 2 original water level data for modeling the water level data of four monitoring stations in a certain period of time in 2019 are selected in the study the four groups of data include 800 sample points with a sampling interval of 1 h among them the 1st 600th sample points are used to train the proposed model and the 601st 800th sample points are used to test the trained forecasting model the four sets of data are recorded as 1 2 3 and 4 respectively fig 5 shows the changes in the four sets of original water level data and their corresponding box diagrams it can be seen from the diagram that the four groups of water level sequences fluctuate irregularly in a certain amplitude range reflecting the characteristics of strong randomness and non stationarity combined with the box diagrams of four groups of water level data it can be concluded that the fluctuation range of 1 is the largest 3 ranks second 2 and 4 have the smallest fluctuation range and the data distribution is the most concentrated 2 and 3 present obvious right skewness distribution with outliers concentrated on the side of larger values while 4 tended to be more symmetrical therefore before training model it is necessary to standardize the original data in order to reduce the impact of abnormal values on the prediction performance of the proposed model through the above data acquisition and analysis it can be seen that among the four groups of original water level data the geographical location of the data collection stations is different the fluctuation trend of the data is various covering several water level height sections there is diversity in the distribution of extreme values and the information contained in four groups of data is very different in summary the water level data in this study is quite representative additionally the xiangjiang river and yuanjiang river are the two main rivers in hunan province china and other rivers are basically their tributaries their hydrological characteristics are highly representative and have both research value and engineering value 3 2 forecasting experiment according to the modeling method in section 3 2 the simulation experiment of the proposed ssa wiad gmdh kelm hybrid model is carried out and the experimental data are four groups of original water level data in section 3 1 2 in order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid model the gmdh model ssa gmdh model ssa wiad gmdh model and gmdh kelm model are selected as comparison models and for the purpose of ensuring the consistency of the comparison results only 701st 800th sample points are utilized as the final test set in the section mape mae rmse sde and r are chosen as the evaluation indices of the forecasting results to quantify the prediction performance of all prediction models all the simulation experiments are carried out on the matlab platform and in the course of the experiment the ssa function alonso 2005 of the wavelet toolbox and the gmdh function yarpiz 2015 and kernel elm function huang 2010 of the neural network toolbox are adopted 3 3 influence analysis of model parameters 3 3 1 window length of ssa impact analysis the window length is the most pivotal factor affecting the performance of the singular spectrum analysis method which is also closely related to the forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid prediction model in order to ensure that the performance of ssa in the study is optimal to a certain extent the influence mechanism of window length on the prediction performance of the proposed model is studied and the regression fitting analysis of the original water level data 1 is carried out the result is shown in fig 6 it can be seen from the figure that except that the window length is 400 namely 1 2 of the length of the original water level series the impact level of the other window lengths on the forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid model are basically of the same order of magnitude when the window length is equal to 720 the forecasting performance of the hybrid model is optimal and the regression r value equals to 0 99118 therefore in the follow up study of the paper the ssa window length for the original water level data 1 is uniformly set to 720 furthermore it is determined by the same experimental method above for the original water level data 2 3 and 4 the window length of the ssa method are both set to 720 3 3 2 integrated parameter impact analysis for the wiad ensemble learning method the weight of the accuracy index of the base predictors and the diversity measurement index and the extraction ratio of the base predictors are the two key factors that affect the ensemble effect and the forecasting performance of the hybrid model in order to explore the influence mechanism of two parameters and ensure the prediction efficiency of the proposed hybrid model simulation experiments on four groups of water level series are carried out to explore the influence mechanism for the water level data 1 the extraction ratio of the base predictors varies from 0 1 to 0 9 and the accuracy index weight of the base predictors varies from 0 to 1 the prediction accuracy of the proposed hybrid model with two different integrated parameters is calculated and the results are shown in fig 7 it can be seen from the figure that when the two integrated parameters change within the set range the forecasting performance of the hybrid model is obviously affected but the regularity is not strong when the accuracy index weight of the base predictors equals to 0 6 and the extraction ratio of the base predictor equals to 0 3 the prediction accuracy of the hybrid model is the highest and the mape value is 0 0297 in order to avoid the above results being limited by the contingency of the original data set the influence of the accuracy index weight of the base predictors is analyzed according to the water level data 2 3 and 4 respectively when the extraction ratio of the base predictor is set to 0 3 the result is shown in fig 8 it can be seen from the figure that the results are consistent with the water level data 1 so the extraction ratio of the base predictors of the ssa wiad gmdh kelm hybrid model proposed in the paper is set to 0 3 and the weight of the accuracy index is set to 0 6 and the weight of diversity index is set to 0 4 3 4 forecasting results and discussion 3 4 1 forecasting results the prediction results of the proposed model and all comparative models for the original water level data 1 4 are shown in figs 9 12 3 4 2 forecasting performance analysis table 1 shows the forecasting performance index values of all models for four sets of raw water level data table 2 demonstrates the forecasting performance improvement of the proposed hybrid model compared with the ssa gmdh kelm model and ssa wiad gmdh model combining figs 8 11 and table 1 the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid model is the best for the four groups of original water level data 1 4 the performance of the ssa gmdh kelm model is the second and the prediction accuracy of the ssa wiad gmdh model ssa gmdh model and gmdh model decreases in turn it shows that the ensemble strategy of the four algorithms proposed in the paper is effective and has good generalization ability for water level data with different types and distribution fig 12 2 analyzing the forecasting performance index values and prediction result curve of the ssa gmdh model and gmdh model it can be proved that the ssa method can effectively improve the prediction effect of the hybrid model it is due to its ability to efficiently extract the main trend component in the original water level series eliminate the noise component and reduce the difficulty and complexity of the training and testing process of base predictors 3 comparing the ssa wiad gmdh kelm hybrid model with the ssa wiad gmdh model it can be seen that the kelm can make a great leap in the forecasting performance of the hybrid model and all the prediction indices are greatly improved the results show that the kelm algorithm as an error modeling method can further reduce the prediction error of the decomposition integrated predictor and standardize its error range which is a very effective post processing method 4 the prediction effect of the ssa wiad gmdh kelm hybrid model is also better than that of the ssa gmdh kelm model the wiad ensemble method takes into account the accuracy and mutual diversity of the base predictors and belongs to the consideration of the comprehensive performance to a certain extent which has a certain theoretical guiding significance 5 as a base predictor gmdh has a good ability to predict time series its prediction performance indices and curve fitting ability have achieved good results 6 the proposed hybrid prediction model can fit the main change trend of the four groups of original water level series to a higher extent but it still lacks the ability of high precision fitting in some peaks and troughs of the curve in addition there is a relatively weak time delay phenomenon which is more obvious in the prediction results of the original water level series 2 but in a word the proposed hybrid prediction model still has high practical application value in order to verify the high prediction accuracy of the proposed hybrid model the section proposes the prediction performance indices improvement percentage to compare and analyze the improvement of the prediction accuracy of the proposed model compared with ssa gmdh kelm model and ssa wiad gmdh model the specific calculation process is as follows 23 p mape m a p e 2 m a p e 1 m a p e 2 p mae m a e 2 m a e 1 m a e 2 p rmse r m s e 2 r m s e 1 r m s e 2 p sde s d e 2 s d e 1 s d e 2 p r r 1 r 2 r 2 where mape1 mae 1 rmse 1 sde 1 and r 1 are forecasting performance indices of the proposed model while mape2 mae 2 rmse 2 sde 2 and r 2 are the indices of the comparison model the following conclusions can be obtained by interpreting table 2 and combining the information drawn above 1 by adjusting the relationship of base predictor combination arrangement by wiad algorithm using accuracy and difference index to classify and label all base predictors and filter them appropriately the integrated configuration of base predictors can be optimized and the ensemble efficiency can be improved the prediction performance of the hybrid model is improved which is strongly proved by the original water level series 1 and 2 although the optimization effect on datasets 3 and 4 is not obvious enough it is enough to see the predictive potential of the proposed model and still has good generalization ability 2 compared with the wiad algorithm the kelm is in a leading position in improving the performance of the hybrid model and its mape improvement effect on the original water level series 1 and 3 is even 20 and 15 71 this shows that after the prediction results of the original data set error modeling is very necessary which can further reduce the prediction error of the model and then improve the prediction performance 4 conclusions in this study a novel hybrid water level prediction model is proposed by using the ssa method gmdh neural network wiad ensemble method and kelm machine learning algorithm in the proposed model the ssa method can extract the main component of the original water level series and the gmdh network can realize the forecasting of the water level series as the base predictor the wiad ensemble method realizes the integration of the base predictors by considering the accuracy and diversity indices the kelm algorithm plays the role of error modeling in the hybrid computation to investigate the real performance of the proposed model the study selects single gmdh model ssa gmdh model ssa wiad gmdh model and ssa gmdh kelm model as the comparison models the experiments are carried out on four groups of original water level series collected from four monitoring stations in xiangjiang and yuanjiang river basins the results demonstrate that a the proposed model has high prediction accuracy which shows that the combination of the four algorithms is effective b wiad and kelm algorithms play a positive role in improving the forecasting performance of the proposed model c the proposed model takes advantage of useful features from several algorithms including the fitting capacity from the built gmdh models the integration of the accuracy and diversity from the wiad and the error correction from the kelm d the

treatment plant dwtp located in the u s was studied by bukhary et al 2017a whereas bukhary et al 2017b performed a similar analysis for the treatment of drinking water in jamshoro pakistan based on the literature review it can be seen that few studies have analyzed the solar energy water nexus of the dwtps however pv applications have certain physical and economic constraints a large land area is required for the deployment of solar pv so successful deployment depends on ample land availability to avoid significant costs related to land preparation and to minimize land use impacts of solar deployment a flat site or gently sloping site with sparse vegetation is desirable solar 2012 in addition permits for solar installation are only issued for land areas which are not protected habitat and which do not fall under the category of culturally historically or archeologically significant areas solar 2012 the economics of pv systems can be affected by high capital costs tax benefits and

the operational energy consumption and energy intensity of the processes utilized for water treatment including ozonation coagulation flocculation filtration on site sodium hypochlorite generation and residual management and then validating it using data collected from the dwtps managers 2 performing a modeling study by using solar pv to offset the computed energy consumption of the dwtp comparing the existing available land area of the treatment plant against computed land area for pv system as well as performing a cost analysis for pv system installation determining the associated net reduction in carbon emissions the equations and design criteria used in this study may serve as a guide for determining the energy consumption of treatment plants a unit process based determination of energy consumption can be used to compare the performance of similar sized treatment plants this work may help treatment plant managers to make decisions concerning energy conservation performance goals of a plant and sustainable treatment of drinking water 2 study plant the dwtp used in this study is located in one of the fastest growing urban landscapes of the southwestern united states with a population of over 2 million the city s primary source of water supply is the colorado river water is conveyed to the selected dwtp and has the design capacity to treat 1 mm3 of water per day the location of the plant is confidential as required by the plant management when they shared the data needed to validate the plant design for analysis of the solar pv system it was assumed that the plant was located in nevada direct solar insolation level of 7 1 kwh m 2 day 1 was assumed 3 data sources the data used in the current study was acquired from the selected dwtp s managers which consist of a raw water quality report table s1 and process flow diagram fig 1 as well as operational details of various treatment processes involved the existing landholdings of the dwtp were accessed using arcgis for the estimation of the net reduction in carbon emissions data sources and parameters for carbon emissions in units of gco2eq kwh 1 moomaw et al 2011 and the state s energy source mix for electricity generation useia 2016 are shown in table s2 for modeling work the parameters for various components of the selected pv system consisting of modules inverters and battery storage were chosen from the database provided by the system advisor model sam whereas the parameters for cost analysis were obtained from recently published studies table s3 these parameters were determined by reviewing the publications of fu et al 2016 kang and rohatgi 2016 krupa and harvey 2017 lai and mcculloch 2017 mundada et al 2016 musi et al 2017 and reiter et al 2016 4 methodology in this study energy consumption for the various energy driving units of the dwtp was determined first section 4 1 which was then used as load input for sam section 4 2 which is the model used for the design calculation of land requirements and cost analysis of the pv system to offset the energy requirements of the dwtp finally corresponding net reduction in carbon emissions due to pv deployment was estimated a detailed description of the methodology follows 4 1 process energy driving units the selected dwtp employed direct filtration treatment train to treat 1 mm3 day 1 of water screens were not required since the water intake is about 30 5 m deep the process flow diagram of the dwtp utilized is shown in fig 1 raw water entered the dwtp and was pre ozonated then the water was flash mixed with a ferric chloride coagulant by using jet diffuser pumps next the water was flocculated filtered and chlorinated finally the finished water was stored for distribution the energy driving units for the various unit processes involved are described below 4 1 1 pre ozonators the pre ozonators consist of 1 a feed gas preparation unit 2 an ozone generator 3 a contact basin 4 an ozone mixing system and 5 off gas destruct unit design and energy consumption of the pre ozonators was determined using the guidelines provided by rakness 2005 and stover et al 1986 for ozonation feed gas can be either air or pure oxygen oxygen enriched air can also be used air produces 1 5 2 5 ozone by weight whereas oxygen produces 3 5 ozone by weight to prevent reduction in the efficiency of the ozone generator feed gas is cleaned by removing dust moisture and oil which is accomplished using a refrigerant dryer compressor and desiccant dryer for large scale oxygen fed systems oxygen may be generated on site by using the vacuum pressure swing adsorption of oxygen from the air for large scale ozone generation a corona discharge cell is used which is ozone generation by the application of a high voltage current across two electrodes separated by a 0 3 3 0 mm discharge gap through which feed gas flows next ozone is dispersed into the water using contact basins the ozone feed rate varies between 1 and 5 mg l and the contact time depends on ct concentration of ozone c times the contact time t with the water values while the residual concentration varies between 0 3 and 0 9 mg l the exhaust gas from the contact basin is destroyed in an off gas destruct unit 4 1 2 feed system for coagulation after pre ozonation the raw water undergoes coagulation to remove particulates adding coagulant promotes destabilization of particulates resulting in floc formation and easier precipitation and removal from water the effectiveness of the operation depends on flash mixing the coagulant with raw water which was achieved at the dwtp through jet diffuser pumps placed in two conduits located midway between the ozone contact basins and flocculation basins the coagulant utilized was ferric chloride the equation used to determine the energy consumption for the jet pump is shown in table 1 ferric chloride and sodium hypochlorite were applied via a pipe routed through the center of a nozzle that discharged just in front of the deflector plate mixing was achieved because of the high hydraulic shearing action created by the interaction between the water jet from the nozzle impacting the deflector plate and the main water flow in the conduit 4 1 3 vertical turbine flocculators the flocculation process followed coagulation while the coagulation process involves flash mixing to disperse the coagulant within the feed water the flocculation process involves slow mixing to enhance the contact between the coagulant and the feed water and for the subsequent formation of flocs at the selected plant vertical turbine flocculators were designed using the criteria provided by crittenden et al 2005 table 1 the range of the values for velocity gradient was between 10 and 80 s 1 maximum tip speed was between 2 and 3 m s 1 and rotational speed was between 10 and 30 rev min 1 4 1 4 filtration backwash system next the flocculated water was filtered using dual media filters consisting of anthracite and sand to provide a finished water quality of 0 3 ntu designed using the criteria provided by reynolds et al 1996 a filtration rate of 13 5 m hr 1 was used the energy consuming units for the filtration process were the three surface wash pumps three centrifugal air blowers and three backwash pumps the equations used to determine energy consumption are shown in table 1 surface wash pumps were designed as jet pumps suspended above the filter media surface to break the crust formed on the surface of the filter media due to heavy clogging air blowers were used for air scour cleaning of the filter media then the filter media was backwashed using backwash pumps 4 1 5 on site sodium hypochlorite generator for the dwtp sodium hypochlorite was used as a secondary disinfectant to maintain residual disinfectant in the distribution system because during primary disinfection ozone is destroyed without leaving residual due to safety concerns related to the use of chlorine gas sodium hypochlorite was generated on site using an electrolysis process on site chlorine generation involves mixing sodium chloride with softened water in a saturator tank to form a brine solution which is then pumped to electrolytic cells electricity is applied and sodium hypochlorite solution is generated and stored electricity consumption was determined using the guidelines provided by white 2010 liquid sodium hypochlorite was applied to the treated water using feed pumps nine feed pumps were provided where two were used as backup 4 1 6 additional pump operations pumping is required to add zinc orthophosphate zo to prevent the corrosion of pipes and fluorosilicic acid fa which is a source of fluoride and important for teeth protection lastly pumping was required to distribute the finished water to the city the wastewater generated due to the filter backwash operation was treated using clarifiers and then thickeners where suspended solids settle under gravity both processes were designed using the criteria provided by crittenden et al 2005 the water recovered from the application of the clarifier and thickener was recycled through the dwtp the energy driving units for the operation were the motors of the pumps used for the transfer of water and generated sludge 4 2 pv system a pv system can potentially be used to meet the energy demands of the dwtp design and cost analysis of a potential pv system were achieved using the sam a modeling platform utilized to make performance and cost predictions for renewables including pv freeman et al 2013 gilman and dobos 2012 various studies have used the sam to analyze solar technologies kalogirou 2013 thevenard and pelland 2013 said et al 2015 malagueta et al 2014 malvoni et al 2017 cassard et al 2011 the sam is used to analyze the performance and economics of renewables over their design lives pv design warrants several inputs including electric load and weather information the computation of energy consumption as discussed in section 4 1 was used as an input for the electric load the rate charges applied were for large scale service for high voltage transmission 25000 v for weather data the sam contains a library of typical meteorological year tmy data which is site specific weather information tmy2 dataset spans 1961 1990 and tmy3 dataset spans 1976 2005 weather information can be selected for the site the tmy3 dataset was chosen selections for pv modules inverters battery storage and their characteristics were made from the database available in sam input required for the design of the pv system was either using the input of the desirable size of array and dc to ac ratio or the desirable number of modules and inverters battery storage was used to meet the energy requirements of the dwtp during the absence of daylight since the plant is operational for 24 hours battery bank storage can be designed either by utilizing the inputs of the number of battery cells in the series and the number of battery strings in parallel or by utilizing the desirable bank capacity and voltage to conduct cost analysis additional inputs include rates of the electric utility initial investment costs related to the pv system and other cost factors over the lifetime of the system financial inputs for the sam are shown in table s3 many us states have mandated to source some percentage of their electricity sales using renewables by implementing renewable portfolio standards rps thus adopting renewables for distributed generation may qualify some projects for financial incentives as in the case of this study table s3 based on nevada rps adopting pv for electricity generation qualified the current dwtp to claim property tax exemption as well as federal investment tax credit itc of 30 becoming part of the input parameters of the economic analysis economic analysis of using solar pv was conducted using the financial metrics of net present value npv and the levelized cost of electricity lcoe the npv is the present value of the difference between cash inflows and outflows and is estimated in dollars the lcoe is representative of the life cycle costs of the pv system based on its present value utilizing the units of cents kwh 1 the npv and lcoe can be estimated using the following equations n p v t 1 t i t 1 d t i o lcoe t 0 t c t 1 d t t 1 t e t 1 d t where t time period t analysis period d discount rate io capital costs it net inflow of cash during time t ct costs incurred during time t and et is the energy generated in kwh during time t the npv incorporates the time value of money based on the concept that the present value of money earned today is greater than the same amount of money earned in the future a project is deemed profitable if the npv is positive and unprofitable if the npv is negative the npv is the principal financial parameter used for this study this is because other popular metrics such as payback period are undesirable because of their complexity in calculations when incorporating various federal and state taxes and incentives even though the npv is not scaled it gives value to the scale of investment unlike the lcoe and payback period the lcoe value may or may not be adjusted for inflation the inflation adjusted value is called the real lcoe whereas the nominal lcoe is not adjusted for inflation further the value of internal rate of return irr was also computed and discussed during sensitivity analysis of financial parameters irr is the discount rate at which npv zero short et al 1995 for pv system using sam hundreds of design possibilities exist based on selected technical and economic parameters tables s3 and s4 the optimal pv array and battery system was designed using an iterative process to ensure a profitable project using npv and possibilities of maximum pv energy generation 4 3 land area requirements in order to estimate the existing empty land acreage of the dwtp the software arcgis was used sam estimated the land demands of a pv system by using the following equation landrequirements a m n m gcr where am area of a pv module nm total number of modules being used by the pv system and gcr ground coverage ratio the gcr determines the east west distance between the pv arrays the gcr value incorporates the additional area requirements for performance of maintenance activities and avoidance of self shading for calculation purposes in the sam the gcr value varies between 0 01 and 0 99 implying a large east west distance between the arrays to a negligible east west distance for the current analysis a gcr value of 0 3 is utilized 4 4 carbon emissions operation of the dwtp utilizing pv as an energy source will result in decreased carbon emissions a pv system does not generate emissions during its operational life however during the manufacturing transportation and dismantling of a pv system some emissions are generated the estimation of carbon emissions were made by taking the product of the electricity source mix data of the state of nevada and the related carbon emission data for the sources of petroleum coal natural gas solar pv wind energy hydroelectricity geothermal energy nuclear energy and bio power table s2 data for the electricity source mix helps in estimation of emissions related to the traditional grid electricity generation carbon emissions were reduced when pv design was incorporated to decrease the dependence of the dwtp on the traditional electricity grid the corresponding reduction was estimated by subtracting the emissions generated by the plant when using the pv system from the emissions generated by the dwtp when using the traditional electricity grid 4 5 scenarios analyzed for the development of the pv system a techno economic analysis was conducted for drinking water treatment only excluding the distribution pumps four scenarios were analyzed for scenario 1 sc 1 the development of the pv was considered to meet the energy demands of the drinking water treatment further scenarios were analyzed to meet the energy demands of the dwtp by excluding the process of ozonation scenario 2 sc 2 a sodium hypochlorite system scenario 3 sc 3 and an ozonation and sodium hypochlorite system scenario 4 sc 4 since some plants might not use ozonation or might not have an on site sodium hypochlorite generation system as is generally the case i e on site generation of hypochlorite is only viable for large plants smaller plants purchase liquid hypochlorite and are thus represented by scenario sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 each of these scenarios was analyzed for with storage and without storage conditions further the effects of location change of the dwtp from the southwest us to the us east coast was also evaluated for the pv system two scenarios were examined by changing the location of the treatment plant from nevada insolation level 7 1 kwh m 2 day 1 to i new york insolation level 3 5 kwh m 2 day 1 and ii massachusetts insolation level 3 7 kwh m 2 day 1 for new york location financial parameters that were changed are shown in table s3 the incentives incorporated were 30 itc and 100 state sales tax exemption based on new york rps dsire 2017 the system did not qualify for other incentives the utilized electric rate input downloaded from the sam database for electric rates was based upon the rates of the new york power authority for large general service assumptions for the remaining data were not changed for massachusetts location financial parameters that were changed are shown in table s3 the incentives incorporated were 30 itc and 100 property tax exemption for a 20 year period based on massachusetts rps dsire 2017 a property tax rate of 2 was used the electric rate input utilized was based upon the rates of the national grid of massachusetts for large general service for commercial or industrial facilities with demands 2000 kw national grid 2018 assumptions for the remaining data were not changed 5 results and discussion this section describes the results of analyzing the energy consumption of various unit processes of the dwtp and then the performance and cost analysis of the pv system 5 1 process energy driving units for the selected dwtp raw water entered the plant and was ozonated ozonation was used as a primary disinfectant and applied as a pre treatment process high purity oxygen was used as feed gas generated using a vacuum pressure swing adsorption system ozone was generated at a 3 6 concentration by weight whereas the ozone dose used was 1 55 mg l 1 the ozone production was about 1 800 kg day 1 a 1 4 log inactivation of cryptosporidium 9 log inactivation of giardia and 18 8 log inactivation of virus were achieved utilizing pre ozonation energy consumption for the system is shown in table 2 next the coagulant ferric chloride was added in the water and flash mixed using jet pumps the flash mix system consisted of two stages installed in series within each of the two 213 4 cm conduits ferric chloride was applied in the first stage while in the second stage sodium hypochlorite was applied then eight flow trains were used to provide flocculation to 1 mm3 day 1 of flow using vertical turbine flocculators flocculation was achieved in 3 stages for decreasing velocity gradients of 70 40 and 25 s 1 and for a reynolds number 10 000 following ozonation coagulation and flocculation the water was filtered using twenty dual media filters having an area of 184 5 m2 the filter media was comprised of 1 83 m of anthracite followed by 0 2 m of sand placed above the underdrains each filter consisted of two cells each having an area of 92 2 m2 the filtration rate used was 13 5 m hr 1 the media size for anthracite was 1 2 mm and for sand it was 0 61 mm the clean bed head loss was found to be 0 57 m two of the filters were provided for redundancy purposes the operational duration for the surface wash pumps was 3 min followed by air scour for 8 min the duration for backwashing was 15 min and the frequency of backwash was daily hence a value of 24 h was used the energy consumption determined for the backwash filtration system is shown in table 2 filtration recovery was found to be 97 since ozone leaves no residual chlorination is performed to protect the finished water against the microbial contamination in the distribution system nine on site sodium hypochlorite generators were used two of which were provided as a backup the generators have an installed capacity of about 8165 kg day 1 equivalent chlorine liquid sodium hypochlorite was added to the finished water using five 10 hp and three 20 hp feed pumps two of which were used as a back up table 2 finished water was distributed using eight 1 75 m3 s 1 water distribution pumps each with a motor size of 3500 hp two additional pumps were provided as a backup the backwash filtration system generates wastewater which is treated using clarifiers and thickeners at first the wastewater was conveyed to two equalization basins with an additional basin provided as a backup next the water was pumped to two clarifiers for solid settling under the effect of gravity the generated effluent was recycled through the dwtp whereas the generated sludge was pumped to two thickeners the energy consumers of the thickeners were the water transfer pumps and the sludge transfer pump motors the total operational energy consumption for the dwtp was about 577 mwh day 1 508 wh m 3 while the energy consumption required for water treatment excluding the water distribution pumps was about 65 5 mwh day 1 57 7 wh m 3 the results showed that the largest consumer of energy for the plant was the pumping operation the energy consumption for the water distribution pumps was about 512 mwh day 1 450 4 wh m 3 while the pumping operations for the treatment of drinking water amounted to 5 71 mwh day 1 5 1 wh m 3 thus utilizing about 89 6 of the total operational energy consumption the water treatment processes themselves consumed about 10 4 of the total operational energy among the processes utilized for the treatment of water the on site sodium hypochlorite generator was the largest consumer of energy consuming about 57 32 9 wh m 3 of the energy utilized for treatment processes table 2 fig 2 the second largest consumer was ozonation 19 5 wh m 3 the third largest consumer of electricity was the coagulation process that employed jet pumps for flash mixing with an energy intensity of about 2 6 wh m 3 the processes of flocculation 1 2 wh m 3 and filtration 1 32 wh m 3 each consumed about 2 of the overall energy the smallest consumers of energy were the processes involved in residual management and the addition of zo and fa each consuming about 0 1 of the overall energy for sc 1 sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 the energy consumption was determined as 65 5 43 3 28 and 5 8 mwh day 1 respectively a sensitivity analysis was performed for the energy consumption estimates related to the pumping operations for the treatment plant one potential improvement a plant can made is switch to more efficient pumps and motors for the sensitivity analysis the wire to electric efficiencies of the pumps were increased by 5 and 10 which resulted in a 0 42 65 2 mwh day 1 and 0 8 65 mwh day 1 decrease in the total operational energy consumption 65 5 mwh day 1 of the water treatment units respectively however decreasing wire to water efficiencies by 5 65 8 mwh day 1 and 10 66 1 mwh day 1 resulted in increased operational energy consumption by 0 46 and 0 97 respectively both increase and decrease were small because the major energy driving units for the water treatment units were the processes of ozonation and the sodium hypochlorite generation system which were unaffected by the changes in wire to water efficiency various studies have reported the energy consumption estimates of unit processes of water treatment the energy intensity values estimated using the current study and validated against plant s data were found to be less than the reported values of plappally and lienhard 2012 table 2 lee et al 2017 reported energy intensity values for desalination as well as water and wastewater treatment and transport for urban areas as 0 3700 wh m 3 for source water extraction and transport 30 4230 wh m 3 for treatment this study 508 wh m 3 30 580 wh m 3 for distribution 160 wh m 3 for wastewater collection and 180 10 000 wh m 3 for wastewater treatment in california about 3 of the total electricity consumption is utilized for drinking water supply and treatment while 1 is used for wastewater treatment according to a study by the california energy commission cec cec 2006 the report estimated the energy intensity for raw water conveyance drinking water treatment water distribution and wastewater treatment as 0 3650 wh m 3 26 wh m 3 this study 57 7 wh m 3 for water treatment processes only 320 wh m 3 and 290 650 wh m 3 respectively the results of this study were found to be in good agreement with the values reported in the literature table 2 5 2 pv system to incorporate sustainability into the design and operation of the dwtp solar pv was utilized the design and economic analysis of the pv system was achieved using the sam the energy consumption determined for unit processes was utilized as the electric load input for sizing solar pv for the simulation work the tracking type selected was 2 axis pv the parameters for the selected solar module inverter and battery type are shown in table s4 freecleansolar 2017 invertersupply 2017 wholesalesolar 2017 since the pv could only meet the daytime energy demands battery storage was used to meet the energy demands for 24 hour operation of the plant for sc 1 sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 the analysis utilizing the sam resulted in 12 mw 8 mw 5 mw and 1 1 mw pv systems respectively with large battery storage capacities table 3 fig 3 about 47 of the energy requirements were fulfilled using the pv system while the remaining 53 of the load was supported using battery storage if battery storage was not provided for these scenarios then the same pv systems could offset about 5 3 npv 6 7 m net capital cost 37 m 3 5 npv 4 4 m net capital cost 24 7 m 2 3 npv 2 8 m net capital cost 15 4 m and 0 5 npv 0 36 net capital cost 3 1 m of the total operational energy consumption for sc 1 sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 respectively the aforementioned estimations for scenarios without incorporating battery storage represent the effect of battery storage on the overall cost and performance of the pv system the pv systems were grid connected the npv was positive for all the analysed scenarios the results generated in this study may serve as a gauge for the design and analysis of treatment plants using similar processes sensitivity analysis for the pv system for sc 1 is shown in table 4 by using different types of tracking mechanisms a sensitivity analysis was conducted by quantifying the influence of loan interest rates 0 5 itc 0 50 electricity rates 25 50 and discount rate 0 10 on the economics of the pv system as shown by fig 4 changing the loan interest rate between 0 and 5 resulted in the npv varying between positive to negative values for sc 1 and sc 4 changes in investment tax credit in the range of 0 50 greatly affected the economics of the project pv system development reduces the energy costs incurred due to the use of a utility grid however if the electric rates are too low pv development may no longer be profitable fig 4 lcoe for pv with battery storage was affected more by changes in loan interest rates and itc than for pv without storage the npv for pv with battery storage supporting large loads was affected more by changes in loan interest rates itc and electric rates than pv supporting smaller loads with or without storage the lcoe values for a pv with or without battery storage was not affected by changes in electric rates since electric rates are not part of the pv system lifecycle costs changes in discount rate showed irr 7 4 and 7 6 for sc 1 and sc 4 with storage respectively corresponding to npv zero fig s1 shows the influence of the parameters of electric rate discount rate loan interest rate and investment tax credit on the npv and irr 5 3 land area requirements land is also a resource which is finite and shrinking land area development is inextricably linked with energy as well as water supply similarly the water and energy infrastructure development require land area cheng and hammond 2017 fthenakis and kim 2009 the fenced area of the dwtp about 1 6 km2 determined using arcgis may be utilized for the development of solar pv the land area is primarily flat with low shrubs thus a pv system can be deployed with minimum land preparation and disturbance as shown by table 3 land requirements for the installation of a pv system for all four scenarios analyzed were determined to be much less than 1 6 km2 due to climate change effects on land systems over exploitation of land for agricultural purposes and land degradation due to pollution using land area in a sustainable manner becomes vital this encompasses ensuring minimal environmental impact while also maintaining the multi functionality of land areas installing pv systems may be an effective technique to ensure sustainable use of land fthenakis and kim 2009 estimated the life cycle of land transformation for various sources of electricity generation including coal coal natural gas nuclear pv wind biomass and hydroelectric and determined that pv installations cause the least land transformation among them additionally bukhary et al 2018a determined pv systems to be favorable for land limited and water limited areas among different types of solar technologies water energy land nexus has been analyzed by various studies bryan et al 2016 analyzed the water energy land nexus for australia and evaluated policy implications for the year 2050 bukhary et al 2018a analyzed the solar energy water land carbon nexus for utility scale solar installations in the southwestern u s based on the regional rps chen et al 2018 made quantitative assessments of land area utilized for cultivation 39 and associated water withdrawal 29 within the context of the global supply chain howells et al 2013 evaluated the effects of climate change on the water energy land nexus by developing a model for integrated resource management and policy analysis 5 4 carbon emissions the development of pv with battery storage can lead to reduced carbon emissions for sc 1 sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 the net reduction in carbon emissions was estimated as 11000 7300 4700 and 980 metric tons co₂eq year 1 respectively while without battery storage the reduction in emissions was estimated as 5200 3400 2200 460 metric tons co₂eq year 1 respectively for the eight water distribution pumps carbon emissions were estimated at 86 000 metric tons co₂eq year 1 as shown by the results the adverse impacts of the water energy nexus can be reduced by using solar for energy generation the u s environmental protection agency usepa usepa 2013 estimated that carbon emissions in the amounts of 40 8 million metric tons are related to water and wastewater treatment operations 5 5 geographical location another scenario was examined by changing the location of the treatment plant from southwestern state of nevada to the us east coast at i new york and ii massachusetts when analyzing for new york it was determined that a 16 1 mw pv system using a large battery storage supporting 60 of load was able to offset 100 of the electric load for sc 1 however the npv was negative table 3 the 12 mw pv system sc 1 at nevada location when sited in new york was able to offset 81 of the total electric load while without battery storage it was only able to offset 38 of the total load analyzed when analyzing for the sensitivity of financial parameters between nevada and new york locations property tax rates were shown to have the largest effect for the new york location the property tax rate of 2 resulted in negative npv however when changed from 2 to 1 2 for sc 1 would result in a positive npv of 2 4 million and an lcoe value of 3 8 cents kwh 1 the property tax rate may vary depending upon location of the property property tax exemption or partial property rate incentives have the potential of greatly promoting the development of solar facilities in the state for the massachusetts location it was determined that a 17 mw pv system using a large storage capacity was able to offset 100 of the electric load for sc 1 the npv was positive table 3 the 12 mw pv system sc 1 at the nevada location when sited in massachusetts was able to offset 84 of the total load analyzed between the new york and massachusetts locations comparison of the results determined property tax incentive to be most influential as massachusetts provides a state incentive of 100 property tax exemption while new york does not dsire 2017 also changing the dwtp location from the southwestern us higher solar insolation levels to the us east coast lower solar insolation levels required larger pv system sizes and battery storage capacities to offset the same electric loads however the system was able to offset about 81 84 of the total load analyzed without changing the pv system size this is because the pv system was designed for the worst case scenario of the winter months for the nevada location this study has successfully applied the water energy carbon nexus approach for sustainable large scale drinking water treatment which is an energy intensive process application of a water energy carbon nexus approach particularly through the adoption of renewables like solar to offset energy requirements may help achieve sustainability and reduce carbon emissions of water treatment systems the resource potential of solar energy is huge fthenakis et al 2009 conducted a techno economical and geographically based analysis of the potential of using pv and concentrated solar power in the u s and determined that by the year 2050 solar energy can potentially meet 35 of the total u s energy demand electricity and fuel and 69 of the total u s electricity demand fthenakis et al 2009 further concluded that by the year 2100 solar energy could potentially supply 90 of the total u s energy needs and along with other renewable energy sources 100 of the total energy needs of the u s hence contributing to a 92 decline in carbon emission levels when compared to the carbon levels in 2005 initial investments are typically high for solar projects but can be offset by low operation and maintenance costs during the operational life of the solar facility hernández moro and martínez duart 2013 in recent years the efficiency of pv panels has increased significantly with a marked decrease in price a trend projected to continue over the coming years currently governmental support and subsidies are still required for solar pv projects to be cost effective hagerman et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2016 as also shown by this study reduction in current battery storage prices can significantly alter the way energy is generated today as pv coupled with battery storage can lead to a reliable supply of electricity throughout the 24 h of the day 6 conclusions the aim of this study was the application of a water energy carbon nexus approach for a dwtp by a determining the energy consumption of the processes utilized for water treatment b using

operations for the treatment of drinking water amounted to 5 71 mwh day 1 5 1 wh m 3 utilizing nearly 89 6 of the total operational energy consumption for sc 1 sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 energy consumption was determined as 65 5 43 3 28 and 5 8 mwh day 1 respectively an on site sodium hypochlorite generation system was the largest consumer of energy 32 9 wh m 3 whereas pre ozonation was the second largest 19 5 wh m 3 among the processes utilized for treatment of water for scenario sc 1 sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 the capacity of the pv system was determined as 12 8 5 and 1 1 mw with large battery storage capacities for nevada site offsetting about 11 7 5 5 and 1 of the operational energy consumption of the plant 577 mwh day 1 respectively however without battery storage the same grid connected pv system could offset about 5 3 3 5 2 3 and 0 5 of the operational energy consumption respectively the npv was found to be positive for sc 1 sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 the net reduction in carbon emissions was estimated as 11000 7300 4700 and 980 metric tons co₂eq year 1 respectively while without battery storage net reduction in carbon emissions was estimated 5200 3400 2200 460 metric tons co₂eq year 1 respectively it was also determined that changing the plant s location from the southwestern us higher solar insolation levels to the us east coast lower solar insolation level would require a larger pv system size and battery storage capacity the results were found to be most sensitive to property tax rates among parameters changed between the two locations sales tax state income tax property tax electric rates a property tax exemption or partial property tax rate incentives have promising implications for solar development in the areas this study successfully applied the water energy carbon nexus approach for sustainable large sale drinking water treatment by evaluating the operational energy consumption of the unit processes of a dwtp located in an urban area and then using solar pv to offset that energy consumption leading to net reduction in carbon emissions a rigorous analysis of energy consumption of the various unit processes involved in drinking water treatment helped identify key design parameters that maybe modified to reduce the energy requirements of treatment plants further the design parameters of actual plants are not widely shared in the public domain and this data provides valuable insight to students professionals as well as researchers in this study determination of energy consumption was limited to drinking water treatment for future work energy consumption related to distribution of water within the community could also be analyzed data generated in this study can serve as a gauge when considering solar energy use in water treatment facilities as a means to save energy and increase sustainability this method can be used for other plants at other locations this work presents valuable insights to researchers in the field and policy makers credit

treatment plant dwtp located in the u s was studied by bukhary et al 2017a whereas bukhary et al 2017b performed a similar analysis for the treatment of drinking water in jamshoro pakistan based on the literature review it can be seen that few studies have analyzed the solar energy water nexus of the dwtps however pv applications have certain physical and economic constraints a large land area is required for the deployment of solar pv so successful deployment depends on ample land availability to avoid significant costs related to land preparation and to minimize land use impacts of solar deployment a flat site or gently sloping site with sparse vegetation is desirable solar 2012 in addition permits for solar installation are only issued for land areas which are not protected habitat and which do not fall under the category of culturally historically or archeologically significant areas solar 2012 the economics of pv systems can be affected by high capital costs tax benefits and supporting governmental policies bukhary et al 2020 the objective of this study was to quantitatively analyze the water energy carbon nexus of large scale water treatment in two parts by 1 determining the operational energy consumption and energy intensity of the processes utilized for water treatment including ozonation coagulation flocculation filtration on site sodium hypochlorite generation and residual management and then validating it using data collected from the dwtps managers 2 performing a modeling study by using solar pv to offset the computed energy consumption of the dwtp comparing the existing available land area of the treatment plant against computed land area for pv system as well as performing a cost analysis for pv system installation determining the associated net reduction in carbon emissions the equations and design criteria used in this study may serve as a guide for determining the energy consumption of treatment plants a unit process based determination of energy consumption can be used to compare the performance of similar sized treatment plants this work may help treatment plant managers to make decisions concerning energy conservation performance goals of a plant and sustainable treatment of drinking water 2 study plant the dwtp used in this study is located in one of the fastest growing urban landscapes of the southwestern united states with a population of over 2 million the city s primary source of water supply is the colorado river water is conveyed to the selected dwtp and has the design capacity to treat 1 mm3 of water per day the location of the plant is confidential as required by the plant management when they shared the data needed to validate the plant design for analysis of the solar pv system it was assumed that the plant was located in nevada direct solar insolation level of 7 1 kwh m 2 day 1 was assumed 3 data sources the data used in the current study was acquired from the selected dwtp s managers which consist of a raw water quality report table s1 and process flow diagram fig 1 as well as operational details of various treatment processes involved the existing landholdings of the dwtp were accessed using arcgis for the estimation of the net reduction in carbon emissions data sources and parameters for carbon emissions in units of gco2eq kwh 1 moomaw et al 2011 and the state s energy source mix for electricity generation useia 2016 are shown in table s2 for modeling work the parameters for various components of the selected pv system consisting of modules inverters and battery storage were chosen from the database provided by the system advisor model sam whereas the parameters for cost analysis were obtained from recently published studies table s3 these parameters were determined by reviewing the publications of fu et al 2016 kang and rohatgi 2016 krupa and harvey 2017 lai and mcculloch 2017 mundada et al 2016 musi et al 2017 and reiter et al 2016 4 methodology in this study energy consumption for the various energy driving units of the dwtp was determined first section 4 1 which was then used as load input for sam section 4 2 which is the model used for the design calculation of land requirements and cost analysis of the pv system to offset the energy requirements of the dwtp finally corresponding net reduction in carbon emissions due to pv deployment was estimated a detailed description of the methodology follows 4 1 process energy driving units the selected dwtp employed direct filtration treatment train to treat 1 mm3 day 1 of water screens were not required since the water intake is about 30 5 m deep the process flow diagram of the dwtp utilized is shown in fig 1 raw water entered the dwtp and was pre ozonated then the water was flash mixed with a ferric chloride coagulant by using jet diffuser pumps next the water was flocculated filtered and chlorinated finally the finished water was stored for distribution the energy driving units for the various unit processes involved are described below 4 1 1 pre ozonators the pre ozonators consist of 1 a feed gas preparation unit 2 an ozone generator 3 a contact basin 4 an ozone mixing system and 5 off gas destruct unit design and energy consumption of the pre ozonators was determined using the guidelines provided by rakness 2005 and stover et al 1986 for ozonation feed gas can be either air or pure oxygen oxygen enriched air can also be used air produces 1 5 2 5 ozone by weight whereas oxygen produces 3 5 ozone by weight to prevent reduction in the efficiency of the ozone generator feed gas is cleaned by removing dust moisture and oil which is accomplished using a refrigerant dryer compressor and desiccant dryer for large scale oxygen fed systems oxygen may be generated on site by using the vacuum pressure swing adsorption of oxygen from the air for large scale ozone generation a corona discharge cell is used which is ozone generation by the application of a high voltage current across two electrodes separated by a 0 3 3 0 mm discharge gap through which feed gas flows next ozone is dispersed into the water using contact basins the ozone feed rate varies between 1 and 5 mg l and the contact time depends on ct concentration of ozone c times the contact time t with the water values while the residual concentration varies between 0 3 and 0 9 mg l the exhaust gas from the contact basin is destroyed in an off gas destruct unit 4 1 2 feed system for coagulation after pre ozonation the raw water undergoes coagulation to remove particulates adding coagulant promotes destabilization of particulates resulting in floc formation and easier precipitation and removal from water the effectiveness of the operation depends on flash mixing the coagulant with raw water which was achieved at the dwtp through jet diffuser pumps placed in two conduits located midway between the ozone contact basins and flocculation basins the coagulant utilized was ferric chloride the equation used to determine the energy consumption for the jet pump is shown in table 1 ferric chloride and sodium hypochlorite were applied via a pipe routed through the center of a nozzle that discharged just in front of the deflector plate mixing was achieved because of the high hydraulic shearing action created by the interaction between the water jet from the nozzle impacting the deflector plate and the main water flow in the conduit 4 1 3 vertical turbine flocculators the flocculation process followed coagulation while the coagulation process involves flash mixing to disperse the coagulant within the feed water the flocculation process involves slow mixing to enhance the contact between the coagulant and the feed water and for the subsequent formation of flocs at the selected plant vertical turbine flocculators were designed using the criteria provided by crittenden et al 2005 table 1 the range of the values for velocity gradient was between 10 and 80 s 1 maximum tip speed was between 2 and 3 m s 1 and rotational speed was between 10 and 30 rev min 1 4 1 4 filtration backwash system next the flocculated water was filtered using dual media filters consisting of anthracite and sand to provide a finished water quality of 0 3 ntu designed using the criteria provided by reynolds et al 1996 a filtration rate of 13 5 m hr 1 was used the energy consuming units for the filtration process were the three surface wash pumps three centrifugal air blowers and three backwash pumps the equations used to determine energy consumption are shown in table 1 surface wash pumps were designed as jet pumps suspended above the filter media surface to break the crust formed on the surface of the filter media due to heavy clogging air blowers were used for air scour cleaning of the filter media then the filter media was backwashed using backwash pumps 4 1 5 on site sodium hypochlorite generator for the dwtp sodium hypochlorite was used as a secondary disinfectant to maintain residual disinfectant in the distribution system because during primary disinfection ozone is destroyed without leaving residual due to safety concerns related to the use of chlorine gas sodium hypochlorite was generated on site using an electrolysis process on site chlorine generation involves mixing sodium chloride with softened water in a saturator tank to form a brine solution which is then pumped to electrolytic cells electricity is applied and sodium hypochlorite solution is generated and stored electricity consumption was determined using the guidelines provided by white 2010 liquid sodium hypochlorite was applied to the treated water using feed pumps nine feed pumps were provided where two were used as backup 4 1 6 additional pump operations pumping is required to add zinc orthophosphate zo to prevent the corrosion of pipes and fluorosilicic acid fa which is a source of fluoride and important for teeth protection lastly pumping was required to distribute the finished water to the city the wastewater generated due to the filter backwash operation was treated using clarifiers and then thickeners where suspended solids settle under gravity both processes were designed using the criteria provided by crittenden et al 2005 the water recovered from the application of the clarifier and thickener was recycled through the dwtp the energy driving units for the operation were the motors of the pumps used for the transfer of water and generated sludge 4 2 pv system a pv system can potentially be used to meet the energy demands of the dwtp design and cost analysis of a potential pv system were achieved using the sam a modeling platform utilized to make performance and cost predictions for renewables including pv freeman et al 2013 gilman and dobos 2012 various studies have used the sam to analyze solar technologies kalogirou 2013 thevenard and pelland 2013 said et al 2015 malagueta et al 2014 malvoni et al 2017 cassard et al 2011 the sam is used to analyze the performance and economics of renewables over their design lives pv design warrants several inputs including electric load and weather information the computation of energy consumption as discussed in section 4 1 was used as an input for the electric load the rate charges applied were for large scale service for high voltage transmission 25000 v for weather data the sam contains a library of typical meteorological year tmy data which is site specific weather information tmy2 dataset spans 1961 1990 and tmy3 dataset spans 1976 2005 weather information can be selected for the site the tmy3 dataset was chosen selections for pv modules inverters battery storage and their characteristics were made from the database available in sam input required for the design of the pv system was either using the input of the desirable size of array and dc to ac ratio or the desirable number of modules and inverters battery storage was used to meet the energy requirements of the dwtp during the absence of daylight since the plant is operational for 24 hours battery bank storage can be designed either by utilizing the inputs of the number of battery cells in the series and the number of battery strings in parallel or by utilizing the desirable bank capacity and voltage to conduct cost analysis additional inputs include rates of the electric utility initial investment costs related to the pv system and other cost factors over the lifetime of the system financial inputs for the sam are shown in table s3 many us states have mandated to source some percentage of their electricity sales using renewables by implementing renewable portfolio standards rps thus adopting renewables for distributed generation may qualify some projects for financial incentives as in the case of this study table s3 based on nevada rps adopting pv for electricity generation qualified the current dwtp to claim property tax exemption as well as federal investment tax credit itc of 30 becoming part of the input parameters of the economic analysis economic analysis of using solar pv was conducted using the financial metrics of net present value npv and the levelized cost of electricity lcoe the npv is the present value of the difference between cash inflows and outflows and is estimated in dollars the lcoe is representative of the life cycle costs of the pv system based on its present value utilizing the units of cents kwh 1 the npv and lcoe can be estimated using the following equations n p v t 1 t i t 1 d t i o lcoe t 0 t c t 1 d t t 1 t e t 1 d t where t time period t analysis period d discount rate io capital costs it net inflow of cash during time t ct costs incurred during time t and et is the energy generated in kwh during time t the npv incorporates the time value of money based on the concept that the present value of money earned today is greater than the same amount of money earned in the future a project is deemed profitable if the npv is positive and unprofitable if the npv is negative the npv is the principal financial parameter used for this study this is because other popular metrics such as payback period are undesirable because of their complexity in calculations when incorporating various federal and state taxes and incentives even though the npv is not scaled it gives value to the scale of investment unlike the lcoe and payback period the lcoe value may or may not be adjusted for inflation the inflation adjusted value is called the real lcoe whereas the nominal lcoe is not adjusted for inflation further the value of internal rate of return irr was also computed and discussed during sensitivity analysis of financial parameters irr is the discount rate at which npv zero short et al 1995 for pv system using sam hundreds of design possibilities exist based on selected technical and economic parameters tables s3 and s4 the optimal pv array and battery system was designed using an iterative process to ensure a profitable project using npv and possibilities of maximum pv energy generation 4 3 land area requirements in order to estimate the existing empty land acreage of the dwtp the software arcgis was used sam estimated the land demands of a pv system by using the following equation landrequirements a m n m gcr where am area of a pv module nm total number of modules being used by the pv system and gcr ground coverage ratio the gcr determines the east west distance between the pv arrays the gcr value incorporates the additional area requirements for performance of maintenance activities and avoidance of self shading for calculation purposes in the sam the gcr value varies between 0 01 and 0 99 implying a large east west distance between the arrays to a negligible east west distance for the current analysis a gcr value of 0 3 is utilized 4 4 carbon emissions operation of the dwtp utilizing pv as an energy source will result in decreased carbon emissions a pv system does not generate emissions during its operational life however during the manufacturing transportation and dismantling of a pv system some emissions are generated the estimation of carbon emissions were made by taking the product of the electricity source mix data of the state of nevada and the related carbon emission data for the sources of petroleum coal natural gas solar pv wind energy hydroelectricity geothermal energy nuclear energy and bio power table s2 data for the electricity source mix helps in estimation of emissions related to the traditional grid electricity generation carbon emissions were reduced when pv design was incorporated to decrease the dependence of the dwtp on the traditional electricity grid the corresponding reduction was estimated by subtracting the emissions generated by the plant when using the pv system from the emissions generated by the dwtp when using the traditional electricity grid 4 5 scenarios analyzed for the development of the pv system a techno economic analysis was conducted for drinking water treatment only excluding the distribution pumps four scenarios were analyzed for scenario 1 sc 1 the development of the pv was considered to meet the energy demands of the drinking water treatment further scenarios were analyzed to meet the energy demands of the dwtp by excluding the process of ozonation scenario 2 sc 2 a sodium hypochlorite system scenario 3 sc 3 and an ozonation and sodium hypochlorite system scenario 4 sc 4 since some plants might not use ozonation or might not have an on site sodium hypochlorite generation system as is generally the case i e on site generation of hypochlorite is only viable for large plants smaller plants purchase liquid hypochlorite and are thus represented by scenario sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 each of these scenarios was analyzed for with storage and without storage conditions further the effects of location change of the dwtp from the southwest us to the us east coast was also evaluated for the pv system two scenarios were examined by changing the location of the treatment plant from nevada insolation level 7 1 kwh m 2 day 1 to i new york insolation level 3 5 kwh m 2 day 1 and ii massachusetts insolation level 3 7 kwh m 2 day 1 for new york location financial parameters that were changed are shown in table s3 the incentives incorporated were 30 itc and 100 state sales tax exemption based on new york rps dsire 2017 the system did not qualify for other incentives the utilized electric rate input downloaded from the sam database for electric rates was based upon the rates of the new york power authority for large general service assumptions for the remaining data were not changed for massachusetts location financial parameters that were changed are shown in table s3 the incentives incorporated were 30 itc and 100 property tax exemption for a 20 year period based on massachusetts rps dsire 2017 a property tax rate of 2 was used the electric rate input utilized was based upon the rates of the national grid of massachusetts for large general service for commercial or industrial facilities with demands 2000 kw national grid 2018 assumptions for the remaining data were not changed 5 results and discussion this section describes the results of analyzing the energy consumption of various unit processes of the dwtp and then the performance and cost analysis of the pv system 5 1 process energy driving units for the selected dwtp raw water entered the plant and was ozonated ozonation was used as a primary disinfectant and applied as a pre treatment process high purity oxygen was used as feed gas generated using a vacuum pressure swing adsorption system ozone was generated at a 3 6 concentration by weight whereas the ozone dose used was 1 55 mg l 1 the ozone production was about 1 800 kg day 1 a 1 4 log inactivation of cryptosporidium 9 log inactivation of giardia and 18 8 log inactivation of virus were achieved utilizing pre ozonation energy consumption for the system is shown in table 2 next the coagulant ferric chloride was added in the water and flash mixed using jet pumps the flash mix system consisted of two stages installed in series within each of the two 213 4 cm conduits ferric chloride was applied in the first stage while in the second stage sodium hypochlorite was applied then eight flow trains were used to provide flocculation to 1 mm3 day 1 of flow using vertical turbine flocculators flocculation was achieved in 3 stages for decreasing velocity gradients of 70 40 and 25 s 1 and for a reynolds number 10 000 following ozonation coagulation and flocculation the water was filtered using twenty dual media filters having an area of 184 5 m2 the filter media was comprised of 1 83 m of anthracite followed by 0 2 m of sand placed above the underdrains each filter consisted of two cells each having an area of 92 2 m2 the filtration rate used was 13 5 m hr 1 the media size for anthracite was 1 2 mm and for sand it was 0 61 mm the clean bed head loss was found to be 0 57 m two of the filters were provided for redundancy purposes the operational duration for the surface wash pumps was 3 min followed by air scour for 8 min the duration for backwashing was 15 min and the frequency of backwash was daily hence a value of 24 h was used the energy consumption determined for the backwash filtration system is shown in table 2 filtration recovery was found to be 97 since ozone leaves no residual chlorination is performed to protect the finished water against the microbial contamination in the distribution system nine on site sodium hypochlorite generators were used two of which were provided as a backup the generators have an installed capacity of about 8165 kg day 1 equivalent chlorine liquid sodium hypochlorite was added to the finished water using five 10 hp and three 20 hp feed pumps two of which were used as a back up table 2 finished water was distributed using eight 1 75 m3 s 1 water distribution pumps each with a motor size of 3500 hp two additional pumps were provided as a backup the backwash filtration system generates wastewater which is treated using clarifiers and thickeners at first the wastewater was conveyed to two equalization basins with an additional basin provided as a backup next the water was pumped to two clarifiers for solid settling under the effect of gravity the generated effluent was recycled through the dwtp whereas the generated sludge was pumped to two thickeners the energy consumers of the thickeners were the water transfer pumps and the sludge transfer pump motors the total operational energy consumption for the dwtp was about 577 mwh day 1 508 wh m 3 while the energy consumption required for water treatment excluding the water distribution pumps was about 65 5 mwh day 1 57 7 wh m 3 the results showed that the largest consumer of energy for the plant was the pumping operation the energy consumption for the water distribution pumps was about 512 mwh day 1 450 4 wh m 3 while the pumping operations for the treatment of drinking water amounted to 5 71 mwh day 1 5 1 wh m 3 thus utilizing about 89 6 of the total operational energy consumption the water treatment processes themselves consumed about 10 4 of the total operational energy among the processes utilized for the treatment of water the on site sodium hypochlorite generator was the largest consumer of energy consuming about 57 32 9 wh m 3 of the energy utilized for treatment processes table 2 fig 2 the second largest consumer was ozonation 19 5 wh m 3 the third largest consumer of electricity was the coagulation process that employed jet pumps for flash mixing with an energy intensity of about 2 6 wh m 3 the processes of flocculation 1 2 wh m 3 and filtration 1 32 wh m 3 each consumed about 2 of the overall energy the smallest consumers of energy were the processes involved in residual management and the addition of zo and fa each consuming about 0 1 of the overall energy for sc 1 sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 the energy consumption was determined as 65 5 43 3 28 and 5 8 mwh day 1 respectively a sensitivity analysis was performed for the energy consumption estimates related to the pumping operations for the treatment plant one potential improvement a plant can made is switch to more efficient pumps and motors for the sensitivity analysis the wire to electric efficiencies of the pumps were increased by 5 and 10 which resulted in a 0 42 65 2 mwh day 1 and 0 8 65 mwh day 1 decrease in the total operational energy consumption 65 5 mwh day 1 of the water treatment units respectively however decreasing wire to water efficiencies by 5 65 8 mwh day 1 and 10 66 1 mwh day 1 resulted in increased operational energy consumption by 0 46 and 0 97 respectively both increase and decrease were small because the major energy driving units for the water treatment units were the processes of ozonation and the sodium hypochlorite generation system which were unaffected by the changes in wire to water efficiency various studies have reported the energy consumption estimates of unit processes of water treatment the energy intensity values estimated using the current study and validated against plant s data were found to be less than the reported values of plappally and lienhard 2012 table 2 lee et al 2017 reported energy intensity values for desalination as well as water and wastewater treatment and transport for urban areas as 0 3700 wh m 3 for source water extraction and transport 30 4230 wh m 3 for treatment this study 508 wh m 3 30 580 wh m 3 for distribution 160 wh m 3 for wastewater collection and 180 10 000 wh m 3 for wastewater treatment in california about 3 of the total electricity consumption is utilized for drinking water supply and treatment while 1 is used for wastewater treatment according to a study by the california energy commission cec cec 2006 the report estimated the energy intensity for raw water conveyance drinking water treatment water distribution and wastewater treatment as 0 3650 wh m 3 26 wh m 3 this study 57 7 wh m 3 for water treatment processes only 320 wh m 3 and 290 650 wh m 3 respectively the results of this study were found to be in good agreement with the values reported in the literature table 2 5 2 pv system to incorporate sustainability into the design and operation of the dwtp solar pv was utilized the design and economic analysis of the pv system was achieved using the sam the energy consumption determined for unit processes was utilized as the electric load input for sizing solar pv for the simulation work the tracking type selected was 2 axis pv the parameters for the selected solar module inverter and battery type are shown in table s4 freecleansolar 2017 invertersupply 2017 wholesalesolar 2017 since the pv could only meet the daytime energy demands battery storage was used to meet the energy demands for 24 hour operation of the plant for sc 1 sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 the analysis utilizing the sam resulted in 12 mw 8 mw 5 mw and 1 1 mw pv systems respectively with large battery storage capacities table 3 fig 3 about 47 of the energy requirements were fulfilled using the pv system while the remaining 53 of the load was supported using battery storage if battery storage was not provided for these scenarios then the same pv systems could offset about 5 3 npv 6 7 m net capital cost 37 m 3 5 npv 4 4 m net capital cost 24 7 m 2 3 npv 2 8 m net capital cost 15 4 m and 0 5 npv 0 36 net capital cost 3 1 m of the total operational energy consumption for sc 1 sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 respectively the aforementioned estimations for scenarios without incorporating battery storage represent the effect of battery storage on the overall cost and performance of the pv system the pv systems were grid connected the npv was positive for all the analysed scenarios the results generated in this study may serve as a gauge for the design and analysis of treatment plants using similar processes sensitivity analysis for the pv system for sc 1 is shown in table 4 by using different types of tracking mechanisms a sensitivity analysis was conducted by quantifying the influence of loan interest rates 0 5 itc 0 50 electricity rates 25 50 and discount rate 0 10 on the economics of the pv system as shown by fig 4 changing the loan interest rate between 0 and 5 resulted in the npv varying between positive to negative values for sc 1 and sc 4 changes in investment tax credit in the range of 0 50 greatly affected the economics of the project pv system development reduces the energy costs incurred due to the use of a utility grid however if the electric rates are too low pv development may no longer be profitable fig 4 lcoe for pv with battery storage was affected more by changes in loan interest rates and itc than for pv without storage the npv for pv with battery storage supporting large loads was affected more by changes in loan interest rates itc and electric rates than pv supporting smaller loads with or without storage the lcoe values for a pv with or without battery storage was not affected by changes in electric rates since electric rates are not part of the pv system lifecycle costs changes in discount rate showed irr 7 4 and 7 6 for sc 1 and sc 4 with storage respectively corresponding to npv zero fig s1 shows the influence of the parameters of electric rate discount rate loan interest rate and investment tax credit on the npv and irr 5 3 land area requirements land is also a resource which is finite and shrinking land area development is inextricably linked with energy as well as water supply similarly the water and energy infrastructure development require land area cheng and hammond 2017 fthenakis and kim 2009 the fenced area of the dwtp about 1 6 km2 determined using arcgis may be utilized for the development of solar pv the land area is primarily flat with low shrubs thus a pv system can be deployed with minimum land preparation and disturbance as shown by table 3 land requirements for the installation of a pv system for all four scenarios analyzed were determined to be much less than 1 6 km2 due to climate change effects on land systems over exploitation of land for agricultural purposes and land degradation due to pollution using land area in a sustainable manner becomes vital this encompasses ensuring minimal environmental impact while also maintaining the multi functionality of land areas installing pv systems may be an effective technique to ensure sustainable use of land fthenakis and kim 2009 estimated the life cycle of land transformation for various sources of electricity generation including coal coal natural gas nuclear pv wind biomass and hydroelectric and determined that pv installations cause the least land transformation among them additionally bukhary et al 2018a determined pv systems to be favorable for land limited and water limited areas among different types of solar technologies water energy land nexus has been analyzed by various studies bryan et al 2016 analyzed the water energy land nexus for australia and evaluated policy implications for the year 2050 bukhary et al 2018a analyzed the solar energy water land carbon nexus for utility scale solar installations in the southwestern u s based on the regional rps chen et al 2018 made quantitative assessments of land area utilized for cultivation 39 and associated water withdrawal 29 within the context of the global supply chain howells et al 2013 evaluated the effects of climate change on the water energy land nexus by developing a model for integrated resource management and policy analysis 5 4 carbon emissions the development of pv with battery storage can lead to reduced carbon emissions for sc 1 sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 the net reduction in carbon emissions was estimated as 11000 7300 4700 and 980 metric tons co₂eq year 1 respectively while without battery storage the reduction in emissions was estimated as 5200 3400 2200 460 metric tons co₂eq year 1 respectively for the eight water distribution pumps carbon emissions were estimated at 86 000 metric tons co₂eq year 1 as shown by the results the adverse impacts of the water energy nexus can be reduced by using solar for energy generation the u s environmental protection agency usepa usepa 2013 estimated that carbon emissions in the amounts of 40 8 million metric tons are related to water and wastewater treatment operations 5 5 geographical location another scenario was examined by changing the location of the treatment plant from southwestern state of nevada to the us east coast at i new york and ii massachusetts when analyzing for new york it was determined that a 16 1 mw pv system using a large battery storage supporting 60 of load was able to offset 100 of the electric load for sc 1 however the npv was negative table 3 the 12 mw pv system sc 1 at nevada location when sited in new york was able to offset 81 of the total electric load while without battery storage it was only able to offset 38 of the total load analyzed when analyzing for the sensitivity of financial parameters between nevada and new york locations property tax rates were shown to have the largest effect for the new york location the property tax rate of 2 resulted in negative npv however when changed from 2 to 1 2 for sc 1 would result in a positive npv of 2 4 million and an lcoe value of 3 8 cents kwh 1 the property tax rate may vary depending upon location of the property property tax exemption or partial property rate incentives have the potential of greatly promoting the development of solar facilities in the state for the massachusetts location it was determined that a 17 mw pv system using a large storage capacity was able to offset 100 of the electric load for sc 1 the npv was positive table 3 the 12 mw pv system sc 1 at the nevada location when sited in massachusetts was able to offset 84 of the total load analyzed between the new york and massachusetts locations comparison of the results determined property tax incentive to be most influential as massachusetts provides a state incentive of 100 property tax exemption while new york does not dsire 2017 also changing the dwtp location from the southwestern us higher solar insolation levels to the us east coast lower solar insolation levels required larger pv system sizes and battery storage capacities to offset the same electric loads however the system was able to offset about 81 84 of the total load analyzed without changing the pv system size this is because the pv system was designed for the worst case scenario of the winter months for the nevada location this study has successfully applied the water energy carbon nexus approach for sustainable large scale drinking water treatment which is an energy intensive process application of a water energy carbon nexus approach particularly through the adoption of renewables like solar to offset energy requirements may help achieve sustainability and reduce carbon emissions of water treatment systems the resource potential of solar energy is huge fthenakis et al 2009 conducted a techno economical and geographically based analysis of the potential of using pv and concentrated solar power in the u s and determined that by the year 2050 solar energy can potentially meet 35 of the total u s energy demand electricity and fuel and 69 of the total u s electricity demand fthenakis et al 2009 further concluded that by the year 2100 solar energy could potentially supply 90 of the total u s energy needs and along with other renewable energy sources 100 of the total energy needs of the u s hence contributing to a 92 decline in carbon emission levels when compared to the carbon levels in 2005 initial investments are typically high for solar projects but can be offset by low operation and maintenance costs during the operational life of the solar facility hernández moro and martínez duart 2013 in recent years the efficiency of pv panels has increased significantly with a marked decrease in price a trend projected to continue over the coming years currently governmental support and subsidies are still required for solar pv projects to be cost effective hagerman et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2016 as also shown by this study reduction in current battery storage prices can significantly alter the way energy is generated today as pv coupled with battery storage can lead to a reliable supply of electricity throughout the 24 h of the day 6 conclusions the aim of this study was the application of a water energy carbon nexus approach for a dwtp by a determining the energy consumption of the processes utilized for water treatment b using pv as an energy source for the treatment facility based on economic considerations c and quantifying the net reduction of carbon emissions due to pv development energy consumption was determined for drinking water treatment processes of pre ozonation 19 5 wh m 3 coagulation 1 3 wh m 3 flocculation 1 22 wh m 3 filtration 0 32 wh m 3 chlorine disinfection 32 9 wh m 3 and residual management 0 091wh m 3 the total operational energy consumption for the dwtp was about 577 mwh day 1 508 wh m 3 while the operational energy consumption required for water treatment excluding water distribution pumps was about 65 5 mwh day 1 57 7 wh m 3 the pumping operation was the largest consumer of energy energy consumption for the water distribution pumps was about 512 mwh day 1 450 4 wh m 3 while the pumping operations for the treatment of drinking water amounted to 5 71 mwh day 1 5 1 wh m 3 utilizing nearly 89 6 of the total operational energy consumption for sc 1 sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 energy consumption was determined as 65 5 43 3 28 and 5 8 mwh day 1 respectively an on site sodium hypochlorite generation system was the largest consumer of energy 32 9 wh m 3 whereas pre ozonation was the second largest 19 5 wh m 3 among the processes utilized for treatment of water for scenario sc 1 sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 the capacity of the pv system was determined as 12 8 5 and 1 1 mw with large battery storage capacities for nevada site offsetting about 11 7 5 5 and 1 of the operational energy consumption of the plant 577 mwh day 1 respectively however without battery storage the same grid connected pv system could offset about 5 3 3 5 2 3 and 0 5 of the operational energy consumption respectively the npv was found to be positive for sc 1 sc 2 sc 3 and sc 4 the net reduction in carbon emissions was estimated as 11000 7300 4700 and 980 metric tons co₂eq year 1 respectively while without battery storage net reduction in carbon emissions was estimated 5200 3400 2200 460 metric tons co₂eq year 1 respectively it was also determined that changing the plant s location from the southwestern us higher solar insolation levels to the us east coast lower solar insolation level would require a larger pv system size and battery storage capacity the results were found to be most sensitive to property tax rates among parameters changed between the two locations sales tax state income tax property tax electric rates a property tax exemption or partial property tax rate incentives have promising implications for solar development in the areas this study successfully applied the water energy carbon nexus approach for sustainable large sale drinking water treatment by evaluating the operational energy consumption of the unit processes of a dwtp located in an urban area and then using solar pv to offset that energy consumption leading to net reduction in carbon emissions a rigorous analysis of energy consumption of the various unit processes involved in drinking water treatment helped identify key design parameters that maybe modified to reduce the energy requirements of treatment plants further the design parameters of actual plants are not widely shared in the public domain and this data provides valuable insight to students professionals as well as researchers in this study determination of energy consumption was limited to drinking water treatment for future work energy consumption related to distribution of water within the community could also be analyzed data generated in this study can serve as a gauge when considering solar energy use in water treatment facilities as a means to save energy and increase sustainability this method can be used for other plants at other locations this work presents valuable insights to researchers in the field and policy makers credit
