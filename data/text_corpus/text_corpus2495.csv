12475,this study investigated whether the toxicity of boron to the green algal species chlamydomonas reinhardtii chlorella sorokiniana and chlorella vulgaris was affected by the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta as edta exists widely in aquatic ecosystems its effects must be considered when assessing metal toxicity c vulgaris was found to be the most insensitive among the three algae as there was little change in the toxicity of boron for this species in the presence of edta when compared with that for the other species in contrast c reinhardtii and c sorokiniana were both highly sensitive to boron in the presence of edta based on visual minteq modeling results we found that edta combined with micronutrients this chelation reduced their availability for uptake by the algae consequently the algae were highly sensitive to boron these results will be useful for future assessments of risk and management of boron in aquatic ecosystems keywords boron green algae toxicity edta metal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction algae play an important role in the food chains of aquatic ecosystems as producers of essential nutrients and their diversity and biomass directly affect ecosystem structure and function 49 algae are widely used to assess the toxicity of chemicals in aquatic ecosystems owing to their microscopic size short generation time and sensitivity to toxic substances 47 60 boron a metalloid is used in the manufacture of glassware and bleach and is an ingredient in fertilizers herbicides and insecticides 5 32 34 it naturally occurs in rocks coal shale and soils as a borosilicate mineral 32 51 boron naturally exists as a compound with elements such as oxygen and nitrogen 46 despite being an essential microelement for organisms studies have shown that boron is not required for the growth of green algae 24 44 boron can be toxic to aquatic organisms especially at high concentrations 17 58 various studies have investigated the toxicity of boron to aquatic organisms including fish water fleas and algae 1 4 7 9 10 12 15 21 26 28 30 36 42 62 64 some studies have focused on green algae including chlorella vulgaris chlorella pyrenoidosa and scendesmus quadricauda 7 9 10 41 64 in these studies the toxicity of boron to green algae was assessed using boric acid sodium tetraborate and sodium pentaborate pentahydrate and the toxic effects included growth inhibition increased oxidative stress and cellular ultrastructure changes previous studies have suggested that boron can cause toxicity in algae by inhibiting the absorption of micronutrients including metals 9 10 therefore this study aimed to observe the effects of boron toxicity on green algae in the presence or absence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta which can affect the absorption of metal ions the edta is known to exist widely in aquatic ecosystems and is commonly used in toxicity bioassays to prevent the precipitation of ions in test media 19 it is known to affect the toxicity of metals as it chelates with metal ions 23 and previous studies have revealed that metal toxicity to algae changed in the presence of edta 19 22 23 35 37 40 50 most studies on metal toxicity have shown that metals and edta chelate which reduces the amount of bioavailable metal and thereby diminishes toxicity 19 22 23 35 however no study has investigated the toxic effects of boron on algae in the presence of edta in this study we expected a change in the toxicity of boron to green algae according to the presence or absence of edta as we hypothesized that if edta was present boron would chelate it and this would reduce its toxicity to green algae three algal species chlamydomonas reinhardtii chlorella sorokiniana and c vulgaris were used and their toxicity values were calculated and compared in the presence or absence of edta this research can help to understand the trend of metal toxicity including boron depending on the presence of edta 2 material and methods 2 1 materials and test species borax sodium tetra borate decahydrate 99 5 was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa in water the solubility of borax is 31 7 g l and it binds with a high affinity to oxygen to form the compound borate 33 34 green algae are primary producers and are thus important species in the aquatic environment 38 c sorokiniana sag strain no 211 8k and c vulgaris sag strain no 211 11b which are trebouxiophyceae species and c reinhardtii a chlorophyceae species were selected as the test species for this investigation as they are commonly used to test the ecotoxicity of green algae c sorokiniana and c vulgaris were obtained from the university of göttingen göttingen germany and c reinhardtii was obtained from the university of texas austin usa they were incubated at 24 c 2 c under 16 8 light dark conditions 4000 lux and shaken at 100 rpm tris acetate phosphate tap medium was used as the test medium 25 the test medium was prepared differently according to the presence or absence of edta edta and edta medium to study the effects of its chelation the detailed components of the tap medium are shown in table s1 2 2 algal assay the algal assay was performed according to a modified version of oecd guideline no 201 for testing chemicals 45 a 2000 mg boron l stock solution was prepared the test concentrations which were determined from range finding tests were created by diluting the stock solution using the tap medium 20 40 60 80 120 and 160 mg boron l all solutions for the test concentration were prepared using edta or edta medium the stock solutions for boron were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes jobin yvon ultima 2 horiba jobin yvon kyoto japan the concentrations of the stock solutions 2000 mg boron l for the edta and edta mediums were measured as 2019 mg boron l and 2014 mg boron l respectively the boron concentrations of both the edta and edta tap mediums were 2 mg boron l the detection limit was confirmed to be below 0 01 mg boron l measured concentrations were used in the graphs and toxicity values then 0 9 ml of the test solution was added to each well of a 48 well cell culture plate and 0 1 ml of algal cell suspension 1 0 105 cells ml for each alga was inoculated in each well the well plates were incubated for 72 h in an incubator at 24 c 2 c under 16 8 light dark conditions 4000 lux and shaken at 100 rpm the experiment was conducted using 3 6 replicates to estimate the yield of algae after 72 h of exposure chlorophyll a was extracted using ethanol for 3 h and was measured using a microplate reader varioskan lux multimode microplate reader thermo scientific waltham ma usa at 420 and 671 nm excitation and emission wavelengths respectively the range of ph for all test solutions was 7 1 8 0 2 3 visual minteq modeling to confirm the chelation of edta with metal ions including boron we used the visual minteq program version 3 1 compiled by gustafsson in 2019 visual minteq is a program developed by the united states environmental protection agency to model chemical equilibrium of chemical species distribution this program can calculate the equilibrium between dissolved adsorbed gaseous and solid phases in the medium 2 using this program we attempted to identify bioavailable metal species including boron in the presence of edta we entered the amount of chemicals in the edta and edta tap medium into the minteq program the organic compound was excluded the temperature of the equilibrium system was assumed to be 24 c 2 4 statistical analysis the growth rate of the algae was quantified and compared with that of the control for each species all data were processed based on the measured concentration the effective concentrations for 50 of each species ec50 and 10 of each species ec10 were calculated using the probit program 20 the no observed effect concentration noec values were estimated using a dunnett s test 16 a dunnett s test was also performed to compare the algae yield according to the absence and presence of edta for all comparisons a 95 confidence limit was used p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 boron toxicity data for the three algal species in all experiments the biomass was found to have increased by 16 after 72 h additionally they all met the specific growth rate of 0 92 day 1 as presented in the oecd guidelines 45 the growth rate of the three algae exposed to boron in the presence or absence of edta is shown in fig 1 boron affected the growth rate of all species at high concentrations the growth rate of c reinhardtii decreased significantly compared with that of the control group at 40 edta and 60 mg boron l concentrations edta p 0 05 fig 1a noec values of boron for c reinhardtii were 20 edta and 40 mg boron l edta table 1 the 72 h ec10 values for c reinhardtii were 33 edta and 59 mg boron l edta and the 72 h ec50 values were 76 edta and 134 mg boron l edta significant growth inhibition of c sorokiniana was observed at a concentration of 60 mg boron l both edta and edta and the noec values of boron in the presence or absence of edta were found to be 40 mg boron l p 0 05 fig 1b and table 1 the 72 h ec10 values for c sorokiniana were confirmed as 31 edta and 52 mg boron l edta and the 72 h ec50 values were 75 edta and 92 mg boron l edta when edta was present the growth rate of c vulgaris was significantly decreased at 100 mg boron l p 0 05 fig 1c c vulgaris was found to be the most insensitive to boron among the three algae significant growth inhibition occurred at concentrations of 121 mg boron l in the absence of edta the 72 h ec10 values for c vulgaris were confirmed as 86 edta and 70 mg boron l edta and the 72 h ec50 values were 111 edta and 110 mg boron l edta table 1 the noec values of boron for the growth inhibition of c vulgaris were 80 edta and 81 mg boron l edta the different sensitivities of the two species may be attributed to their different cellular properties including the thickness and components of the cell wall 66 previous studies have also observed the growth inhibition of algae by boron exposure bringmann and kühn 7 assessed the toxicity of boron using sodium tetra borate by means of a cell multiplication inhibition test they found that the toxicity threshold for scenedesmus quadricauda was 0 58 mg boron l wong and wong 64 performed boron toxicity tests using boric acid for 14 days by observing the population changes of the algae and determined that the lowest noec values were 0 8 and 0 4 mg boron l in the presence and absence of boric acid respectively chen and pei 9 calculated the 3 day ec50 value of sodium pentaborate pentahydrate as 46 59 mg boron l using chlorella vulgaris only one study found a similar toxicity of boron on chlorella where the growth inhibition was in the range of 50 100 mg boron l however the authors of this study did not suggest a toxicity value for boron 6 the toxicity value of boron for green algae seems to be lower in this study than in previous studies the toxicity mechanisms of boron have been confirmed in a previous study boron is known to inhibit enzyme activity in plant cells by either complexing substrates or binding to the enzyme 51 however the mechanisms by which boron inhibits enzyme activity in algae have not yet been studied in the meantime chen and pei 9 measured the growth rate of c vulgaris as well as the chlorophyll content and activities of sod and cat in their study the chlorophyll content of c vulgaris decreased significantly and the activities of the antioxidant enzymes increased after 72 h of exposure however since it was confirmed that boron had little effect on photosynthesis 51 the authors speculated that the decrease in chlorophyll content was not causally related to the toxicity of boron regarding the increase in antioxidant enzymes zhou et al 65 suggested that the main influencing factor was the pentaborate anion which could affect nutrient absorption chen et al 10 conducted a further study by measuring intracellular metal ion concentrations they found that the metal ion ca mg k and fe concentrations decreased as the boron concentration increased in the 24 h and 96 h measurements for plants it was reported that boron inhibited the absorption of metal ions including ca mg and fe which are essential elements for crop growth 18 57 these elements are known to be involved in photosynthesis chlorophyll synthesis and defense mechanisms of the cell 13 29 39 59 the authors concluded that the combination of polyborate with metallic cations decreases the availability of metal for algae the toxicity of boron shown in this study is also presumed to be due to the change in metal availability for the algae this is discussed in greater detail in the next section 3 2 comparison of toxicity values in relation to the presence of edta our hypothesis is that the presence of edta reduces the inhibitory effect of boron on nutrient absorption by algae through chelation resulting in a decrease in boron toxicity according to the growth inhibition results for the three algae in the presence of edta boron toxicity was determined to be generally higher in the presence of edta than in its absence in experiments with c reinhardtii the growth rate in the edta medium decreased significantly compared with that in the edta medium at 60 mg boron l significant differences continued to be observed with increased concentrations the growth rate of c sorokiniana in the edta medium was also inhibited compared with that in the edta medium at 60 and 81 mg boron l in the high concentration exposure groups there was no significant difference because the growth of c sorokiniana did not markedly increase in either medium meanwhile the growth rate of c vulgaris was similar in the two media significant differences in the growth rates were observed at the highest concentration 161 mg boron l p 0 05 toxicity values were also found to be low when edta was present in the medium except for c vulgaris in our study most toxicity values were lower in the edta medium than in the edta medium which means that edta had negative effects on boron toxicity based on previous studies indicating that boron inhibits the absorption of micronutrients by algae we have conducted an investigation into the toxicity values of metals in the presence or absence of edta there have been several studies on the toxicity of metals for algae in the presence of edta we compared the toxicity values of the heavy metals for algae in the presence or absence of edta table 2 we found seven studies on the effects of cu zn ni pb and cd 19 22 23 35 37 40 50 selecting only the literature that presented toxicity values for each material we presented them in a graph fig 2 among the 21 cases in the 7 studies the comparable toxicity values were identified for 10 cases in 3 studies 19 35 37 in other papers as the toxicity values were not presented they could not be utilized to generate fig 2 the negative effects of edta were found in only two cases whereas positive effects were found in the other cases natural water especially water with a high caco3 content was the common element in these two cases when edta had positive effects on metal toxicity the authors suggested that the chelation of metal ions and edta reduced their bioavailability for the algae 19 22 23 35 in this study we produced results contradicting the findings of most previous studies which may be connected to the absorption of metals meanwhile through the modeling results of visual minteq edta in tap medium was confirmed to chelate mostly with zn mn ca co and fe table s2 as it was confirmed that edta did not chelate with boron it was found that the species distribution of boron did not change according to the presence of edta in a previous study by dembitsky et al 14 boron in algae was identified as existing in both free and complex borate forms specifically in green algae it was found to primarily exist as boric acid 11 these findings are consistent with our modeling results which suggest that boron in tap medium exists in the form of boric acid however in the case of zn mn and fe it was confirmed that the species distribution changed significantly according to presence or absence of edta hence it can be assumed that the amount of metal especially zn mn and fe available to algae in the medium changed and this might change the toxicity of boron edta has a high affinity for metals such as mn cu and pb forming strong complexes 31 our visual minteq results showed that zn mn and fe which had significantly altered compositions due to the presence of edta also had a high affinity for edta their stability constants with edta log kb were 16 68 zn 13 95 mn and 14 3 fe respectively 31 a recent study comparing micronutrient concentrations in the presence and absence of edta also confirmed a similar trend to our modeling results 48 they found that the bioavailable micronutrient concentration for algae decreased in the presence of edta in conclusion contrary to our hypothesis edta increased the toxicity of boron by preferentially binding with micronutrients present in the medium over boron which was present in high concentrations thereby inhibiting the absorption of nutrients available to algae zn especially zn2 is known to protect cell membranes from oxidative stress and peroxidative damage therefore a deficiency of zn2 might cause an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane 3 53 55 it is also associated with the activity of enzymes including dehydrogenases isomerases and rna and dna polymerases fe is involved in the biosynthesis of ethylene therefore deficiency of fe might cause growth inhibition owing to insufficient levels of ethylene 52 fe is also required for the activity of enzymes which are related to oxidation and reduction processes and involved in the assembly of thylakoid units therefore the absorption of sufficient fe plays a very important role in photosynthesis mn is a constituent of enzymes related to ps ii and mnsod 8 a deficient mn level might interrupt the creation of phenolics and lignin content which is associated with the primary defense against fungal infections 8 43 52 56 therefore in this study the change in metal ions including zn mn and fe might have affected boron toxicity with regard to the growth of the three algae via various mechanisms additionally borate or polyborate generated by borax exposure would have chelated with other metal cations rather than with edta 61 this can be found in previous studies on the toxicity mechanisms of boron as presented in section 3 1 therefore we suggest that the change in boron toxicity depending on the presence of edta was caused by the absorption of micronutrients such as zn mn and fe this study had some limitations we confirmed the species distribution of the metals in the tap medium using visual minteq however we did not measure the concentrations of the metals absorbed by the algae compared with that in previous studies the growth inhibition observed in this study appears to be due to changes in the concentration of metals absorbed by the algae therefore the concentrations of the metals absorbed by algae should be investigated in future studies together with this accurate mechanisms to describe the changes in the metal absorbance of the algae need to be elucidated in future studies nevertheless this study explored the changes in the toxicity of metals in the presence of edta and attempted to identify the causes of these changes therefore we believe that the results of this study could provide foundational information for future studies into metal toxicity to algae 4 conclusion in this study we assessed boron toxicity using three species of green algae and examined the effects of edta our results confirmed that the toxicity of boron increased when edta was present the toxicity mechanisms of boron are known to involve the inhibition of micronutrient absorption and it has been confirmed that edta enhances this inhibition we found that edta binds to metal ions such as zn mn and fe in the medium rather than to boron could enhance the toxicity of boron by reducing available micronutrients in the medium for the algae zn mn and fe are associated with enzyme activity related to growth photosynthesis and defense mechanisms therefore the lack of bioavailable metal ions would hinder the activities of the relevant enzymes thereby preventing the activation of defense mechanisms against boron the findings indicate that the harmful effects of boron in the presence of edta differ from those of metals as far as we know this is the first investigation of algal toxicity caused by boron in the presence and absence of edta our results are significant because the toxicity of a substance containing edta may be affected by the competition between the substance and metal ions for chelation by edta declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this research was

authors of this study did not suggest a toxicity value for boron 6 the toxicity value of boron for green algae seems to be lower in this study than in previous studies the toxicity mechanisms of boron

defense mechanisms of the cell 13 29 39 59 the authors concluded that the combination of polyborate with metallic cations decreases the availability of metal for algae the toxicity of boron shown in this study is also presumed to be due to the change in metal availability for the algae this is discussed in greater detail in the next section 3 2 comparison of toxicity values in relation to the presence of edta our hypothesis is that the presence of edta reduces the inhibitory effect of boron on nutrient absorption by algae through chelation resulting in a decrease in boron toxicity

no significant difference because the growth of c sorokiniana did not markedly increase in either medium meanwhile the growth rate of c vulgaris was similar in the two media significant differences in the growth rates were observed at the highest concentration 161 mg boron l p 0 05 toxicity values were also found to be low when edta was present in the medium except for c vulgaris in our study most toxicity values were lower in the edta medium than in the edta medium which means that edta had negative effects on boron toxicity based on previous studies indicating that boron inhibits the absorption of micronutrients by algae we have conducted an investigation into the toxicity values of metals in the presence or absence of edta there have been several studies on the toxicity of metals for algae in the presence of edta we compared the toxicity values of the heavy metals for algae in the presence or absence of edta table 2 we found seven studies on the effects of cu zn ni pb and cd 19 22 23 35 37 40 50 selecting only the literature that presented toxicity values for each material we presented them in a graph fig 2 among the 21 cases in the 7 studies the comparable toxicity values were identified for 10 cases in 3 studies 19 35 37 in other papers as the toxicity values were not presented they could not be utilized to generate fig 2 the negative effects of edta were found in only two cases whereas positive effects were found in the other cases natural water especially water with a high caco3 content was the common element in these two cases when edta had positive effects on metal toxicity the authors suggested that the chelation of metal ions and edta reduced their bioavailability for the algae 19 22 23 35 in this study we produced results contradicting the findings of most previous studies which may be connected to the absorption of metals meanwhile through the modeling results of visual minteq edta in tap medium was confirmed to chelate mostly with zn mn ca co and fe table s2 as it was confirmed that edta did not chelate with boron it was found that the species distribution of boron did not change according to the presence of edta in a previous study by dembitsky et al 14 boron in algae was identified as existing in both free and complex borate forms specifically in green algae it was found to primarily exist as boric acid 11 these findings are consistent with our modeling results which suggest that boron in tap medium exists in the form of boric acid however in the case of zn mn and fe it was confirmed that the species distribution changed significantly according to presence or absence of edta hence it can be assumed that the amount of metal especially zn mn and fe available to algae in the medium changed and this might change the toxicity of boron edta has a high affinity for metals such as mn cu and pb forming strong complexes 31 our visual minteq results showed that zn mn and fe which had significantly altered compositions due to the presence of edta also had a high affinity for edta their stability constants with edta log kb were 16 68 zn 13 95 mn and 14 3 fe respectively 31 a recent study comparing micronutrient concentrations in the presence and absence of edta also confirmed a similar trend to our modeling results 48 they found that the bioavailable micronutrient concentration for algae decreased in the presence of edta in conclusion contrary to our hypothesis edta increased the toxicity of boron by preferentially binding with micronutrients present in the medium over boron which was present in high concentrations thereby inhibiting the absorption of nutrients available to algae zn especially zn2 is known to protect cell membranes from oxidative stress and peroxidative damage therefore a deficiency of zn2 might cause an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane 3 53 55 it is also associated with the activity of enzymes including dehydrogenases isomerases and rna and dna polymerases fe is involved in the biosynthesis of ethylene therefore deficiency of fe might cause growth inhibition owing to insufficient levels of ethylene 52 fe is also required for the activity of enzymes which are related to oxidation and reduction processes and involved in the assembly of thylakoid units therefore the absorption of sufficient fe plays a very important role in photosynthesis mn is a constituent of enzymes related to ps ii and mnsod 8 a deficient mn level might interrupt the creation of phenolics and lignin content which is associated with the primary defense against fungal infections 8 43 52 56 therefore in this study the change in metal ions including zn mn and fe might have affected boron toxicity with regard to the growth of the three algae via various mechanisms additionally borate or polyborate generated by borax exposure would have chelated with other metal cations rather than with edta 61 this can be found in previous studies on the toxicity mechanisms of boron as presented in section 3 1 therefore we suggest that the change in boron toxicity depending on the presence of edta was caused by the absorption of micronutrients such as zn mn and fe this study had some limitations we confirmed the species distribution of the metals in the tap medium using visual minteq however we did not measure the concentrations of the metals absorbed by the algae compared with that in previous studies the growth inhibition observed in this study appears to be due to changes in the concentration of metals absorbed by the algae therefore the concentrations of the metals absorbed by algae should be investigated in future studies together with this accurate mechanisms to describe the changes in the metal absorbance of the algae need to be elucidated in future studies nevertheless this study explored the changes in the toxicity of metals in the presence of edta and attempted to identify the causes of these changes therefore we believe that the results of this study could provide foundational information for future studies into metal toxicity to algae 4 conclusion in this study we assessed boron toxicity using three species of green algae and examined the effects of edta our results confirmed that the toxicity of boron increased when edta was present the toxicity mechanisms of boron are known to involve the inhibition of micronutrient absorption and it has been confirmed that edta enhances this inhibition we found that edta binds to metal ions such as zn mn and fe in the medium rather than to boron could enhance the toxicity of boron by reducing available micronutrients in the medium for the algae zn mn and fe are associated with enzyme activity related to growth photosynthesis and defense mechanisms therefore the lack of bioavailable metal ions would hinder the activities of the relevant enzymes thereby preventing the activation of defense mechanisms against boron the findings indicate that the harmful effects of boron in the presence of edta differ from those of metals as far as we know this is the first investigation of algal toxicity caused by boron in the presence and absence of edta our results are significant because the toxicity of a substance containing edta may be affected by the competition between the substance and metal ions for chelation by edta declaration of competing interest the

12476,wetlands are an economically viable alternative for decentralized wastewater treatment plasterboard sheets ps are commonly used in civil construction however the waste generated could be an environmental concern thus fragments of plasterboard sheets and modified ps were used as substrates in two sequencing batch vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcw of 28 l of the working volume to evaluate the carbonaceous nitrogenous and phosphorous matter removal from synthetic wastewater combining sewage treatment and reuse of civil construction waste the systems planted with eichhornia crassipes were named cw p 11 36 kg of ps fragments and 30 porosity and cw mp 9 34 kg of modified ps fragments and 35 porosity the systems were evaluated under two different sampling conditions after 24 h phase i and 48 h phase ii for 308 days the ps was characterized using sem sed and xrf analyses and the bacterial community in the biofilm was evaluated in the systems cw mp achieved the highest cod removals 65 and 70 in both phases the results for tn and tan were similar with cw p achieving higher efficiency in phase i in phase ii there was no significant difference between cw p and cw mp regarding total phosphorus removal cw p was slightly better than c mp with removal efficiencies of 64 in phase i and 54 in phase ii for both systems the proposed systems could remove organic matter and phosphorus through different processes such as adsorption on the substrate precipitation plant uptake and as a source of carbon and nutrients for microorganisms graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords civil construction waste reuse adsorption plant uptake phytoremediation data availability all data are included in the manuscript 1 introduction several design configurations of constructed wetlands cw have been successfully applied in treating different wastewater such as domestic industrial stormwater runoff and agricultural presenting low operational cost and energy consumption 1 2 each configuration was subjected to different hydraulic and operational conditions presenting different pollutant removal mechanisms 3 4 vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcw are often applied in wastewater treatment due to their reliability in removing organic matter nitrogen and suspended solids through the simultaneous presence of macrophytes uptake translocation sequestration and degradation of pollutants 5 microorganisms transformation and degradation processes biosorption bioaccumulation and speciation transformation 6 and substrate filtration and interception adsorption ion exchange biofilm fixation plant support complexation and precipitation 4 7 in these systems the oxygen transfer is supplied mainly by diffusion and convection 8 influenced by water regime and substrate depth regarding substrate applying inert and conventional materials unpolluted soil gravel and sand has been widely studied in cw however clogging and their low adsorption capacity reduce the treatment efficiency 9 thus research focusing on alternative materials to improve the treatment efficiency has increased 10 11 recently emergent materials have been studied as substrates since they present a high affinity for phosphorus due to their surface rich al si ca fe and mg among these low cost materials some examples include clay bricks 12 mixture of light expanded clay aggregates leca and porcelain 10 civil construction waste 13 oyster shell 14 and bricks 15 considering construction waste plasterboard sheets ps are commonly used for cladding internal walls and ceilings fire protection thermal efficiency and acoustic insulation in construction in 2020 the consumption of plasterboard sheets increased by about 25 compared to 2019 with a growth trend in the following years brazil consumed approximately 73 million m2 of gypsum board sheets in 2019 representing an increase of 17 million m2 compared to 2015 16 17 the production of calcium sulfate dihydrate popularly known as gypsum is estimated to be 5 1 million tons used for civil construction 52 cementitious industry 37 agriculture 9 and other purposes 2 in brazil regarding civil construction gypsum waste is generated from cladding 88 plasterboard sheets 8 and precast components 4 resulting in 1 316 million tons of waste 18 therefore the waste of plasterboard in construction should be a concern since there are few alternatives for its reuse and there are severe problems of irregular waste disposal in the least developed and developing countries the low acquisition cost is one of the main advantages of using this waste since it is valueless to the industry but entails landfill costs besides the availability as construction waste the selection of this material in our study was based on its chemical composition including sulfur trioxide and calcium oxide and lower quantities of phosphorus pentoxide iron iii oxide silicon dioxide and oxides of aluminum and strontium 19 20 that favors adsorption onto the substrates the high content of calcium in gypsum could favor phosphate adsorption in aqueous solutions through ca2 liberation and phosphate precipitation in a short period 21 in addition calcium stimulates ammonia uptake and improves nitrogen uptake by the roots of young plants 22 the presence of exchangeable ions ca2 mg2 na al3 h k cl so3 and po4 3 in the gypsum surface enhances the sorption capacity through pore filling ion exchange mechanism and precipitation 23 there are no studies in literature using calcium sulfate dihydrate gypsum or fragments of plasterboard sheets as substrates in cw emphasizing the novel aspect of our study however these wastes should be used directly from cutting and losses in the construction building and industry to avoid contaminants dissolution into cw gypsum neutralizes aluminum provides calcium and sulfur to the soil reduces ammonia losses during the composting and neutralizes saline and sodic soils 24 increasing hydraulic conductivity and promoting plant growth 25 these characteristics could be beneficial in planted cw systems thus this innovative application in vertical constructed wetlands vcw planted with eichhonia crassipes aimed to enhance the removal of organic matter and nutrients from synthetic sewage additionally the structure of microbial community was assessed by relating the removal of contaminants to physical chemical or biological processes 2 material and methods 2 1 vertical flow constructed wetlands two rectangular constructed wetlands vfcw were constructed in polypropylene

coverage eichhornia crassipes water hyacinth is a native abundant fast growing specie 26 quickly adapted to climate conditions that present phytoremediation potential 27 and is capable of removing micropollutants 12 and nutrients 28 however there are still few studies regarding using this free floating specie fixed in filtering media of cw as evaluated in this study these microcosm scale systems were nominated as cw p 11 36 kg of fragments of ps porosity of 30 and cw mp 9 34 kg of modified fragments of ps porosity of 35 for cw mp the fragments of plasterboard sheets were immersed in tap water for 4 days to remove the layers of paper covering the gypsum panel of the plasterboard the material was dried at 100 c for 3 h in an oven biopar s150sa for subsequent application in the cw

in the effluent samples from 15 9 to 21 7 c in cw p and 16 2 to 22 0 c in cw mp in phase i and from 16 8 to 22 4 c in cw p and 17 1 to 22 7 c in cw mp in phase ii table 1 with no significant differences p value 0 4268 for cw p and p value 0 5128 for cw mp under these operational conditions in addition temperature ranged in influent samples from 16 20 to 22 5 c in phase i and 17 2 to 23 3 c in phase ii with no significant differences p value 0 6355 for phase i and p value 0 5296 for phase ii during the entire operation in this study the mean temperature verified was 19 5 c i e closer to 20 0 c favoring ammonia and nitrite oxidizing microorganisms 45 and higher than 15 0 c that promotes contaminants removal 46 these values may inhibit or limit biological treatment and denitrification according to kadlec wallace 47 metcalf eddy 48 and sezerino et al 49 that indicated the range of 25 to 35 c substrates and operation cycles probably influenced ph since significant differences p value 0 05 were observed between the values of influent and effluent samples the values varied from 6 98 to 7 72 in phase i and 7 21 to 7 83 in phase ii in influent samples in effluent samples ph ranged from 6 30 to 6 89 in cw p and 6 47 to 7 07 in cw mp in phase i in phase ii ph varied from 6 66 to 7 14 in cw p and 6 92 to 7 21 in cw mp table 1 in this study ph did not influence the growth and development of e crassipes because ammonia is probably in ionic form nh4 since ph values were lower than 8 0 50 in addition nitrification is limited at ph below 7 5 and ammonia volatilization is enhanced above 8 5 thus nitrification was probably limited during the operation since the highest ph value 7 21 in cw mp in phase ii was lower than the range 7 5 8 6 indicated for this process by iwa 51 and vymazal 52 moreover nitrification was probably more limited in cw p with lower ph values the mean total alkalinity was 101 and 84 gcaco3 l 1 in phase i and 102 and 109 gcaco3 l 1 in phase ii for cw p and cw mp respectively differing p value 0 05 from the influent 66 gcaco3 l 1 for both phases in all systems table 1 regarding the effluent samples the contact time cycles influenced the total alkalinity for cw p p value 0 05 under these operational conditions conversely the contact time did not affect ta values for cw mp p value 0 7995 younger et al 53 and kadlec wallace 47 stated that heterotrophic microorganisms that produce alkalinity and do not use dissolved oxygen are predominant in saturated constructed wetlands the alkalinity production could indicate lower nitrifying conditions since ammonia oxidation 1 g consumes alkalinity 7 1 gcaco3 thus the alkalinity production could inhibit or deficiency the nitrification process thus alkalinity generation could inhibit or deficiency the nitrification process the dissolved oxygen do ranged from 0 50 to 1 50 mg l 1 in cw p and 0 34 to 1 60 mg l 1 in cw mp in phase i and from 0 61 to 1 32 mg l 1 in cw p and 0 48 to 1 33 mg l 1 in cw mp in phase ii table 1 indicating anoxic conditions during the operation od 2 0 mg l 1 according to metcalf eddy 48 neither the contact time nor the material influenced do concentration for both systems under these operational conditions p value 0 05 regarding oxidation reduction potential orp the values varied from 25 to 47 mv in phase i and 40 to 100 mv in phase ii in influent samples regarding the effluent samples orp varied from 75 to 30 mv in cw p and 64 to 3 mv in cw mp operated with 24 h cycle phase i and from 100 to 90 mv in cw p and 44 to 86 mv in cw mp operated with 48 h cycle phase ii in effluent samples table 1 the values indicated the anoxic environment in these systems according to matos et al 54 who consider the range of 100 to 100 mv by comparing the materials no significant differences were observed between the orp values for the systems operated under the same operational condition p value 0 05 however the contact time influenced orp in the effluent samples of cw mp in cycles of 24 h and 48 h p value 0 0244 3 2 1 chemical oxygen demand fig 3 shows cod variation in samples of the influent and effluent of the systems cod varied from 117 0 to 207 0 mg l 1 in the influent samples indicating weak synthetic wastewater cod 339 mg l 1 according to the classification of metcalf eddy 48 although cw mp achieved higher cod removal efficiencies 65 and 70 in phases i and ii compared to cw p 51 and 60 no significant differences p value 0 05 n 32 were verified neither between the substrates of the sequencing batch mode systems nor between the cycles of operation indicating that these factors did not affect cod removal under these operational conditions additionally the mean remaining cod resulted lower with 54 mg l 1 in cw mp in phase i and 45 mg l 1 in phase ii similar cod removal efficiencies were noted in vertical flow cw operated in batch mode treating weak synthetic wastewater by mateus pinho 13 who obtained 70 influent cod of 258 mg l 1 in a system planted with phragmites australis onto limestone waste and clay brick fragments operated with cycle of 36 h in addition lima et al 12 achieved 55 with leca and 73 influent cod 203 mg l 1 with clay bricks in systems vegetated with eichhornia crassipes 25 plants m 2 and operated with cycles of 48 h and marcelino et al 10 who achieved 67 75 and 68 in vfcw vegetated with pistia stratiotes onto bricks light expanded clay aggregates leca and mixture of leca and porcelain respectively treating influent cod from 63 8 to 125 mg l 1 in this study cw p and cw mp presented slightly better cod removal efficiencies when operated with cycles of 48 h additionally the novel material plasterboard sheet fragments showed higher or similar potential for removing cod compared to the results verified using conventional materials as substrate in vfcw treating different wastewater nema et al 55 obtained 40 and 62 in cw 30 l vegetated with typha latifolia and phragmites australis onto gravel and operated with cycles of 24 h treating grey wastewater influent cod of 215 87 mg l 1 respectively zhou et al 56 noted 63 influent cod of 207 mg l 1 in vfcw 60 l planted with oenanthe javanica onto sand and gravel du et al 57 observed ranges of 41 2 to 83 2 70 7 to 87 6 and 66 0 to 81 4 in vfcw 240 l vegetated with hibiscus mutabilis linn a combination of acorus calamus l and typha orientalis presl and nerium indicum mill respectively onto limestone and cobblestone treating domestic wastewater with influent cod from 142 to 225 mg l 1 at hydraulic retention time hrt of 48 h mello et al 28 observed 58 73 and 67 in a vfcw vegetated with e crassipes onto sand and gravel under hrt of 24 48 and 72 h respectively treating low strength sewage influent cod of 198 23 to 328 76 mg l 1 a decrease in the applied organic loading rates olr was verified from 3 29 and 2 36 g m 2 d 1 for cw p and cw mp in phase i cycles of 24 h to 1 17 and 0 89 g m 2 d 1 was noted in phase ii cycles of 48 h respectively corresponding to removals of 3 46 and 4 39 g m 2 d 1 in phase i and 1 76 and 2 04 g m 2 d 1 in phase ii table 1 vegetation also supplies do by the rhizosphere to the support medium helping in the aerobic degradation of carbon however the influence of vegetation on cod removal was not verified since microbial activity is considered the main mechanism for removing organic matter 12 28 influenced by carbon source dissolved oxygen retention time loading rate and temperature 56 3 2 2 nitrogen fig 4 shows the results of tn of cw p and cw mp in the influent and effluent samples significant differences p value 0 05 n 32 between the influent and effluent samples were observed for both phases for tn in the effluent samples tn varied from 28 to 41 mg l 1 during the operation resulting in efficiencies of 46 and 37 in cw p and cw mp in phase i and 30 and 34 in phase ii respectively table 1 the use of plasterboard sheet fragments was more efficient than the modified plasterboard sheet fragments in the removal of tn since significant differences p value 0 0003 were observed between cw p and cw mp in phase i conversely in phase ii there was no influence of the material in the removal of this parameter probably due to the period of operation the similar behavior of the systems during the operation in this phase was probably due to the detachment of the paperboard from the plasterboard resulting from the continuous contact with the effluent as previously seen in fig 2b regarding the cycle of operation significant differences were noted for cw p p value 0 0002 between phases i and ii resulting in higher removal efficiencies for 24 h phase i however similarity was observed for cw mp p value 0 05 between phases i and ii the viability of removing tn could be verified by comparing the results obtained to plasterboard sheets fragments to conventional materials since similar results were achieved in the treatment of sanitary wastewater by pelissari et al 58 who noted removal of 58 in a system vegetated with cyperus papyrus onto gravel and sand with concentration of 50 mg l 1 santos et al 59 who attributed removal of 45 to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in a system 57 l typha domingensis onto sand treating concentration of 80 4 mg l 1 and du et al 57 who noted removals of 39 to 58 4 34 to 48 and 32 to 38 in vfcw 240 l planted with acorus calamus l and typha orientalis presl hibiscus mutabilis linn and nerium indicum mill onto limestone and cobblestone with concentration varying from 16 3 to 55 4 mg l 1 at hrt of 48 h despite the diversity of configurations and operational conditions of constructed wetlands the systems filled with fragments of plasterboard sheets achieved removal efficiencies similar to studies regarding conventional materials in the literature for example mateus pinho 13 verified the removal of 44 in a vfcw with phragmites australis onto limestone fragments treating synthetic urban type wastewater with 18 1 mg l 1 and roth et al 60 achieved removal of 62 in a vertical subsuperficial tfcw planted with althernanthera philoxeroids onto clay bricks treating wastewater 40 mg l 1 during 48 h the organic loading rates olr applied decreased from 0 83 and 0 97 g m 2 d 1 for cw p and cw mp in phase i cycles of 24 h to 0 49 and 0 46 g m 2 d 1 for the systems operated in phase ii cycles of 48 h respectively corresponding to removals of 0 71 and 0 57 g m 2 d 1 in phase i and 0 21 and 0 24 g m 2 d 1 in phase ii regarding tan cw p and cw mp achieved mean removal efficiencies of 41 and 19 in phase i with influent concentration varying from 13 to 18 mg l 1 respectively however lower removal efficiencies were verified in phase ii with 7 for cw p and 10 for cw mp table 2 fig 5 cw p differed significantly p value 0 0003 n 32 from cw mp in phase i indicating that the use of fragments of ps was more efficient than modified ps in removing tan however similarity was verified between cw p and cw mp p value 0 0256 in phase ii regarding the cycle of operation higher removals were achieved for both systems in phase i with significant differences between cw p p value 0 0004 and cw mp p value 0 0179 similar removal efficiencies of tan were achieved by minakshi et al 61 of 43 1 and 49 4 in vfcw systems planted with canna indica onto sand and gravel 10 mm respectively in the treatment of dairy wastewater with 48 0 mg l 1 operated at hrt of 24 h however our results disagree with previous studies reported in the literature when increasing the cycle of operation to 48 h such as minakshi et al 61 who verified removal efficiencies of 56 5 49 4 and 43 8 when vfcw systems were operated at hrt of 48 h tan removal decreased approximately 34 in cw p between phases probably due to the material expansion during the operation absorption of sewage by the material diminishing the useful volume from 8 l to 7 l and the oxygen transfer by the void pore filling biofilm assimilation adsorption and plant absorption probably contributed to nitrogen removal in the studied systems as previously verified by saeed sun 62 however mello et al 28 and lima et al 12 observed that e crassipes did not influence in nitrogen removal in subsurface vfcw treating low strengh sewage 34 to 69 mg l 1 evaporation and evapotranspiration were not determined in this study otherwise nitrite and nitrate concentrations were lower in the systems than the detection limits loq of 0 015 and 5 mg l 1 respectively indicating that ammonia could not be completely oxidized and justifying the lower removal efficiencies in phase ii similarly lima et al 12 noted removal of 13 in a vfcw with e crassipes onto clay bricks in the treatment of synthetic wastewater with 40 mg l 1 and operated with cycles of 48 h these authors saeed sun 62 and du et al 63 attributed the ammonia production in vfcw systems filled with gravel 17 9 and light expanded clay aggregates 32 to the low concentrations of do 1 50 mg l 1 that may limit ammonia oxidation and complete nitrification in the present study do concentrations remained lower than 1 60 mg l 1 during the operation of cw p and cw mp i e lower than the concentration required for nitrification suggesting the predominance of anoxic conditions 3 2 3 total phosphorus regarding influent samples phosphorus concentration ranged from 11 0 to 15 0 mg l 1 in phase i and from 12 to 13 0 mg l 1 in phase ii fig 6 classifying the synthetic wastewater as strength 11 mg l 1 in accordance with metcalf eddy 48 cw p and cw mp achieved mean removal efficiencies of 64 and 62 in phase i and 54 for both systems in phase ii respectively table 1 although no significant differences p value 0 05 n 32 were obtained neither between the substrates nor between the cycles of operation under these operational conditions cw p and cw mp presented slightly better tp removal in phase i higher results were achieved compared to those achieved by marcelino et al 10 10 12 l of 35 41 and 46 influent pt from 9 80 mg l 1 in vfcw with p stratiotes onto bricks leca and a mixture of leca and porcelain respectively operated with cycles of 12 h additionally mateus pinho 13 verified a removal efficiency of 65 influent tp of 2 24 mg l 1 in a vfcw planted with phragmites australis onto limestone waste and clay bricks and operated with cycles of 36 h and lima et al 12 noted removals of 82 and 87 influent tp of 18 9 mg l 1 in vfcw with eichhornia crassipes onto clay bricks and leca respectively operated with cycles of 48 h the potential of plasterboard sheet fragments to remove tp could be verified by comparing the results to systems filled with conventional materials such as sand and gravel by mello et al 28 who verified removals of 20 16 and 29 in a vfcw 100 l planted with e crassipes and operated at hrt of 24 48 and 72 h respectively treating sewage influent tp of 10 2 to 18 60 mg l 1 zhou et al 64 who achieved removal efficiency of 72 77 influent tp of 10 mg l 1 in vfcw 5 5 l vegetated with oenanthe javanica treating wastewater and operated with hrt of 72 h and minakshi et al 61 who noted removal efficiencies of 46 1 17 3 and 44 4 in a vfcw 67 5 l filled with sand gravel 10 mm and gravel 20 mm respectively vegetated with canna indica treating dairy wastewater influent tp of 41 0 mg l 1 under cycles of 48 h batch mode regarding clay based materials shi et al 65 obtained removal of 64 in a vfcw 27 l planted with iris pseudoacorus onto red brick in the treatment of synthetic domestic wastewater with 8 1 mg l 1 under hrt of 72 h du et al 57 verified mean removal efficiencies of 65 to 71 3 42 to 86 and 46 to 71 in vfcw 240 l planted with acorus calamus l and typha orientalis presl hibiscus mutabilis linn and nerium indicum mill onto limestone and cobblestone treating domestic wastewater with tp varying from 1 9 to 7 2 mg l 1 at hrt of 48 h additionally garcia ávila et al 66 achieved removal efficiencies of 49 in vfcw 60 l planted with phragmites australis acutangula and cyperus papyrus onto silicon sand treating wastewater with influent tp of 8 91 mg l 1 and operated at hrt of 27 h phosphorus transformation or removal generally occurs via soil accumulation and plant tissue plant and microorganism uptake dissolution and precipitation adsorption and desorption mineralization fragmentation and leaching in constructed wetlands 52 67 additionally vymazal et al 1 stated that the removal of phosphorus is directly associated with the nature and physical chemical characteristics of the support media in this context shen et al 2022 68 reported that alkaline conditions favor the generation of mgp and cap bonds while acid conditions enhance the formation of alp an fep bonds according to cabral et al 69 and han et al 70 materials rich in fe al ca and mg oxides assist phosphorus precipitation and adsorption in this study the most detected elements in sed analyses were o 51 07 ca 20 27 s 14 65 c 12 59 si 0 87 al 0 39 and k 0 16 to plasterboard sheet fragments according to qin et al 44 phosphorus adsorption could occur mainly by precipitation of aluminum and iron phosphates precipitation or adsorption in hydroxides and al and fe oxides due to the formation of calcium phosphates in the presence of ca in this study xrf analysis detected calcium oxide cao 61 42 sulfur trioxide so3 32 02 phosphorus pentoxide p2o5 4 07 iron iii oxide fe2o3 1 31 silicon oxide sio2 0 98 aluminum oxide al2o3 0 12 and strontium oxide sro 0 08 in plasterboard sheet fragments the organic loading rates olr applied decreased from 0 20 and 0 21 g m 2 d 1 in phase i cycles of 24 h to 0 11 and 0 11 g m 2 d 1 in phase ii cycles of 48 h for cw p and cw mp respectively corresponding to removals of 0 34 and 0 33 g m 2 d 1 in phase i and 0 13 and 0 13 g m 2 d 1 3 3 nutrients in macrophytes and support media after the 308th of operation the number of individuals increased 100 in cw p and cw mp with 54 plants m 2 in both systems demonstrating the adaptability of the floating macrophyte e crassipes onto the support media investigated in this study therefore this species could be used in surface flow and subsurface flow cw as stated by lima et al 12 and mello et al 28 the total dry biomasses of 33 67 g for cw p and 36 86 g for cw mp were obtained at the end of the operation including roots stems and leaves additionally tn and tp were quantified in the dry biomass of macrophyte at the end of operation table 2 most of the total nitrogen masses were stored in roots and stems and the total phosphorus masses in the stems in both systems table 2 the average sizes of the roots leaves and stems increased from 0 090 0 035 and 0 045 m before to 0 13 0 12 and 0 21 m in cw p and 0 15 0 12 and 0 24 m in cw mp after respectively the smaller size of the roots of e crassipes compared to other species could assist in the removal of the entire plant from the cw minimizing damage to substrate and biofilm 12 according to brix 71 vymazal 72 and kadlec wallace 47 pruning is done in the aerial part due to the ramification and fixation of species such as phragmites australis and typha spp onto substrates increasing vegetal absorption and nutrient release to the liquid phase from root decomposition in the dry biomass concentrations of tn and tp were similar resulting in 27 01 mg g 1 in cw p and 28 47 mg g 1 in cw mp for tn and 72 33 mg g 1 in cw p and 72 03 mg g 1 in cw mp for tp lima et al 12 obtained tn and tp of 55 00 and 20 40 mg g 1 in cwg p gravel 55 97 and 20 55 mg g 1 in cw p light expanded clay aggregates and 55 21 and 4 39 mg g 1 in cwb p clay bricks in the dry biomass of e crassipes with initial concentrations of 69 0 mgtn l 1 and 19 0 mgtp l 1 respectively in vfcw in this study e crassipes could uptake 5 38 and 19 72 g in cw p and 6 78 and 23 12 g in cw mp of tn and tp at the end of operation respectively before the operation tp concentration was 12 39 mg g 1 in the substrate totalizing 140 70 g in each cw plasterboard sheet fragments demonstrated the adsorptive potential related mainly to the high cation exchange capacity of gypsum 19 39 as abovementioned in item 3 1 on the 308th day the mass recovered was 1 40 mg g 1 for cw p and 1 54 mg g 1 for cw mp 3 3 1 mass balance during the experiment tn and tp balances were quantified in the cw following the adapted methodology of wu et al 73 considering plant uptake support media storage effluent and other losses table 3 tn quantification was 852 50 mg m 2 d 1 in the influent and 463 32 and 509 65 mg m 2 d 1 in the effluent representing overall removal of 54 35 in cw p and 59 78 in cw mp during the operation of cw nitrogen plant uptake was 7 10 and 8 19 mg m 2 d 1 representing 0 83 in cw p and 0 96 in cw mp the accumulation onto substrate and absorption resulted in 3 38 and 1 33 mg m 2 d 1 indicating contributions of 0 40 in cw p and 0 16 in cw mp respectively marcelino et al 10 observed accumulation of tn of 0 52 0 58 and 0 39 in vfcw planted with pistia stratiotes onto leca mixture of leca and porcelain and bricks respectively with 2432 91 mg m 2 d 1 of tn initial other processes that could be related to microbial activities were responsible for the major contribution to tn removal with 378 71 and 333 34 mg m 2 d 1 representing 44 42 in cw p and 39 10 in cw mp therefore accumulation onto substrate and plant uptake had less influence on the tn overall removal the quantification of tp during the operation was 333 59 mg m 2 d 1 in the influent and 129 73 and 148 26 mg m 2 d 1 in the effluent that is 38 89 in cw p and 44 44 in cw mp similarly plant uptake represented the least preferable removal pathway with 33 63 and 28 75 mg m 2 d 1 corresponding to 10 08 in cw p and 8 62 in cw mp of tp overall removal baldovi et al 74 noted plant uptake ranging from 14 5 to 29 1 from the overall removal evaluating different hrt the adsorption and accumulation onto substrate resulted in 3 23 and 3 52 mg m 2 d 1 representing contributions of 0 97 in cw mp and 1 06 in cw p respectively other removal pathways represented 49 98 in cw p and 45 97 in cw mp of the overall removal represented 166 71 and 153 34 mg m 2 d 1 therefore nitrogen is transformed and removed through biofilm assimilation via microorganisms with lesser contribution of plant plant uptake and adsorption onto the materials evaluated in this study the physical chemical characteristics of the materials directly influence the removal of phosphorus via adsorption and desorption and probable precipitation of the formed aggregates as previously mentioned in items 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 however there are no studies in literature regarding the application of calcium sulfate dihydrate gypsum nor fragments of plasterboard sheets as support media in constructed wetlands limiting the comparison with mass balance results a stable performance in the total phosphorus removal throughout the operational period of cw p and cw mp is shown in fig s1 supplementary material average phosphorus removal efficiencies of 64 in cw p and 62 in cw mp were achieved in phase i and 54 for both systems in phase ii during the operation no desorption was noted probably by the strong binding of phosphorus to the substrate additionally no saturation of the substrates was noted at the end of the operation thus further studies are necessary to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity of these wastes as substrates in cw 3 4 microbial community diversity and structure the microbial diversity was assessed indicating a good sampling from the asymptotic curves generated in the rarefaction curve analysis the number of effective sequences was 33 278 from cw p and 44 260 from cw mp alpha diversity was calculated using simpson s index indicating greater bacterial diversity in cw p system 0 9234 than in cw mp 0 8329 although the samples from cw mp system presented the highest number of sequences no greater diversity was observed therefore modifications in the substrate such as paper removal treatment affected the alpha diversity index cw p system presented a more diverse microbial community at the phylum level proteobacteria and firmicutes were dominant in both systems with 79 of relative abundance ra for cw p and 95 for cw mp for the sum of both fig 7 the relative abundance found for cw p and cw mp was 45 73 and 50 99 of firmicutes followed by 33 14 and 43 83 of proteobacteria respectively shen et al 68 obtained similar results in floating treatment wetlands ftw 180 l with vetiver and aerated concrete block proteobacteria and firmicutes phyla add high levels of bacterial metabolic diversity and are crucial to denitrification 75 bacteria pertaining to the proteobacteria phylum are responsible for acting in carbon nitrogen sulfur and phosphorus cycles these microorganisms have great metabolic and morphological capacity including aerobic anaerobic and facultative organisms 76 furthermore they include bacteria involved in various stages of nitrogen removal such as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob as well as bacteria responsible for carbon removal in cw systems under various c n ratios 15 77 78 the phyla campylobacterota 8 53 actinobacteriota 3 97 gemmatimonadota 3 04 desulfobacterota 2 96 and bacteroidota 2 62 were identified for cw p while chloroflexi 3 34 actinobacteriota 0 84 and acidobacteriota 0 73 for cw mp the phyla proteobacteria firmicutes chloroflexi and bacteroidota are commonly verified in cw 76 79 82 at the gender level there is an evident difference between the systems showing a predominance of bacillus and pseudomonas in cw mp sum of 53 with 50 of the population composed of only two genders fig 8 conversely these genera were not identified in cw p with better species distribution therefore the existing conditions in the cw mp system were more favorable to the development and predominance of bacillus and pseudomonas in cw p system the genera lactobacillus staphylococcus streptococcus and parvimonas firmicutes phylum representing 14 30 13 28 6 26 and 6 20 respectively were identified in addition the genera phyllobacterium 10 13 and pantoea 6 16 proteobacteria phylum were identified sulfurimonas 8 53 bacteria related to sulfur oxidation campylobacterota phylum were identified in cw p system 6 83 according to hu et al 83 this sulfur oxidizing denitrifier bacterium participates in the sulfur and nitrogen cycles performing complete denitrification based on the sed analysis this could explain the sulfur reduction from 14 65 to 10 04 in the material composition after the treatments however the sulfur percentage increased from 13 05 to 18 85 in cw mp system in which sulfurimonas was not found the genera bacillus and streptococcus firmicutes phylum were identified in cw mp with relative abundances of 30 95 and 7 98 respectively denitrifying bacteria of the bacillus genus tend to grow under anoxic conditions 84 the systems were operated under anoxic conditions in phases i and ii considering the values obtained for do and orp pseudomonas pantoea and achromobacter proteobacteria phylum were also identified in cw mp representing 22 38 7 49 and 5 57 respectively pseudomonas are involved in different metabolic processes improving denitrification and assimilating phosphorus 77 85 according to shen et al 68 pseudomonas might be related to phosphorus mineralization in ftw however nitrogen and phosphorus removal cannot be attributed to pseudomonas in cw mp since this specie was not found in cw p besides the removal of nutrients was similar between the systems despite the significant phosphorus removal candidatus accumulibacter the main genus related to this process 77 was not identified in the systems the unfavorable environment for nitrification confirmed by the absence of nitrifying genera nitrospira nitrosospira nitrosomonas explains the low ammonia removal efficiency in phase ii 7 for cw p and 10 for cw mp both systems have denitrifying bacteria indicating that the conditions found in the medium favor the presence of these microorganisms although the occurrence of denitrification was not observed the presence of bacteria demonstrates the potential of the system to carry out such a process 4 conclusions plasterboard sheet fragments ps and modified plasterboard sheet fragments mp showed chemical and textural composition favorable for removing nutrients the results indicated phosphorus adsorption onto the substrates the chemical composition showed high o ca s and c values besides presenting exchangeable ions on its surface which increases its capacity for sorption processes ion exchange and precipitation regarding the parameters cod and pt no significant differences were verified when evaluating the support medium and the operated phases however cw mp achieved the highest cod removal of 65 in phase i and 70 in phase ii cw p and cw mp showed similar phosphorus removal efficiencies in both phases in phase i the removal was higher with an increase of 8 to 10 in the average removal efficiency for cw mp and cw p respectively the best removal efficiencies for tn and tan were achieved by cw p in phase i cw p and cw mp showed similar removal for tn and tan in phase ii suggesting a gradual removal of the paperboard from cw p during the operation and leading to more similar behavior between the systems despite the differences in the structure of the microbial community the removal efficiencies of organic matter and nutrients were highly similar with no statistically significant difference between the results from phase ii credit authorship contribution statement adelania de oliveira souza investigation writing original draft

12476,wetlands are an economically viable alternative for decentralized wastewater treatment plasterboard sheets ps are commonly used in civil construction however the waste generated could be an environmental concern thus fragments of plasterboard sheets and modified ps were used as substrates in two sequencing batch vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcw of 28 l of the working volume to evaluate the carbonaceous nitrogenous and phosphorous matter removal from synthetic wastewater combining sewage treatment and reuse of civil construction waste the systems planted with eichhornia crassipes were named cw p 11 36 kg of ps fragments and 30 porosity and cw mp 9 34 kg of modified ps fragments and 35 porosity the systems were evaluated under two different sampling conditions after 24 h phase i and 48 h phase ii for 308 days the ps was characterized using sem sed and xrf analyses and the bacterial community in the biofilm was evaluated in the systems cw mp achieved the highest cod removals 65 and 70 in both phases the results for tn and tan were similar with cw p achieving higher efficiency in phase i in phase ii there was no significant difference between cw p and cw mp regarding total phosphorus removal cw p was slightly better than c mp with removal efficiencies of 64 in phase i and 54 in phase ii for both systems the proposed systems could remove organic matter and phosphorus through different processes such as adsorption on the substrate precipitation plant uptake and as a source of carbon and nutrients for microorganisms graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords civil construction waste reuse adsorption plant uptake phytoremediation data availability all data are included in the manuscript 1 introduction several design configurations of constructed wetlands cw have been successfully applied in treating different wastewater such as domestic industrial stormwater runoff and agricultural presenting low operational cost and energy consumption 1 2 each configuration was subjected to different hydraulic and operational conditions presenting different pollutant removal mechanisms 3 4 vertical flow constructed wetlands vfcw are often applied in wastewater treatment due to their reliability in removing organic matter nitrogen and suspended solids through the simultaneous presence of macrophytes uptake translocation sequestration and degradation of pollutants 5 microorganisms transformation and degradation processes biosorption bioaccumulation and speciation transformation 6 and substrate filtration and interception adsorption ion exchange biofilm fixation plant support complexation and precipitation 4 7 in these systems the oxygen transfer is supplied mainly by diffusion and convection 8 influenced by water regime and substrate depth regarding substrate applying inert and conventional materials unpolluted soil gravel and sand has been widely studied in cw however clogging and their low adsorption capacity reduce the treatment efficiency 9 thus research focusing on alternative materials to improve the treatment efficiency has increased 10 11 recently emergent materials have been studied as substrates since they present a high affinity for phosphorus due to their surface rich al si ca fe and mg among these low cost materials some examples include clay bricks 12 mixture of light expanded clay aggregates leca and porcelain 10 civil construction waste 13 oyster shell 14 and bricks 15 considering construction waste plasterboard sheets ps are commonly used for cladding internal walls and ceilings fire protection thermal efficiency and acoustic insulation in construction in 2020 the consumption of plasterboard sheets increased by about 25 compared to 2019 with a growth trend in the following years brazil consumed approximately 73 million m2 of gypsum board sheets in 2019 representing an increase of 17 million m2 compared to 2015 16 17 the production of calcium sulfate dihydrate popularly known as gypsum is estimated to be 5 1 million tons used for civil construction 52 cementitious industry 37 agriculture 9 and other purposes 2 in brazil regarding civil construction gypsum waste is generated from cladding 88 plasterboard sheets 8 and precast components 4 resulting in 1 316 million tons of waste 18 therefore the waste of plasterboard in construction should be a concern since there are few alternatives for its reuse and there are severe problems of irregular waste disposal in the least developed and developing countries the low acquisition cost is one of the main advantages of using this waste since it is valueless to the industry but entails landfill costs besides the availability as construction waste the selection of this material in our study was based on its chemical composition including sulfur trioxide and calcium oxide and lower quantities of phosphorus pentoxide iron iii oxide silicon dioxide and oxides of aluminum and strontium 19 20 that favors adsorption onto the substrates the high content of calcium in gypsum could favor phosphate adsorption in aqueous solutions through ca2 liberation and phosphate precipitation in a short period 21 in addition calcium stimulates ammonia uptake and improves nitrogen uptake by the roots of young plants 22 the presence of exchangeable ions ca2 mg2 na al3 h k cl so3 and po4 3 in the gypsum surface enhances the sorption capacity through pore filling ion exchange mechanism and precipitation 23 there are no studies in literature using calcium sulfate dihydrate gypsum or fragments of plasterboard sheets as substrates in cw emphasizing the novel aspect of our study however these wastes should be used directly from cutting and losses in the construction building and industry to avoid contaminants dissolution into cw gypsum neutralizes aluminum provides calcium and sulfur to the soil reduces ammonia losses during the composting and neutralizes saline and sodic soils 24 increasing hydraulic conductivity and promoting plant growth 25 these characteristics could be beneficial in planted cw systems thus this innovative application in vertical constructed wetlands vcw planted with eichhonia crassipes aimed to enhance the removal of organic matter and nutrients from synthetic sewage additionally the structure of microbial community was assessed by relating the removal of contaminants to physical chemical or biological processes 2 material and methods 2 1 vertical flow constructed wetlands two rectangular constructed wetlands vfcw were constructed in polypropylene containers with 0 51 m of length 0 36 m of width and 0 31 m of height totalizing 28 l of working volume and 0 18 m2 of surface area fig 1 plasterboard sheet fragments ps with 0 10 0 12 m of length and 0 07 0 10 m of width depth of 0 20 m d60 4 08 mm d10 0 11 mm uniformity coefficient u 37 09 were used as substrate in which eichhornia crassipes 25 plants m 2 of each cw was planted for vegetal coverage eichhornia crassipes water hyacinth is a native abundant fast growing specie 26 quickly adapted to climate conditions that present phytoremediation potential 27 and is capable of removing micropollutants 12 and nutrients 28 however there are still few studies regarding using this free floating specie fixed in filtering media of cw as evaluated in this study these microcosm scale systems were nominated as cw p 11 36 kg of fragments of ps porosity of 30 and cw mp 9 34 kg of modified fragments of ps porosity of 35 for cw mp the fragments of plasterboard sheets were immersed in tap water for 4 days to remove the layers of paper covering the gypsum panel of the plasterboard the material was dried at 100 c for 3 h in an oven biopar s150sa for subsequent application in the cw

stated that phosphate removal is related to precipitation or adsorption on fe and al oxides and hydroxides forming ca fe and al phosphates 3 2 performance evaluation of the systems temperature ranged in the effluent samples from 15 9 to 21 7 c in cw p and 16 2 to 22 0 c in cw mp in phase i and from 16 8 to 22 4 c in cw p and 17 1 to 22 7 c in cw mp in phase ii table 1 with no significant differences p value 0 4268 for cw p and p value 0 5128 for cw mp under these operational conditions in addition temperature ranged in influent samples from 16 20 to 22 5 c in phase i and 17 2 to 23 3 c in phase ii with no significant differences p value 0 6355 for phase i and p value 0 5296 for phase ii during the entire operation in this study the mean temperature verified was 19 5 c i e closer to 20 0 c favoring ammonia and nitrite oxidizing microorganisms 45 and higher than 15 0 c that promotes contaminants removal 46 these values may inhibit or limit biological treatment and denitrification according to kadlec wallace 47 metcalf eddy 48 and sezerino et al 49 that indicated the range of 25 to 35 c substrates and operation cycles probably influenced ph since significant differences p value 0 05 were observed between the values of influent and effluent samples the values varied from 6 98 to 7 72 in phase i and 7 21 to 7 83 in phase ii in influent samples in effluent samples ph ranged from 6 30 to 6 89 in cw p and 6 47 to 7 07 in cw mp in phase i in phase ii ph varied from 6 66 to 7 14 in cw p and 6 92 to 7 21 in cw mp table 1 in this study ph did not influence the growth and development of e crassipes because ammonia is probably in ionic form nh4 since ph values were lower than 8 0 50 in addition nitrification is limited at ph below 7 5 and ammonia volatilization is enhanced above 8 5 thus nitrification was probably limited during the operation since the highest ph value 7 21 in cw mp in phase ii was lower than the range 7 5 8 6 indicated for this process by iwa 51 and vymazal 52 moreover nitrification was probably more limited in cw p with lower ph values the mean total alkalinity was 101 and 84 gcaco3 l 1 in phase i and 102 and 109 gcaco3 l 1 in phase ii for cw p and cw mp respectively differing p value 0 05 from the influent 66 gcaco3 l 1 for both phases in all systems table 1 regarding the effluent samples the contact time cycles influenced the total alkalinity for cw p p value 0 05 under these operational conditions conversely the contact time did not affect ta values for cw mp p value 0 7995 younger et al 53 and kadlec wallace 47 stated that heterotrophic microorganisms that produce alkalinity and do not use dissolved oxygen are predominant in saturated constructed wetlands the alkalinity production could indicate lower nitrifying conditions since ammonia oxidation 1 g consumes alkalinity 7 1 gcaco3 thus the alkalinity production could inhibit or deficiency the nitrification process thus alkalinity generation could inhibit or deficiency the nitrification process the dissolved oxygen do ranged from 0 50 to 1 50 mg l 1 in cw p and 0 34 to 1 60 mg l 1 in cw mp in phase i and from 0 61 to 1 32 mg l 1 in cw p and 0 48 to 1 33 mg l 1 in cw mp in phase ii table 1 indicating anoxic conditions during the operation od 2 0 mg l 1 according to metcalf eddy 48 neither the contact time nor the material influenced do concentration for both systems under these operational conditions p value 0 05 regarding oxidation reduction potential orp the values varied from 25 to 47 mv in phase i and 40 to 100 mv in phase ii in influent samples regarding the effluent samples orp varied from 75 to 30 mv in cw p and 64 to 3 mv in cw mp operated with 24 h cycle phase i and from 100 to 90 mv in cw p and 44 to 86 mv in cw mp operated with 48 h cycle phase ii in effluent samples table 1 the values indicated the anoxic environment in these systems according to matos et al 54 who consider the range of 100 to 100 mv by comparing the materials no significant differences were observed between the orp values for the systems operated under the same operational condition p value 0 05 however the contact time influenced orp in the effluent samples of cw mp in cycles of 24 h and 48 h p value 0 0244 3 2 1 chemical oxygen demand fig 3 shows cod variation in samples of the influent and effluent of the systems cod varied from 117 0 to 207 0 mg l 1 in the influent samples indicating weak synthetic wastewater cod 339 mg l 1 according to the classification of metcalf eddy 48 although cw mp achieved higher cod removal efficiencies 65 and 70 in phases i and ii compared to cw p 51 and 60 no significant differences p value 0 05 n 32 were verified neither between the substrates of the sequencing batch mode systems nor between the cycles of operation indicating that these factors did not affect cod removal under these operational conditions additionally the mean remaining cod resulted lower with 54 mg l 1 in cw mp in phase i and 45 mg l 1 in phase ii similar cod removal efficiencies were noted in vertical flow cw operated in batch mode treating weak synthetic wastewater by mateus pinho 13 who obtained 70 influent cod of 258 mg l 1 in a system planted with phragmites australis onto limestone waste and clay brick fragments operated with cycle of 36 h in addition lima et al 12 achieved 55 with leca and 73 influent cod 203 mg l 1 with clay bricks in systems vegetated with eichhornia crassipes 25 plants m 2 and operated with cycles of 48 h and marcelino et al 10 who achieved 67 75 and 68 in vfcw vegetated with pistia stratiotes onto bricks light expanded clay aggregates leca and mixture of leca and porcelain respectively treating influent cod from 63 8 to 125 mg l 1 in this study cw p and cw mp presented slightly better cod removal efficiencies when operated with cycles of 48 h additionally the novel material plasterboard sheet fragments showed higher or similar potential for removing cod compared to the results verified using conventional materials as substrate in vfcw treating different wastewater nema et al 55 obtained 40 and 62 in cw 30 l vegetated with typha latifolia and phragmites australis onto gravel and operated with cycles of 24 h treating grey wastewater influent cod of 215 87 mg l 1 respectively zhou et al 56 noted 63 influent cod of 207 mg l 1 in vfcw 60 l planted with oenanthe javanica onto sand and gravel du et al 57 observed ranges of 41 2 to 83 2 70 7 to 87 6 and 66 0 to 81 4 in vfcw 240 l vegetated with hibiscus mutabilis linn a combination of acorus calamus l and typha orientalis presl and nerium indicum mill respectively onto limestone and cobblestone treating domestic wastewater with influent cod from 142 to 225 mg l 1 at hydraulic retention time hrt of 48 h mello et al 28 observed 58 73 and 67 in a vfcw vegetated with e crassipes onto sand and gravel under hrt of 24 48 and 72 h respectively treating low strength sewage influent cod of 198 23 to 328 76 mg l 1 a decrease in the applied organic loading rates olr was verified from 3 29 and 2 36 g m 2 d 1 for cw p and cw mp in phase i cycles of 24 h to 1 17 and 0 89 g m 2 d 1 was noted in phase ii cycles of 48 h respectively corresponding to removals of 3 46 and 4 39 g m 2 d 1 in phase i and 1 76 and 2 04 g m 2 d 1 in phase ii table 1 vegetation also supplies do by the rhizosphere to the support medium helping in the aerobic degradation of carbon however the influence of vegetation on cod removal was not verified since microbial activity is considered the main mechanism for removing organic matter 12 28 influenced by carbon source dissolved oxygen retention time loading rate and temperature 56 3 2 2 nitrogen fig 4 shows the results of tn of cw p and cw mp in the influent and effluent samples significant differences p value 0 05 n 32 between the influent and effluent samples were observed for both phases for tn in the effluent samples tn varied from 28 to 41 mg l 1 during the operation resulting in efficiencies of 46 and 37 in cw p and cw mp in phase i and 30 and 34 in phase ii respectively table 1 the use of plasterboard sheet fragments was more efficient than the modified plasterboard sheet fragments in the removal of tn since significant differences p value 0 0003 were observed between cw p and cw mp in phase i conversely in phase ii there was no influence of the material in the removal of this parameter probably due to the period of operation the similar behavior of the systems during the operation in this phase was probably due to the detachment of the paperboard from the plasterboard resulting from the continuous contact with the effluent as previously seen in fig 2b regarding the cycle of operation significant differences were noted for cw p p value 0 0002 between phases i and ii resulting in higher removal efficiencies for 24 h phase i however similarity was observed for cw mp p value 0 05 between phases i and ii the viability of removing tn could be verified by comparing the results obtained to plasterboard sheets fragments to conventional materials since similar results were achieved in the treatment of sanitary wastewater by pelissari et al 58 who noted removal of 58 in a system vegetated with cyperus papyrus onto gravel and sand with concentration of 50 mg l 1 santos et al 59 who attributed removal of 45 to simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in a system 57 l typha domingensis onto sand treating concentration of 80 4 mg l 1 and du et al 57 who noted removals of 39 to 58 4 34 to 48 and 32 to 38 in vfcw 240 l planted with acorus calamus l and typha orientalis presl hibiscus mutabilis linn and nerium indicum mill onto limestone and cobblestone with concentration varying from 16 3 to 55 4 mg l 1 at hrt of 48 h despite the diversity of configurations and operational conditions of constructed wetlands the systems filled with fragments of plasterboard sheets achieved removal efficiencies similar to studies regarding conventional materials in the literature for example mateus pinho 13 verified the removal of 44 in a vfcw with phragmites australis onto limestone fragments treating synthetic urban type wastewater with 18 1 mg l 1 and roth et al 60 achieved removal of 62 in a vertical subsuperficial tfcw planted with althernanthera philoxeroids onto clay bricks treating wastewater 40 mg l 1 during 48 h the organic loading rates olr applied decreased from 0 83 and 0 97 g m 2 d 1 for cw p and cw mp in phase i cycles of 24 h to 0 49 and 0 46 g m 2 d 1 for the systems operated in phase ii cycles of 48 h respectively corresponding to removals of 0 71 and 0 57 g m 2 d 1 in phase i and 0 21 and 0 24 g m 2 d 1 in phase ii regarding tan cw p and cw mp achieved mean removal efficiencies of 41 and 19 in phase i with influent concentration varying from 13 to 18 mg l 1 respectively however lower removal efficiencies were verified in phase ii with 7 for cw p and 10 for cw mp table 2 fig 5 cw p differed significantly p value 0 0003 n 32 from cw mp in phase i indicating that the use of fragments of ps was more efficient than modified ps in removing tan however similarity was verified between cw p and cw mp p value 0 0256 in phase ii regarding the cycle of operation higher removals were achieved for both systems in phase i with significant differences between cw p p value 0 0004 and cw mp p value 0 0179 similar removal efficiencies of tan were achieved by minakshi et al 61 of 43 1 and 49 4 in vfcw systems planted with canna indica onto sand and gravel 10 mm respectively in the treatment of dairy wastewater with 48 0 mg l 1 operated at hrt of 24 h however our results disagree with previous studies reported in the literature when increasing the cycle of operation to 48 h such as minakshi et al 61 who verified removal efficiencies of 56 5 49 4 and 43 8 when vfcw systems were operated at hrt of 48 h tan removal decreased approximately 34 in cw p between phases probably due to the material expansion during the operation absorption of sewage by the material diminishing the useful volume from 8 l to 7 l and the oxygen transfer by the void pore filling biofilm assimilation adsorption and plant absorption probably contributed to nitrogen removal in the studied systems as previously verified by saeed sun 62 however mello et al 28 and lima et al 12 observed that e crassipes did not influence in nitrogen removal in subsurface vfcw treating low strengh sewage 34 to 69 mg l 1 evaporation and evapotranspiration were not determined in this study otherwise nitrite and nitrate concentrations were lower in the systems than the detection limits loq of 0 015 and 5 mg l 1 respectively indicating that ammonia could not be completely oxidized and justifying the lower removal efficiencies in phase ii similarly lima et al 12 noted removal of 13 in a vfcw with e crassipes onto clay bricks in the treatment of synthetic wastewater with 40 mg l 1 and operated with cycles of 48 h these authors saeed sun 62 and du et al 63 attributed the ammonia production in vfcw systems filled with gravel 17 9 and light expanded clay aggregates 32 to the low concentrations of do 1 50 mg l 1 that may limit ammonia oxidation and complete nitrification in the present study do concentrations remained lower than 1 60 mg l 1 during the operation of cw p and cw mp i e lower than the concentration required for nitrification suggesting the predominance of anoxic conditions 3 2 3 total phosphorus regarding influent samples phosphorus concentration ranged from 11 0 to 15 0 mg l 1 in phase i and from 12 to 13 0 mg l 1 in phase ii fig 6 classifying the synthetic wastewater as strength 11 mg l 1 in accordance with metcalf eddy 48 cw p and cw mp achieved mean removal efficiencies of 64 and 62 in phase i and 54 for both systems in phase ii respectively table 1 although no significant differences p value 0 05 n 32 were obtained neither between the substrates nor between the cycles of operation under these operational conditions cw p and cw mp presented slightly better tp removal in phase i higher results were achieved compared to those achieved by marcelino et al 10 10 12 l of 35 41 and 46 influent pt from 9 80 mg l 1 in vfcw with p stratiotes onto bricks leca and a mixture of leca and porcelain respectively operated with cycles of 12 h additionally mateus pinho 13 verified a removal efficiency of 65 influent tp of 2 24 mg l 1 in a vfcw planted with phragmites australis onto limestone waste and clay bricks and operated with cycles of 36 h and lima et al 12 noted removals of 82 and 87 influent tp of 18 9 mg l 1 in vfcw with eichhornia crassipes onto clay bricks and leca respectively operated with cycles of 48 h the potential of plasterboard sheet fragments to remove tp could be verified by comparing the results to systems filled with conventional materials such as sand and gravel by mello et al 28 who verified removals of 20 16 and 29 in a vfcw 100 l planted with e crassipes and operated at hrt of 24 48 and 72 h respectively treating sewage influent tp of 10 2 to 18 60 mg l 1 zhou et al 64 who achieved removal efficiency of 72 77 influent tp of 10 mg l 1 in vfcw 5 5 l vegetated with oenanthe javanica treating wastewater and operated with hrt of 72 h and minakshi et al 61 who noted removal efficiencies of 46 1 17 3 and 44 4 in a vfcw 67 5 l filled with sand gravel 10 mm and gravel 20 mm respectively vegetated with canna indica treating dairy wastewater influent tp of 41 0 mg l 1 under cycles of 48 h batch mode regarding clay based materials shi et al 65 obtained removal of 64 in a vfcw 27 l planted with iris pseudoacorus onto red brick in the treatment of synthetic domestic wastewater with 8 1 mg l 1 under hrt of 72 h du et al 57 verified mean removal efficiencies of 65 to 71 3 42 to 86 and 46 to 71 in vfcw 240 l planted with acorus calamus l and typha orientalis presl hibiscus mutabilis linn and nerium indicum mill onto limestone and cobblestone treating domestic wastewater with tp varying from 1 9 to 7 2 mg l 1 at hrt of 48 h additionally garcia ávila et al 66 achieved removal efficiencies of 49 in vfcw 60 l planted with phragmites australis acutangula and cyperus papyrus onto silicon sand treating wastewater with influent tp of 8 91 mg l 1 and operated at hrt of 27 h phosphorus transformation or removal generally occurs via soil accumulation and plant tissue plant and microorganism uptake dissolution and precipitation adsorption and desorption mineralization fragmentation and leaching in constructed wetlands 52 67 additionally vymazal et al 1 stated that the removal of phosphorus is directly associated with the nature and physical chemical characteristics of the support media in this context shen et al 2022 68 reported that alkaline conditions favor the generation of mgp and cap bonds while acid conditions enhance the formation of alp an fep bonds according to cabral et al 69 and han et al 70 materials rich in fe al ca and mg oxides assist phosphorus precipitation and adsorption in this study the most detected elements in sed analyses were o 51 07 ca 20 27 s 14 65 c 12 59 si 0 87 al 0 39 and k 0 16 to plasterboard sheet fragments according to qin et al 44 phosphorus adsorption could occur mainly by precipitation of aluminum and iron phosphates precipitation or adsorption in hydroxides and al and fe oxides due to the formation of calcium phosphates in the presence of ca in this study xrf analysis detected calcium oxide cao 61 42 sulfur trioxide so3 32 02 phosphorus

decreased from 0 20 and 0 21 g m 2 d 1 in phase i cycles of 24 h to 0 11 and 0 11 g m 2 d 1 in phase ii cycles of 48 h for cw p and cw mp respectively corresponding to removals of 0 34 and 0 33 g m 2

both systems demonstrating the adaptability of the floating macrophyte e crassipes onto the support media investigated in this study therefore this species could be used in surface flow and subsurface flow cw as stated by lima et al 12 and mello et al 28 the total dry biomasses of 33 67 g for cw p and 36 86 g for cw mp were obtained at the end of the operation including roots stems and leaves additionally tn and tp were quantified in the dry biomass of macrophyte at the end of operation table 2 most of the total nitrogen masses were stored in roots and stems and the total phosphorus masses in the stems in both systems table 2 the average sizes of the roots leaves and stems increased from 0 090 0 035 and 0 045 m before to 0 13 0 12 and 0 21 m in cw p and 0 15 0 12 and 0 24 m in cw mp after respectively the smaller size of the roots of e crassipes compared to other species could assist in the removal of the entire plant from the cw minimizing damage to substrate and biofilm 12 according to brix 71 vymazal 72 and kadlec wallace 47 pruning is done in the aerial part due to the ramification and fixation of species such as phragmites australis and typha spp onto substrates increasing vegetal absorption and nutrient release to the liquid phase from root decomposition in the dry biomass concentrations of tn and tp were similar resulting in 27 01 mg g 1 in cw p and 28 47 mg g 1 in cw mp for tn and 72 33 mg g 1 in cw p and 72 03 mg g 1 in cw mp for tp lima et al 12 obtained tn and tp of 55 00 and 20 40 mg g 1 in cwg p gravel 55 97 and 20 55 mg g 1 in cw p light expanded clay aggregates and 55 21 and 4 39 mg g 1 in cwb p clay bricks in the dry biomass of e crassipes with initial concentrations of 69 0 mgtn l 1 and 19 0 mgtp l 1 respectively in vfcw in this study e crassipes could uptake 5 38 and 19 72 g in cw p and 6 78 and 23 12 g in cw mp of tn and tp at the end of operation respectively before the operation tp concentration was 12 39 mg g 1 in the substrate totalizing 140 70 g in each cw plasterboard sheet fragments demonstrated the adsorptive potential related mainly to the high cation exchange capacity of gypsum 19 39 as abovementioned in item 3 1 on the 308th day the mass recovered was 1 40 mg g 1 for cw p and 1 54 mg g 1 for cw mp 3 3 1 mass balance during the experiment tn and tp balances were quantified in the cw following the adapted methodology of wu et al 73 considering plant uptake support media storage effluent and other losses table 3 tn quantification was 852 50 mg m 2 d 1 in the influent and 463 32 and 509 65 mg m 2 d 1 in the effluent representing overall removal of 54 35 in cw p and 59 78 in cw mp during the operation of cw nitrogen plant uptake was 7 10 and 8 19 mg m 2 d 1 representing 0 83 in cw p and 0 96 in cw mp the accumulation onto substrate and absorption resulted in 3 38 and 1 33 mg m 2 d 1 indicating contributions of 0 40 in cw p and 0 16 in cw mp respectively marcelino et al 10 observed accumulation of tn of 0 52 0 58 and 0 39 in vfcw planted with pistia stratiotes onto leca mixture of leca and porcelain and bricks respectively with 2432 91 mg m 2 d 1 of tn initial other processes that could be related to microbial activities were responsible for the major contribution to tn removal with 378 71 and 333 34 mg m 2 d 1 representing 44 42 in cw p and 39 10 in cw mp therefore accumulation onto substrate and plant uptake had less influence on the tn overall removal the quantification of tp during the operation was 333 59 mg m 2 d 1 in the influent and 129 73 and 148 26 mg m 2 d 1 in the effluent that is 38 89 in cw p and 44 44 in cw mp similarly plant uptake represented the least preferable removal pathway with 33 63 and 28 75 mg m 2 d 1 corresponding to 10 08 in cw p and 8 62 in cw mp of tp overall removal baldovi et al 74 noted plant uptake ranging from 14 5 to 29 1 from the overall removal evaluating different hrt the adsorption and accumulation onto substrate resulted in 3 23 and 3 52 mg m 2 d 1 representing contributions of 0 97 in cw mp and 1 06 in cw p respectively other removal pathways represented 49 98 in cw p and 45 97 in cw mp of the overall removal represented 166 71 and 153 34 mg m 2 d 1 therefore nitrogen is transformed and removed through biofilm assimilation via microorganisms with lesser contribution of plant plant uptake and adsorption onto the materials evaluated in this study the physical chemical characteristics of the materials directly influence the removal of phosphorus via adsorption and desorption and probable precipitation of the formed aggregates as previously mentioned in items 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 however there are no studies in literature regarding the application of calcium sulfate dihydrate gypsum nor fragments of plasterboard sheets as support media in constructed wetlands limiting the comparison with mass balance results a stable performance in the total phosphorus removal throughout the operational period of cw p and cw mp is shown in fig s1 supplementary material average phosphorus removal efficiencies of 64 in cw p and 62 in cw mp were achieved in phase i and 54 for both systems in phase ii during the operation no desorption was noted probably by the strong binding of phosphorus to the substrate additionally no saturation of the substrates was noted at the end of the operation thus further studies are necessary to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity of these wastes as substrates in cw 3 4 microbial community diversity and structure the microbial diversity was assessed indicating a good sampling from the asymptotic curves generated in the rarefaction curve analysis the number of effective sequences was 33 278 from cw p and 44 260 from cw mp alpha diversity was calculated using simpson s index indicating greater bacterial diversity in cw p system 0 9234 than in cw mp 0 8329 although the samples from cw mp system presented the highest number of sequences no greater diversity was observed therefore modifications in the substrate such as paper removal treatment affected the alpha diversity index cw p system presented a more diverse microbial community at the phylum level proteobacteria and firmicutes were dominant in both systems with 79 of relative abundance ra for cw p and 95 for cw mp for the sum of both fig 7 the relative abundance found for cw p and cw mp was 45 73 and 50 99 of firmicutes followed by 33 14 and 43 83 of proteobacteria respectively shen et al 68 obtained similar results in floating treatment wetlands ftw 180 l with vetiver and aerated concrete block proteobacteria and firmicutes phyla add high levels of bacterial metabolic diversity and are crucial to denitrification 75 bacteria pertaining to the proteobacteria phylum are responsible for acting in carbon nitrogen sulfur and phosphorus cycles these microorganisms have great metabolic and morphological capacity including aerobic anaerobic and facultative organisms 76 furthermore they include bacteria involved in various stages of nitrogen removal such as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob as well as bacteria responsible for carbon removal in cw systems under various c n ratios 15 77 78 the phyla campylobacterota 8 53 actinobacteriota 3 97 gemmatimonadota 3 04 desulfobacterota 2 96 and bacteroidota 2 62 were identified for cw p while chloroflexi 3 34 actinobacteriota 0 84 and acidobacteriota 0 73 for cw mp the phyla proteobacteria firmicutes chloroflexi and bacteroidota are commonly verified in cw 76 79 82 at the gender level there is an evident difference between the systems showing a predominance of bacillus and pseudomonas in cw mp sum of 53 with 50 of the population composed of only two genders fig 8 conversely these genera were not identified in cw p with better species distribution therefore the existing conditions in the cw mp system were more favorable to the development and predominance of bacillus and pseudomonas in cw p system the genera lactobacillus staphylococcus streptococcus and parvimonas firmicutes phylum representing 14 30 13 28 6 26 and 6 20 respectively were identified in addition the genera phyllobacterium 10 13 and pantoea 6 16 proteobacteria phylum were identified sulfurimonas 8 53 bacteria related to sulfur oxidation campylobacterota phylum were identified in cw p system 6 83 according to hu et al 83 this sulfur oxidizing denitrifier bacterium participates in the sulfur and nitrogen cycles performing complete denitrification based on the sed analysis this could explain the sulfur reduction from 14 65 to 10 04 in the material composition after the treatments however the sulfur percentage increased from 13 05 to 18 85 in cw mp system in which sulfurimonas was not found the genera bacillus and streptococcus firmicutes phylum were identified in cw mp with relative abundances of 30 95 and 7 98 respectively denitrifying bacteria of the bacillus genus tend to grow under anoxic conditions 84 the systems were operated under anoxic conditions in phases i and ii considering the values obtained for do and orp pseudomonas pantoea and achromobacter proteobacteria phylum were also identified in cw mp representing 22 38 7 49 and 5 57 respectively pseudomonas are involved in different metabolic processes improving denitrification and assimilating phosphorus 77 85 according to shen et al 68 pseudomonas might be related to phosphorus mineralization in ftw however nitrogen and phosphorus removal cannot be attributed to pseudomonas in cw mp since this specie was not found in cw p besides the removal of nutrients was similar between the systems despite the significant phosphorus removal candidatus accumulibacter the main genus related to this process 77 was not identified in the systems the unfavorable environment for nitrification confirmed by the absence of nitrifying genera nitrospira nitrosospira nitrosomonas explains the low ammonia removal efficiency in phase ii 7 for cw p and 10 for cw mp both systems have denitrifying bacteria indicating that the conditions found in the medium favor the presence of these microorganisms although the occurrence of denitrification was not observed the presence of bacteria demonstrates the potential of the system to carry out such a process 4 conclusions plasterboard sheet fragments ps and modified plasterboard sheet fragments mp showed chemical and textural composition favorable for removing nutrients the results indicated phosphorus adsorption onto the substrates the chemical composition showed high o ca s and c values besides presenting exchangeable ions on its surface which increases its capacity for sorption processes ion exchange and precipitation regarding the parameters cod and pt no significant differences were verified when evaluating the support medium and the operated phases however cw mp achieved the highest cod removal of 65 in phase i and 70 in phase ii cw p and cw mp showed similar phosphorus removal efficiencies in both phases in phase i the removal was higher with an increase of 8 to 10 in the average removal efficiency for cw mp and cw p respectively the best removal efficiencies for tn and tan were achieved by cw p in phase i cw p and cw mp showed similar removal for tn and tan in phase ii suggesting a gradual removal of the paperboard from cw p during the operation and leading to more similar behavior between the systems despite the differences in the structure of the microbial community the removal efficiencies of organic matter and nutrients were highly similar with no statistically significant difference between the results from phase ii credit authorship contribution statement adelania de oliveira souza investigation writing original draft

12477,in this study we investigated the effect of different inoculation ratios of the suspended state bacterial algal symbiosis system bass on the treatment of pollutants in mariculture wastewater the inoculation ratio of 3 sludge algae 360 mg l 120 mg l performed best resulting in removal efficiencies of 96 22 92 43 94 56 and 95 06 for cod nitrogen phosphorus and sulfamethoxazole smx respectively an appropriate inoculation ratio sludge algae 3 would increase not only the activity of algae and bacteria 12 86 μmol o2 mg chl a h for sogr and 28 17 mgo2 g mlvss h for sour but also facilitate the secretion of extracellular polymers and the formation of bacterial algal colloids achieving simultaneous nitrification denitrification high throughput sequencing results showed that the functional bacteria could constitute a complete aerobic anoxic anaerobic environmental gradient to achieve maximum oxygen utilization and a higher abundance of sulfamethoxazole degrading bacteria norak f microscillaceae could be cultivated by changing the inoculum ratio therefore this study provides new ideas for the treatment of mariculture wastewater containing antibiotics and the green development of the mariculture industry graphical abstract mechanism diagram of pollutant removal by bacteria algal symbiosis system unlabelled image keywords inoculation ratio bacterial algal symbiotic system bacterial algal colloids sulfamethoxazole data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction china the single largest producer and consumer of seafood accounted for 54 6 of world aquaculture production by 2012 1 and reached 38 13 million tons of seafood consumption by 2018 during mariculture large amounts of animal excreta and unused feed were directly discharged into the environment which can cause a dramatic increase in the level of pollutants e g nitrogen phosphorus and cod in the water column resulting in eutrophication of the water column 2 also aquaculture feeds often contain antibiotics for the treatment of fish and shrimp diseases about 70 80 of antibiotics failed to be used posing a serious threat to the aquatic environment 3 among them sulfonamides were one of the antibiotics with a high detection rate in aquaculture wastewater 4 in actual aquaculture wastewater the sulfamethoxazole detection concentrations varied widely from ng l to mg l depending on the season and sampling site 5 and even up to 5 57 mg l in the mariculture water environment 6 in 2019 the chinese government put forward the opinion of green and healthy development for the aquaculture industry requiring that pollutants in aquaculture wastewater should be effectively removed before discharge and the recycling of aquaculture wastewater should be realized in 2020 jiangsu province of china released the discharge standards for mariculture wastewater including cod 10 mg l tn 3 mg l and tp 0 5 mg l currently the main conventional adsorption and advanced oxidation methods are used to farm wastewater which is effective for nitrogen phosphorus and cod removal but the drawbacks of these two exist and do not comply with the requirements of the environmental cycle the adsorption method transfers pollutants to another system without achieving the final treatment of pollutants and the treatment and regeneration of adsorbent materials is an essential concern 7 advanced oxidation methods are limited by harsh reaction conditions and high operating costs 8 and the formation of hypobromous acid and hypobromite ions from the reaction of ozone with bromine ions in brackish freshwater and seawater systems are toxic to fish and shellfish in contrast biological methods have a less environmental impact lower economic costs and are more effective for antibiotic removal liu et al used a horizontally submerged artificial wetland to achieve 80 and 50 removal of ammonia nitrogen and sulfamethoxazole from culture wastewater respectively 9 however there are also disadvantages of artificial wetlands such as large footprint and long treatment time recently technology based on bacterial algal symbiosis system bass for pollutant removal has been emerged algae produce oxygen through photosynthesis feeding bacteria for mineralization bacteria in activated sludge release co2 through respiration supplying the microalgae for photosynthesis 10 11 through this symbiotic mechanism the bacterial algal symbiosis provides higher removal of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus than conventional activated sludge li et al used the bass to treat low c n ratio pig wastewater and found that the removal of nh4 n and po4 3 p by the symbiosis system was increased by 53 84 and 43 52 respectively compared to the conventional activated sludge system 12 14 meanwhile the bass was more tolerant to antibiotics and more efficient for antibiotic removal 15 based on the complementary symbiotic conditions of bacteria and algae the initial inoculation ratio of algae and bacteria may affect the removal rate of the symbiotic system sepehri et al showed that a 10 90 inoculation ratio of common c vulgaris to activated sludge nas enriched with nitrifying bacteria could yield 100 removal of ammonia nitrogen 16 in the study of su et al the highest nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies of 91 0 7 0 and 93 5 2 5 respectively were achieved with an inoculation ratio of 5 1 algae sludge 17 since light is known to be crucial for algal growth high activated sludge concentrations can cause light shading phenomena that can have an inhibitory effect on algae bai et al applied different concentrations of pig manure sludge for algae production and found low algal production in undiluted liquid manure 18 to achieve a mechanism of symbiosis between bacteria and algae the bacterial algal inoculation ratio is a major factor however relevant studies on the effect of bacterial algal inoculation ratio on the treatment of mariculture wastewater are not available and no studies on antibiotic removal have been reported in this study we investigated a suspended bacterial algal symbiosis system consisting of marine chlorella and salt tolerant activated sludge co culture with sulfamethoxazole selected as the target antibiotic to explore the removal of pollutants from mariculture wastewater under different inoculation ratios of bacteria and algae also the microbial activity extracellular polymer secretion and microbial community were compared to derive the best inoculation ratio to lay the theoretical basis for the practical application of the project 2 methods and materials 2 1 chlorella expansion marine chlorella gy h4 chlorella sp was purchased from shanghai guangyu biotechnology co and cultured in bg11 medium the seeds were inoculated in a 500 ml conical flask according to the volume ratio of algal liquid medium 1 5 and placed in a light incubator with a temperature of 25 c a light of 2500 lux and a light dark ratio of 12 12 for expansion the growth of algal cells was detected daily by uv spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 680 nm and the equation of the correlation function between od680 and the dry weight of marine chlorella was obtained as shown in eq 1 1 dry weight g l 0 3416 3x 0 00563 r 2 0 99 854 2 2 acclimation of salt tolerance of activated sludge aerobic activated sludge was obtained from guangzhou nancun sewage treatment plant the salinity of wastewater was adjusted from 0 to 3 by adding sea crystal and salt tolerant activated sludge was obtained after 60 days of acclimation and cultivation the activated sludge was used as inoculum in this experiment 500 ml volume conical flasks were employed as sbr reactors six different algal sludge ratio reactors were obtained by fixing the chlorella inoculum and varying the salt tolerant activated sludge inoculum at 25 c 4500 lux and 12 12 light dark ratio i e marine chlorella activated sludge dry weight ratio 1 1 120 mg l 120 mg l 1 3 120 mg l 360 mg l 1 5 120 mg l 600 mg l

to stir at 200 rpm min 24 h is one cycle 22 h stirring 100 min settling 10 min discharge 10 min inlet due to the poor sediment ability of algae and to avoid excessive loss of algae no water was drained on the first day of the experiment and contaminants were incorporated as mother liquor and the subsequent daily volume exchange rate was 25 the total volume of experimental mariculture

formic acid water 0 1 the volume ratio was 49 51 the flow rate was 0 2 ml min and the detection wavelength was set at 280 nm the smx removal rate was calculated according to the smx concentration at the beginning and the end of the experiment 2 4 characterization of chlorella activity and microbial activity in this experiment the growth of chlorella was measured by chlorophyll a which was determined using 95 ethanol the microbiological activity was measured by taking the bacteria algae mixture at the 20th day the photosynthetic oxygen production rate sogr of the bacterial algal mixture was measured using the black and white bottle method to characterize marine chlorella activity 20 total bacterial activity aob activity and nob activity of each reactor were expressed as specific oxygen consumption uptake rate sour saur snur 21 2 5 eps extraction and scanning electron microscopy sem eps mainly consisted of loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps 22 lb eps and tb

total organic carbon toc protein pn and polysaccharides ps toc was measured by a toc analyzer toc lcph cpn shimadzu pn was measured according to the lowry method 25 ps content was determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method 26 in addition the bacteria algae mixture at the end of the experiment was taken and characterized morphologically using a scanning electron microscope zeiss sigma 300 2 6 high throughput sequencing at the end of the experiment the 20th day the experimental group inoculated with sludge was taken for high throughput sequencing the sequencing of microbial diversity was performed by majorbio biopharmaceutical technology shanghai china the basic sequencing process consists of dna extraction pcr amplification product purification quantification and homogenization of pcr products sequencing library construction and double end sequencing the universal primer pairs 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvggtatctaatcc 3 were used to amplify the bacterial 16s rrna region targeting the v3 v4 region 27 the pcr products were then sequenced on the illumina miseq platform bioinformatics analysis was performed on the majorbio i sanger https cloud majorbio com 2 7 statistical analysis all tests were conducted in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of the results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 algal growth ph and do changes the growth of algae was monitored by detecting the chlorophyll a content as shown in fig 1a during the 20 day of experiment the chlorophyll a content of each experimental group inoculated with chlorella showed an increasing trend the concentrations of r1 r2 r3 r4 and r5 increased from 1 8 mg l at the 0th day to 4 73 mg l 4 53 mg l 4 14 mg l 3 85 mg l and 4 68 mg l at the 20th day respectively in r1 r4 as sludge concentration increased the rate of chlorophyll a increase was lower this indicated that the increase of sludge concentration showed a negative correlation with the growing of chlorella the shading effect of a high concentration of sludge on light inhibited the availability of light to algae resulting in an increase in oxygen consumption by algal cells performing dark respiration and low chlorophyll production due to low photosynthetic efficiency however the inclusion of activated sludge promoted the growth of chlorella to some extent in bass ph and dissolved oxygen showed a positive correlation with chlorophyll a bacterial respiration and mineralization consume o2 and release co2 and algae not only supply o2 but also absorb co2 the higher the sludge content the higher the o2 demand and the lower the dissolved oxygen in the water at the same time the sludge shaded the light and the photo inhibited algal cells lacking chlorophyll were unable to quickly capture and convert light energy into atp making the algae less efficient in assimilating co2 in the dark reaction stage and enriched carbonate ions in the water therefore the higher the sludge concentration the lower the ph value while there was no co2 internal supplier in the pure algae system r5 the ph value continued to rise 3 2 pollutant removal the removal performance of pollutants from mariculture wastewater was studied for 20 d with different inoculation ratios of bass marine chlorella alone and activated sludge alone system 3 2 1 removal of nutrients fig 2a investigates the effect of mono and co culture systems on the removal of cod from mariculture wastewater the cod removal rates of the co culture system r1 r4 were 90 85 96 22 91 96 and 88 76 at day 20 respectively compared with the pure algae system 63 1 and pure sludge system 59 7 the symbiotic system showed a higher cod removal rate in general the removal of cod in activated sludge systems mainly depended on the metabolism of heterotrophic bacteria and the concentration of do was one of the limitations for the uptake and degradation of cod by heterotrophic aerobic bacteria 28 the addition of algae provided the symbiotic system with an o2 provider which contributed to the mineralization of heterotrophic bacteria and improved cod removal in contrast in r3 and r4 where the biomass was higher the ability of chlorella to capture light energy would be limited by the sludge concentration and would never be able to provide the do required to meet the normal metabolism of all heterotrophic bacteria in the system resulting in poor removal of cod in r1 where the sludge volume is the lowest cod removal efficiency was limited by the low content of heterotrophic bacteria also the sludge shading effect on light was weak while chlorella would gradually become the main body of the system with the highest chlorophyll a content of 4 7 mg l showing a lower removal effect on cod the efficiency of carbon dioxide release from carbon source by bacteria and the efficiency of oxygen production by photosynthesis of microalgae limited each other by changing the inoculation ratio the equilibrium point between bacteria and algae could be found to minimize the effect produced by this limitation and eventually achieve an efficient and stable cod removal efficiency in this study the r2 system always maintained a stable and efficient cod removal efficiency which was always above 94 the cod removal rate in the pure sludge system r6 showed a trend of rising and then falling most likely due to anoxia which led to the decomposition of heterotrophic aerobic bacteria by other bacteria and a decrease in activated sludge activity resulting in cod accumulation the phosphate removal efficiency is shown in fig 2b phosphorus is an essential nutrient in the metabolism of algae most of the inorganic phosphorus hpo4 2 or h2po was phosphorylated by microalgae to synthesize organic compounds namely adenosine diphosphate adp for the final synthesis of atp 29 phosphorus is one of the main causes of water blooms in natural water bodies therefore with no other competitors the r5 system provided the best environment for algae growth and could achieve 97 56 phosphorus removal with the help of the luxurious uptake mechanism of microalgae 30 the remaining groups performed in the following order for phosphorus removal r1 85 43 r2 94 56 r3 79 64 and r4 65 04 when the inoculum ratio exceeded 3 the phosphorus removal efficiency exhibited a significant decreasing trend which was largely attributed to the lack of o2 among the experimental groups with imbalanced inoculation ratios of algae to activated sludge the aerobic environment required by bacteria to convert phosphate to polyphosphate could not be reached even in the light phase and phosphate assimilation was limited by bacterial respiration when the light disappeared the bacteria released polyphosphate again in an anoxic environment this explained the fluctuations in phosphate removal efficiency by the end of the experiment for the r6 system which was not oxygenated by chlorella the lack of oxygen limited even more the aerobic phosphorus uptake by the polyphosphate bacteria and the release of phosphate was not present in addition phosphate precipitation occurring above ph 8 5 was responsible for the lower removal rate in r1 at a ph of about 9 0 thus it is evident that the bacterial algal inoculation ratio is crucial for the interaction between bacteria and microalgae and is the main factor in regulating do and ph in the system in this experiment the best phosphorus removal was achieved with an inoculation ratio of 3 fig 2c shows the changes in tn removal efficiency the trend of nitrogen removal by each experimental group always maintained a steady increase on the 10th day the reactors containing chlorella reached the highest nitrogen removal efficiency which was r1 81 42 r2 92 43 r3 80 07 r4 76 43 and r5 58 49 respectively it was discovered that r2 had a much higher treatment capacity than the other systems indicating that selecting an appropriate inoculation ratio of bacteria and algae was an important factor in improving the efficiency of the symbiotic system in treating mariculture wastewater subsequently we examined the mass concentrations of each nitrogen form fig c1 c5 in the effluent water on five different days 4th 8th 12th 16th and 20th to observe the nitrogen transformation pathway the overall decreasing trend in ammonia nitrogen concentration in the symbiotic system over time was achieved mainly through algal bio assimilation and microbial nitrification however the inoculation ratio directly affected the magnitude and rate of ammonia nitrogen reduction in the effluent the higher the concentration of inoculated sludge the more significant the limitation of microalgae growth the lower the do supply and the lower the efficiency of ammonia nitrogen microbial transformation when the inoculated sludge concentration was too low the microbial amount was low nitrification was slow and algae became the main absorber when the inoculation ratio was 3 the nh4 n content of the effluent remained low and reached 0 mg l on the 8th day indicating that the inoculum of the organisms was the main reason for the ammonia nitrogen oxidation rate the symbiotic system accumulated no2 n on the 4th day which could be attributed to the inhibition of nitrosating and nitrifying bacteria by free ammonia fa and the rapid consumption of substrate by heterotrophic bacteria resulting in too low c n 31 after this the system showed more nitrogen loss and a small amount of no3 n excluding the part assimilated by algae we inferred that the whole denitrification process was a simultaneous nitrification denitrification process bacteria and algae continuously secrete extracellular polymers to form bonds to mutually adsorb and utilize beneficial substances resulting in a bacterial algal colloid with bacteria as the main body and algae as the substrate bacterial algal colloids formed more easily with a 3 1 inoculation ratio resulting in the rapid generation of an aerobic anoxic anaerobic environmental gradient from the surface to the interior simultaneous nitrification denitrification maximized oxygen utilization and almost 0 mg l no2 n and a small amount of no3 n appeared which benefited from the efficient denitrification of the system the nitrogen removal efficiency decreased during the later stages of the experiment owing to a small increase in no3 n this could be attributed to the higher dissolved oxygen in the system inhibiting the reductase activity of denitrifying bacteria resulting in low denitrification efficiency 3 2 2 removal of sulfamethoxazole fig 2d demonstrates the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole under different bacterial algal ratio conditions at the beginning of the stabilization period on day 10 r1 r2 r3 and r4 removed 92 79 95 06 89 48 and 88 4 of sulfamethoxazole respectively while r5 and r6 only had 36 8 and 24 91 the removal of antibiotics by the symbiotic system was increased by 56 4 66 49 when compared to the monoculture system this indicated that sulfamethoxazole could be removed more efficiently from mariculture wastewater by using a combined culture of bacteria and algae aydin et al constructed a symbiotic system of bacteria and algae after adding rainfed red algae to the mbr which increased the removal rate of tetracycline from 69 75 to 89 73 32 smx removal was consistently higher in r2 than that in the other reactors suggesting that a suitable sludge inoculum aids in smx removal in this study the highest smx removal efficiency was achieved when the bacterial algal inoculation ratio was 3 which corresponded to the nitrogen and phosphorus removal ratios this could be because the activity of both aob and nob was higher at this inoculation ratio than at others ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa have been reported to be closely related to the degradation and removal of ppcps 33 kassotaki et al revealed that the addition of an ammonia oxidation inhibitor atu to the sbr reactor with a nitrification function reduced the removal efficiency of smx directly from 98 to 0 34 the pk a of smx was 5 6 6 6 when ph was higher than pk a smx existed in negatively charged form which would be rejected by negatively charged microalgal cells 35 meanwhile the logkow of smx was lower than 1 with 0 89 which exhibited hydrophilic qualities that lead to limited adsorption binding to cells 36 da silva rodrigues et al revealed a very low biosorption of 1 26 for smx by the bacterial algal symbiotic system 37 besides hydroxyl radicals could react with smx and promote the biodegradation of smx hydroxyl radicals were generated in the bacterial algal symbiotic system mainly from the following three sources the interaction of nitrate with sunlight 8 the reaction of cl and cl 2 in the seawater matrix 38 and the hydrolysis accompanying the photosynthesis of microalgae therefore most smx was removed by biodegradation 2 no 3 no 3 no 2 o no 2 ho ho 3 oh cl hcl cl cl 2 in conclusion with an algae inoculation ratio of 3 the gradient utilization of do produced by chlorella was achieved without additional aeration resulting in a dynamically balanced symbiotic relationship between bacteria and microalgae and the best pollutant removal efficiency 3 3 changes of mlss mlvss and mlvss mlss the changes of mlss mlvss and mlvss mlss for each experimental group before and after the experiment with different inoculation ratios are shown in table 1 after 20 days of cultivation the dry weight mlss of each reactor increased by r1 211 6 r2 183 5 r3 120 1 r4 74 0 r5 180 3 and r6 70 1 respectively and the biomass mlvss increased by r1 201 8 r2 188 5 r3 107 5 r4 58 3 r5 176 8 and r6 30 5 this indicated that the growth rate of algae was higher than that of activated sludge and the addition of algae promoted the growth of the microorganisms in system however the growth rate of dry weight and biomass of each reactor was negatively correlated with the sludge concentration this was because the weakening effect of sludge on light led to the reduction of photosynthetic efficiency of microalgae and the limitation of bacterial growth mlvss mlss expressed the proportion of microorganisms in the bacteria algae mixture which could reflect the activity of overall microorganisms 24 only in r2 the value of mlvss mlss increased from 0 886 to 0 902 and decreased in the rest of the experimental groups this indicated that the inoculation ratio of bacteria and algae of 3 was most suitable for the co growth of microalgae and activated sludge which contributed to the improvement of the microbial activity of the system 3 4 microbial activity fig 3a shows the algal activity at the end of the experiment the 20th day with different inoculation ratios the r2 reactor showed the highest oalgal activity with 12 86 μmol o2 mg chl a h followed by r1 with 10 18 μmol o2 mg chl a h both higher than the r5 pure algae reactor with 11 28 μmol o2 mg chl a h this indicated that the addition of activated sludge can increase algal activity activated sludge was also shown to improve algal viability and photosynthetic efficiency in the experiments of xu et al 39 however the photosynthetic oxygen production rates of algae in r3 and r4 were only 9 92 μmol o2 mg chl a h and 7 77 μmol o2 mg chl a h this could be due to the excessively activated sludge inoculum which has an enhanced light shading effect and slows down the algal photosynthetic rate contributing to reduced activity meanwhile algal photosynthesis is accompanied by hydrolysis which results in the production of large amounts of hydroxyls oh which peng et al suggested as a major conversion pathway for the biodegradation of organic matter by microalgae 40 therefore algal activity is an essential prerequisite for smx to undergo biodegradation the bacterial activity at the end of the experiment with different inoculation ratios is shown in fig 3b it was discovered that the r2 reactor had a higher microbial than the other reactors as well as higher activity of denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria the algae produce oxygen through a photosynthetic process which can be used by aerobic bacteria such as denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria to promote nitrogen uptake and conversion in r2 the highest total aerobic rate of microorganisms was 28 17 mgo2 g mlvss h this further indicated that in this experiment a bacterial algal inoculation ratio of 3 was the optimum condition for bacterial algal symbiosis and that both bacterial and algal activity are inhibited above or below this inoculum ratio the bacterial activity in r6 was only 9 02 mgo2 g mlvss h in the absence of oxygen supplied by chlorella whereas the bacterial activity in the r4 reactor was 1 3 times higher due to the inoculation of chlorella this partly suggested that the interaction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes may contribute to bioactivity 41 remarkably saur was consistently higher than snur in all experimental groups light had a strong inhibitory effect on nob it has been reported that nob was more light sensitive than aob and that aob recovered more easily from photoinhibition and became more light tolerant all of which contributed to the establishment of stable nitrification 42 3 5 eps analysis table 2 shows the content of loose extracellular polymer lb eps and compact extracellular polymer tb eps in each reactor at different inoculation ratios on day 0 and day 20 respectively both lb eps and tb eps increased in each system compared to day 0 up to day 20 lb eps increased by r1 8 95 mg g mlvss r2 15 89 mg g mlvss r3 3 91 mg g mlvss r4 2 88 mg g mlvss r5 8 02 mg g mlvss and r6 3 78 mg g mlvss respectively and tb eps eps increased by r1 10 2 mg g mlvss r2 18 67 mg g mlvss r3 6 31 mg g mlvss r4 4 64 mg g mlvss r5 6 61 mg g mlvss and r6 1 39 mg g mlvss respectively the increment of secreted eps in r2 was the largest and could reach 2 5 times of the other experimental groups it had been demonstrated that the increase of eps content had a positive effect on the removal of pollutants and the improvement of microbial activity 23 43 the scanning electron micrographs of each symbiotic system before and after the experiment were shown in fig 5 after 20 d of co culture chlorella was transformed from floating on the surface of activated sludge to being wrapped by activated sludge or bonded to each other the formation of bacterial algal colloids was facilitated by the aggregation phenomenon of chlorella and sludge achieved by secreting eps 43 among all symbiotic reactors the aggregation phenomenon was most evident in r2 fig 5 b2 the content of pn and ps in lb eps and tb eps both increased with the increase of operation time and the increase of pn was significantly much higher than that of ps fig 4 on the 20th day the content of pn in lb eps increased by 47 05 52 55 11 46 8 68 28 65 and 4 84 in each reactor respectively the content of pn in tb eps increased by 97 81 99 02 52 34 33 29 70 17 and 42 06 respectively among them the largest increment was observed in r2 which may be due to the large increase of extracellular enzymes which provided a good pathway for the transport of ammonia nitrogen phosphorus and antibiotics 44 meanwhile huang et al showed that the reduction of the pn ps ratio was negatively correlated with the increase of bacterial activity sour 21 in the system inoculated with bacteria the higher the sour the lower the pn ps where the pn ps of r2 was the lowest for both lb eps and tb eps at 2 83 and 3 26 respectively you et al suggested that intercellular contact and adhesion of extracellular polymers are the primary conditions for the removal of antibiotics by the bacterial algal consortium 45 faced with the threat of antibiotics the acute response of eps helps bacteria resist environmental stress and maintain metabolic behavior thus providing a better survival state for the bacteriophage system after exposure to antibiotics 46 ps in eps can improve the tolerance of algae and bacteriophages to antibiotics laying the foundation for subsequent removal of antibiotics antibiotics diffuse slowly in ps or glycoproteins with diffusion values of only 36 76 of their values in water which protect and mitigate acute cellular damage from antibiotics 47 pn also plays an important role in antibiotic transport 44 which can improve oxygen utilization and enhance enzyme activity in bacterial algal symbiotic communities 48 facilitating the removal of antibiotics 3 6 high throughput analysis to investigate the effect of inoculation ratio on the microbial community we performed the diversity and structure analysis of the microbial community in five reactors containing activated sludge at the end of the experiment the 20th day the taxonomic attribution of the phylum level of dominant bacteria is shown in fig 6a the main bacteria in each reactor were proteobacteria mainly α proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes and cyanobacteria among them proteobacteria accounted for the most 72 83 77 19 67 63 63 54 and 56 15 respectively followed by the bacteroidetes with 10 28 9 77 10 37 10 94 and 19 77 respectively zhang et al showed that continuous exposure to tc and smx decreased the abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes in sludge 49 in the zhou et al study with the growth of algae the growth of bacteroidetes was inhibited while the growth of proteobacteria was promoted 50 in this study the inhibition of proteobacteria was remarkable at inoculation ratios above 3 this may be because the lower the activity of algae and activated sludge when the inoculation ratio exceeds 3 the pressure of antibiotics on the system can only be borne by the activated sludge with more biomass meanwhile under high salinity conditions the proteobacteria was a reliable participant in the removal of organic matter and nitrogen especially the α and β proteobacteria 51 bacteroidetes and γ proteobacteria were also found to play a key role in denitrification under high salinity conditions 52 in lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors the proteobacteria was the dominant phylum accounting for about 40 to 50 of the total bacteria and also dominated the activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants 53 the abundance of proteobacteria in r2 was the highest among all systems so the best performance for the treatment of smx and nitrogen and phosphorus removal in mariculture wastewater planctomycetes are common settlers of macroalgae in the three phyla chlorophyta green algae rhodophyta red algae and heterokontophyta brown algae and can take molecules produced or released by algae as a rich source of the substrate also as heterotrophs planctomycetes produce inorganic compounds to satisfy the nutritional requirements of macroalgae by mineralizing organic molecules 54 planctomycetes were reported to be involved in the mineralization of algal biomass and nitrogen removal 55 and had variable resistance to sulfamethoxazole methoprene combinations 56 the r2 system with an inoculum ratio of 3 contained the highest planctomycetes content of 11 78 and exhibited higher removal of ammonia nitrogen and degradation of sulfamethoxazole than the other systems fig 6b presents the taxonomic attribution at the level of dominant bacterial genera in the combined bacterial algal and pure mud systems among them ruegeria aestuariicoccus unclassified f rhodobacteraceaeg albirhodobacter and defluviimonas all belong to the marine rhodobacteraceae family of α proteobacteria marine rhodobacteraceae has been reported to be important members of the marine microbiome accounting for 40 of marine prokaryotic dna promoting initial colonization and biofilm formation of other bacterial species through indirect contact and as excellent biofilm forming organisms 57 also the marine rhodobacteraceae served as the main vitamin supplier to the primary producers of vb12 nutrient deficient prokaryotes and eukaryotes such as green algae diatoms methanogens coccolithophores and brown algae 58 and vb12 was an essential growth factor for many algae the r2 system contained the highest abundance of bacteria belonging to the rhodobacteraceae which might increase the activity of chlorella and promote the production of eps in the bacteria algae symbiosis system allowing easier signal exchange between bacteria and algae since rhodobacteraceae also played an essential role in the sulfur cycle of the ocean 59 this might have facilitated the breakage of so in smx allowing higher degradation rates of smx ruegeria is saline heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria involved in denitrification 60 aestuariicoccus albirhodobacter defluviimonas and denitromonas of the rhodocyclaceae family of the γ proteobacteria all belong to denitrifying bacteria 61 65 sm1a02 of the phylum planctomycetes was considered a new anaerobic amine oxidizing bacteria 66 and was discovered in many activated sludges with good nitrification performance 67 the above six species of bacteria in total accounted for 56 34 r1 61 34 r2 53 75 r3 45 59 r4 and 38 31 r6 in each system in agreement with the previous denitrification effect this indicated that the inoculum of activated sludge affected the microbial community of the system and the addition of marine chlorella increased the abundance of the microbial community the existence of nitrifying bacteria denitrifying bacteria and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria demonstrated from the microscopic point of view that after the co cultivation an aerobic anoxic anaerobic environmental gradient was formed within the bacterial algal colloid which maximized the use of oxygen and promoted the process of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in symbiotic systems too low or too high inoculation ratios were unfavorable to increase the abundance of ammonifying nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in the bacterial algal colloids thus reducing the denitrification efficiency due to the hypersaline nature of mariculture wastewater salt tolerant bacteria became the dominant genus and xanthomarina could play an important role in salt resistance 68 as well as degrading pahs and dissolving phosphate 69 chryseolinea belonging to the mycobacterium colletotrichum facilitated the secretion of ps and markedly correlated with lb eps and tb eps 70 xu et al revealed that chryseolinea was the main bacterial genus that maintained the granulation state of sludge and could enhance the sedimentation of sludge by increasing the denseness of sludge flocculation 71 also this bacteria is crucial for the phosphorus uptake and release process 70 notably we also identified norank f microscillaceae which could degrade smx efficiently norank f microscillaceae was reported to be sensitive to the increase of smx concentration and favorable to degrading high concentrations of smx 72 the abundance of norank f microscillaceae in each reactor was r1 0 59 r2 1 52 r3 1 07 r4 0 65 and r6 0 53 respectively with the highest in r2 it indicated that the bacterial algal inoculation ratio of 3 was the most potent and efficient for the degradation of smx 3 7 mechanisms of removing pollutants by bass according to the analysis of the previous experimental results the bass treated pollutants in mariculture wastewater effectively fig 7 demonstrates the mechanism of the bass in treating pollutants in mariculture wastewater algae and bacteria deliver o2 co2 and vb12 to each other for metabolism to further enhance material exchange and signal transmission they formed bacterial algal colloids from the inner to outer anaerobic zone anoxic zone and aerobic zone through secreting extracellular polymers to maximize oxygen utilization and fully stimulate bacterial and algal activity cod was absorbed and degraded by heterotrophic bacteria part of the nitrogen and phosphorus were absorbed by algal cell bio assimilation bacteria complete denitrification by ammonification nitrification and denitrification and assimilate phosphate by absorption during the photooxygenation phase in addition to biosorption by algae and bacteria most of smx was transported and diffused by proteins and polysaccharides to the interior of the bacterial algal colloids for biodegradation the hydrolysis of high activity algae releasing large amounts of oh is an essential prerequisite for smx to undergo degradation however too high or too low inoculation ratios of bacteria and algae are not conducive to the effective exchange of substances between bacteria and algae resulting in the reduction of both activities and the inability to form tightly linked bacteria algae colloids therefore it also failed to form a symbiotic system with a higher abundance of functional bacteria leading to lower efficiency in treating pollutants when the inoculation ratio of bacteria and algae was 3 the activity of bacteria and algae was higher and it was easier to form bacterial algal colloids containing various functional bacteria to achieve efficient removal of pollutants 4 conclusion the symbiotic system of marine chlorella and activated sludge could effectively remove pollutants in mariculture wastewater the optimal inoculation ratio of bacteria and algae was 3 the removal rates of cod nh4 n po4 3 p and smx could reach 96 22 92 4 94 56 and 95 06 respectively the higher bacterial algal activity and eps secretion made it easier to form bacterial algal colloids from the inner to outer anaerobic zone anoxic zone and aerobic zone successively achieving an efficient denitrification symbiosis system with the simultaneous existence of nitrifying bacteria denitrifying bacteria and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria the high activity of microalgae promotes the release of hydroxyl groups during hydrolysis and provides the prerequisite for the degradation of smx the proteins and polysaccharides in eps provide support for the transportation and diffusion of smx which is the subsequent power for further degradation of smx an appropriate ratio of bacteria to algae inoculum ratio of 3 was beneficial for screening the system with a higher abundance of functional bacteria for nitrogen and phosphorus removal and increasing the abundance of smx degrading bacteria norak f microscillaceae declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12477,in this study we investigated the effect of different inoculation ratios of the suspended state bacterial algal symbiosis system bass on the treatment of pollutants in mariculture wastewater the inoculation ratio of 3 sludge algae 360 mg l 120 mg l performed best resulting in removal efficiencies of 96 22 92 43 94 56 and 95 06 for cod nitrogen phosphorus and sulfamethoxazole smx respectively an appropriate inoculation ratio sludge algae 3 would increase not only the activity of algae and bacteria 12 86 μmol o2 mg chl a h for sogr and 28 17 mgo2 g mlvss h for sour but also facilitate the secretion of extracellular polymers and the formation of bacterial algal colloids achieving simultaneous nitrification denitrification high throughput sequencing results showed that the functional bacteria could constitute a complete aerobic anoxic anaerobic environmental gradient to achieve maximum oxygen utilization and a higher abundance of sulfamethoxazole degrading bacteria norak f microscillaceae could be cultivated by changing the inoculum ratio therefore this study provides new ideas for the treatment of mariculture wastewater containing antibiotics and the green development of the mariculture industry graphical abstract mechanism diagram of pollutant removal by bacteria algal symbiosis system unlabelled image keywords inoculation ratio bacterial algal symbiotic system bacterial algal colloids sulfamethoxazole data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction china the single largest producer and consumer of seafood accounted for 54 6 of world aquaculture production by 2012 1 and reached 38 13 million tons of seafood consumption by 2018 during mariculture large amounts of animal excreta and unused feed were directly discharged into the environment which can cause a dramatic increase in the level of pollutants e g nitrogen phosphorus and cod in the water column resulting in eutrophication of the water column 2 also aquaculture feeds often contain antibiotics for the treatment of fish and shrimp diseases about 70 80 of antibiotics failed to be used posing a serious threat to the aquatic environment 3 among them sulfonamides were one of the antibiotics with a high detection rate in aquaculture wastewater 4 in actual aquaculture wastewater the sulfamethoxazole detection concentrations varied widely from ng l to mg l depending on the season and sampling site 5 and even up to 5 57 mg l in the mariculture water environment 6 in 2019 the chinese government put forward the opinion of green and healthy development for the aquaculture industry requiring that pollutants in aquaculture wastewater should be effectively removed before discharge and the recycling of aquaculture wastewater should be realized in 2020 jiangsu province of china released the discharge standards for mariculture wastewater including cod 10 mg l tn 3 mg l and tp 0 5 mg l currently the main conventional adsorption and advanced oxidation methods are used to farm wastewater which is effective for nitrogen phosphorus and cod removal but the drawbacks of these two exist and do not comply with the requirements of the environmental cycle the adsorption method transfers pollutants to another system without achieving the final treatment of pollutants and the treatment and regeneration of adsorbent materials is an essential concern 7 advanced oxidation methods are limited by harsh reaction conditions and high operating costs 8 and the formation of hypobromous acid and hypobromite ions from the reaction of ozone with bromine ions in brackish freshwater and seawater systems are toxic to fish and shellfish in contrast biological methods have a less environmental impact lower economic costs and are more effective for antibiotic removal liu et al used a horizontally submerged artificial wetland to achieve 80 and 50 removal of ammonia nitrogen and sulfamethoxazole from culture wastewater respectively 9 however there are also disadvantages of artificial wetlands such as large footprint and long treatment time recently technology based on bacterial algal symbiosis system bass for pollutant removal has been emerged algae produce oxygen through photosynthesis feeding bacteria for mineralization bacteria in activated sludge release co2 through respiration supplying the microalgae for photosynthesis 10 11 through this symbiotic mechanism the bacterial algal symbiosis provides higher removal of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus than conventional activated sludge li et al used the bass to treat low c n ratio pig wastewater and found that the removal of nh4 n and po4 3 p by the symbiosis system was increased by 53 84 and 43 52 respectively compared to the conventional activated sludge system 12 14 meanwhile the bass was more tolerant to antibiotics and more efficient for antibiotic removal 15 based on the complementary symbiotic conditions of bacteria and algae the initial inoculation ratio of algae and bacteria may affect the removal rate of the symbiotic system sepehri et al showed that a 10 90 inoculation ratio of common c vulgaris to activated sludge nas enriched with nitrifying bacteria could yield 100 removal of ammonia nitrogen 16 in the study of su et al the highest nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies of 91 0 7 0 and 93 5 2 5 respectively were achieved with an inoculation ratio of 5 1 algae sludge 17 since light is known to be crucial for algal growth high activated sludge concentrations can cause light shading phenomena that can have an inhibitory effect on algae bai et al applied different concentrations of pig manure sludge for algae production and found low algal production in undiluted liquid manure 18 to achieve a mechanism of symbiosis between bacteria and algae the bacterial algal inoculation ratio is a major factor however relevant studies on the effect of bacterial algal inoculation ratio on the treatment of mariculture wastewater are not available and no studies on antibiotic removal have been reported in this study we investigated a suspended bacterial algal symbiosis system consisting of marine chlorella and salt tolerant activated sludge co culture with sulfamethoxazole selected as the target antibiotic to explore the removal of pollutants from mariculture wastewater under different inoculation ratios of bacteria and algae also the microbial activity extracellular polymer secretion and microbial community were compared to derive the best inoculation ratio to lay the theoretical basis for the practical application of the project 2 methods and materials 2 1 chlorella expansion marine chlorella gy h4 chlorella sp was purchased from shanghai guangyu biotechnology co and cultured in bg11 medium the seeds were inoculated in a 500 ml conical flask according to the volume ratio of algal liquid medium 1 5 and placed in a light incubator with a temperature of 25 c a light of 2500 lux and a light dark ratio of 12 12 for expansion the growth of algal cells was detected daily by uv spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 680 nm and the equation of the correlation function between od680 and the dry weight of marine chlorella was obtained as shown in eq 1 1 dry weight g l 0 3416 3x 0 00563 r 2 0 99 854 2 2 acclimation of salt tolerance of activated sludge aerobic activated sludge was obtained from guangzhou nancun sewage treatment plant the salinity of wastewater was adjusted from 0 to 3 by adding sea crystal and salt tolerant activated sludge was obtained after 60 days of acclimation and cultivation the activated sludge was used as inoculum in this experiment 500 ml volume conical flasks were employed as sbr reactors six different algal sludge ratio reactors were obtained by fixing the chlorella inoculum and varying the salt tolerant activated sludge inoculum at 25 c 4500 lux and 12 12 light dark ratio i e marine chlorella activated sludge dry weight ratio 1 1 120 mg l 120 mg l 1 3 120 mg l 360 mg l 1 5 120 mg l 600 mg l

to stir at 200 rpm min 24 h is one cycle 22 h stirring 100 min settling 10 min discharge 10 min inlet due to the poor sediment ability of algae and to avoid excessive loss of algae no water was drained on the first day of the experiment and contaminants were incorporated as mother liquor and the subsequent daily volume exchange rate was 25 the total volume of experimental mariculture

the beginning and the end of the experiment 2 4 characterization of chlorella activity and microbial activity in this experiment the growth of chlorella was measured by chlorophyll a which was determined using 95 ethanol the microbiological activity was measured by taking the bacteria algae mixture at the 20th day the photosynthetic oxygen production rate sogr of the bacterial algal mixture was measured using the black and white bottle method to characterize marine chlorella activity 20 total bacterial activity aob activity and nob activity of each reactor were expressed as specific oxygen consumption uptake rate sour saur snur 21 2 5 eps extraction and scanning electron microscopy sem eps mainly consisted of loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps 22 lb eps and tb

total organic carbon toc protein pn and polysaccharides ps toc was measured by a toc analyzer toc lcph cpn shimadzu pn was measured according to the lowry method 25 ps content was determined by the

high throughput sequencing at the end of the experiment the 20th day the experimental group inoculated with sludge was taken for high throughput sequencing the sequencing of microbial diversity was performed by majorbio biopharmaceutical technology shanghai china the basic sequencing process consists of dna extraction pcr amplification product purification quantification and homogenization of pcr products sequencing library construction and double end sequencing the universal primer pairs 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvggtatctaatcc 3 were used to amplify the bacterial 16s rrna region targeting the v3 v4 region 27 the pcr products were then sequenced on the illumina miseq platform bioinformatics analysis was performed on the majorbio i sanger https cloud majorbio com 2 7 statistical analysis all tests were conducted in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of the results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 algal growth ph and do changes the growth of algae was monitored by detecting the chlorophyll a content as shown in fig 1a during the 20 day of experiment the chlorophyll a content of each experimental group inoculated with chlorella showed an increasing trend the concentrations of r1 r2 r3 r4 and r5 increased from 1 8 mg l at the 0th day to 4 73 mg l 4 53 mg l 4 14 mg l 3 85 mg l and 4 68 mg l at the 20th day respectively in r1 r4 as sludge concentration increased the rate of chlorophyll a increase was lower this indicated that the increase of sludge concentration showed a negative correlation with the growing of chlorella the shading effect of a high concentration of sludge on light inhibited the availability of light to algae resulting in an increase in oxygen consumption by algal cells performing dark respiration and low chlorophyll production due to low photosynthetic efficiency however the inclusion of activated sludge promoted the growth of chlorella to some extent in bass ph and dissolved oxygen showed a positive correlation with chlorophyll a bacterial respiration and mineralization consume o2 and release co2 and algae not only supply o2 but also absorb co2 the higher the sludge content the higher the o2 demand and the lower the dissolved oxygen in the water at the same time the sludge shaded the light and the photo inhibited algal cells lacking chlorophyll were unable to quickly capture and convert light energy into atp making the algae less efficient in assimilating co2 in the dark reaction stage and enriched carbonate ions in the water therefore the higher the sludge concentration the lower the ph value while there was no co2 internal supplier in the pure algae system r5 the ph value continued to rise 3 2 pollutant removal the removal performance of pollutants from mariculture wastewater was studied for 20 d with different inoculation ratios of bass marine chlorella alone and activated sludge alone system 3 2 1 removal of nutrients fig 2a investigates the effect of mono and co culture systems on the removal of cod from mariculture wastewater the cod removal rates of the co culture system r1 r4 were 90 85 96 22 91 96 and 88 76 at day 20 respectively compared with the pure algae system 63 1 and pure sludge system 59 7 the symbiotic system showed a higher cod removal rate in general the removal of cod in activated sludge systems mainly depended on the metabolism of heterotrophic bacteria and the concentration of do was one of the limitations for the uptake and degradation of cod by heterotrophic aerobic bacteria 28 the addition of algae provided the symbiotic system with an o2 provider which contributed to the mineralization of heterotrophic bacteria and improved cod removal in contrast in r3 and r4 where the biomass was higher the ability of chlorella to capture light energy would be limited by the sludge concentration and would never be able to provide the do required to meet the normal metabolism of all heterotrophic bacteria in the system resulting in poor removal of cod in r1 where the sludge volume is the lowest cod removal efficiency was limited by the low content of heterotrophic bacteria also the sludge shading effect on light was weak while chlorella would gradually become the main body of the system with the highest chlorophyll a content of 4 7 mg l showing a lower removal effect on cod the efficiency of carbon dioxide release from carbon source by bacteria and the efficiency of oxygen production by photosynthesis of microalgae limited each other by changing the inoculation ratio the equilibrium point between bacteria and algae could be found to minimize the effect produced by this limitation and eventually achieve an efficient and stable cod removal efficiency in this study the r2 system always maintained a stable and efficient cod removal efficiency which was always above 94 the cod removal rate in the pure sludge system r6 showed a trend of rising and then falling most likely due to anoxia which led to the decomposition of heterotrophic aerobic bacteria by other bacteria and a decrease in activated sludge activity resulting in cod accumulation the phosphate removal efficiency is shown in fig 2b phosphorus is an essential nutrient in the metabolism of algae most of the inorganic phosphorus hpo4 2 or h2po was phosphorylated by microalgae to synthesize organic compounds namely adenosine diphosphate adp for the final synthesis of atp 29 phosphorus is one of the main causes of water blooms in natural water bodies therefore with no other competitors the r5 system provided the best environment for algae growth and could achieve 97 56 phosphorus removal with the help of the luxurious uptake mechanism of microalgae 30 the remaining groups performed in the following order for phosphorus removal r1 85 43 r2 94 56 r3 79 64 and r4 65 04 when the inoculum ratio exceeded 3 the phosphorus removal efficiency exhibited a significant decreasing trend which was largely attributed to the lack of o2 among the experimental groups with imbalanced inoculation ratios of algae to activated sludge the aerobic environment required by bacteria to convert phosphate to polyphosphate could not be reached even in the light phase and phosphate assimilation was limited by bacterial respiration when the light disappeared the bacteria released polyphosphate again in an anoxic environment this explained the fluctuations in phosphate removal efficiency by the end of the experiment for the r6 system which was not oxygenated by chlorella the lack of oxygen limited even more the aerobic phosphorus uptake by the polyphosphate bacteria and the release of phosphate was not present in addition phosphate precipitation occurring above ph 8 5 was responsible for the lower removal rate in r1 at a ph of about 9 0 thus it is evident that the bacterial algal inoculation ratio is crucial for the interaction between bacteria and microalgae and is the main factor in regulating do and ph in the system in this experiment the best phosphorus removal was achieved with an inoculation ratio of 3 fig 2c shows the changes in tn removal efficiency the trend of nitrogen removal by each experimental group always maintained a steady increase on the 10th day the reactors containing chlorella reached the highest nitrogen removal efficiency which was r1 81 42 r2 92 43 r3 80 07 r4 76 43 and r5 58 49 respectively it was discovered that r2 had a much higher treatment capacity than the other systems indicating that selecting an appropriate inoculation ratio of bacteria and algae was an important factor in improving the efficiency of the symbiotic system in treating mariculture wastewater subsequently we examined the mass concentrations of each nitrogen form fig c1 c5 in the effluent water on five different days 4th 8th 12th 16th and 20th to observe the nitrogen transformation pathway the overall decreasing trend in ammonia nitrogen concentration in the symbiotic system over time was achieved mainly through algal bio assimilation and microbial nitrification however the inoculation ratio directly affected the magnitude and rate of ammonia nitrogen reduction in the effluent the higher the concentration of inoculated sludge the more significant the limitation of microalgae growth the lower the do supply and the lower the efficiency of ammonia nitrogen microbial transformation when the inoculated sludge concentration was too low the microbial amount was low nitrification was slow and algae became the main absorber when the inoculation ratio was 3 the nh4 n content of the effluent remained low and reached 0 mg l on the 8th day indicating that the inoculum of the organisms was the main reason for the ammonia nitrogen oxidation rate the symbiotic system accumulated no2 n on the 4th day which could be attributed to the inhibition of nitrosating and nitrifying bacteria by free ammonia fa and the rapid consumption of substrate by heterotrophic bacteria resulting in too low c n 31 after this the system showed more nitrogen loss and a small amount of no3 n excluding the part assimilated by algae we inferred that the whole denitrification process was a simultaneous nitrification denitrification process bacteria and algae continuously secrete extracellular polymers to form bonds to mutually adsorb and utilize beneficial substances resulting in a bacterial algal colloid with bacteria as the main body and algae as the substrate bacterial algal colloids formed more easily with a 3 1 inoculation ratio resulting in the rapid generation of an aerobic anoxic anaerobic environmental gradient from the surface to the interior simultaneous nitrification denitrification maximized oxygen utilization and almost 0 mg l no2 n and a small amount of no3 n appeared which benefited from the efficient denitrification of the system the nitrogen removal efficiency decreased during the later stages of the experiment owing to a small increase in no3 n this could be attributed to the higher dissolved oxygen in the system inhibiting the reductase activity of denitrifying bacteria resulting in low denitrification efficiency 3 2 2 removal of sulfamethoxazole fig 2d demonstrates the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole under different bacterial algal ratio conditions at the beginning of the stabilization period on day 10 r1 r2 r3 and r4 removed 92 79 95 06 89 48 and 88 4 of sulfamethoxazole respectively while r5 and r6 only had 36 8 and 24 91 the removal of antibiotics by the symbiotic system was increased by 56 4 66 49 when compared to the monoculture system this indicated that sulfamethoxazole could be removed more efficiently from mariculture wastewater by using a combined culture of bacteria and algae aydin et al constructed a symbiotic system of bacteria and algae after adding rainfed red algae to the mbr which increased the removal rate of tetracycline from 69 75 to 89 73 32 smx removal was consistently higher in r2 than that in the other reactors suggesting that a suitable sludge inoculum aids in smx removal in this study the highest smx removal efficiency was achieved when the bacterial algal inoculation ratio was 3 which corresponded to the nitrogen and phosphorus removal ratios this could be because the activity of both aob and nob was higher at this inoculation ratio than at others ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa have been reported to be closely related to the degradation and removal of ppcps 33 kassotaki et al revealed that the addition of an ammonia oxidation inhibitor atu to the sbr reactor with a nitrification function reduced the removal efficiency of smx directly from 98 to 0 34 the pk a of smx was 5 6 6 6 when ph was higher than pk a smx existed in negatively charged form which would be rejected by negatively charged microalgal cells 35 meanwhile the logkow of smx was lower than 1 with 0 89 which exhibited hydrophilic qualities that lead to limited adsorption binding to cells 36 da silva rodrigues et al revealed a very low biosorption of 1 26 for smx by the bacterial algal symbiotic system 37 besides hydroxyl radicals could react with smx and promote the biodegradation of smx hydroxyl radicals were generated in the bacterial algal symbiotic system mainly from the following three sources the interaction of nitrate with sunlight 8 the reaction of cl and cl 2 in the seawater matrix 38 and the hydrolysis accompanying the photosynthesis of microalgae therefore most smx was removed by biodegradation 2 no 3 no 3 no 2 o no 2 ho ho 3 oh cl hcl cl cl 2 in conclusion with an algae inoculation ratio of 3 the gradient utilization of do produced by chlorella was achieved without additional aeration resulting in a dynamically balanced symbiotic relationship between bacteria and microalgae and the best pollutant removal efficiency 3 3 changes of mlss mlvss and mlvss mlss the changes of mlss mlvss and mlvss mlss for each experimental group before and after the experiment with different inoculation ratios are shown in table 1 after 20 days of cultivation the dry weight mlss of each reactor increased by r1 211 6 r2 183 5 r3 120 1 r4 74 0 r5 180 3 and r6 70 1 respectively and the biomass mlvss increased by r1 201 8 r2 188 5 r3 107 5 r4 58 3 r5 176 8 and r6 30 5 this indicated that the growth rate of algae was higher than that of activated sludge and the addition of algae promoted the growth of the microorganisms in system however the growth rate of dry weight and biomass of each reactor was negatively correlated with the sludge concentration this was because the weakening effect of sludge on light led to the reduction of photosynthetic efficiency of microalgae and the limitation of bacterial growth mlvss mlss expressed the proportion of microorganisms in the bacteria algae mixture which could reflect the activity of overall microorganisms 24 only in r2 the value of mlvss mlss increased from 0 886 to 0 902 and decreased in the rest of the experimental groups this indicated that the inoculation ratio of bacteria and algae of 3 was most suitable for the co growth of microalgae and activated sludge which contributed to the improvement of the microbial activity of the system 3 4 microbial activity fig 3a shows the algal activity at the end of the experiment the 20th day with different inoculation ratios the r2 reactor showed the highest oalgal activity with 12 86 μmol o2 mg chl a h followed by r1 with 10 18 μmol o2 mg chl a h both higher than the r5 pure algae reactor with 11 28 μmol o2 mg chl a h this indicated that the addition of activated sludge can increase algal activity activated sludge was also shown to improve algal viability and photosynthetic efficiency in the experiments of xu et al 39 however the photosynthetic oxygen production rates of algae in r3 and r4 were only 9 92 μmol o2 mg chl a h and 7 77 μmol o2 mg chl a h this could be due to the excessively activated sludge inoculum which has an enhanced light shading effect and slows down the algal photosynthetic rate contributing to reduced activity meanwhile algal photosynthesis is accompanied by hydrolysis which results in the production of large amounts of hydroxyls oh which peng et al suggested as a major conversion pathway for the biodegradation of organic matter by microalgae 40 therefore algal activity is an essential prerequisite for smx to undergo biodegradation the bacterial activity at the end of the experiment with different inoculation ratios is shown in fig 3b it was discovered that the r2 reactor had a higher microbial than the other reactors as well as higher activity of denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria the algae produce oxygen through a photosynthetic process which can be used by aerobic bacteria such as denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria to promote nitrogen uptake and conversion in r2 the highest total aerobic rate of microorganisms was 28 17 mgo2 g mlvss h this further indicated that in this experiment a bacterial algal inoculation ratio of 3 was the optimum condition for bacterial algal symbiosis and that both bacterial and algal activity are inhibited above or below this inoculum ratio the bacterial activity in r6 was only 9 02 mgo2 g mlvss h in the absence of oxygen supplied by chlorella whereas the bacterial activity in the r4 reactor was 1 3 times higher due to the inoculation of chlorella this partly suggested that the interaction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes may contribute to bioactivity 41 remarkably saur was consistently higher than snur in all experimental groups light had a strong inhibitory effect on nob it has been reported that nob was more light sensitive than aob and that aob recovered more easily from photoinhibition and became more light tolerant all of which contributed to the establishment of stable nitrification 42 3 5 eps analysis table 2 shows the content of loose extracellular polymer lb eps and compact extracellular polymer tb eps in each reactor at different inoculation ratios on day 0 and day 20 respectively both lb eps and tb eps increased in each system compared to day 0 up to day 20 lb eps increased by r1 8 95 mg g mlvss r2 15 89 mg g mlvss r3 3 91 mg g mlvss r4 2 88 mg g mlvss r5 8 02 mg g mlvss and r6 3 78 mg g mlvss respectively and tb eps eps increased by r1 10 2 mg g mlvss r2 18 67 mg g mlvss r3 6 31 mg g mlvss r4 4 64 mg g mlvss r5 6 61 mg g mlvss and r6 1 39 mg g mlvss respectively the increment of secreted eps in r2 was the largest and could reach 2 5 times of the other experimental groups it had been demonstrated that the increase of eps content had a positive effect on the removal of pollutants and the improvement of microbial activity 23 43 the scanning electron micrographs of each symbiotic system before and after the experiment were shown in fig 5 after 20 d of co culture chlorella was transformed from floating on the surface of activated sludge to being wrapped by activated sludge or bonded to each other the formation of bacterial algal colloids was facilitated by the aggregation phenomenon of chlorella and sludge achieved by secreting eps 43 among all symbiotic reactors the aggregation phenomenon was most evident in r2 fig 5 b2 the content of pn and ps in lb eps and tb eps both increased with the increase of operation time and the increase of pn was significantly much higher than that of ps fig 4 on the 20th day the content of pn in lb eps increased by 47 05 52 55 11 46 8 68 28 65 and 4 84 in each reactor respectively the content of pn in tb eps increased by 97 81 99 02 52 34 33 29 70 17 and 42 06 respectively among them the largest increment was observed in r2 which may be due to the large increase of extracellular enzymes which provided a good pathway for the transport of ammonia nitrogen phosphorus and antibiotics 44 meanwhile huang et al showed that the reduction of the pn ps ratio was negatively correlated with the increase of bacterial activity sour 21 in the system inoculated with bacteria the higher the sour the lower the pn ps where the pn ps of r2 was the lowest for both lb eps and tb eps at 2 83 and 3 26 respectively you et al suggested that intercellular contact and adhesion of extracellular polymers are the primary conditions for the removal of antibiotics by the bacterial algal consortium 45 faced with the threat of antibiotics the acute response of eps helps bacteria resist environmental stress and maintain metabolic behavior thus providing a better survival state for the bacteriophage system after exposure to antibiotics 46 ps in eps can improve the tolerance of algae and bacteriophages to antibiotics laying the foundation for subsequent removal of antibiotics antibiotics diffuse slowly in ps or glycoproteins with diffusion values of only 36 76 of their values in water which protect and mitigate acute cellular damage from antibiotics 47 pn also plays an important role in antibiotic transport 44 which can improve oxygen utilization and enhance enzyme activity in bacterial algal symbiotic communities 48 facilitating the removal of antibiotics 3 6 high throughput analysis to investigate the effect of inoculation ratio on the microbial community we performed the diversity and structure analysis of the microbial community in five reactors containing activated sludge at the end of the experiment the 20th day the taxonomic attribution of the phylum level of dominant bacteria is shown in fig 6a the main bacteria in each reactor were proteobacteria mainly α proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria bacteroidetes planctomycetes and cyanobacteria among them proteobacteria accounted for the most 72 83 77 19 67 63 63 54 and 56 15 respectively followed by the bacteroidetes with 10 28 9 77 10 37 10 94 and 19 77 respectively zhang et al showed that continuous exposure to tc and smx decreased the abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes in sludge 49 in the zhou et al study with the growth of algae the growth of bacteroidetes was inhibited while the growth of proteobacteria was promoted 50 in this study the inhibition of proteobacteria was remarkable at inoculation ratios above 3 this may be because the lower the activity of algae and activated sludge when the inoculation ratio exceeds 3 the pressure of antibiotics on the system can only be borne by the activated sludge with more biomass meanwhile under high salinity conditions the proteobacteria was a reliable participant in the removal of organic matter and nitrogen especially the α and β proteobacteria 51 bacteroidetes and γ proteobacteria were also found to play a key role in denitrification under high salinity conditions 52 in lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors the proteobacteria was the dominant phylum accounting for about 40 to 50 of the total bacteria and also dominated the activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants 53 the abundance of proteobacteria in r2 was the highest among all systems so the best performance for the treatment of smx and nitrogen and phosphorus removal in mariculture wastewater planctomycetes are common settlers of macroalgae in the three phyla chlorophyta green algae rhodophyta red algae and heterokontophyta brown algae and can take molecules produced or released by algae as a rich source of the substrate also as heterotrophs planctomycetes produce inorganic compounds to satisfy the nutritional requirements of macroalgae by mineralizing organic molecules 54 planctomycetes were reported to be involved in the mineralization of algal biomass and nitrogen removal 55 and had variable resistance to sulfamethoxazole methoprene combinations 56 the r2 system with an inoculum ratio of 3 contained the highest planctomycetes content of 11 78 and exhibited higher removal of ammonia nitrogen and degradation of sulfamethoxazole than the other systems fig 6b presents the taxonomic attribution at the level of dominant bacterial genera in the combined bacterial algal and pure mud systems among them ruegeria aestuariicoccus unclassified f rhodobacteraceaeg albirhodobacter and defluviimonas all belong to the marine rhodobacteraceae family of α proteobacteria marine rhodobacteraceae has been reported to be important members of the marine microbiome accounting for 40 of marine prokaryotic dna promoting initial colonization and biofilm formation of other bacterial species through indirect contact and as excellent biofilm forming organisms 57 also the marine rhodobacteraceae served as the main vitamin supplier to the primary producers of vb12 nutrient deficient prokaryotes and eukaryotes such as green algae diatoms methanogens coccolithophores and brown algae 58 and vb12 was an essential growth factor for many algae the r2 system contained the highest abundance of bacteria belonging to the rhodobacteraceae which might increase the activity of chlorella and promote the production of eps in the bacteria algae symbiosis system allowing easier signal exchange between bacteria and algae since rhodobacteraceae also played an essential role in the sulfur cycle of the ocean 59 this might have facilitated the breakage of so in smx allowing higher degradation rates of smx ruegeria is saline heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria involved in denitrification 60 aestuariicoccus albirhodobacter defluviimonas and denitromonas of the rhodocyclaceae family of the γ proteobacteria all belong to denitrifying bacteria 61 65 sm1a02 of the phylum planctomycetes was considered a new anaerobic amine oxidizing bacteria 66 and was discovered in many activated sludges with good nitrification performance 67 the above six species of bacteria in total accounted for 56 34 r1 61 34 r2 53 75 r3 45 59 r4 and 38 31 r6 in each system in agreement with the previous denitrification effect this indicated that the inoculum of activated sludge affected the microbial community of the system and the addition of marine chlorella increased the abundance of the microbial community the existence of nitrifying bacteria denitrifying bacteria and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria demonstrated from the microscopic point of view that after the co cultivation an aerobic anoxic anaerobic environmental gradient was formed within the bacterial algal colloid which maximized the use of oxygen and promoted the process of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in symbiotic systems too low or too high inoculation ratios were unfavorable to increase the abundance of ammonifying nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in the bacterial algal colloids thus reducing the denitrification efficiency due to the hypersaline nature of mariculture wastewater salt tolerant bacteria became the dominant genus and xanthomarina could play an important role in salt resistance 68 as well as degrading pahs and dissolving phosphate 69 chryseolinea belonging to the mycobacterium colletotrichum facilitated the secretion of ps and markedly correlated with lb eps and tb eps 70 xu et al revealed that chryseolinea was the main bacterial genus that maintained the granulation state of sludge and could enhance the sedimentation of sludge by increasing the denseness of sludge flocculation 71 also this bacteria is crucial for the phosphorus uptake and release process 70 notably we also identified norank f microscillaceae which could degrade smx efficiently norank f microscillaceae was reported to be sensitive to the increase of smx concentration and favorable to degrading high concentrations of smx 72 the abundance of norank f microscillaceae in each reactor was r1 0 59 r2 1 52 r3 1 07 r4 0 65 and r6 0 53 respectively with the highest in r2 it indicated that the bacterial algal inoculation ratio of 3 was the most potent and efficient for the degradation of smx 3 7 mechanisms of removing pollutants by bass according to the analysis of the previous experimental results the bass treated pollutants in mariculture wastewater effectively fig 7 demonstrates the mechanism of the bass in treating pollutants in mariculture wastewater algae and bacteria deliver o2 co2 and vb12 to each other for metabolism to further enhance material exchange and signal transmission they formed bacterial algal colloids from the inner to outer anaerobic zone anoxic zone and aerobic zone through secreting extracellular polymers to maximize oxygen utilization and fully stimulate bacterial and algal activity cod was absorbed and degraded by heterotrophic bacteria part of the nitrogen and phosphorus were absorbed by algal cell bio assimilation bacteria complete denitrification by ammonification nitrification and denitrification and assimilate phosphate by absorption during the photooxygenation phase in addition to biosorption by algae and bacteria most of smx was transported and diffused by proteins and polysaccharides to the interior of the bacterial algal colloids for biodegradation the hydrolysis of high activity algae releasing large amounts of oh is an essential prerequisite for smx to undergo degradation however too high or too low inoculation ratios of bacteria and algae are not conducive to the effective exchange of substances between bacteria and algae resulting in the reduction of both activities and the inability to form tightly linked bacteria algae colloids therefore it also failed to form a symbiotic system with a higher abundance of functional bacteria leading to lower efficiency in treating pollutants when the inoculation ratio of bacteria and algae was 3 the activity of bacteria and algae was higher and it was easier to form bacterial algal colloids containing various functional bacteria to achieve efficient removal of pollutants 4 conclusion the symbiotic system of marine chlorella and activated sludge could effectively remove pollutants in mariculture wastewater the optimal inoculation ratio of bacteria and algae was 3 the removal rates of cod nh4 n po4 3 p and smx could reach 96 22 92 4 94 56 and 95 06 respectively the higher bacterial algal activity and eps secretion made it easier to form bacterial algal colloids from the inner to outer anaerobic zone anoxic zone and aerobic zone successively achieving an efficient denitrification symbiosis system with the simultaneous existence of nitrifying bacteria denitrifying bacteria and anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria the high activity of microalgae promotes the release of hydroxyl groups during hydrolysis and provides the prerequisite for the degradation of smx the proteins and polysaccharides in eps provide support for the transportation and diffusion of smx which is the subsequent power for further degradation of smx an appropriate ratio of bacteria to algae inoculum ratio of 3 was beneficial for screening the system with a higher abundance of functional bacteria for nitrogen and phosphorus removal and increasing the abundance of smx degrading bacteria norak f microscillaceae declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

selenite seo3 2 or se4 selenium se0 selenide se2 and organic selenium depending on both the oxidation reduction potential orp and ph conditions 2 in a previous study 3 zeolite supported nanoscale zero valent iron z nzvi was utilized to remove se6 the results revealed that the z nzvi displayed greater effectiveness in se6 removal according to the results of the xanes investigation se6 was reduced to se4 and se0 by nzvi and subsequently adsorbed on the z nzvi surface with the composite materials combining adsorption and reduction processes target pollutants presented the promising removal capacity due to the higher stability and dispersion of materials 3 5 nzvi itself has drawn interest in the removal of heavy metals because of its adaptability under various geochemical circumstances ease of use and cheap maintenance costs 6 8 at the same time zeolite is well known as one of outstanding adsorbents 9 for practical applications there is an intrinsic disadvantage when zeolite supported nanoscale zero valent iron z nzvi is used in powder form since the particles must be removed from the water after treatment furthermore powder based systems are impractical in a continuous flow system because of the potential for clogging and high friction losses 10 11 sacco and colleagues 12 developed improved pellet adsorbents in a packed bed system which were able to overcome the limitation of slurry systems by avoiding expensive after treatment steps that separate the particles from treated wastewater bentonite is promising to be a powdery material s supporter as well as a good binder 12 14 bentonite is a kind of layered clay mineral consisting primarily of montmorillonite which has been proposed as a candidate for synthetic mechanical support owing to its large specific area high cation exchange capacity low cost and low hydraulic conductivity 15 sheng and colleagues used bentonite to support the synthesis of iron nanoparticles on clay including the interlayer by reduction of exchangeable fe2 or fe3 for the removal of cr6 16 on the other hand zhang and colleagues investigated pillared bentonite with zero valent iron in column experiments to enhance the efficiency of cr6

and z nzvi was synthesized following the method described in our previous report 3 18 preparation of the z nzvi powder coating on bentonite zeolite pellets bz or so called bz nzvi required several steps first bz was formed from mixtures of both bentonite and zeolite powders at a ratio of 1 1 subsequently the mixture powder was put into a 1 cm diameter and 1 cm height mold and compressed by a manual hydraulic press at 4200 psi for 1 min next the bz was dried at 850 c for 3 h in a muffle furnace afterward z nzvi powder was added to the bz at a 1 5 weight ratio within a 250 ml beaker this mixture was then shaken together in an orbital shaker at 300 rpm for 1 h to coat the z nzvi on bz surface via the mechanical orbital shaking technique 11 finally the bz nzvi material was obtained as shown in fig 1 the bz nzvi was then characterized and packed into a continuous fixed bed column 2 3 characterization of bz nzvi an x ray diffractometer xrd d8 discover bruker axs germany with cu k radiation 0 1514 nm at 40 kv and 40 ma was used to determine the crystallinities of materials the scan range was 10 70 with an increment of 0 02 step and a scan speed of 0 1 s step at 298 k the point

applied to measure the specific surface area of the fresh materials a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem auriga carl zeiss germany was used to analyze the surface morphology of the materials the chemical composition of the materials was analyzed using an x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf zsx primus rigaku japan 2 4 bz nzvi test for kinetic reaction model calculation the experiments were carried out in a volume of 50 ml batch system with an se6 initial concentration of 1 mg l and bz nzvi amount of 5 g during the test the bz nzvi was settled down in the bottom of the beaker while the se6 aqueous solution in the beaker was stirred using the overhead stirrer at 24 rpm for good mixing and contact the contact times ranged between 0 and 90 min and the initial ph was varied at 4 7 and 10 the ph of the solution was measured using a ph meter and adjusted by diluted solutions of naoh or hno3 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes optima 8000

varied se6 initial concentrations 1 20 mg l were equilibrated with 5 g of bz nzvi at 303 k and ph 7 during the test the bz nzvi was settled down in the bottom of the beaker while the se6 aqueous solution in the beaker was stirred using the overhead stirrer at 24 rpm for good mixing and contact the solution was sampled periodically in the first 30 min of reaction time under continuous mixing the se6 concentration was monitored using icp oes initial and final values of ph and orp were measured initial and final orp were ranged at 185 192 and 45 54 mv respectively initial and final ph values were 6 7 7 2 and 8 9 9 2 respectively the experimental results were compared with freundlich and langmuir isotherms 21 with goodness of fit evaluated using r2 the langmuir isotherm is based on adsorbate monolayer adsorption onto a homogeneous surface as described by eq 3 3 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where qm and qe are the amount of se6 adsorbed onto the adsorbent at maximum adsorption

column with a 7 cm internal diameter the bz nzvi was packed in the column with a layer of glass wool at the bottom fig 2 the height of the bz nzvi bed was 8 cm the 0 5 mg l se6 solution at ph 7 the flow rate of 5 ml min and the temperature of 303 k was passed through the column using a peristaltic pump that maintained the desired flow rate the effluent samples were collected at specified

3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristic of bz nzvi the degree of crystallinity of z nzvi and z nzvi calculated following the previous study are 36 93 36 93 and 60 94 respectively 26 28 the crystallite size of z nzvi was 44 138 nm 26 the optimal coating conditions for z nzvi on the surface of bz were also investigated in a previous study 26 the appropriate percentage coating of z nzvi on the surface of bz was set according to a ratio of 1 5 76 9 3 00 g z nzvi on the surface wt according to the xrd patterns of bz nzvi fig 3 single diffraction peak appeared at plane 124 which was the characteristic peak of bentonite along with some smaller peaks representing the intrinsic structure of bentonite 29 however fewer oxides formed on the bz nzvi which may be related to the buffering effect of certain functional groups in the bentonite as support 30 the phpzc for z nzvi and bz nzvi was measured as a function of ph fig 4 the phpzc of bz nzvi and z nzvi were 9 3 and 8 0 respectively the positively charged surfaces at ph phpzc enhanced the electrostatic attraction of anionic se6 resulting in superior sequestration efficiency the surface area of the bz nzvi was 16 22 m2 g which was lower than the 61 72 m2 g found in z nzvi and likely the result of different particle sizes between the materials the mean pore diameter and pore volume of bz nzvi were 34 47 nm and 0 139 cm3 g respectively table 1 based on our previous report transmission electron microscopy tem measurement of z nzvi powder revealed that nzvi particles were most likely embedded in a z matrix structure 3 the morphological micrographs of the z nzvi and bz nzvi are presented in fig 5 a b and c d respectively these micrographs indicated that the nzvi supported in z adhered to the surface of the bz and were generally spherical in shape with particle diameters within 10 nm fig 5 c d although nzvi accumulated into a bulky nanocluster this outcome can be attributed to the nature of the materials fig 5 d represents that the proportion of separate nzvi supported in z that scatter on the surface of the bz according to the xrf analysis table 2 the elemental analyses of z bentonite z nzvi and bz nzvi showed that the chemical composition of z nzvi and bz nzvi had fe content of 58 75 and 56 82 wt respectively fe can enhance the active sites in the structure materials which can exchange se6 ions in the solution 3 2 kinetics of se6 removal by bz nzvi the effect of temperature on selenium adsorption performance in a batch system was reported in our previous study 26 the kinetic study showed that the reaction rate increased with increasing temperature 303 333k besides a study of thermodynamic parameters indicated that the reduction of se6 was spontaneous and endothermic reaction capacity therefore the room temperature 303k was selected for selenium treatment under continuous flow in the fixed bed column in this study to be close to real practice and reduce the cost of operation comparing the removal efficiency of se6 using bz nzvi at ph of 4 7 and 10 fig 6 a the reaction capacity increased at ph 4 because the ionic groups of the adsorbent were positively charged which was consistent with the results obtained from phpzc measurements the lower ph limits the adsorption of positive cations like se6 on the contrary hydroxide formed at a higher ph which also restricted the adsorption process 31 the removal of se6 by z nzvi fitted well with the pseudo first order kinetics model fig 6 b with kobs of the pseudo first order reaction at ph of 4 7 and 10 being 0 0645 0 0224 and 0 0043 1 min respectively considering on the intra particle diffusion of se6 into the z nzvi fig 6 c the linear plots did not intersect the origin suggesting that the diffusion of adsorbate within the pores of the adsorbent particle was a greater contributor to the rate determining step 32 for the initial ph of 4 the internal mass transfer ki2 was found to have a diffusion rate constant of 0 0041 mg g min1 2 whereas the external mass transfer ki1 was found to have a rate constant of 0 0309 mg g min1 2 under circumneutral ph conditions normally found in natural waters selenium species will be primarily se4 hseo3 while se6 seo4 2 dominates under reducing or oxidizing conditions in wastewater treatment selenium speciation can be altered significantly by the presence of other metal ions 33 in this research a ph of 7 was selected to study the fixed bed column because of its high efficiency and because it is representative of the range for treated water in the industry the ph of the solution however was in the permissible range of 5 5 9 0 for treated water in the industry according to regulations from the ministry of industry thailand indicating that treated water is suitable for effluent applications 3 3 adsorption isotherms of se6 over bz nzvi the se6 adsorption equilibrium experiments showed a steady increase in the adsorbed selenium with increasing equilibrium concentration similar to the langmuir isotherm fig 7 according to the highest r2 value bz nzvi adsorption of se6 was most consistent with the langmuir adsorption isotherm table 3 therefore se6 was adsorbed on the bz nzvi most similarly to a monolayer adsorption process 34 the maximum adsorption capacity qm was 1 436 mg g the langmuir factor constant rl values represented the degree of practicability for the bz nzvi toward se6 ions presenting the possibility of advancing the adsorption process the range of rl values was 0 069 to 0 972 demonstrating that the adsorption of se6 on bz nzvi was a favorable process i e 1 moreover the 1 n value in the freundlich model was 0 939 i e 1 also indicating that the nature of the adsorption of se6 on the bz nzvi was favorable under these experimental conditions based on xanes results se6 was reduced to se4 and se0 by nzvi and subsequently adsorbed on the z nzvi surface 3 the bz was proposed to contribute to selenium adsorption in addition to being a support 3 4 performance of bz nzvi continuous fixed bed column the efficacy of a continuous fixed bed column can be described through the concept of breakthrough curve analysis the results were compared to the linear equations of the yoon nelson and thomas models the breakthrough curve of se6 removal by bz nzvi was similar to the yoon nelson model fig 8 comparing standard deviation sd values eq 13 the sd values for the yoon nelson model were less than those for the thomas model under the provided experimental settings table 4 35 13 sd i 1 p q exp q model q exp 2 where qexp is adsorption capacity at equilibrium of experimental value and qmodel is adsorption capacity at equilibrium of model besides the sd values akaike s information criterion aic is a statistical tool used to determine the best empirical data representing model 27 36 37 the aic was computed by eq 14 14 aic nln sse n 2 n p 2 n p n p 1 n n p 1 where sse n and np symbolize the sum of square error number of experimental data and number of parameters in the model respectively the sum of square error see can be calculated using eq 15 15 sse t 0 t y exp y model 2 where yexp and ymodel denote the normalized concentration of experiment and model at a specific time t min together with sd values as presented in table 4 the aic calculation showed that the experimental curve best complied with the yoon nelson model due to its lowest aic value 36 37 the adsorption behavior of the bz nzvi column in this study was explained using the yoon nelson model which found that the adsorption rate reduced in proportion to the se6 breakthrough 11 the values of τ ky n and breakthrough capacity q0 were 204 min 0 022 1 min and 0 034 mg g respectively fe leaching during se6 removal by bz nzvi in a continuous fixed bed column was also investigated fig 9 the fe concentrations were 1 0 5 0 mg l after 60 min the concentration of fe stabilized at approximately 0 15 mg l additionally the fe leaching concentrations fell below the who drinking water standard which is 0 3 mg l as the maximum concentration limit value 38 because nzvi is prone to oxidation form changes or deterioration could occur after the reaction which would affect the reusability and recycling of bz nzvi however the bz as a support is possibly reused and needs further study 3 4 1 effect of flow rate the experiment in the continuous fixed bed column was operated at flow rates of 3 10 and 15 ml min and an experimental flow rate of 5 ml min fig 10 a with an se6 initial concentration of 0 5 mg l the experimental 50 breakthrough time τ for flow rates 3 and 15 ml min were found to be 340 and 68 min respectively these results confirmed that the increased flow rate was affected by decreased residence time resulting in the decreased performance of se6 removal at a lower flow rate the removal performance improved as there was an increase in the residence time 39 3 4 2 effect of se6 initial concentration the adsorption efficiency of bz nzvi was also evaluated under varying se6 initial concentrations fig 10 b while the flow rate and amount of adsorbents were maintained at 5 ml min and 15 g respectively the τ values for se6 initial concentration 0 1 and 1 0 mg l were found to be 1033 and 103 min respectively table 5 when the se6 initial concentration increased the competition between the two types of adsorbate molecules toward the adsorption sites it resulted in a decreased uptake rate 40 3 4 3 effect of bz nvzi amount the effect of varying the mass of bz nvzi on breakthrough curves was also investigated fig 10 c the 50 breakthrough time of se6 removal increased from 136 to 680 min when the mass of bz nzvi increased from 10 to 50 g table 5 thus the increased mass of bz nzvi resulted in a longer breakthrough time the increased adsorption capacity of the column was the result of greater adsorption sites for se6 ions therefore the longer residence time for se6 caused better intra particle phenomena all three main variables including flow rate se6 initial concentration and amount of bz nzvi were compared with the time required for 50 adsorbate breakthrough as shown in fig 11 it could be observed that the flow rate and se6 initial concentration gave a negative effect while the amount of bz nzvi had a positive effect the variables that affect the time required for 50 adsorbate breakthrough were in the following order se6 initial concentration amount of bz nzvi flow rate the se6 effluent concentrations from the continuous fixed bed column were greater than zero and proportional to the se6 initial concentrations at the inlet feed of the reactor comparisons of di water and wastewater breakthrough curves achieved with and without redistribution systems fig 12 showed that the 50 breakthrough times of se6 removal were 204 and 68 min for di water and wastewater respectively table 6 however the performance of bz nzvi in complex wastewater can be compromised due to the presence of organic compounds and other inorganic species since these compounds can compete with selenium and ion species for the same adsorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent the removal of se6 onto bz nzvi could inhibit the accessibility in the presence of so4 2 the wastewater used in this study contained so4 2 of 327 mg l which was quite high the competitive adsorption could reduce the enrichment of se6 on the reactive sites of bz nzvi decreasing the reduction rate of se6 by z nzvi because of the similarity in chemical properties of so4 2 and seo4 2 and the smaller size of so4 2 than seo4 2 they compete effectively for adsorption at reactive sites of z nzvi 41 to estimate the adsorption performance of an adsorbent mathematical models for the simulation of adsorption processes are needed the yoon and nelson model was selected as suitable for the experimental data fig 13 presents the experimental breakthrough curves obtained for bz nzvi at an inlet se6 concentration of 0 5 mg l a flow rate of 10 ml min and among adsorbent 15 g the theoretical curves calculated according to the proposed model indicated that the theoretical and experimental curves were in good agreement 4 conclusions bz nzvi can effectively remove se6 in an aqueous solution at ph 4 due the formation of atomic hydrogen from the corrosion of iron nanoparticles on the surface of bz nzvi which caused the degradation of se6 the observed rate constants kobs of the pseudo first order reaction at ph of 4 7 and 10 were 0 0645 0 0224 and 0 0043 1 min respectively the adsorption isotherms matched the langmuir adsorption isotherm rather well based on adsorption isotherm calculation the bz nzvi had the maximum se6 adsorption capacity qm at 1 436 mg g under experimental conditions se6 initial concentrations of 1 20 mg l bz nzvi amount of 5 g 303 k and ph 7 the process of intraparticle diffusion seems to be affected by both boundary layer diffusion and intraparticle diffusion the removal of se6 from aqueous solutions onto bz nzvi in a fixed bed column system was investigated the maximum se6 adsorption breakthrough capacity was 0 034 mg g under the operation conditions se6 initial concentrations of 0 5 mg l bz nzvi amount of 15 g 303 k ph 7 and the flow rate of 5 ml min the yoon nelson model was suitable for explaining the dynamic behavior of the adsorption process breakthrough times increased with decreasing se6 initial concentration and flow rate but decreased as adsorbent mass increased the variables that affect the time required for 50 adsorbate breakthrough were in the following order se6 initial concentration amount of bz nzvi flow rate in conclusion bz nzvi continuous fixed bed column showed substantial adsorption capability for the treatment of se6 in contaminated wastewater declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exists acknowledgments this research has received funding support from the fundamental fund

discharge include the combustion of fossil fuels coal fired power plants and mining operations 1 selenium se is a metalloid that contains a variety of oxidation states including selenate seo4 2 or se6 selenite seo3 2 or se4 selenium se0 selenide se2 and organic selenium depending on both the oxidation reduction potential orp and ph conditions 2 in a previous study 3 zeolite supported nanoscale zero valent iron z nzvi was utilized to remove se6 the results revealed that the z nzvi displayed greater effectiveness in se6 removal according to the results of the xanes investigation se6 was reduced to se4 and se0 by nzvi and subsequently adsorbed on the z nzvi surface with the composite materials combining adsorption and reduction processes target pollutants presented the promising removal capacity due to the higher stability and dispersion of materials 3 5 nzvi itself has drawn interest in the removal of heavy metals because of its adaptability under various geochemical circumstances ease of use and cheap maintenance costs 6 8 at the same time zeolite is well known as one of outstanding adsorbents 9 for practical applications there is an intrinsic disadvantage when zeolite supported nanoscale zero valent iron z nzvi is used in powder form since the particles must be removed from the water after treatment furthermore powder based systems are impractical in a continuous flow system because of the potential for clogging and high friction losses 10 11 sacco and colleagues 12 developed improved pellet adsorbents in a packed bed system which were able to overcome the limitation of slurry systems by avoiding expensive after treatment steps that separate the particles from treated wastewater bentonite is promising to be a powdery material s supporter as well as a good binder 12 14 bentonite is a kind of layered clay mineral consisting primarily of montmorillonite which has been proposed as a candidate for synthetic mechanical support owing to its large specific area high cation exchange capacity low cost and low hydraulic conductivity 15 sheng and colleagues used bentonite to support the synthesis of iron nanoparticles on clay including the interlayer by reduction of exchangeable fe2 or fe3 for the removal of cr6 16 on the other hand zhang and colleagues investigated pillared bentonite with zero valent iron in column experiments to enhance the efficiency of cr6

and z nzvi was synthesized following the method described in our previous report 3 18 preparation of the z nzvi powder coating on bentonite zeolite pellets bz or so called bz nzvi required several steps first bz was formed from mixtures of both bentonite and zeolite powders at a ratio of 1 1 subsequently the mixture powder was put into a 1 cm diameter and 1 cm height mold and compressed by a manual hydraulic press at 4200 psi for 1 min next the bz was dried at 850 c for 3 h in a muffle furnace afterward z nzvi powder was added to the bz at a 1 5 weight ratio within a 250 ml beaker this mixture was then shaken together in an orbital shaker at 300 rpm for 1 h to coat the z nzvi on bz surface via the mechanical orbital shaking technique 11 finally the bz nzvi material was obtained as shown in fig 1 the bz nzvi was then characterized and packed into a continuous fixed bed column 2 3 characterization of bz nzvi an x ray diffractometer xrd d8 discover bruker axs germany with cu k

adsorbed on the bz nzvi most similarly to a monolayer adsorption process 34 the maximum adsorption capacity qm was 1 436 mg g the langmuir factor constant rl values represented the degree of practicability for the bz nzvi toward se6 ions presenting the possibility of advancing the adsorption process the range of rl values was 0 069 to 0 972 demonstrating that the adsorption of se6 on bz nzvi was a favorable process i e 1 moreover the 1 n value in the freundlich model was 0 939 i e 1 also indicating that the nature of the adsorption of se6 on the bz nzvi was favorable under these experimental conditions based on xanes results se6 was reduced to se4 and se0 by nzvi and subsequently adsorbed on the z nzvi surface 3 the bz was proposed to contribute to selenium adsorption in addition to being a support 3 4 performance of bz nzvi continuous fixed bed column the efficacy of a continuous fixed bed column can be described through the concept of breakthrough curve analysis the results were compared to the linear equations of the yoon nelson and thomas models the breakthrough curve of se6 removal by bz nzvi was similar to the yoon nelson model fig 8 comparing standard deviation sd values eq 13 the sd values for the yoon nelson model were less than those for the thomas model under the provided experimental settings table 4 35 13 sd i 1 p q exp q model q exp 2 where qexp is adsorption capacity at equilibrium of experimental value and qmodel is adsorption capacity at equilibrium of model besides the sd values akaike s information criterion aic is a statistical tool used to determine the best empirical data representing model 27 36 37 the aic was computed by eq 14 14 aic nln sse n 2 n p 2 n p n p 1 n n p 1 where sse n and np symbolize the sum of square error number of experimental data and number of parameters in the model respectively the sum of square error see can be calculated using eq 15 15 sse t 0 t y exp y model 2 where yexp and ymodel denote the normalized concentration of experiment and model at a specific time t min together with sd values as presented in table 4 the aic calculation showed that the experimental curve best complied with the yoon nelson model due to its lowest aic value 36 37 the adsorption behavior of the bz nzvi column in this study was explained using the yoon nelson model which found that the adsorption rate reduced in proportion to the se6 breakthrough 11 the values of τ ky n and breakthrough capacity q0 were 204 min 0 022 1 min and 0 034 mg g respectively fe leaching during se6 removal by bz nzvi in a continuous fixed bed column was also investigated fig 9 the fe concentrations were 1 0 5 0 mg l after 60 min the concentration of fe stabilized at approximately 0 15 mg l additionally the fe leaching concentrations fell below the who drinking water standard which is 0 3 mg l as the maximum concentration limit value 38 because nzvi is prone to oxidation form changes or deterioration could occur after the reaction which would affect the reusability and recycling of bz nzvi however the bz as a support is possibly reused and needs further study 3 4 1 effect of flow rate the experiment in the continuous fixed bed column was operated at flow rates of 3 10 and 15 ml min and an experimental flow rate of 5 ml min fig 10 a with an se6 initial concentration of 0 5 mg l the experimental 50 breakthrough time τ for flow rates 3 and 15 ml min were found to be 340 and 68 min respectively these results confirmed that the increased flow rate was affected by decreased residence time resulting in the decreased performance of se6 removal at a lower flow rate the removal performance improved as there was an increase in the residence time 39 3 4 2 effect of se6 initial concentration the adsorption efficiency of bz nzvi was also evaluated under varying se6 initial concentrations fig 10 b while the flow rate and amount of adsorbents were maintained at 5 ml min and 15 g respectively the τ values for se6 initial concentration 0 1 and 1 0 mg l were found to be 1033 and 103 min respectively table 5 when the se6 initial concentration increased the competition between the two types of adsorbate molecules toward the adsorption sites it resulted in a decreased uptake rate 40 3 4 3 effect of bz nvzi amount the effect of varying the mass of bz nvzi on breakthrough curves was also investigated fig 10 c the 50 breakthrough time of se6 removal increased from 136 to 680 min when the mass of bz nzvi increased from 10 to 50 g table 5 thus the increased mass of bz nzvi resulted in a longer breakthrough time the increased adsorption capacity of the column was the result of greater adsorption sites for se6 ions therefore the longer residence time for se6 caused better intra particle phenomena all three main variables including flow rate se6 initial concentration and amount of bz nzvi were compared with the time required for 50 adsorbate breakthrough as shown in fig 11 it could be observed that the flow rate and se6 initial concentration gave a negative effect while the amount of bz nzvi had a positive effect the variables that affect the time required for 50 adsorbate breakthrough were in the following order se6 initial concentration amount of bz nzvi flow rate the se6 effluent concentrations from the continuous fixed bed column were greater than zero and proportional to the se6 initial concentrations at the inlet feed of the reactor comparisons of di water and wastewater breakthrough curves achieved with and without redistribution systems fig 12 showed that the 50 breakthrough times of se6 removal were 204 and 68 min for di water and wastewater respectively table 6 however the performance of bz nzvi in complex wastewater can be compromised due to the presence of organic compounds and other inorganic species since these compounds can compete with selenium and ion species for the same adsorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent the removal of se6 onto bz nzvi could inhibit the accessibility in the presence of so4 2 the wastewater used in this study contained so4 2 of 327 mg l which was quite high the competitive adsorption could reduce the enrichment of se6 on the reactive sites of bz nzvi decreasing the reduction rate of se6 by z nzvi because of the similarity in chemical properties of so4 2 and seo4 2 and the smaller size of so4 2 than seo4 2 they compete effectively for adsorption at reactive sites of z nzvi 41 to estimate the adsorption performance of an adsorbent mathematical models for the simulation of adsorption processes are needed the yoon and nelson model was selected as suitable for the experimental data fig 13 presents the experimental breakthrough curves obtained for bz nzvi at an inlet se6 concentration of 0 5 mg l a flow rate of 10 ml min and among adsorbent 15 g the theoretical curves calculated according to the proposed model indicated that the theoretical and experimental curves were in good agreement 4 conclusions bz nzvi can effectively remove se6 in an aqueous solution at ph 4 due the formation of atomic hydrogen from the corrosion of iron nanoparticles on the surface of bz nzvi which caused the degradation of se6 the observed rate constants kobs of the pseudo first order reaction at ph of 4 7 and 10 were 0 0645 0 0224 and 0 0043 1 min respectively the adsorption isotherms matched the langmuir adsorption isotherm rather well based on adsorption isotherm calculation the bz nzvi had the maximum se6 adsorption capacity qm at 1 436 mg g under experimental conditions se6 initial concentrations of 1 20 mg l bz nzvi amount of 5 g 303 k and ph 7 the process of intraparticle diffusion seems to be affected by both boundary layer diffusion and intraparticle diffusion the removal of se6 from aqueous solutions onto bz nzvi in a fixed bed column system was investigated the maximum se6 adsorption breakthrough capacity was 0 034 mg g under the operation conditions se6 initial concentrations of 0 5 mg l bz nzvi amount of 15 g 303 k ph 7 and the flow rate of 5 ml min the yoon nelson model was suitable for explaining the dynamic behavior of the adsorption process breakthrough times increased with decreasing se6 initial concentration and flow rate but decreased as adsorbent mass increased the variables that affect the time required for 50 adsorbate breakthrough were in the following order se6 initial concentration amount of bz nzvi flow rate in conclusion bz nzvi continuous fixed bed column showed substantial adsorption capability for the treatment of se6 in contaminated wastewater declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exists acknowledgments this research has received funding support from the fundamental fund

12479,a three dimensional bioelectrical reactor 3d ber with a treatment capacity of 1 m3 d was constructed for the high level denitrification of wastewater treatment plant effluent the results indicated that with activated carbon and light ceramsite volume ratio was 1 1 as the particle electrodes and applied current of 5 a the removal efficiency of no3 n in the 3d ber was 78 99 4 10 the selectivity of nitrogen was 83 48 4 20 and the energy consumption was 1 20 0 13 kwh m3 nitrate and sulfate concentrations decreased rapidly based on the samples withdrawn at a reactor height of 47 5 cm and they both decreased to their lowest values at a reactor height of 75 cm indicating that nitrate reduction took place preferentially in the 3d ber proteobacteria and campilobacterota were selectively enriched in the 3d ber compared with the inoculated sludge and the microbial community composition of 3d ber at 75 cm was significantly different from that at other heights sulfurimonas 20 96 sulfuricurvum 5 32 thauera 4 40 and denitratisoma 3 87 were the dominant bacteria at 75 cm in the 3d ber and the relative abundance of bacteria with denitrifying functions was the highest at 75 cm fieldwork demonstrated the feasibility and sustainability of using a 3d ber for nitrogen removal keywords nitrate denitrification three dimensional bioelectrical reactor wastewater treatment plant effluent data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to anthropogenic activities such as nonpoint nitrogen containing pollution from agriculture activities and potential industrial wastewater and domestic sewage discharges nitrate pollution has become a global problem 1 2 in aquatic ecosystems excessive nitrate in water can lead to eutrophication and affect water quality and aquatic biodiversity 3 nitrate itself does not pose a threat to human health but it can be reduced to nitrite in the gastrointestinal tract after it enters the human body and react with hemoglobin in the blood to inhibit the transfer of oxygen to cells causing methemoglobinemia and blue baby disease 4 when the nitrate concentration in drinking water is excessively high it may lead to coronary heart disease and thyroid hypertrophy and increase the possibility of gastrointestinal cancer and gastric cancer 5 7 actually chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod and other carbon source pollution parameters are effectively controlled in wastewater treatment plants wwtps consequently wastewater often contains high nitrate content and low organic carbon however it is difficult to remove nitrate from such water and the high cost associated with additional carbon source inputs further restricts nitrogen removal bioelectrical reactors bers that stimulate the metabolic activity of microorganisms by applying electrical stimulation have recently drawn intensive attention 8 due to inputs of electrons to the reactor bers are suitable for treating wastewaters that contain limited electron donors and realizing the autotrophic removal of pollutants 9 11 the bioelectrochemical denitrification process proceeds on the cathode of bers and the electron donors used in denitrification can be divided into two types atomic hydrogen h2 produced by electrolysis and electrons directly from the cathode to improve the ability of bers for pollutant removal anthracite granular activated carbon sulfur iron and other particles are placed between the cathode and anode of bers the particles are polarized under the action of the electric field to form charged microelectrodes and serve as the third electrode particle electrode such bers are usually called three dimensional bers 3d bers 12 these particles could increase the electrode surface area improve mass transfer rates and current efficiency and increase the microbial attachment area in the reactor 13 at present 3d bers can be used to effectively remove nitrate from low organic carbon waters in the literature electrode materials optimization of operating conditions accumulation of intermediate products and identification of microbial communities of 3d ber have been widely studied 14 15 however most studies have focused on laboratory scale tests and there have been few pilot scale tests and practical applications of 3d ber for denitrification the goals of this study were to 1 construct a pilot scale 3d ber for the high level denitrification of wwtp effluent 2 explore the effectiveness of 3d ber in practical applications during long term operation 3 investigate the energy consumption and current efficiency of reactors with different particle electrodes under different currents and 4 analyze effluent quality and microbial community structures with different reactor heights 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus the schematic of the 3d ber is shown in fig 1 a reactor without bacterial inoculation 3d er served as the control the main body of the reactor was a cylindrical plexiglas container with a diameter of 70 cm a height of 165 cm and an effective volume of 500 l the stainless steel mesh cathode was rolled and welded with a stainless steel punching plate with a thickness of 0 8 mm an aperture of 1 5 mm and a hole margin of 1 5 mm the cathode with a height of 150 cm was divided into inner and outer rings and the diameters of the rings were 20 cm and 66 cm respectively fig 1 right four partitions which were made of stainless steel perforated plates were connected with the inner and outer rings by welding and the circular ring was equally divided into four parts a water distribution plate at the bottom of the reactor was made of a stainless steel punching plate with a thickness of 1 mm an aperture of 5 mm and a hole margin of 3 mm round holes with a diameter of 3 5 cm were cut on the side of the outer ring stainless steel drum and the positions were 10 30 57 5 85 112 5 and 140 cm from the top the anode was a titanium rod with a titanium suboxide coating a titanium rod with a size of φ5 150 cm was placed in the center of the inner ring of the cathode and four φ3 150 cm titanium rods were placed in the four separate intervals the layout of the anode and cathode consisted of double layer concentric circles as shown in fig 1 right the particle electrodes were placed between the cathode and the cathode and the filling height was 130 cm since the water distribution plate was made of stainless steel the bottom of the titanium rods was insulated to prevent short circuiting between the cathode and anode the water outlet port and sampling ports were set on the side of the reactor which were 20 47 5 75 102 5 130 and 150 cm away from the bottom of the reactor corresponding to the 6 holes in the outer ring of the cathode influent water entered the bottom of the reactor and flowed out from the top under pressure from the peristaltic pump 2 2 reactor operation the influent water quality is shown in table 1 when activated carbon was used as the particle electrode 3d er and 3d ber were operated for electrochemical denitrification and bioelectrochemical denitrification experiments respectively the biofilm immobilization and acclimation process of 3d ber was as follows 300 l of activated sludge taken from an anoxic tank was pumped into the reactor and 100 l of culture solution was prepared in a plastic bucket nutrients were added to the plastic bucket every day as shown in table 2 the culture solution was continuously pumped into the reactor through a peristaltic pump and the effluent was returned to the plastic bucket the cycle lasted for 7 days during this period the hrt was set to 12 h and the applied current was 0 5 a thereafter the biofilm acclimation process was carried out using influent water at which time the hrt was 12 h and the current was increased in the order 1 3 and 5 a each stage was run for 7 days 3d er was run for 28 days in two stages the first stage was from day 1 to day 15 the particle electrodes were activated carbon and the applied current increased from 2 a to 5 a the second stage was 16 28 days the activated carbon only filled the four circular spaces formed by the inner and outer rings of the cathode and the applied current was 2 5 a and 4 a the three stages of 3d ber operation lasted for 70 days during the days of operation the particle electrodes and filling space of stage 1 and stage 2 were the same as those of 3d er stage 3 was from day 29 to day 70 the particle electrodes were activated carbon and lightweight ceramsite volume ratio 1 1 and a rope type biological filler was added five rope type biological fillers were placed in each space of the four circular spaces one rope type biological filler was placed in the inner ring of the cathode around the titanium rod and the remaining space was filled with particle electrodes activated carbon light ceramsite since the particle electrodes were replaced at this stage the biofilm immobilization and acclimation process were conducted again after biofilm acclimation the applied current increased in the order 2 5 a 4 a and 5 a 2 3 sampling and analysis water samples were taken every day from the influent and effluent to determine the concentrations of no3 n so4 2 no2 n and nh4 n and the ph value the determination and analysis were performed according to a previous study 16 in stage 3 of 3d ber the effluent water at different heights of the reactor was sampled when the current was 2 5 a 4 a and 5 a when the current was 5 a and hrt was 12 h samples for microbial community analysis were collected from the water outlet and 5 sampling ports of the 3d ber the samples were named s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 according to the height of the reactor from bottom to top and the inoculated sludge was named as the microbial analysis was based on procedures described in a previous study 17 the removal efficiency of no3 n and the current efficiency and energy consumption of 3d ber were calculated according to a previous study 16 nitrogen selectivity s was calculated on the basis of eq 1 1 s c no 3 n c no 2 n eff c nh 4 n eff c no 3 n x 100 where c no 3 n is the difference in no3 n between influent and effluent mg l c no 2 n eff and c nh 4 n eff are the concentrations of no2 n and nh4 n in the effluent respectively mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 denitrification performance of reactors with different particle electrodes the denitrification performance of 3d er and 3d ber with different particle electrodes is shown in fig 2 in stage 1 days 1 15 the particle electrodes were activated carbon under a current of 2 5 a the effluent concentrations of no3 n no2 n nh4 n and so4 2 and ph barely changed in both 3d er and 3d ber at this stage the no3 n removal efficiency in 3d er and 3d ber did not change with the current changes remaining at 4 and 18 respectively fig 3 which may be caused by an excessive short circuit current in the reactor thus the activated carbon in the inner circle of the cathode was removed in stage 2 days 16 28 the effluent no2 n concentrations in 3d er and 3d ber were significantly higher than those in the influent as an intermediate product of nitrate electrochemical reduction and biological denitrification 18 19 the increase in no2 n indicated that nitrate reduction occurred in 3d er and 3d ber when the applied current increased from 2 5 a to 4 a the no3 n removal efficiency increased from 0 48 0 78 to 44 77 6 11 and 33 53 9 01 to 65 57 7 06 in 3d er and efficiency 3d ber respectively fig 3 these results suggested that most current input into the reactor was lost in the form of a short circuit current when the particle electrodes were activated carbon in stage 1 in addition the no3 n removal efficiency was only 18 in 3d ber which was due to biological denitrification although the removal efficiency of no3 n was greatly improved the voltage of 3d er and 3d ber increased sharply in stage 2 table 3 when the current was 4 a the voltages of 3d er and 3d ber were 16 36 v and 19 12 v respectively a higher voltage possibly occurred in 3d ber because the microorganisms were cultured on the electrodes which increased the internal resistance of the reactor due to the low conductivity of biofilms 20 the conductive activated carbon was between the anode and cathode which may have resulted in a short circuit to solve this problem and reduce the short circuit current activated carbon light ceramsite and rope biological fillers were used for mixed filling in this study the density of light ceramsite is less than that of water which is different from activated carbon rope type biological filler helped to reduce the short circuit current and increase the attachment area of microorganisms in the reactor when the current was 4 a in stage 2 of 3d ber the removal efficiency of no3 n was 68 79 1 97 which was similar to that in the second stage when a 4 a current was applied 65 57 7 06 but the voltage of 3d ber was only 7 21 v table 3 which decreased by 11 91 v in addition the replacement of the particle electrode improved the nitrogen selectivity of 3d ber fig 3 when the applied current was 5 a the removal efficiency of no3 n reached 80 and the nitrogen selectivity was higher than 80 3 2 effect of different applied currents on denitrification performance applied current is a key factor affecting the performance of electrolytic cells 21 in stage 2 the no3 n removal efficiency in 3d er and 3d ber improved with increasing current and a similar removal efficiency was achieved in stage 3 fig 3 during nitrate reduction nitrite accumulated and was depleted after achieving a maximum concentration which is consistent with previous work 22 by increasing the applied current more electrons transferred to the cathode and induced improved nitrate reduction thus the increase in applied current could improve the reduction performance in both the 3d er and 3d ber by increasing various electron donors electrons provided by the cathode active atomic hydrogen h2 in the reactor 23 the no2 n in the influent in 3d ber was 0 5 mg l while it reached 2 17 mg l in the effluent fig 2 the no2 n accumulation might be due to denitrification and the thermodynamic difference between nitrate reduction and nitrite reduction in the process of biological denitrification the activity of nitrate reductase in reducing no3 n to no2 n is much higher than that of nitrite reductase in reducing no2 n to n2 12 the energy required for the reduction of no3 n to no2 n is 3 68 4 88 kj while the reduction of no2 n to n2 requires 13 86 20 08 kj therefore no2 n accumulated under the limited energy supply conditions 24 generally effluent no2 n decreased with increasing applied current for example in stage 2 the effluent no2 n decreased from 2 17 mg l to 0 52 mg l with increasing current in stage 3 when the applied current increased from 2 5 a to 5 a the effluent no2 n decreased from 1 96 mg l to 0 90 mg l but from day 65 the effluent no2 n gradually increased to 1 70 mg l which might be related to the increase in influent no3 n 25 a previous study also confirmed that the reduction rate of no3 n increased with increasing initial nitrate concentration 20 492 mg l but no2 n accumulation was observed at the same time 26 similar to no2 n the nh4 n in the effluent of 3d ber was mostly higher than that in the influent and the accumulation of nh4 n might be caused by the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra process in the reactor fig 4 previous studies have confirmed that the dnra process occurs in autotrophic denitrification systems and electrical stimulation could increase the activity of microorganisms related to dnra leading to an increase in nh4 n in the effluent 27 28 according to figs 2 and 4 no3 n was effectively removed but so4 2 was not included in the 3d ber the influent of the bes was from the effluent of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp and the high nh4 n in the influent of stage 2 was due to the water quality fluctuation in the effluent obtained from the wwtp the nh4 n in the effluent of er and ber was lower than that in the influent which may be attributed to oxidation by the anode 29 3 3 effluent water quality at different heights of the 3d ber the effluent no3 n no2 n nh4 n so4 2 concentration and ph in stage 3 at different heights in the 3d ber at a current of 2 5 a a 4 a b and 5 a c are shown in fig 5 the effluent no3 n first decreased and then increased with reactor height and finally decreased to the lowest value at a height of 75 cm when the applied current was 2 5 a 4 a and 5 a the reduction values of no3 n from the inlet to a height of 20 cm were 4 65 mg l 7 94 mg l and 10 68 mg l respectively the results suggested that a greater applied current resulted in higher no3 n reduction although no effective removal of so4 2 was observed at the outlet 150 cm in 3d ber the so4 2 at heights of 47 5 cm to 75 cm decreased significantly fig 5 when the applied currents were 2 5 a 4 a and 5 a the so4 2 concentration difference between 75 cm and the influent was 35 08 mg l 52 05 mg l and 83 80 mg l respectively similar to the variation in no3 n a greater current could result in a higher reduction value of so4 2 2 2no 3 10 e 12 h n 2 6h 2 o 3 so 4 2 8e 8h s 2 4h 2 o the trend in ph in the 3d ber with reactor height was opposite to that of no3 n and so4 2 according to the trend in no3 n and so4 2 nitrate reduction mainly occurred in the 0 47 5 cm layer while sulfate reduction mainly occurred in the 47 5 75 cm layer nitrate and sulfate reduction consumed h according to fig 5 the ph from the inlet to 47 5 cm only increased by 0 75 1 18 under different currents while the ph increased by 2 21 2 63 between 47 5 cm and 75 cm indicating that the ph increase in 3d ber was mainly caused by sulfate reduction according to eqs 2 3 6 mol h is consumed when 1 mol no3 n is reduced to n2 and 8 mol h is consumed when 1 mol so4 2 is reduced to s2 and the product undergoes a hydrolysis reaction to further increase the ph of the solution taking fig 5c as an example the consumption of h for 13 43 mg l nitrate reduction was 5 75 mm at a height of 0 47 5 cm and that for 68 21 mg l sulfate reduction at a height of 47 5 75 cm was 5 68 mm h however the ph increased only 0 75 between 0 and 47 5 cm and increased 2 63 between 47 5 and 75 cm this phenomenon indicated that the ph increase from a height of 47 5 to 75 cm was mainly due to s2 hydrolysis as shown in fig 5 the nitrate in the influent rapidly decreased over the height of 0 47 5 cm and the sulfate started to decrease at 47 5 cm both of which decreased to a minimum at 75 cm indicating that nitrate reduction took place preferentially in the 3d ber and then the sulfate reduction process began to strengthen the 3d ber used in this study had a large volume which might lead to an uneven distribution of current and potential in the reactor the nonuniform distribution of current and potential is a difficult scenario for the industrial application of a three dimensional electrode fixed bed reactor 30 further study is needed to understand why the lowest concentrations of nitrate and sulfate occurred in the middle of the 3d ber 75 cm 3 4 analysis of microbial community structure at different heights of the 3d ber microbial samples from different heights of the 3d ber were sequenced and the microbial community differences between the initial inoculated sludge and the reactor were analyzed fig 6 the dominant bacteria of as were proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes with relative abundances of 36 76 25 40 and 16 61 respectively fig 6 left the microbial community structure at the phylum level of 3d ber is shown in fig 6 right proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes were still the dominant bacteria in s1 s6 and these three are common bacteria in sewage treatment 31 similar to as proteobacteria had an absolute advantage in the 3d ber except for s4 the relative abundance of the samples was higher than that in the as furthermore the relative abundance of proteobacteria in s1 was as high as 59 20 the proportion of firmicutes in s3 was 38 26 which was higher than that in as however the relative abundance of firmicutes in the other 5 samples of the 3d ber was lower than the proportion of 25 40 in as the relative abundance of bacteroidota in s1 s6 was also lower than that in as indicating that proteobacteria was selectively enriched during the experiment compared with as campilobacterota appeared as the dominant bacteria in the 3d ber especially in the lower part of the reactor the relative abundance of campilobacterota in s3 was as high as 27 07 indicating that campilobacterota was selectively domesticated and enriched in this study it was reported that many species of campilobacterota contain the nitrate reductase gene 32 the heatmap of samples from different heights of the 3d ber at the genus level is shown in fig 7 in s1 s4 the dominant genera were lysobacter 22 47 denitratiosoma 10 25 sulfurimonas 20 96 and srb2 16 38 denitratisoma consists of aerobic denitrifying bacteria which can directly reduce nitrite nitrogen to n2 33 sulfomonas is a kind of bacteria capable of chemoautotrophy with sulfur and can reduce sulfur compounds as electron donors and use nitrate nitrite and oxygen as electron acceptors 34 in addition to srb2 opb41 with a relative abundance of 7 16 in s4 was also a sulfate reducing bacteria 35 erysipelothrix had a relative abundance of 9 19 in s4 and studies have shown that erysipelothrix appears in anaerobic biofilm denitrification reactors with citric acid as the organic carbon source 36 pseudomonas was also a dominant genus in s4 it is widespread in the environment and can use h2 s or organic carbon as electronic donors for denitrification 37 in addition this genus was also found in the electrochemical autotrophic sulfate reduction process and is capable of capturing electrons directly from the cathode 38 39 sulfurovum a dominant bacterium shared by s1 and s2 is an autotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacterium with s2 or s as an electron donor 40 the dominant bacteria in s5 were candidatus competibacter 4 07 metallogenera 3 03 desulfomicrobacterium 2 88 erytherma 2 11 and thiobacillus 2 00 in s6 hydrophilia 4 55 methylenera 4 15 candidatus competitor 3 23 denitratiosoma 3 13 desulfomicrobium 3 02 and thiobacillus 1 90 were the dominant bacteria candidatus competibacter was reported to be involved in the denitrification process 41 and thiobacillus is a typical sulfur autotrophic denitrifying bacterium that is often found in bioelectrochemical denitrification systems 42 in s3 in addition to sulfurimonas 20 96 dominant bacteria included sulfuricurum 5 32 tauera 4 40 denitratiosoma 3 87 dechloromonas 2 79 bacteroides 2 17 rhodanobacter 2 13 and hydrogenophaga 1 07 sulfuricurvum is a chemoautotrophic bacterium that uses s2 s s2o3 2 and h2 as electron donors for denitrification 43 dechromonas was also capable of autotrophic denitrification using h2 or s as an electron donor 44 45 hydrogenophaga and thauera are two major bacteria that can participate in hydrogen autotrophic denitrification 37 46 rhodanobacteria and bacteroides are common denitrifying bacteria in soil and water treatment 13 47 it can be seen from the above metabolic functions of microorganisms that all dominant bacteria in s3 had denitrification capacity compared with the as a variety of hydrogen sulfur autotrophic denitrifying bacteria such as sulfurimonas thiobacillus hydrogenophaga dechloromonas and tauera were enriched in the 3d ber these bacteria utilize hydrogen or sulfur as electron donors for autotrophic denitrification to convert nitrate into n2 electrochemical reduction is also involved in nitration conversion a previous study demonstrated that biological denitrification was the major reduction pathway in bers 48 therefore there was a synergistic involvement of biological denitrification and electrochemical reduction in the 3d ber as a result the removal efficiency of no3 n in the 3d ber in stage 1 and stage 2 was greater than that in 3d er the top 30 genera in s1 s6 were summarized and classified according to metabolic functions the results showed that the relative abundances of denitrifying bacteria in s1 s6 were 22 20 34 16 45 55 25 80 15 88 and 17 74 respectively the proportion of denitrifying bacteria in s1 s3 in the lower part of the reactor was higher than that in s4 s6 the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria in s3 was the largest which might be why lowest no3 n concentration occurred at 75 cm 3 5 current efficiency and energy consumption of 3d ber current efficiencies in 3d ber with different particle electrodes at different applied currents are shown in fig 8 in stages 1 and 2 the current efficiency in the 3d er was significantly lower than that in the 3d ber the current efficiency of the two reactors was 50 in stage 1 and most of the current input into the reactor was transformed into heat energy in the third stage when the applied current was 2 5 a and 4 a the current efficiencies of 3d ber were 121 69 18 70 and 131 32 35 27 respectively this indicated that the applied current acted as a persistent extracellular electron donor for bacteria that involved in denitrification on the cathode furthermore applied current was also used for electrochemical reaction on the particle electrodes in other words the current was fully consumed in the reactor and resulted in a current efficiency of 100 meanwhile the influent organic substances were also utilized as electron donor for denitrification by the bacteria which further increased the current efficiency over 100 i e 121 69 18 70 and 131 32 35 27 however when the applied current was 2 5 a and 4 a in stage 2 the current efficiencies were 33 76 12 40 and 70 78 14 41 respectively in stage 3 the current efficiency under 2 5 a and 4 a was 100 which indicated that the mixed filling of activated carbon light ceramsites rope type biological fillers effectively increased the reaction current in the reactor thereby improving current efficiency in the reactor the energy consumption of 3d ber with different particle electrodes at different currents in stage 3 is displayed in table 4 when activated carbon filled the outer ring of the cathode the energy consumption at 2 5 a and 4 a was 0 13 and 0 24 kwh g no3 n respectively when activated carbon and lightweight ceramics were used as particle electrodes the energy consumption at 2 5 a and 4 a was 0 06 and 0 08 kwh g no3 n respectively this indicated that changing the particle electrodes not only improved the no3 n removal efficiency but also effectively reduced the energy consumption of the reactor when the reactor was filled with activated carbon light and ceramsite rope type biological fillers and the applied current was 5 a the energy consumption of the 3d ber was 0 13 kwh g no3 n 3 6 engineering feasibility test and running cost to test the engineering feasibility of 3d ber in fieldwork a 100 m3 d pilot scale 3d ber was constructed at xin an river wastewater treatment co ltd yantai china the main body of the reactor was a cylindrical steel container real reactor with a diameter of 570 cm a height of 275 cm and an effective volume of 100 m3 the stainless steel shell of the container was used directly as the cathode six anodes titanium rod with a height of 215 cm were inserted into particle electrodes activated carbon lightweight ceramics with different rings a wind solar hybrid generation system qingdao wind turbine technology co ltd qingdao china was applied to supply power for the electrodes over four months of continuous operation 100 m3 d influent and effluent samples from the 3d ber were collected and the concentrations of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n were determined the variation in concentrations is listed in table 5 and fig 9 during pilot scale reactor operation cost was mainly associated with electricity for the compressed water pump power was supplied to the electrodes from a wind solar hybrid generation system which was much lower than the 0 10 us dollars per cubic meter based on local electricity prices in contrast to other common methods 3d ber is preferred due to its high removal rate low cost convenience feasibility and sustainability due to its low operational cost requirements together with high removal capacity for different nitrogen compounds in waters 3d ber application is feasible in the water treatment industry especially for no3 n removal 4 conclusions a 3d ber with double concentric circles for the cathode and anode was constructed for high level denitrification of wwtp effluent the electrochemical and bioelectrochemical denitrification performance of the reactor with different particle electrodes and currents were studied the removal efficiency of no3 n was 78 99 4 10 the selectivity of nitrogen was 83 48 4 20 and the energy consumption was 1 20 0 13 kwh m3 at a current of 5 a when activated carbon and light ceramsites were used as the particle electrodes nitrate reduction occurred preferentially in the 3d ber and the ph of the 3d ber was mainly affected by sulfate reduction proteobacteria and campilobacterota were selectively enriched in the 3d ber compared with the inoculated sludge and the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria at a height of 75 cm was the greatest fieldwork proved the feasibility and sustainability of the 3d ber for nitrogen removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

12479,a three dimensional bioelectrical reactor 3d ber with a treatment capacity of 1 m3 d was constructed for the high level denitrification of wastewater treatment plant effluent the results indicated that with activated carbon and light ceramsite volume ratio was 1 1 as the particle electrodes and applied current of 5 a the removal efficiency of no3 n in the 3d ber was 78 99 4 10 the selectivity of nitrogen was 83 48 4 20 and the energy consumption was 1 20 0 13 kwh m3 nitrate and sulfate concentrations decreased rapidly based on the samples withdrawn at a reactor height of 47 5 cm and they both decreased to their lowest values at a reactor height of 75 cm indicating that nitrate reduction took place preferentially in the 3d ber proteobacteria and campilobacterota were selectively enriched in the 3d ber compared with the inoculated sludge and the microbial community composition of 3d ber at 75 cm was significantly different from that at other heights sulfurimonas 20 96 sulfuricurvum 5 32 thauera 4 40 and denitratisoma 3 87 were the dominant bacteria at 75 cm in the 3d ber and the relative abundance of bacteria with denitrifying functions was the highest at 75 cm fieldwork demonstrated the feasibility and sustainability of using a 3d ber for nitrogen removal keywords nitrate denitrification three dimensional bioelectrical reactor wastewater treatment plant effluent data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to anthropogenic activities such as nonpoint nitrogen containing pollution from agriculture activities and potential industrial wastewater and domestic sewage discharges nitrate pollution has become a global problem 1 2 in aquatic ecosystems excessive nitrate in water can lead to eutrophication and affect water quality and aquatic biodiversity 3 nitrate itself does not pose a threat to human health but it can be reduced to nitrite in the gastrointestinal tract after it enters the human body and react with hemoglobin in the blood to inhibit the transfer of oxygen to cells causing methemoglobinemia and blue baby disease 4 when the nitrate concentration in drinking water is excessively high it may lead to coronary heart disease and thyroid hypertrophy and increase the possibility of gastrointestinal cancer and gastric cancer 5 7 actually chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod and other carbon source pollution parameters are effectively controlled in wastewater treatment plants wwtps consequently wastewater often contains high nitrate content and low organic carbon however it is difficult to remove nitrate from such water and the high cost associated with additional carbon source inputs further restricts nitrogen removal bioelectrical reactors bers that stimulate the metabolic activity of microorganisms by applying electrical stimulation have recently drawn intensive attention 8 due to inputs of electrons to the reactor bers are suitable for treating wastewaters that contain limited electron donors and realizing the autotrophic removal of pollutants 9 11 the bioelectrochemical denitrification process proceeds on the cathode of bers and the electron donors used in denitrification can be divided into two types atomic hydrogen h2 produced by electrolysis and electrons directly from the cathode to improve the ability of bers for pollutant removal anthracite granular activated carbon sulfur iron and other particles are placed between the cathode and anode of bers the particles are polarized under the action of the electric field to form charged microelectrodes and serve as the third electrode particle electrode such bers are usually called three dimensional bers 3d bers 12 these particles could increase the electrode surface area improve mass transfer rates and current efficiency and increase the microbial attachment area in the reactor 13 at present 3d bers can be used to effectively remove nitrate from low organic carbon waters in the literature electrode materials optimization of operating conditions accumulation of intermediate products and identification of microbial communities of 3d ber have been widely studied 14 15 however most studies have focused on laboratory scale tests and there have been few pilot scale tests and practical applications of 3d ber for denitrification the goals of this study were to 1 construct a pilot scale 3d ber for the high level denitrification of wwtp effluent 2 explore the effectiveness of 3d ber in practical applications during long term operation 3 investigate the energy consumption and current efficiency of reactors with different particle electrodes under different currents and 4 analyze effluent quality and microbial community structures with different reactor heights 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus the schematic of the 3d ber is shown in fig 1 a reactor without bacterial inoculation 3d er served as the control the main body of the reactor was a cylindrical plexiglas container with a diameter of 70 cm a height of 165 cm and an effective volume of 500 l the stainless steel mesh cathode was rolled and welded with a stainless steel punching plate with a thickness of 0 8 mm an aperture of 1 5 mm and a hole margin of 1 5 mm the cathode with a height of 150 cm was divided into inner and outer rings and the diameters of the rings were 20 cm and 66 cm respectively fig 1 right four partitions which were made of stainless steel perforated plates were connected with the inner and outer rings by welding and the circular ring was equally divided into four parts a water distribution plate at the bottom of the reactor was made of a stainless steel punching plate with a thickness of 1 mm an aperture of 5 mm and a hole margin of 3 mm round holes with a diameter of 3 5 cm were cut on the side of the outer ring stainless steel drum and the positions were 10 30 57 5 85 112 5 and 140 cm from the top the anode was a titanium rod with a titanium suboxide coating a titanium rod with a size of φ5 150 cm was placed in the center of the inner ring of the cathode and four φ3 150 cm titanium rods were placed in the four separate intervals the layout of the anode and cathode consisted of double layer concentric circles as shown in fig 1 right the particle electrodes were placed between the cathode and the cathode and the filling height was 130 cm since the water distribution plate was made of stainless steel the bottom of the titanium rods was insulated to prevent short circuiting between the cathode and anode the water outlet port and sampling ports were set on the side of the reactor which were 20 47 5 75 102 5 130 and 150 cm away from the bottom of the reactor corresponding to the 6 holes in the outer ring of the cathode influent water entered the bottom of the reactor and flowed out from the top under pressure from the peristaltic pump 2 2 reactor operation the influent water quality is shown in table 1 when activated carbon was used as the particle electrode 3d er and 3d ber were operated for electrochemical denitrification and bioelectrochemical denitrification experiments respectively the biofilm immobilization and acclimation process of 3d ber was as follows 300 l of activated sludge taken from an anoxic tank was pumped into the reactor and 100 l of culture solution was prepared in a plastic bucket nutrients were added to the plastic bucket every day as shown in table 2 the culture solution was continuously pumped into the reactor through a peristaltic pump and the effluent was returned to the plastic bucket the cycle lasted for 7 days during this period the hrt was set to 12 h and the applied current was 0 5 a thereafter the biofilm acclimation process was carried out using influent water at which time the hrt was 12 h and the current was increased in the order 1 3 and 5 a each stage was run for 7 days 3d er was run for 28 days in two stages the first stage was from day 1 to day 15 the particle electrodes were activated carbon and the applied current increased from 2 a to 5 a the second stage was 16 28 days the activated carbon only filled the four circular spaces formed by the inner and outer rings of the cathode and the applied current was 2 5 a and 4 a the three stages of 3d ber operation lasted for 70 days during the days of operation the particle electrodes and filling space of stage 1 and stage 2 were the same as those of 3d er stage 3 was from day 29 to day 70 the particle electrodes were activated carbon and lightweight ceramsite volume ratio 1 1 and a rope type biological filler was added five rope type biological fillers were placed in each space of the four circular spaces one rope type biological filler was placed in the inner ring of the cathode around the titanium rod and the remaining space was filled with particle electrodes activated carbon light ceramsite since the particle electrodes were replaced at this stage the biofilm immobilization and acclimation process were conducted again after biofilm acclimation the applied current increased in the order 2 5 a 4 a and 5 a 2 3 sampling and analysis water samples were taken every day from the influent and effluent to determine the concentrations of no3 n so4 2 no2 n and nh4 n and the ph value the determination and analysis were performed according to a previous study 16 in stage 3 of 3d ber the effluent water at different heights of the reactor was sampled when the current was 2 5 a 4 a and 5 a when the current was 5 a and hrt was 12 h samples for microbial community analysis were collected from the water outlet and 5 sampling ports of the 3d ber the samples were named s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 according to the height of the reactor from bottom to top and the inoculated sludge was named as the microbial analysis was based on procedures described in a previous study 17 the removal efficiency of no3 n and the current efficiency and energy consumption of 3d ber were calculated according to a previous study 16 nitrogen selectivity s was calculated on the basis of eq 1 1 s c no 3 n c no 2 n eff c nh 4 n eff c no 3 n x 100 where c no 3 n is the difference in no3 n between influent and effluent mg l c no 2 n eff and c nh 4 n eff are the concentrations of no2 n and nh4 n in the effluent respectively mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 denitrification performance of reactors with different particle electrodes the denitrification performance of 3d er and 3d ber with different particle electrodes is shown in fig 2 in stage 1 days 1 15 the particle electrodes were activated carbon under a current of 2 5 a the effluent concentrations of no3 n no2 n nh4 n and so4 2 and ph barely changed in both 3d er and 3d ber at this stage the no3 n removal efficiency in 3d er and 3d ber did not change with the current changes remaining at 4 and 18 respectively fig 3 which may be caused by an excessive short circuit current in the reactor thus the activated carbon in the inner circle of the cathode was removed in stage 2 days 16 28 the effluent no2 n concentrations in 3d er and 3d ber were significantly higher than those in the influent as an intermediate product of nitrate electrochemical reduction and biological denitrification 18 19 the increase in no2 n indicated that nitrate reduction occurred in 3d er and 3d ber when the applied current increased from 2 5 a to 4 a the no3 n removal efficiency increased from 0 48 0 78 to 44 77 6 11 and 33 53 9 01 to 65 57 7 06 in 3d er and efficiency 3d ber respectively fig 3 these results suggested that most current input into the reactor was lost in the form of a short circuit current when the particle electrodes were activated carbon in stage 1 in addition the no3 n removal efficiency was only 18 in 3d ber which was due to biological denitrification although the removal efficiency of no3 n was greatly improved the voltage of 3d er and 3d ber increased sharply in stage 2 table 3 when the current was 4 a the voltages of 3d er and 3d ber were 16 36 v and 19 12 v respectively a higher voltage possibly occurred in 3d ber because the microorganisms were cultured on the electrodes which increased the internal resistance of the reactor due to the low conductivity of biofilms 20 the conductive activated carbon was between the anode and cathode which may have resulted in a short circuit to solve this problem and reduce the short circuit current activated carbon light ceramsite and rope biological fillers were used for mixed filling in this study the density of light ceramsite is less than that of water which is different from activated carbon rope type biological filler helped to reduce the short circuit current and increase the attachment area of microorganisms in the reactor when the current was 4 a in stage 2 of 3d ber the removal efficiency of no3 n was 68 79 1 97 which was similar to that in the second stage when a 4 a current was applied 65 57 7 06 but the voltage of 3d ber was only 7 21 v table 3 which decreased by 11 91 v in addition the replacement of the particle electrode improved the nitrogen selectivity of 3d ber fig 3 when the applied current was 5 a the removal efficiency of no3 n reached 80 and the nitrogen selectivity was higher than 80 3 2 effect of different applied currents on denitrification performance applied current is a key factor affecting the performance of electrolytic cells 21 in stage 2 the no3 n removal efficiency in 3d er and 3d ber improved with increasing current and a similar removal efficiency was achieved in stage 3 fig 3 during nitrate reduction nitrite accumulated and was depleted after achieving a maximum concentration which is consistent with previous work 22 by increasing the applied current more electrons transferred to the cathode and induced improved nitrate reduction thus the increase in applied current could improve the reduction performance in both the 3d er and 3d ber by increasing various electron donors electrons provided by the cathode active atomic hydrogen h2 in the reactor 23 the no2 n in the influent in 3d ber was 0 5 mg l while it reached 2 17 mg l in the effluent fig 2 the no2 n accumulation might be due to denitrification and the thermodynamic difference between nitrate reduction and nitrite reduction in the process of biological denitrification the activity of nitrate reductase in reducing no3 n to no2 n is much higher than that of nitrite reductase in reducing no2 n to n2 12 the energy required for the reduction of no3 n to no2 n is 3 68 4 88 kj while the reduction of no2 n to n2 requires 13 86 20 08 kj therefore no2 n accumulated under the limited energy supply conditions 24 generally effluent no2 n decreased with increasing applied current for example in stage 2 the effluent no2 n decreased from 2 17 mg l to 0 52 mg l with increasing current in stage 3 when the applied current increased from 2 5 a to 5 a the effluent no2 n decreased from 1 96 mg l to 0 90 mg l but from day 65 the effluent no2 n gradually increased to 1 70 mg l which might be related to the increase in influent no3 n 25 a previous study also confirmed that the reduction rate of no3 n increased with increasing initial nitrate concentration 20 492 mg l but no2 n accumulation was observed at the same time 26 similar to no2 n the nh4 n in the effluent of 3d ber was mostly higher than that in the influent and the accumulation of nh4 n might be caused by the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra process in the reactor fig 4 previous studies have confirmed that the dnra process occurs in autotrophic denitrification systems and electrical stimulation could increase the activity of microorganisms related to dnra leading to an increase in nh4 n in the effluent 27 28 according to figs 2 and 4 no3 n was effectively removed but so4 2 was not included in the 3d ber the influent of the bes was from the effluent of the wastewater treatment plant wwtp and the high nh4 n in the influent of stage 2 was due to the water quality fluctuation in the effluent obtained from the wwtp the nh4 n in the effluent of er and ber was lower than that in the influent which may be attributed to oxidation by the anode 29 3 3 effluent water quality at different heights of the 3d ber the effluent no3 n no2 n nh4 n so4 2 concentration and ph in stage 3 at different heights in the 3d ber at a current of 2 5 a a 4 a b and 5 a c are shown in fig 5 the effluent no3 n first decreased and then increased with reactor height and finally decreased to the lowest value at a height of 75 cm when the applied current was 2 5 a 4 a and 5 a the reduction values of no3 n from the inlet to a height of 20 cm were 4 65 mg l 7 94 mg l and 10 68 mg l respectively the results suggested that a greater applied current resulted in higher no3 n reduction although no effective removal of so4 2 was observed at the outlet 150 cm in 3d ber the so4 2 at heights of 47 5 cm to 75 cm decreased significantly fig 5 when the applied currents were 2 5 a 4 a and 5 a the so4 2 concentration difference between 75 cm and the influent was 35 08 mg l 52 05 mg l and 83 80 mg l respectively similar to the variation in no3 n a greater current could result in a higher reduction value of so4 2 2 2no 3 10 e 12 h n 2 6h 2 o 3 so 4 2 8e 8h s 2 4h 2 o the trend in ph in the 3d ber with reactor height was opposite to that of no3 n and so4 2 according to the trend in no3 n and so4 2 nitrate reduction mainly occurred in the 0 47 5 cm layer while sulfate reduction mainly occurred in the 47 5 75 cm layer nitrate and sulfate reduction consumed h according to fig 5 the ph from the inlet to 47 5 cm only increased by 0 75 1 18 under different currents while the ph increased by 2 21 2 63 between 47 5 cm and 75 cm indicating that the ph increase in 3d ber was mainly caused by sulfate reduction according to eqs 2 3 6 mol h is consumed when 1 mol no3 n is reduced to n2 and 8 mol h is consumed when 1 mol so4 2 is reduced to s2 and the product undergoes a hydrolysis reaction to further increase the ph of the solution taking fig 5c as an example the consumption of h for 13 43 mg l nitrate reduction was 5 75 mm at a height of 0 47 5 cm and that for 68 21 mg l sulfate reduction at a height of 47 5 75 cm was 5 68 mm h however the ph increased only 0 75 between 0 and 47 5 cm and increased 2 63 between 47 5 and 75 cm this phenomenon indicated that the ph increase from a height of 47 5 to 75 cm was mainly due to s2 hydrolysis as shown in fig 5 the nitrate in the influent rapidly decreased over the height of 0 47 5 cm and the sulfate started to decrease at 47 5 cm both of which decreased to a minimum at 75 cm indicating that nitrate reduction took place preferentially in the 3d ber and then the sulfate reduction process began to strengthen the 3d ber used in this study had a large volume which might lead to an uneven distribution of current and potential in the reactor the nonuniform distribution of current and potential is a difficult scenario for the industrial application of a three dimensional electrode fixed bed reactor 30 further study is needed to understand why the lowest concentrations of nitrate and sulfate occurred in the middle of the 3d ber 75 cm 3 4 analysis of microbial community structure at different heights of the 3d ber microbial samples from different heights of the 3d ber were sequenced and the microbial community differences between the initial inoculated sludge and the reactor were analyzed fig 6 the dominant bacteria of as were proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes with relative abundances of 36 76 25 40 and 16 61 respectively fig 6 left the microbial community structure at the phylum level of 3d ber is shown in fig 6 right proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes were still the dominant bacteria in s1 s6 and these three are common bacteria in sewage treatment 31 similar to as proteobacteria had an absolute advantage in the 3d ber except for s4 the relative abundance of the samples was higher than that in the as furthermore the relative abundance of proteobacteria in s1 was as high as 59 20 the proportion of firmicutes in s3 was 38 26 which was higher than that in as however the relative abundance of firmicutes in the other 5 samples of the 3d ber was lower than the proportion of 25 40 in as the relative abundance of bacteroidota in s1 s6 was also lower than that in as indicating that proteobacteria was selectively enriched during the experiment compared with as campilobacterota appeared as the dominant bacteria in the 3d ber especially in the lower part of the reactor the relative abundance of campilobacterota in s3 was as high as 27 07 indicating that campilobacterota was selectively domesticated and enriched in this study it was reported that many species of campilobacterota contain the nitrate reductase gene 32 the heatmap of samples from different heights of the 3d ber at the genus level is shown in fig 7 in s1 s4 the dominant genera were lysobacter 22 47 denitratiosoma 10 25 sulfurimonas 20 96 and srb2 16 38 denitratisoma consists of aerobic denitrifying bacteria which can directly reduce nitrite nitrogen to n2 33 sulfomonas is a kind of bacteria capable of chemoautotrophy with sulfur and can reduce sulfur compounds as electron donors and use nitrate nitrite and oxygen as electron acceptors 34 in addition to srb2 opb41 with a relative abundance of 7 16 in s4 was also a sulfate reducing bacteria 35 erysipelothrix had a relative abundance of 9 19 in s4 and studies have shown that erysipelothrix appears in anaerobic biofilm denitrification reactors with citric acid as the organic carbon source 36 pseudomonas was also a dominant genus in s4 it is widespread in the environment and can use h2 s or organic carbon as electronic donors for denitrification 37 in addition this genus was also found in the electrochemical autotrophic sulfate reduction process and is capable of capturing electrons directly from the cathode 38 39 sulfurovum a dominant bacterium shared by s1 and s2 is an autotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacterium with s2 or s as an electron donor 40 the dominant bacteria in s5 were candidatus competibacter 4 07 metallogenera 3 03 desulfomicrobacterium 2 88 erytherma 2 11 and thiobacillus 2 00 in s6 hydrophilia 4 55 methylenera 4 15 candidatus competitor 3 23 denitratiosoma 3 13 desulfomicrobium 3 02 and thiobacillus 1 90 were the dominant bacteria candidatus competibacter was reported to be involved in the denitrification process 41 and thiobacillus is a typical sulfur autotrophic denitrifying bacterium that is often found in bioelectrochemical denitrification systems 42 in s3 in addition to sulfurimonas 20 96 dominant bacteria included sulfuricurum 5 32 tauera 4 40 denitratiosoma 3 87 dechloromonas 2 79 bacteroides 2 17 rhodanobacter 2 13 and hydrogenophaga 1 07 sulfuricurvum is a chemoautotrophic bacterium that uses s2 s s2o3 2 and h2 as electron donors for denitrification 43 dechromonas was also capable of autotrophic denitrification using h2 or s as an electron donor 44 45 hydrogenophaga and thauera are two major bacteria that can participate in hydrogen autotrophic denitrification 37 46 rhodanobacteria and bacteroides are common denitrifying bacteria in soil and water treatment 13 47 it can be seen from the above metabolic functions of microorganisms that all dominant bacteria in s3 had denitrification capacity compared with the as a variety of hydrogen sulfur autotrophic denitrifying bacteria such as sulfurimonas thiobacillus hydrogenophaga dechloromonas and tauera were enriched in the 3d ber these bacteria utilize hydrogen or sulfur as electron donors for autotrophic denitrification to convert nitrate into n2 electrochemical reduction is also involved in nitration conversion a previous study demonstrated that biological denitrification was the major reduction pathway in bers 48 therefore there was a synergistic involvement of biological denitrification and electrochemical reduction in the 3d ber as a result the removal efficiency of no3 n in the 3d ber in stage 1 and stage 2 was greater than that in 3d er the top 30 genera in s1 s6 were summarized and classified according to metabolic functions the results showed that the relative abundances of denitrifying bacteria in s1 s6 were 22 20 34 16 45 55 25 80 15 88 and 17 74 respectively the proportion of denitrifying bacteria in s1 s3 in the lower part of the reactor was higher than that in s4 s6 the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria in s3 was the largest which might be why lowest no3 n concentration occurred at 75 cm 3 5 current efficiency and energy consumption of 3d ber current efficiencies in 3d ber with different particle electrodes at different applied currents are shown in fig 8 in stages 1 and 2 the current efficiency in the 3d er was significantly lower than that in the 3d ber the current efficiency of the two reactors was 50 in stage 1 and most of the current input into the reactor was transformed into heat energy in the third stage when the applied current was 2 5 a and 4 a the current efficiencies of 3d ber were 121 69 18 70 and 131 32 35 27 respectively this indicated that the applied current acted as a persistent extracellular electron donor for bacteria that involved in denitrification on the cathode furthermore applied current was also used for electrochemical reaction on the particle electrodes in other words the current was fully consumed in the reactor and resulted in a current efficiency of 100 meanwhile the influent organic substances were also utilized as electron donor for denitrification by the bacteria which further increased the current efficiency over 100 i e 121 69 18 70 and 131 32 35 27 however when the applied current was 2 5 a and 4 a in stage 2 the current efficiencies were 33 76 12 40 and 70 78 14 41 respectively in stage 3 the current efficiency under 2 5 a and 4 a was 100 which indicated that the mixed filling of activated carbon light ceramsites rope type biological fillers effectively increased the reaction current in the reactor thereby improving current efficiency in the reactor the energy consumption of 3d ber with different particle electrodes at different currents in stage 3 is displayed in table 4 when activated carbon filled the outer ring of the cathode the energy consumption at 2 5 a and 4 a was 0 13 and 0 24 kwh g no3 n respectively when activated carbon and lightweight ceramics were used as particle electrodes the energy consumption at 2 5 a and 4 a was 0 06 and 0 08 kwh g no3 n respectively this indicated that changing the particle electrodes not only improved the no3 n removal efficiency but also effectively reduced the energy consumption of the reactor when the reactor was filled with activated carbon light and ceramsite rope type biological fillers and the applied current was 5 a the energy consumption of the 3d ber was 0 13 kwh g no3 n 3 6 engineering feasibility test and running cost to test the engineering feasibility of 3d ber in fieldwork a 100 m3 d pilot scale 3d ber was constructed at xin an river wastewater treatment co ltd yantai china the main body of the reactor was a cylindrical steel container real reactor with a diameter of 570 cm a height of 275 cm and an effective volume of 100 m3 the stainless steel shell of the container was used directly as the cathode six anodes titanium rod with a height of 215 cm were inserted into particle electrodes activated carbon lightweight ceramics with different rings a wind solar hybrid generation system qingdao wind turbine technology co ltd qingdao china was applied to supply power for the electrodes over four months of continuous operation 100 m3 d influent and effluent samples from the 3d ber were collected and the concentrations of no3 n no2 n and nh4 n were determined the variation in concentrations is listed in table 5 and fig 9 during pilot scale reactor operation cost was mainly associated with electricity for the compressed water pump power was supplied to the electrodes from a wind solar hybrid generation system which was much lower than the 0 10 us dollars per cubic meter based on local electricity prices in contrast to other common methods 3d ber is preferred due to its high removal rate low cost convenience feasibility and sustainability due to its low operational cost requirements together with high removal capacity for different nitrogen compounds in waters 3d ber application is feasible in the water treatment industry especially for no3 n removal 4 conclusions a 3d ber with double concentric circles for the cathode and anode was constructed for high level denitrification of wwtp effluent the electrochemical and bioelectrochemical denitrification performance of the reactor with different particle electrodes and currents were studied the removal efficiency of no3 n was 78 99 4 10 the selectivity of nitrogen was 83 48 4 20 and the energy consumption was 1 20 0 13 kwh m3 at a current of 5 a when activated carbon and light ceramsites were used as the particle electrodes nitrate reduction occurred preferentially in the 3d ber and the ph of the 3d ber was mainly affected by sulfate reduction proteobacteria and campilobacterota were selectively enriched in the 3d ber compared with the inoculated sludge and the relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria at a height of 75 cm was the greatest fieldwork proved the feasibility and sustainability of the 3d ber for nitrogen removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
