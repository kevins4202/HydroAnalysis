3210,the vigorous development of satellite precipitation observations has gained widespread attention in the field of hydrology many studies have explored the reliability of hydrological models driven by satellite precipitation data spd to reproduce streamflow however the reliability of spd in the simulation of other hydrological processes remains unclear even though a full understanding of the dynamic variations in hydrological processes is essential for the scientific management of water resources in this study we investigated the effect of spd uncertainty on the distributed hydrological model in reproducing hydrological simulations the investigation was conducted in the upper huaihe river basin which has a high density ground precipitation observation network the uncertainty inherent in 8 types of spd in characterizing the temporal and spatial variations in precipitation was comprehensively examined the variable infiltration capacity hydrological model vic was then applied to further explore the reliability of the simulated hydrological fluxes and states hfs driven by the selected spd over multiple temporal spatial scales the results showed that 1 the selected spd tend to have greater uncertainty in recognizing spatial variations in precipitation than in identifying temporal variations the vic models driven by the selected spd generally performed better in characterizing temporal variations in hfs than in reproducing their spatial variations in addition the corrected spd cspd are more suitable for hfs simulations than the uncorrected spd uspd 2 the effective reproduction of the spatio temporal variations in hfs has more stringent requirements on the quality of spd than the satisfactory reproduction of streamflow for the gridded scale simulations the selected spd driven models exhibited large uncertainties in reproducing spatio temporal variations in daily hfs in contrast although these models significantly improved the simulation performance of monthly hfs they were still relatively deficient in reproducing their spatial variations in terms of the basin scale simulations the cspd driven models tend to reliably reproduce monthly hfs and 3 independent calibration can allow the selected spd driven models to reproduce streamflow more effectively but it may not result in the best reproduction of hfs this study provides guidance for strengthening the application of spd in hydrological modeling and provides feedback for further improving the quality of spd keywords precipitation hydrological simulations satellite uncertainty analysis 1 introduction as a significant component of the earth s critical zone the water cycle plays an important role in the pattern and evolution of global ecosystems hegerl et al 2015 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 hydrological models which are descriptions of the hydrological processes that occur in nature are an important tool used to explore and understand the hydrological cycle and hydrological processes beven 2011 semenova and beven 2015 precipitation is a direct driving factor in the terrestrial water cycle and its accurate representation greatly affects the reliability of hydrological process simulations maggioni and massari 2018 wang and zeng 2011 however precipitation is both temporally and spatially heterogeneous as a result its accurate characterization and estimation are currently hot topics in the fields of hydrology and meteorology traditionally observations of precipitation used in hydrological models were primarily derived from rain gauges the obtained data are accurate but this is limited to the position of the observation unfortunately in most areas rain gauges are sparsely and unevenly distributed especially in developing countries and in remote regions kidd et al 2017 the emergence of satellite observation technology provides a potentially effective solution to achieve global or quasi global precipitation observations skofronick jackson et al 2017 thus far two types of satellite derived precipitation data spd have been released one data type is mainly retrieved from thermal infrared satellite data including the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hsu et al 1997 sorooshian et al 2000 and the climate hazards group infrared precipitation chirp funk et al 2015 the other data type is microwave infrared merged dataset such as the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis huffman et al 2007 and the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2019 spd provide precipitation estimation characterized by different spatial and temporal resolutions the quality of the data is dependent on the sensors sampling rate retrieval schemes and characterization of the physical properties of clouds kidd and levizzani 2011 maggioni et al 2016 the ultimate goal of satellite precipitation observations is to obtain the most accurate data possible that meets the needs of various applications for this reason many studies have comprehensively explored the advantages and disadvantages of spd nguyen et al 2018 sun et al 2018 most of these studies are based on ground precipitation observations chen and li 2016 chen et al 2013 foelsche et al 2017 gebrechorkos et al 2018 moazami and najafi 2021 tang et al 2016 a few studies applied the triple collocation method to quantify the uncertainty of spd alemohammad et al 2015 li et al 2018 massari et al 2017 since no benchmark data are required these studies only obtained relative uncertainties between the data in addition to the above mentioned inherent errors the quality of spd is also affected by seasonal variations in precipitation differences in precipitation types and intensity and changes in precipitation with topography elevation among a host of other factors bartsotas et al 2018 maggioni et al 2016 mehran and aghakouchak 2014 thus the uncertainty inherent in precipitation varies in both time and space therefore it is necessary to evaluate spd worldwide in addition it should be noted that accurate assessment of the uncertainty inherent in spd requires appropriate reference data such as sufficiently dense ground observations chen et al 2020b tian et al 2018 with the widespread application of spd the uncertainty inherent in their applications has received more attention especially for the analysis of climate chen and gao 2018 drought sahoo et al 2015 zhong et al 2019 and hydrology maggioni and massari 2018 yong et al 2010 in the field of hydrology the highly non linear characteristics of the distributed hydrological models allow the uncertainty in spd to be propagated through the model resulting in greater uncertainty in the simulated results numerous studies have therefore been conducted around the world to explore the feasibility of spd driven hydrological models beck et al 2017 camici et al 2018 camici et al 2020 le et al 2020 li et al 2018b satg√© et al 2021 su et al 2019 sun et al 2018b wu et al 2018b these studies have mainly focused on the uncertainty in reproducing streamflow much less attention has been paid to other hydrological processes although the performance of these models varies significantly between regions there is a consensus that spd have significant potential to be effectively used in hydrological simulations especially in areas where ground precipitation observations are scarce or absent although streamflow is a key component needed to understand the temporal dynamics of a watershed s hydrological system it does not provide information about the spatial heterogeneity of the hydrological cycle within the watershed this information is provided by other hydrological parameters the purpose of hydrological modeling is to reliably represent the temporal and spatial variations of hydrological processes beven 2019 over the past few decades advances in satellite observation and computing power have led to the development and application of distributed hydrological models characterized by increasingly higher resolutions the spatial representation of hydrological fluxes and states hfs that they provide has become an important tool for decision makers in a range of applications such as land atmosphere feedback analysis drought monitoring flood prediction and control water resources management and ecological restoration among a host of other fields rakovec et al 2016 while significant insights into the relationship s between the quality of spd and a model s ability to reproduce streamflow have been obtained it is still unknown whether spd driven models reliably reproduce temporal and spatial variations in hfs and or the extent to which results are reliable this will affect the breadth and depth of the application of spd in hydrological modeling in addition improper use of simulation results may lead to an erroneous understanding of hydrological processes and the scientific mismanagement of water resources based on the above considerations the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of spd uncertainty on the distributed hydrological model in reproducing the temporal and spatial variations of hydrological processes taking the upper huaihe river basin in china as a representative study area we first analyzed the uncertainty inherent in 8 types of spd in comparison to a highly dense ground precipitation observation network approximately one per 140 km2 in doing so we focused on their performance in identifying temporal and spatial variations in precipitation then the widely used variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model was employed to assess the effect of the selected spd uncertainty on reproducing temporal and spatial variations in the three hfs including runoff rf evapotranspiration et and changes in soil moisture deltmois which are closely related to water balance over multiple temporal and spatial scales 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the wangjiaba basin is an upstream tributary to the huai river and covers an area of 30 500 km2 the wangjiaba hydrological station monitors streamflow at the outlet of the basin the northeast section of the study area is characterized by low relief terrain while the southwest part is mountainous altitude ranges from about 20 m to over 1500 m fig 1 the study area is situated in a transitional zone from a warm temperate climate to a northern subtropical climate the long term average annual precipitation is over 900 mm precipitation is largely controlled by the east asian monsoon which is mainly concentrated in june september and accounts for about 60 80 of the total annual precipitation the annual average temperature is 11 16 c the highest average monthly temperature 25 c occurs in july and the lowest 0 c occurs in january the annual average et is about 600 800 mm land cover types over the study area are dominated by cropland about 65 of the total area grassland 24 99 and woodland 7 53 as shown in fig 1 there are 201 rain gauges and 16 meteorological stations within the basin and their basic information is shown in table s1 in the supplementary material 2 2 data meteorological data including daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature wind speed and daily precipitation have been collected at 16 meteorological stations within the study area these data were obtained from the china meteorological science data sharing network and had undergone rigorous quality controls such as extreme value checks and consistency checks yu et al 2007 daily precipitation has also been monitored at 201 rain gauges in the basin daily streamflow observations have been made at the wangjiaba hydrological station these data were obtained from the annual hydrological report of the people s republic of china according to the report ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2011 the observation data were also subject to strict quality controls before being released all above ground observations cover the period 2001 2011 eight types of spd including trmm 3b42rt 3b42rt trmm 3b42 3b42 imerg early run imerge imerg final run imergf persiann persiann climate data record persiann cdr chirp and chirp with station data chirps were selected for evaluation table 1 the trmm launched in november 27 1997 is a joint space mission between the national aeronautics and space administration and the japan aerospace exploration agency huffman et al 2007 the precipitation radar it carries is the world s first spaceborne radar designed to measure precipitation 3b42rt and 3b42 are the near real time latency product and the post processed product respectively as the successor of trmm the global precipitation mission gpm launched on feb 27 2014 it carries the first space borne ku ka band dual frequency precipitation radar and a multi channel gpm microwave imager to further enhance the ability of precipitation observation imerg is a level 3 precipitation product of gpm imerge is the near real time product with a 4 hour latency and imergf is considered the research product with a 3 5 month latency unlike trmm and imerg persiann relies heavily on infrared data and is developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing at the university of california irvine the training of the artificial neural network is done using the national centers for environmental prediction stage iv hourly precipitation data persiann cdr is the result of bias correction of persiann ashouri et al 2015 chirp is developed by the university of california at santa barbara and u s geological survey and is also based on ir data the model parameters are estimated using 3b42 chirps is generated by further integrating ground precipitation observation from five public gauge data streams and several private archives funk et al 2015 according to whether the selected spd have undergone data correction they were divided into two types namely the uncorrected spd uspd and the corrected spd cspd table 1 3 methodology 3 1 uncertainty analysis of the selected spd to eliminate the impact of large spatial scale differences between ground precipitation observations and satellite derived precipitation observations we employed an inverse distance weighting idw method to spatially interpolate the observations from a dense network including 201 rain gauges and 16 meteorological stations to generate 0 25 daily precipitation grid data dg it is commonly accepted that the interpolated results are reliable if each grid contains at least one rain gauge haylock et al 2008 in view of the high density ground precipitation observations utilized in the present study dg is accurate and reliable then taking the dg as a reference the uncertainties of the selected spd were quantified over both daily and monthly time scales in addition to evaluating their overall accuracy we further explored the uncertainty of the selected spd in identifying spatial and temporal variations in precipitation the metrics adopted included the pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse and bias bias table 2 specifically we measured the capability of the selected spd to identify spatial variations in precipitation by comparing the precipitation of spd with that of dg for each day month during the study period to assess their capability to capture temporal variations in precipitation the daily monthly precipitation temporal series in spd was compared with that in dg for each grid in the study area 3 2 uncertainty analysis of the selected spd driven hydrological simulations 3 2 1 hydrological model setting vic 3l a grid based distributed hydrological model was employed to carry out the hydrological simulations of the study area it divides the region into regular grids and each grid is subdivided into sub grids based on vegetation cover type to better describe the land atmosphere interaction of energy and water vertically the soil profile is divided into three layers to describe the dynamic response of soil moisture to precipitation the vic model can simulate hydrological processes such as runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture movement in either a water balance mode or a water and energy balance mode it is a land surface simulation so a separate lohmann routing model lohmann et al 1996 was needed to simulate streamflow more information about the vic model can be obtained from hamman et al 2018 liang et al 1994 liang et al 1996 and nijssen et al 1997 in the present study vic 4 2 d was employed to construct the model which was run in water balance mode at 0 25 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution a digital elevation model of the study area was obtained from the hydro 1 k dataset https www usgs gov centers eros which is developed by u s geological survey usgs earth resources observation and science center soil parameters were extracted from the 30 arc second harmonized world soil database hwsd released by the food and agriculture organization http www fao org soils portal data hub soil maps and databases harmonized world soil database v12 en which were then converted into the soil hydraulic parameters required by the vic model conversion of the soil parameters was conducted using the formula proposed by saxton et al 1986 land cover parameters were derived from the global 1 km land cover type dataset released by the university of maryland hansen et al 2000 the meteorological forcing parameters including daily maximum and minimum temperature and daily wind speed were generated by spatial interpolation of meteorological observation station data within and around the study area precipitation forcing data were produced from the selected spd described in section 2 2 and dg in section 3 1 the vic model involves many parameters some of which are obtained through observations others need to be calibrated according to the actual conditions in the basin according to previous studies gou et al 2020 shi et al 2008 troy et al 2008 the model parameters calibrated in this study included infilt dsmax ds ws d2 and d3 more details about these parameters are shown in table 3 3 2 2 hydrological simulation analysis two scenarios were designed to investigate the effect of the selected spd uncertainty on hydrological modeling scenario i independently calibrated the vic model driven by dg and each spd specifically according to the daily and monthly streamflow of the wangjiaba hydrological station from 2001 to 2006 the genetic algorithm wang 1991 was employed to calibrate each constructed vic model the objective function used is the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the model was warmed up in the first year 2001 each model then run hydrological simulations over the study area from 2001 to 2011 using its own model parameters given that the uncertainty of spd has a great influence on model calibration this scenario comprehensively considers the effect of spd uncertainty and the calibrated model parameters on hydrological simulations in addition scenario i assesses whether spd can be used as an independent source for reliable hydrological simulations such as in basins where ground precipitation observations are very limited or nonexistent for scenario ii the calibrated parameters of the dg driven vic model were used for each spd driven hydrological simulation this scenario focuses more on the impact of spd uncertainty on hydrological simulations moreover it investigates whether spd can replace ground precipitation observations for reliable hydrological simulations in basins where they are sufficiently available the similar designs for scenarios i and ii can be seen in previous studies bitew and gebremichael 2011 su et al 2021 sun et al 2016 the evaluation of the hydrological simulations obtained in scenarios i and ii consisted of two parts part one focused on the performance of the selected spd driven vic models in reconstructing the observed daily and monthly streamflow the observed streamflow during the period 2007 to 2011 was used for validation in view of the accuracy and reliability of dg part two took the dg driven hydrological simulations as a benchmark to evaluate the capability of the selected spd driven vic models to reproduce hydrological processes especially the temporal and spatial variations in rf et and deltmois here these three hfs were focused because they are closely related to water balance gao et al 2010b we also paid attention to their reliability in reproducing the basin scale hfs the metrics used included the taylor diagram taylor 2001 nse and the spatial efficiency metric spaef koch et al 2018 table 2 the taylor diagram assesses the overall consistency between the reference and the simulated hfs the nse evaluates the ability of the selected spd driven models to reproduce temporal variations in the hfs while the spaef was used to measure the models ability to reproduce their spatial variations 4 results 4 1 uncertainty analysis of the selected spd 4 1 1 daily time scale analysis fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of averaged daily precipitation derived from dg and the selected spd during the study period while they all exhibited a similar spatial pattern with high precipitation occurring in the south and low precipitation in the north there were great differences among them compared with dg persiann seriously underestimated precipitation over most of the study area whereas imerge overestimated precipitation most significantly in the south it is worth to note that 3b42rt shows extremely high precipitation in one pixel in the southwestern part but imerge imergf and 3b42 do not have such a problem this may be associated with the nanwan reservior there tang et al 2016 found that passive microwave retrievals are problematic in inland water bodies in the trmm era while imerg has solved this problem 3b42 may benefit from gauge correction in this region table 4 summarizes the overall accuracy of the 8 types of spd to measure daily precipitation in terms of the three metrics concerned imergf had the highest accuracy followed by imerge and 3b42 persiann preformed the worst with r values of only 0 55 and 0 49 during the calibration and validation periods respectively the data correction imparted different effects on the uspd after 3b42rt and imerge were corrected their accuracy consistently improved however for chirp and persiann their corrected results reduced bias but increased error reducing r and increasing rmse to further explore the uncertainty of the selected spd we evaluated their performances in identifying variations in daily precipitation over space and time fig 3 fig 3a and figs s1 s3 in the supplementary material show the metrics of each spd in capturing temporal variations in daily precipitation except for persiann persiann cdr and chirps the selected spd were able to roughly capture the temporal variations in daily precipitation with r values greater than 0 6 throughout most of the study area fig 3a and fig s1 chirps and persiann cdr usually had the largest errors in terms of nrmse fig s2 the bias of cspd was significantly better than for uspd fig s3 imergf and 3b42 performed best in contrast the selected spd were significantly less capable of recognizing spatial variations in daily precipitation fig 3b even the best performing chirps had a median r value of only about 0 35 during the entire study period according to nrmse there were serious uncertainties in persiann cdr and 3b42rt in characterizing spatial variations in daily precipitation on some days in addition persiann and chirps underestimated daily precipitation for more days than the other datasets 4 1 2 monthly time scale analysis as shown in table 5 the consistency between the selected spd and dg on the monthly time scale was significantly higher than that for the daily time scale table 4 even the worst performing persiann had r values of 0 72 and 0 74 during the calibration and validation periods respectively imergf exhibited the most agreement with the monthly dg and possessed the smallest rmse followed by 3b42 and chirps since the correction for uspd occurs over monthly or pentadal time scales cspd was better than the corresponding uspd in characterizing monthly precipitation table 5 moreover the improvement in accuracy of cspd relative to uspd on a monthly time scale was significantly greater than that on a daily time scale table 4 except for persiann the selected spd were effective at identifying temporal variations in monthly precipitation over most of the study area with r values greater than 0 8 fig 3c although the selected spd were significantly better at measuring spatial variations in monthly precipitation when compared with those in fig 3b it was still relatively deficient even the best performing imergf had r values of less than 0 5 during about 30 of the study period fig 3d in general cspd was better than uspd in identifying temporal and spatial variations in monthly precipitation among which 3b42 and imergf performed best 4 2 streamflow simulations fig 4 show the daily streamflow simulations driven by dg and the selected spd under the conditions defined by scenario i except for the persiann driven vic model all models satisfactorily reproduced the observed daily streamflow nse greater than 0 5 during the study period the dg driven model performed best with nse values of 0 88 during the calibration and validation periods respectively the dg driven model was followed by the imerg and 3b42 driven models both of which performed at the level of good nse 0 65 moriasi et al 2007 given that persiann seriously underestimated daily precipitation in the study area it often led to a considerable underestimate of the observed peak daily streamflow resulting in nse values of only 0 39 and 0 28 during the calibration and validation periods respectively in contrast each precipitation data driven model performed significantly better in reproducing the observed monthly streamflow fig 5 even so the persiann driven model was unable to reproduce the observed monthly streamflow satisfactorily compared to uspd driven models the cspd driven models significantly improved the accuracy of simulating streamflow especially peaks thus their ability to reproduce streamflow was better figs s4 and s5 in the supplementary material summarize each precipitation data driven streamflow simulation under scenario ii although the same real model parameters were adopted the performance ranking of spd driven streamflow simulations was roughly the same as that under scenario i these trends verify that the accuracy of the spd greatly affects the ability of the simulations to reproduce streamflow compared with the simulations under scenario i the performance of spd driven models in reproducing streamflow decreased and the decrease for uspd was greater than that for cspd as a result in addition to the persiann driven model the chirp driven model could not satisfactorily reproduce the observed streamflow under scenario ii 4 3 hydrological process simulations 4 3 1 hydrological process simulations under scenario i given that changes in soil moisture tend to be limited zero for long periods here we only present averaged daily rf and averaged daily et derived from the vic models driven by dg and the selected spd during the study period figs 6 and 7 although the simulated hfs exhibited similar spatial patterns there were large differences in the resulting values among models the imerge driven model underestimated rf in the northern part of the study area while the chirp driven model overestimated rf in the central and southeastern part of the basin the models driven by persiann and chirp significantly underestimated et while et was overestimated by the 3b42rt and imerge driven models compared with the uspd driven simulations cspd driven simulations were more consistent with dg driven simulations for example the imergf driven model corrected the underestimation in rf produced by the imerge driven model in the northern part of the study area fig 8 summarizes the overall consistency between the selected spd driven hfs simulations and the reference the models driven by imergf and 3b42 performed the best while the persiann driven model performed the worst note that the selected spd driven models exhibited different simulation accuracies for the three hfs specifically they generally performed better in reproducing et than in reproducing rf and deltmois moreover their difference in simulating et was much smaller than that in simulating the other two hfs indicating that et is less sensitive to the quality of precipitation forcing than rf and deltmois as simulations shifted from a daily time scale to a monthly time scale the consistency between the selected spd driven hfs simulations and the reference was significantly enhanced fig 9 shows the ability of the selected spd driven models to reproduce temporal and spatial variations in the three hfs unfortunately all models had great uncertainty in capturing their spatial variations on a daily time scale fig 9a specifically for any of the three hfs no model had a median spaef greater than 0 5 their ability to reproduce the spatial variations in daily deltmois was particularly poor fig 9a as for the identification of temporal variations in the three hfs over the daily time scale the selected spd driven models generated significant differences in fact only the imergf driven model effectively reproduced the temporal variations in daily rf and deltmois over half of the study area however except for the persiann chirp driven models all models satisfactorily reproduced the temporal variations in daily et the 3b42 and imerg driven models performed especially well compared with the daily simulations the selected spd driven models significantly improved the performance in capturing spatial and temporal variations in the three hfs on a monthly time scale fig 9b even so none of the models effectively reproduced their spatial variations only the models driven by chirps and 3b42 had the median spaef greater than 0 5 in characterizing spatial variations in monthly rf the cspd driven models satisfactorily reproduced temporal variations in the three hfs over almost the entire study area while the uspd driven models did not in comparison to the simulation of rf and deltmois the selected spd driven models were better at reproducing temporal variations in monthly et the cspd driven models preformed particularly well reaching the performance level of very good nse 0 75 moriasi et al 2007 finally we evaluated the capability of the selected spd driven models to reproduce the basin scale hfs fig 10 the models driven by imergf and 3b42 performed best for both the daily and monthly simulations indicating that these two datasets are of good quality and stable over both time scales the cspd driven models exhibited stronger performance in monthly simulations reaching the very good level for all three basin scale hfs simulations even though the models driven by persiann cdr and chirps effectively reproduced the observed daily streamflow fig 4 they did not satisfactorily characterize the daily variation in basin scale deltmois this indicates that the calibrated model parameters based on the observed streamflow may not be the best choice for simulating other hydrological processes 4 3 2 hydrological process simulations under scenario ii fig 11 depicts the overall performance of the selected spd driven hfs simulations under scenario ii as the uncertainty of precipitation forcing increases the deviation between the derived simulation and the reference also become larger although these simulations exhibited similar performance distribution patterns to those under scenario i fig 8 they are more consistent with the reference in terms of sd compared with the simulations under scenario i the selected spd driven models performed better in reproducing temporal and spatial variations in et and deltmois under scenario ii fig 12 this means that the real model parameters can be used to better simulate et and deltmois however ability to simulate rf was mixed the selected spd driven models were better able to reproduce its spatial variations but performed worse at reproducing the temporal changes fig 13 shows the ability of the selected spd driven models to reproduce the basin scale hfs under scenario ii as expected compared with the simulations under scenario i each model performed better at reproducing et and deltmois but worse for rf ultimately only 3b42 imergf and imerge were able to replace ground observations to satisfactorily reproduce hfs at a daily and basin wide scale for monthly simulations all models were able to satisfactorily reproduce the basin scale hfs with two exceptions the models driven by persiann and chirp basin characteristics also affect the performance of hydrological models camic et al 2018 found that spd driven models are less reliable at reproducing the observed streamflow for small basins note that reliable hydrological process simulations require a far higher quality of precipitation forcing than reliable streamflow simulation therefore if spd driven models cannot satisfactorily reproduce the observed streamflow then it is very unlikely that they can effectively reproduce temporal and spatial variations in hfs 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainty in spd precipitation represents the direct forcing of the land water cycle the accuracy of its measurement and subsequent description over time and space have important effects on hydrological simulations the persiann precipitation retrieval algorithm is mainly based on infrared satellite data and is an indirect method of estimating precipitation however 3b42rt and imerge mainly use microwave satellite data to estimate precipitation in contrast to infrared data microwave radiation can directly interact with hydrometeors in the atmosphere battaglia et al 2020 therefore they are more accurate than persiann in measuring precipitation tables 4 and 5 a similar conclusion was reached in the previous studies chen et al 2020c romilly and gebremichael 2011 and explains why the 3b42rt and imerge driven models performed better than the persiann driven model in reproducing hydrological processes figs 4 5 8 and 11 despite the fact that chirp retrieves precipitation primarily on the basis of infrared data it employs a local regression to explore the relationship between infrared information and 3b42 to estimate global daily precipitation funk et al 2015 in view of the relatively high accuracy of 3b42 and the spatial variations in model parameters it may cause chirp to measure daily precipitation better than 3b42rt table 4 as the successor of trmm gpm not only improves the spatial and temporal resolution of observations but is also significantly better at measuring light precipitation ice and snow this makes imerge more accurate than 3b42rt in estimating daily precipitation a finding consistent with previous studies le et al 2020 wu et al 2018a therefore among the uspd driven models the imerge driven models tend to exhibit the best performance in the study area compared with uspd all four types of cspd show an improvement in measuring precipitation at the monthly time scale including the characterization of the spatial and temporal variations in precipitation however on the daily time scale only imergf and 3b42 performed better than their corresponding uspd and the improvement was significantly lower than that for a monthly time scale the main reasons are as follows 1 gpcp corrects persiann 3b42rt and imerge on the monthly time scale and chirps is corrected by ground precipitation observations over a monthly or pentadal time scale funk et al 2015 2 aggregation of time steps averages the errors or cancels out the positive and negative biases 3 it should be noted that the gpcp correction does not revise the proportional relationship of each dataset on a sub month time scale furthermore the gpcp has a spatial resolution of 2 5 huffman et al 1997 so the proportional relationship of spd within each range of 2 5 2 5 cannot be changed thus imergf and 3b42 did not significantly improve the ability to estimate daily precipitation compared with their corresponding uspd even persiann cdr performed worse than persiann in terms of rmse table 4 and 4 unlike the other selected cspd chirps adjusts precipitation per grid by a factor that is a weighted average of ratios between the five closet stations and the chirp funk et al 2015 and the adjustment factor is spatially variable since the chirps considers the spatial correlation between station observations and the chirp in a local region it performed better than chirp in reproducing spatial variations in daily precipitation however in mainland china chirps uses more than 300 stations only two of which are located in the study area for correction and the number of stations varies with time resulting in large uncertainty in some adjustment factors this makes chirps worse at reproducing temporal variations in daily precipitation 5 2 effect of model parameters on hydrological simulations model parameters also represent key factors influencing the performance of hydrological models compared with those under scenario ii the hydrological simulations under scenario i generally reproduced the observed streamflow better but did not more effectively simulate the other hydrological processes there are several possible explanations for these observations first to obtain a better objective function independent calibration will adjust the model parameters according to the uncertainty characteristics of each selected spd fig 14 as a result the error in spd will be compressed when reproducing streamflow a case in point is the chirp driven hydrological simulation chirp underestimated daily precipitation during the calibration period table 4 to better reproduce the observed streamflow the chirp driven model increased base flow primarily by adjusting the related model parameters for example compared with the calibrated parameters for the dg driven model the parameters for the chirp driven model have higher values of dsmax and d3 which led to the potential for the model to generate higher base flow liang et al 1994 moreover the parameters in the chirp driven model increased ds and decreased ws these two parameters control how quickly the moisture in the third soil layer generates base flow a higher ds will generate higher base flow even when the water content in the third soil layer is low the smaller the ws values the easier nonlinear base flow will occur liang et al 1994 finally the chirp driven model produced larger base flow under scenario i than that under scenario ii fig s6 in the supplementary material and satisfactorily reproduced the observed daily and monthly streamflow under scenario i figs 4 and 5 other studies have also found that independent calibration can improve the capability of spd driven models to simulate streamflow li et al 2018b sun et al 2016 xue et al 2013 a second possible explanation is that the land hydrological cycle is a unified system and hydrological processes interact with each other therefore regulating one process will inevitably affect the simulation of other processes imerge overestimated daily precipitation in the study area table 4 to obtain the best streamflow simulation the imerge driven model reduced the peak flow by increasing d2 fig 14 however thicker soil depths also increased the loss due to et xie et al 2007 resulting in the imerge driven et simulation to possess a large bias with degraded performance since the optimization of the model parameters is mainly for streamflow other hydrological processes cannot be fully considered therefore the errors in spd may be amplified when reproducing other hydrological processes resulting in the degradation of their simulated performance it is for this reason that spd driven models generally performed better in reproducing et and deltmois under scenario ii than those under scenario i as a result of such error amplification effects spd driven models may be unable to effectively reproduce basin scale hfs even if the models can satisfactorily reproduce the observed streamflow for example the chirps driven model exhibited good performance in reproducing the observed daily streamflow under scenario i fig 4 but it could not effectively reproduce basin scale deltmois fig 10 5 3 reproducing difference in spatial and temporal variations of hfs the selected spd driven models are generally better at recognizing temporal variations in the three hfs than at reproducing their spatial variations figs 9 and 12 the possible reasons can be attributed to the following factors 1 spd especially uspd cannot accurately discriminate differences in precipitation intensity it is well known that spd often overestimates light precipitation and underestimates heavy precipitation kidd and levizzani 2011 stampoulis et al 2013 leading to greater uncertainty in identifying the spatial pattern of precipitation fig 3 however temporally there is usually a significant difference between the precipitation at a given time and the following moment this variation can partially eliminate the shortcomings of spd in discriminating differences in precipitation intensity allowing them to better characterize temporal variations in precipitation fig 3 and 2 the parameter calibration method adopted by the hydrological model could influence the model s ability to characterize spatial variations in the hfs current studies typically use the observed streamflow to calibrate the parameters in the hydrological model some studies have attempted to utilize multiple information sources such as satellite derived et and soil moisture l√≥pez et al 2017b nijzink et al 2018 however it is worth to note that the satellite derived soil moisture only represents the condition within the top few centimeters less than 5 cm of soil mccabe et al 2005 owe and van de griend 1998 and the satellite derived et is models generated not directly measured and contains uncertainties from the model and input variables l√≥pez et al 2017a martens et al 2017 mccabe et al 2017 the quality of calibration data greatly affects the reliability of hydrological model mcmillan et al 2012 since the streamflow is a one dimensional time series the calibrated model parameters are more suitable for reproducing temporal variations in hfs but lack the constraints need to reproduce their spatial variations baroni et al 2019 3 model inputs other than precipitation have certain uncertainty and 4 hydrological model structures are inherently uncertain they generally rely on many assumptions and generalizations and use simple mathematical formulas to describe internal hydrological laws so that their description of hydrological processes is to some extent imperfect which adversely affects the simulation results considering the limitation of satellite derived soil moisture in measuring depth and the fact that the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data tends to reveal the changes in terrestrial water storage on large scales 100 000 km2 due to its coarse spatial resolution mccabe et al 2017 the global land evaporation amsterdam model v3 3b et data hereafter referred to as gleam et martens et al 2017 is adopted as a benchmark to further evaluate et simulations due to its good performance in asia bai and liu 2018 khan et al 2018 the gleam et is constructed from satellite data and spans 2003 to 2020 just like spd satellite derived et also suffers from large uncertainty on the daily time scale mccabe et al 2017 thus the evaluation was carried out on the monthly time scale all generated et simulations reproduce temporal variations in gleam et well even with the lowest r value greater than 0 8 fig s7 in the supplementary material overall the selected spd driven models performed better in reproducing temporal variations in gleam et than identifying spatial variations fig 15 a which is consistent with the analysis in figs 9 and 12 furthermore the models generally reproduced gleam et better under scenario ii than under scenario i again confirming that independent calibration parameters are not necessarily the best choice for simulating hfs other than rf it should be noted that compared to the analysis using dg driven simulations as a reference the spd driven models showed poor ability in reproducing spatiotemporal variations of gleam et fig 15 in addition to being affected by the uncertainty associated with vic simulations two other possible reasons include 1 different inputs for the same forcing for example land cover is a key variable for estimating et but the constructed vic model and gleam utilize different land cover data as input and 2 uncertainty of gleam et itself for instance the precipitation input used in gleam is 3b42 martens et al 2017 however the 3b42 is insufficient to accurately identify spatial variation in precipitation fig 3 which will adversely affect accurate estimation of the spatial variation of et the impact is especially severe for dg driven et simulation fig s7 and fig 15a in addition in view of the representativeness of the trmm data for satellite precipitation observation we further evaluated the performance of 3b42rt and 3b42 in capturing temporal and spatial changes in precipitation in mainland china using ground observations from more than 2 400 meteorological stations fig s8 in the supplementary material since there are too few stations to characterize precipitation in the xinjiang region xj and the qinghai tibet plateau qt in western china we focused on the other regions fig s8 the capability of 3b42rt and 3b42 to distinguish temporal variations in precipitation within these regions was better than their ability to identify spatial variations figs s9 and s10 in the supplementary material which confirms the extensiveness of the results obtained in the study area 5 4 limitations and outlook this study focused on exploring the effect of spd uncertainty on hydrological modeling specifically spd uncertainty was measured against dg and its effect on hydrological simulations was further investigated using dg driven simulations as the reference under scenarios i and ii despite the dg driven simulations have certain uncertainty the evaluation was conducted in the same model space thereby partly eliminating the effects of uncertainties introduced by model structures model inputs other than precipitation and model parameters in fact the effect of spd uncertainty on hydrological simulations is not necessarily entirely responsible for these effects for example further improvement in the quality of model inputs can enhance the reliability of the hydrological simulations although it is more scientific to introduce other data for evaluation it is hard to attain accurate and suitable hydrological variable data like the observed streamflow in the reality ground observations are accurate but difficult to cover the entire area and there is a significant scale difference between them and simulation results satellite derived hydrological variables can solve the problem of spatial coverage but suffer from certain uncertainties mccabe et al 2017 many studies have found that satellite derived hydrological variables cannot meet water balance closure constraints gao et al 2010a pan et al 2012 weerasinghe et al 2020 nonetheless as mentioned in section 5 3 not all satellite derived hydrological variables are suitable for hydrological simulations evaluation in addition the final assessment results could amplify the effect of spd uncertainty on hydrological simulations the uncertainty of spd is the key factor affecting the reliability of hydrological models in reproducing hfs even for the evaluation based on gleam et although the quality of spd can be improved by the correction of uspd the insufficiency of cspd in identifying spatial variation of precipitation and measuring daily precipitation remains a promising scheme is to directly correct spd on a daily time scale using ground observations which allows the correction to fully perform in both temporal and spatial dimensions studies have found that the fusion of ground daily precipitation observations and spd can significantly improve the accuracy of estimating daily and monthly precipitation at the same time chen et al 2020a chen et al 2019 yang et al 2017 in addition when fusing spd and ground precipitation observations the huge difference in spatial scales between them needs to be taken into account otherwise large uncertainty would arise doing so can provide a new perspective for expanding the applications of spd in the hydrological sciences to date a series of hydrological models that resolve the physical processes with different degrees in completeness and complexity have been developed in future research more hydrological models and basins should be considered to fully explore the relationship between the quality of spd hydrological models and the simulation of hfs next there is a need to develop an appropriate multi objective calibration method that makes reasonable use of information other than the observed stream while greatly avoid the impact of its uncertainty on hydrological model in addition despite current studies on evaluating the hydrological utility of spd typically apply an optimization algorithm to calibrate hydrological model parameters the calibration method considering parameter uncertainty is promising and should be considered in the future 6 conclusion in this study we investigated the effect of 8 types of spd uncertainty on reproducing hydrological processes the experiment was carried out in the upper huaihe river basin which possesses a high density of ground precipitation observation network the uncertainty of the selected spd in identifying temporal and spatial variations in precipitation was comprehensively analyzed and then the vic model was adopted to explore the reliability of their hfs simulations over multiple temporal and spatial scales using dg driven simulations as the reference below are the main conclusions derived from the current study the capability of the selected spd to recognize temporal variations in precipitation is typically better than that to identify spatial variations although data correction improved the accuracy of uspd including their ability to identify spatial and temporal variations in precipitation the improvement of cspd relative to uspd on a monthly time scale was far better than that on daily time scale for the grid scale simulations the selected spd driven models generally performed better in characterizing temporal variations in hfs than in characterizing spatial variations overall they exhibited large uncertainties in reproducing spatio temporal variations in daily hfs in contrast although these models significantly improved the simulation performance of monthly hfs they were still relatively deficient in reproducing their spatial variations in terms of the basin scale simulations the cspd driven models tend to reliably reproduce monthly hfs independent calibration can allow the selected spd driven models to reproduce the observed streamflow as much as possible but the derived model parameters may not be the best choice for the reproduction of hfs in addition different hydrological processes exhibited different sensitivities to the quality of spd there are more stringent requirements on the quality of spd for the effective reproduction of spatio temporal variations in hfs than for the satisfactory reproduction of streamflow even if spd driven models can reproduce streamflow satisfactorily it cannot guarantee the satisfactory reproduction of all basin scale hfs cspd are more suitable to drive hydrological process simulations than uspd among the selected spd imergf and 3b42 tend to possess the best observation accuracy and the best performance for hfs simulations the study helps to strengthen the application of spd in the hydrological sciences such as by providing guidance for model diagnosis and hydrological cycle mechanism

3210,the vigorous development of satellite precipitation observations has gained widespread attention in the field of hydrology many studies have explored the reliability of hydrological models driven by satellite precipitation data spd to reproduce streamflow however the reliability of spd in the simulation of other hydrological processes remains unclear even though a full understanding of the dynamic variations in hydrological processes is essential for the scientific management of water resources in this study we investigated the effect of spd uncertainty on the distributed hydrological model in reproducing hydrological simulations the investigation was conducted in the upper huaihe river basin which has a high density ground precipitation observation network the uncertainty inherent in 8 types of spd in characterizing the temporal and spatial variations in precipitation was comprehensively examined the variable infiltration capacity hydrological model vic was then applied to further explore the reliability of the simulated hydrological fluxes and states hfs driven by the selected spd over multiple temporal spatial scales the results showed that 1 the selected spd tend to have greater uncertainty in recognizing spatial variations in precipitation than in identifying temporal variations the vic models driven by the selected spd generally performed better in characterizing temporal variations in hfs than in reproducing their spatial variations in addition the corrected spd cspd are more suitable for hfs simulations than the uncorrected spd uspd 2 the effective reproduction of the spatio temporal variations in hfs has more stringent requirements on the quality of spd than the satisfactory reproduction of streamflow for the gridded scale simulations the selected spd driven models exhibited large uncertainties in reproducing spatio temporal variations in daily hfs in contrast although these models significantly improved the simulation performance of monthly hfs they were still relatively deficient in reproducing their spatial variations in terms of the basin scale simulations the cspd driven models tend to reliably reproduce monthly hfs and 3 independent calibration can allow the selected spd driven models to reproduce streamflow more effectively but it may not result in the best reproduction of hfs this study provides guidance for strengthening the application of spd in hydrological modeling and provides feedback for further improving the quality of spd keywords precipitation hydrological simulations satellite uncertainty analysis 1 introduction as a significant component of the earth s critical zone the water cycle plays an important role in the pattern and evolution of global ecosystems hegerl et al 2015 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 hydrological models which are descriptions of the hydrological processes that occur in nature are an important tool used to explore and understand the hydrological cycle and hydrological processes beven 2011 semenova and beven 2015 precipitation is a direct driving factor in the terrestrial water cycle and its accurate representation greatly affects the reliability of hydrological process simulations maggioni and massari 2018 wang and zeng 2011 however precipitation is both temporally and spatially heterogeneous as a result its accurate characterization and estimation are currently hot topics in the fields of hydrology and meteorology traditionally observations of precipitation used in hydrological models were primarily derived from rain gauges the obtained data are accurate but this is limited to the position of the observation unfortunately in most areas rain gauges are sparsely and unevenly distributed especially in developing countries and in remote regions kidd et al 2017 the emergence of satellite observation technology provides a potentially effective solution to achieve global or quasi global precipitation observations skofronick jackson et al 2017 thus far two types of satellite derived precipitation data spd have been released one data type is mainly retrieved from thermal infrared satellite data including the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hsu et al 1997 sorooshian et al 2000 and the climate hazards group infrared precipitation chirp funk et al 2015 the other data type is microwave infrared merged dataset such as the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis huffman et al 2007 and the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg huffman et al 2019 spd provide precipitation estimation characterized by different spatial and temporal resolutions the quality of the data is dependent on the sensors sampling rate retrieval schemes and characterization of the physical properties of clouds kidd and levizzani 2011 maggioni et al 2016 the ultimate goal of satellite precipitation observations is to obtain the most accurate data possible that meets the needs of various applications for this reason many studies have comprehensively explored the advantages and disadvantages of spd nguyen et al 2018 sun et al 2018 most of these studies are based on ground precipitation observations chen and li 2016 chen et al 2013 foelsche et al 2017 gebrechorkos et al 2018 moazami and najafi 2021 tang et al 2016 a few studies applied the triple collocation method to quantify the uncertainty of spd alemohammad et al 2015 li et al 2018 massari et al 2017 since no benchmark data are required these studies only obtained relative uncertainties between the data in addition to the above mentioned inherent errors the quality of spd is also affected by seasonal variations in precipitation differences in precipitation types and intensity and changes in precipitation with topography elevation among a host of other factors bartsotas et al 2018 maggioni et al 2016 mehran and aghakouchak 2014 thus the uncertainty inherent in precipitation varies in both time and space therefore it is necessary to evaluate spd worldwide in addition it should be noted that accurate assessment of the uncertainty inherent in spd requires appropriate reference data such as sufficiently dense ground observations chen et al 2020b tian et al 2018 with the widespread application of spd the uncertainty inherent in their applications has received more attention especially for the analysis of climate chen and gao 2018 drought sahoo et al 2015 zhong et al 2019 and hydrology maggioni and massari 2018 yong et al 2010 in the field of hydrology the highly non linear characteristics of the distributed hydrological models allow the uncertainty in spd to be propagated through the model resulting in greater uncertainty in the simulated results numerous studies have therefore been conducted around the world to explore the feasibility of spd driven hydrological models beck et al 2017 camici et al 2018 camici et al 2020 le et al 2020 li et al 2018b satg√© et al 2021 su et al 2019 sun et al 2018b wu et al 2018b these studies have mainly focused on the uncertainty in reproducing streamflow much less attention has been paid to other hydrological processes although the performance of these models varies significantly between regions there is a consensus that spd have significant potential to be effectively used in hydrological simulations especially in areas where ground precipitation observations are scarce or absent although streamflow is a key component needed to understand the temporal dynamics of a watershed s hydrological system it does not provide information about the spatial heterogeneity of the hydrological cycle within the watershed this information is provided by other hydrological parameters the purpose of hydrological modeling is to reliably represent the temporal and spatial variations of hydrological processes beven 2019 over the past few decades advances in satellite observation and computing power have led to the development and application of distributed hydrological models characterized by increasingly higher resolutions the spatial representation of hydrological fluxes and states hfs that they provide has become an important tool for decision makers in a range of applications such as land atmosphere feedback analysis drought monitoring flood prediction and control water resources management and ecological restoration among a host of other fields rakovec et al 2016 while significant insights into the relationship s between the quality of spd and a model s ability to reproduce streamflow have been obtained it is still unknown whether spd driven models reliably reproduce temporal and spatial variations in hfs and or the extent to which results are reliable this will affect the breadth and depth of the application of spd in hydrological modeling in addition improper use of simulation results may lead to an erroneous understanding of hydrological processes and the scientific mismanagement of water resources based on the above considerations the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of spd uncertainty on the distributed hydrological model in reproducing the temporal and spatial variations of hydrological processes taking the upper huaihe river basin in china as a representative study area we first analyzed the uncertainty inherent in 8 types of spd in comparison to a highly dense ground precipitation observation network approximately one per 140 km2 in doing so we focused on their performance in identifying temporal and spatial variations in precipitation then the widely used variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model was employed to assess the effect of the selected spd uncertainty on reproducing temporal and spatial variations in the three hfs including runoff rf evapotranspiration et and changes in soil moisture deltmois which are closely related to water balance over multiple temporal and spatial scales 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the wangjiaba basin is an upstream tributary to the huai river and covers an area of 30 500 km2 the wangjiaba hydrological station monitors streamflow at the outlet of the basin the northeast section of the study area is characterized by low relief terrain while the southwest part is mountainous altitude ranges from about 20 m to over 1500 m fig 1 the study area is situated in a transitional zone from a warm temperate climate to a northern subtropical climate the long term average annual precipitation is over 900 mm precipitation is largely controlled by the east asian monsoon which is mainly concentrated in june september and accounts for about 60 80 of the total annual precipitation the annual average temperature is 11 16 c the highest average monthly temperature 25 c occurs in july and the lowest 0 c occurs in january the annual average et is about 600 800 mm land cover types over the study area are dominated by cropland about 65 of the total area grassland 24 99 and woodland 7 53 as shown in fig 1 there are 201 rain gauges and 16 meteorological stations within the basin and their basic information is shown in table s1 in the supplementary material 2 2 data meteorological data including daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature wind speed and daily precipitation have been collected at 16 meteorological stations within the study area these data were obtained from the china meteorological science data sharing network and had undergone rigorous quality controls such as extreme value checks and consistency checks yu et al 2007 daily precipitation has also been monitored at 201 rain gauges in the basin daily streamflow observations have been made at the wangjiaba hydrological station these data were obtained from the annual hydrological report of the people s republic of china according to the report ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2011 the observation data were also subject to strict quality controls before being released all above ground observations cover the period 2001 2011 eight types of spd including trmm 3b42rt 3b42rt trmm 3b42 3b42 imerg early run imerge imerg final run imergf persiann persiann climate data record persiann cdr chirp and chirp with station data chirps were selected for evaluation table 1 the trmm launched in november 27 1997 is a joint space mission between the national aeronautics and space administration and the japan aerospace exploration agency huffman et al 2007 the precipitation radar it carries is the world s first spaceborne radar designed to measure precipitation 3b42rt and 3b42 are the near real time latency product and the post processed product respectively as the successor of trmm the global precipitation mission gpm launched on feb 27 2014 it carries the first space borne ku ka band dual frequency precipitation radar and a multi channel gpm microwave imager to further enhance the ability of precipitation observation imerg is a level 3 precipitation product of gpm imerge is the near real time product with a 4 hour latency and imergf is considered the research product with a 3 5 month latency unlike trmm and imerg persiann relies heavily on infrared data and is developed by the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing at the university of california irvine the training of the artificial neural network is done using the national centers for environmental prediction stage iv hourly precipitation data persiann cdr is the result of bias correction of persiann ashouri et al 2015 chirp is developed by the university of california at santa barbara and u s geological survey and is also based on ir data the model parameters are estimated using 3b42 chirps is generated by further integrating ground precipitation observation from five public gauge data streams and several private archives funk et al 2015 according to whether the selected spd have undergone data correction they were divided into two types namely the uncorrected spd uspd and the corrected spd cspd table 1 3 methodology 3 1 uncertainty analysis of the selected spd to eliminate the impact of large spatial scale differences between ground precipitation observations and satellite derived precipitation observations we employed an inverse distance weighting idw method to spatially interpolate the observations from a dense network including 201 rain gauges and 16 meteorological stations to generate 0 25 daily precipitation grid data dg it is commonly accepted that the interpolated results are reliable if each grid contains at least one rain gauge haylock et al 2008 in view of the high density ground precipitation observations utilized in the present study dg is accurate and reliable then taking the dg as a reference the uncertainties of the selected spd were quantified over both daily and monthly time scales in addition to evaluating their overall accuracy we further explored the uncertainty of the selected spd in identifying spatial and temporal variations in precipitation the metrics adopted included the pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse normalized rmse nrmse and bias bias table 2 specifically we measured the capability of the selected spd to identify spatial variations in precipitation by comparing the precipitation of spd with that of dg for each day month during the study period to assess their capability to capture temporal variations in precipitation the daily monthly precipitation temporal series in spd was compared with that in dg for each grid in the study area 3 2 uncertainty analysis of the selected spd driven hydrological simulations 3 2 1 hydrological model setting vic 3l a grid based distributed hydrological model was employed to carry out the hydrological simulations of the study area it divides the region into regular grids and each grid is subdivided into sub grids based on vegetation cover type to better describe the land atmosphere interaction of energy and water vertically the soil profile is divided into three layers to describe the dynamic response of soil moisture to precipitation the vic model can simulate hydrological processes such as runoff evapotranspiration and soil moisture movement in either a water balance mode or a water and energy balance mode it is a land surface simulation so a separate lohmann routing model lohmann et al 1996 was needed to simulate streamflow more information about the vic model can be obtained from hamman et al 2018 liang et al 1994 liang et al 1996 and nijssen et al 1997 in the present study vic 4 2 d was employed to construct the model which was run in water balance mode at 0 25 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution a digital elevation model of the study area was obtained from the hydro 1 k dataset https www usgs gov centers eros which is developed by u s geological survey usgs earth resources observation and science center soil parameters were extracted from the 30 arc second harmonized world soil database hwsd released by the food and agriculture organization http www fao org soils portal data hub soil maps and databases harmonized world soil database v12 en which were then converted into the soil hydraulic parameters required by the vic model conversion of the soil parameters was conducted using the formula proposed by saxton et al 1986 land cover parameters were derived from the global 1 km land cover type dataset released by the university of maryland hansen et al 2000 the meteorological forcing parameters including daily maximum and minimum temperature and daily wind speed were generated by spatial interpolation of meteorological observation station data within and around the study area precipitation forcing data were produced from the selected spd described in section 2 2 and dg in section 3 1 the vic model involves many parameters some of which are obtained through observations others need to be calibrated according to the actual conditions in the basin according to previous studies gou et al 2020 shi et al 2008 troy et al 2008 the model parameters calibrated in this study included infilt dsmax ds ws d2 and d3 more details about these parameters are shown in table 3 3 2 2 hydrological simulation analysis two scenarios were designed to investigate the effect of the selected spd uncertainty on hydrological modeling scenario i independently calibrated the vic model driven by dg and each spd specifically according to the daily and monthly streamflow of the wangjiaba hydrological station from 2001 to 2006 the genetic algorithm wang 1991 was employed to calibrate each constructed vic model the objective function used is the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the model was warmed up in the first year 2001 each model then run hydrological simulations over the study area from 2001 to 2011 using its own model parameters given that the uncertainty of spd has a great influence on model calibration this scenario comprehensively considers the effect of spd uncertainty and the calibrated model parameters on hydrological simulations in addition scenario i assesses whether spd can be used as an independent source for reliable hydrological simulations such as in basins where ground precipitation observations are very limited or nonexistent for scenario ii the calibrated parameters of the dg driven vic model were used for each spd driven hydrological simulation this scenario focuses more on the impact of spd uncertainty on hydrological simulations moreover it investigates whether spd can replace ground precipitation observations for reliable hydrological simulations in basins where they are sufficiently available the similar designs for scenarios i and ii can be seen in previous studies bitew and gebremichael 2011 su et al 2021 sun et al 2016 the evaluation of the hydrological simulations obtained in scenarios i and ii consisted of two parts part one focused on the performance of the selected spd driven vic models in reconstructing the observed daily and monthly streamflow the observed streamflow during the period 2007 to 2011 was used for validation in view of the accuracy and reliability of dg part two took the dg driven hydrological simulations as a benchmark to evaluate the capability of the selected spd driven vic models to reproduce hydrological processes especially the temporal and spatial variations in rf et and deltmois here these three hfs were focused because they are closely related to water balance gao et al 2010b we also paid attention to their reliability in reproducing the basin scale hfs the metrics used included the taylor diagram taylor 2001 nse and the spatial efficiency metric spaef koch et al 2018 table 2 the taylor diagram assesses the overall consistency between the reference and the simulated hfs the nse evaluates the ability of the selected spd driven models to reproduce temporal variations in the hfs while the spaef was used to measure the models ability to reproduce their spatial variations 4 results 4 1 uncertainty analysis of the selected spd 4 1 1 daily time scale analysis fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of averaged daily precipitation derived from dg and the selected spd during the study period while they all exhibited a similar spatial pattern with high precipitation occurring in the south and low precipitation in the north there were great differences among them compared with dg persiann seriously underestimated precipitation over most of the study area whereas imerge overestimated precipitation most significantly in the south it is worth to note that 3b42rt shows extremely high precipitation in one pixel in the southwestern part but imerge imergf and 3b42 do not have such a problem this may be associated with the nanwan reservior there tang et al 2016 found that passive microwave retrievals are problematic in inland water bodies in the trmm era while imerg has solved this problem 3b42 may benefit from gauge correction in this region table 4 summarizes the overall accuracy of the 8 types of spd to measure daily precipitation in terms of the three metrics concerned imergf had the highest accuracy followed by imerge and 3b42 persiann preformed the worst with r values of only 0 55 and 0 49 during the calibration and validation periods respectively the data correction imparted different effects on the uspd after 3b42rt and imerge were corrected their accuracy consistently improved however for chirp and persiann their corrected results reduced bias but increased error reducing r and increasing rmse to further explore the uncertainty of the selected spd we evaluated their performances in identifying variations in daily precipitation over space and time fig 3 fig 3a and figs s1 s3 in the supplementary material show the metrics of each spd in capturing temporal variations in daily precipitation except for persiann persiann cdr and chirps the selected spd were able to roughly capture the temporal variations in daily precipitation with r values greater than 0 6 throughout most of the study area fig 3a and fig s1 chirps and persiann cdr usually had the largest errors in terms of nrmse fig s2 the bias of cspd was significantly better than for uspd fig s3 imergf and 3b42 performed best in contrast the selected spd were significantly less capable of recognizing spatial variations in daily precipitation fig 3b even the best performing chirps had a median r value of only about 0 35 during the entire study period according to nrmse there were serious uncertainties in persiann cdr and 3b42rt in characterizing spatial variations in daily precipitation on some days in addition persiann and chirps underestimated daily precipitation for more days than the other datasets 4 1 2 monthly time scale analysis as shown in table 5 the consistency between the selected spd and dg on the monthly time scale was significantly higher than that for the daily time scale table 4 even the worst performing persiann had r values of 0 72 and 0 74 during the calibration and validation periods respectively imergf exhibited the most agreement with the monthly dg and possessed the smallest rmse followed by 3b42 and chirps since the correction for uspd occurs over monthly or pentadal time scales cspd was better than the corresponding uspd in characterizing monthly precipitation table 5 moreover the improvement in accuracy of cspd relative to uspd on a monthly time scale was significantly greater than that on a daily time scale table 4 except for persiann the selected spd were effective at identifying temporal variations in monthly precipitation over most of the study area with r values greater than 0 8 fig 3c although the selected spd were significantly better at measuring spatial variations in monthly precipitation when compared with those in fig 3b it was still relatively deficient even the best performing imergf had r values of less than 0 5 during about 30 of the study period fig 3d in general cspd was better than uspd in identifying temporal and spatial variations in monthly precipitation among which 3b42 and imergf performed best 4 2 streamflow simulations fig 4 show the daily streamflow simulations driven by dg and the selected spd under the conditions defined by scenario i except for the persiann driven vic model all models satisfactorily reproduced the observed daily streamflow nse greater than 0 5 during the study period the dg driven model performed best with nse values of 0 88 during the calibration and validation periods respectively the dg driven model was followed by the imerg and 3b42 driven models both of which performed at the level of good nse 0 65 moriasi et al 2007 given that persiann seriously underestimated daily precipitation in the study area it often led to a considerable underestimate of the observed peak daily streamflow resulting in nse values of only 0 39 and 0 28 during the calibration and validation periods respectively in contrast each precipitation data driven model performed significantly better in reproducing the observed monthly streamflow fig 5 even so the persiann driven model was unable to reproduce the observed monthly streamflow satisfactorily compared to uspd driven models the cspd driven models significantly improved the accuracy of simulating streamflow especially peaks thus their ability to reproduce streamflow was better figs s4 and s5 in the supplementary material summarize each precipitation data driven streamflow simulation under scenario ii although the same real model parameters were adopted the performance ranking of spd driven streamflow simulations was roughly the same as that under scenario i these trends verify that the accuracy of the spd greatly affects the ability of the simulations to reproduce streamflow compared with the simulations under scenario i the performance of spd driven models in reproducing streamflow decreased and the decrease for uspd was greater than that for cspd as a result in addition to the persiann driven model the chirp driven model could not satisfactorily reproduce the observed streamflow under scenario ii 4 3 hydrological process simulations 4 3 1 hydrological process simulations under scenario i given that changes in soil moisture tend to be limited zero for long periods here we only present averaged daily rf and averaged daily et derived from the vic models driven by dg and the selected spd during the study period figs 6 and 7 although the simulated hfs exhibited similar spatial patterns there were large differences in the resulting values among models the imerge driven model underestimated rf in the northern part of the study area while the chirp driven model overestimated rf in the central and southeastern part of the basin the models driven by persiann and chirp significantly underestimated et while et was overestimated by the 3b42rt and imerge driven models compared with the uspd driven simulations cspd driven simulations were more consistent with dg driven simulations for example the imergf driven model corrected the underestimation in rf produced by the imerge driven model in the northern part of the study area fig 8 summarizes the overall consistency between the selected spd driven hfs simulations and the reference the models driven by imergf and 3b42 performed the best while the persiann driven model performed the worst note that the selected spd driven models exhibited different simulation accuracies for the three hfs specifically they generally performed better in reproducing et than in reproducing rf and deltmois moreover their difference in simulating et was much smaller than that in simulating the other two hfs indicating that et is less sensitive to the quality of precipitation forcing than rf and deltmois as simulations shifted from a daily time scale to a monthly time scale the consistency between the selected spd driven hfs simulations and the reference was significantly enhanced fig 9 shows the ability of the selected spd driven models to reproduce temporal and spatial variations in the three hfs unfortunately all models had great uncertainty in capturing their spatial variations on a daily time scale fig 9a specifically for any of the three hfs no model had a median spaef greater than 0 5 their ability to reproduce the spatial variations in daily deltmois was particularly poor fig 9a as for the identification of temporal variations in the three hfs over the daily time scale the selected spd driven models generated significant differences in fact only the imergf driven model effectively reproduced the temporal variations in daily rf and deltmois over half of the study area however except for the persiann chirp driven models all models satisfactorily reproduced the temporal variations in daily et the 3b42 and imerg driven models performed especially well compared with the daily simulations the selected spd driven models significantly improved the performance in capturing spatial and temporal variations in the three hfs on a monthly time scale fig 9b even so none of the models effectively reproduced their spatial variations only the models driven by chirps and 3b42 had the median spaef greater than 0 5 in characterizing spatial variations in monthly rf the cspd driven models satisfactorily reproduced temporal variations in the three hfs over almost the entire study area while the uspd driven models did not in comparison to the simulation of rf and deltmois the selected spd driven models were better at reproducing temporal variations in monthly et the cspd driven models preformed particularly well reaching the performance level of very good nse 0 75 moriasi et al 2007 finally we evaluated the capability of the selected spd driven models to reproduce the basin scale hfs fig 10 the models driven by imergf and 3b42 performed best for both the daily and monthly simulations indicating that these two datasets are of good quality and stable over both time scales the cspd driven models exhibited stronger performance in monthly simulations reaching the very good level for all three basin scale hfs simulations even though the models driven by persiann cdr and chirps effectively reproduced the observed daily streamflow fig 4 they did not satisfactorily characterize the daily variation in basin scale deltmois this indicates that the calibrated model parameters based on the observed streamflow may not be the best choice for simulating other hydrological processes 4 3 2 hydrological process simulations under scenario ii fig 11 depicts the overall performance of the selected spd driven hfs simulations under scenario ii as the uncertainty of precipitation forcing increases the deviation between the derived simulation and the reference also become larger although these simulations exhibited similar performance distribution patterns to those under scenario i fig 8 they are more consistent with the reference in terms of sd compared with the simulations under scenario i the selected spd driven models performed better in reproducing temporal and spatial variations in et and deltmois under scenario ii fig 12 this means that the real model parameters can be used to better simulate et and deltmois however ability to simulate rf was mixed the selected spd driven models were better able to reproduce its spatial variations but performed worse at reproducing the temporal changes fig 13 shows the ability of the selected spd driven models to reproduce the basin scale hfs under scenario ii as expected compared with the simulations under scenario i each model performed better at reproducing et and deltmois but worse for rf ultimately only 3b42 imergf and imerge were able to replace ground observations to satisfactorily reproduce hfs at a daily and basin wide scale for monthly simulations all models were able to satisfactorily reproduce the basin scale hfs with two exceptions the models driven by persiann and chirp basin characteristics also affect the performance of hydrological models camic et al 2018 found that spd driven models are less reliable at reproducing the observed streamflow for small basins note that reliable hydrological process simulations require a far higher quality of precipitation forcing than reliable streamflow simulation therefore if spd driven models cannot satisfactorily reproduce the observed streamflow then it is very unlikely that they can effectively reproduce temporal and spatial variations in hfs 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainty in spd precipitation represents the direct forcing of the land water cycle the accuracy of its measurement and subsequent description over time and space have important effects on hydrological simulations the persiann precipitation retrieval algorithm is mainly based on infrared satellite data and is an indirect method of estimating precipitation however 3b42rt and imerge mainly use microwave satellite data to estimate precipitation in contrast to infrared data microwave radiation can directly interact with hydrometeors in the atmosphere battaglia et al 2020 therefore they are more accurate than persiann in measuring precipitation tables 4 and 5 a similar conclusion was reached in the previous studies chen et al 2020c romilly and gebremichael 2011 and explains why the 3b42rt and imerge driven models performed better than the persiann driven model in reproducing hydrological processes figs 4 5 8 and 11 despite the fact that chirp retrieves precipitation primarily on the basis of infrared data it employs a local regression to explore the relationship between infrared information and 3b42 to estimate global daily precipitation funk et al 2015 in view of the relatively high accuracy of 3b42 and the spatial variations in model parameters it may cause chirp to measure daily precipitation better than 3b42rt table 4 as the successor of trmm gpm not only improves the spatial and temporal resolution of observations but is also significantly better at measuring light precipitation ice and snow this makes imerge more accurate than 3b42rt in estimating daily precipitation a finding consistent with previous studies le et al 2020 wu et al 2018a therefore among the uspd driven models the imerge driven models tend to exhibit the best performance in the study area compared with uspd all four types of cspd show an improvement in measuring precipitation at the monthly time scale including the characterization of the spatial and temporal variations in precipitation however on the daily time scale only imergf and 3b42 performed better than their corresponding uspd and the improvement was significantly lower than that for a monthly time scale the main reasons are as follows 1 gpcp corrects persiann 3b42rt and imerge on the monthly time scale and chirps is corrected by ground precipitation observations over a monthly or pentadal time scale funk et al 2015 2 aggregation of time steps averages the errors or cancels out the positive and negative biases 3 it should be noted that the gpcp correction does not revise the proportional relationship of each dataset on a sub month time scale furthermore the gpcp has a spatial resolution of 2 5 huffman et al 1997 so the proportional relationship of spd within each range of 2 5 2 5 cannot be changed thus imergf and 3b42 did not significantly improve the ability to estimate daily precipitation compared with their corresponding uspd even persiann cdr performed worse than persiann in terms of rmse table 4 and 4 unlike the other selected cspd chirps adjusts precipitation per grid by a factor that is a weighted average of ratios between the five closet stations and the chirp funk et al 2015 and the adjustment factor is spatially variable since the chirps considers the spatial correlation between station observations and the chirp in a local region it performed better than chirp in reproducing spatial variations in daily precipitation however in mainland china chirps uses more than 300 stations only two of which are located in the study area for correction and the number of stations varies with time resulting in large uncertainty in some adjustment factors this makes chirps worse at reproducing temporal variations in daily precipitation 5 2 effect of model parameters on hydrological simulations model parameters also represent key factors influencing the performance of hydrological models compared with those under scenario ii the hydrological simulations under scenario i generally reproduced the observed streamflow better but did not more effectively simulate the other hydrological processes there are several possible explanations for these observations first to obtain a better objective function independent calibration will adjust the model parameters according to the uncertainty characteristics of each selected spd fig 14 as a result the error in spd will be compressed when reproducing streamflow a case in point is the chirp driven hydrological simulation chirp underestimated daily precipitation during the calibration period table 4 to better reproduce the observed streamflow the chirp driven model increased base flow primarily by adjusting the related model parameters for example compared with the calibrated parameters for the dg driven model the parameters for the chirp driven model have higher values of dsmax and d3 which led to the potential for the model to generate higher base flow liang et al 1994 moreover the parameters in the chirp driven model increased ds and decreased ws these two parameters control how quickly the moisture in the third soil layer generates base flow a higher ds will generate higher base flow even when the water content in the third soil layer is low the smaller the ws values the easier nonlinear base flow will occur liang et al 1994 finally the chirp driven model produced larger base flow under scenario i than that under scenario ii fig s6 in the supplementary material and satisfactorily reproduced the observed daily and monthly streamflow under scenario i figs 4 and 5 other studies have also found that independent calibration can improve the capability of spd driven models to simulate streamflow li et al 2018b sun et al 2016 xue et al 2013 a second possible explanation is that the land hydrological cycle is a unified system and hydrological processes interact with each other therefore regulating one process will inevitably affect the simulation of other processes imerge overestimated daily precipitation in the study area table 4 to obtain the best streamflow simulation the imerge driven model reduced the peak flow by increasing d2 fig 14 however thicker soil depths also increased the loss due to et xie et al 2007 resulting in the imerge driven et simulation to possess a large bias with degraded performance since the optimization of the model parameters is mainly for streamflow other hydrological processes cannot be fully considered therefore the errors in spd may be amplified when reproducing other hydrological processes resulting in the degradation of their simulated performance it is for this reason that spd driven models generally performed better in reproducing et and deltmois under scenario ii than those under scenario i as a result of such error amplification effects spd driven models may be unable to effectively reproduce basin scale hfs even if the models can satisfactorily reproduce the observed streamflow for example the chirps driven model exhibited good performance in reproducing the observed daily streamflow under scenario i fig 4 but it could not effectively reproduce basin scale deltmois fig 10 5 3 reproducing difference in spatial and temporal variations of hfs the selected spd driven models are generally better at recognizing temporal variations in the three hfs than at reproducing their spatial variations figs 9 and 12 the possible reasons can be attributed to the following factors 1 spd especially uspd cannot accurately discriminate differences in precipitation intensity it is well known that spd often overestimates light precipitation and underestimates heavy precipitation kidd and levizzani 2011 stampoulis et al 2013 leading to greater uncertainty in identifying the spatial pattern of precipitation fig 3 however temporally there is usually a significant difference between the precipitation at a given time and the following moment this variation can partially eliminate the shortcomings of spd in discriminating differences in precipitation intensity allowing them to better characterize temporal variations in precipitation fig 3 and 2 the parameter calibration method adopted by the hydrological model could influence the model s ability to characterize spatial variations in the hfs current studies typically use the observed streamflow to calibrate the parameters in the hydrological model some studies have attempted to utilize multiple information sources such as satellite derived et and soil moisture l√≥pez et al 2017b nijzink et al 2018 however it is worth to note that the satellite derived soil moisture only represents the condition within the top few centimeters less than 5 cm of soil mccabe et al 2005 owe and van de griend 1998 and the satellite derived et is models generated not directly measured and contains uncertainties from the model and input variables l√≥pez et al 2017a martens et al 2017 mccabe et al 2017 the quality of calibration data greatly affects the reliability of hydrological model mcmillan et al 2012 since the streamflow is a one dimensional time series the calibrated model parameters are more suitable for reproducing temporal variations in hfs but lack the constraints need to reproduce their spatial variations baroni et al 2019 3 model inputs other than precipitation have certain uncertainty and 4 hydrological model structures are inherently uncertain they generally rely on many assumptions and generalizations and use simple mathematical formulas to describe internal hydrological laws so that their description of hydrological processes is to some extent imperfect which adversely affects the simulation results considering the limitation of satellite derived soil moisture in measuring depth and the fact that the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data tends to reveal the changes in terrestrial water storage on large scales 100 000 km2 due to its coarse spatial resolution mccabe et al 2017 the global land evaporation amsterdam model v3 3b et data hereafter referred to as gleam et martens et al 2017 is adopted as a benchmark to further evaluate et simulations due to its good performance in asia bai and liu 2018 khan et al 2018 the gleam et is constructed from satellite data and spans 2003 to 2020 just like spd satellite derived et also suffers from large uncertainty on the daily time scale mccabe et al 2017 thus the evaluation was carried out on the monthly time scale all generated et simulations reproduce temporal variations in gleam et well even with the lowest r value greater than 0 8 fig s7 in the supplementary material overall the selected spd driven models performed better in reproducing temporal variations in gleam et than identifying spatial variations fig 15 a which is consistent with the analysis in figs 9 and 12 furthermore the models generally reproduced gleam et better under scenario ii than under scenario i again confirming that independent calibration parameters are not necessarily the best choice for simulating hfs other than rf it should be noted that compared to the analysis using dg driven simulations as a reference the spd driven models showed poor ability in reproducing spatiotemporal variations of gleam et fig 15 in addition to being affected by the uncertainty associated with vic simulations two other possible reasons include 1 different inputs for the same forcing for example land cover is a key variable for estimating et but the constructed vic model and gleam utilize different land cover data as input and 2 uncertainty of gleam et itself for instance the precipitation input used in gleam is 3b42 martens et al 2017 however the 3b42 is insufficient to accurately identify spatial variation in precipitation fig 3 which will adversely affect accurate estimation of the spatial variation of et the impact is especially severe for dg driven et simulation fig s7 and fig 15a in addition in view of the representativeness of the trmm data for satellite precipitation observation we further evaluated the performance of 3b42rt and 3b42 in capturing temporal and spatial changes in precipitation in mainland china using ground observations from more than 2 400 meteorological stations fig s8 in the supplementary material since there are too few stations to characterize precipitation in the xinjiang region xj and the qinghai tibet plateau qt in western china we focused on the other regions fig s8 the capability of 3b42rt and 3b42 to distinguish temporal variations in precipitation within these regions was better than their ability to identify spatial variations figs s9 and s10 in the supplementary material which confirms the extensiveness of the results obtained in the study area 5 4 limitations and outlook this study focused on exploring the effect of spd uncertainty on hydrological modeling specifically spd uncertainty was measured against dg and its effect on hydrological simulations was further investigated using dg driven simulations as the reference under scenarios i and ii despite the dg driven simulations have certain uncertainty the evaluation was conducted in the same model space thereby partly eliminating the effects of uncertainties introduced by model structures model inputs other than precipitation and model parameters in fact the effect of spd uncertainty on hydrological simulations is not necessarily entirely responsible for these effects for example further improvement in the quality of model inputs can enhance the reliability of the hydrological simulations although it is more scientific to introduce other data for evaluation it is hard to attain accurate and suitable hydrological variable data like the observed streamflow in the reality ground observations are accurate but difficult to cover the entire area and there is a significant scale difference between them and simulation results satellite derived hydrological variables can solve the problem of spatial coverage but suffer from certain uncertainties mccabe et al 2017 many studies have found that satellite derived hydrological variables cannot meet water balance closure constraints gao et al 2010a pan et al 2012 weerasinghe et al 2020 nonetheless as mentioned in section 5 3 not all satellite derived hydrological variables are suitable for hydrological simulations evaluation in addition the final assessment results could amplify the effect of spd uncertainty on hydrological simulations the uncertainty of spd is the key factor affecting the reliability of hydrological models in reproducing hfs even for the evaluation based on gleam et although the quality of spd can be improved by the correction of uspd the insufficiency of cspd in identifying spatial variation of precipitation and measuring daily precipitation remains a promising scheme is to directly correct spd on a daily time scale using ground observations which allows the correction to fully perform in both temporal and spatial dimensions studies have found that the fusion of ground daily precipitation observations and spd can significantly improve the accuracy of estimating daily and monthly precipitation at the same time chen et al 2020a chen et al 2019 yang et al 2017 in addition when fusing spd and ground precipitation observations the huge difference in spatial scales between them needs to be taken into account otherwise large uncertainty would arise doing so can provide a new perspective for expanding the applications of spd in the hydrological sciences to date a series of hydrological models that resolve the physical processes with different degrees in completeness and complexity have been developed in future research more hydrological models and basins should be considered to fully explore the relationship between the quality of spd hydrological models and the simulation of hfs next there is a need to develop an appropriate multi objective calibration method that makes reasonable use of information other than the observed stream while greatly avoid the impact of its uncertainty on hydrological model in addition despite current studies on evaluating the hydrological utility of spd typically apply an optimization algorithm to calibrate hydrological model parameters the calibration method considering parameter uncertainty is promising and should be considered in the future 6 conclusion in this study we investigated the effect of 8 types of spd uncertainty on reproducing hydrological processes the experiment was carried out in the upper huaihe river basin which possesses a high density of ground precipitation observation network the uncertainty of the selected spd in identifying temporal and spatial variations in precipitation was comprehensively analyzed and then the vic model was adopted to explore the reliability of their hfs simulations over multiple temporal and spatial scales using dg driven simulations as the reference below are the main conclusions derived from the current study the capability of the selected spd to recognize temporal variations in precipitation is typically better than that to identify spatial variations although data correction improved the accuracy of uspd including their ability to identify spatial and temporal variations in precipitation the improvement of cspd relative to uspd on a monthly time scale was far better than that on daily time scale for the grid scale simulations the selected spd driven models generally performed better in characterizing temporal variations in hfs than in characterizing spatial variations overall they exhibited large uncertainties in reproducing spatio temporal variations in daily hfs in contrast although these models significantly improved the simulation performance of monthly hfs they were still relatively deficient in reproducing their spatial variations in terms of the basin scale simulations the cspd driven models tend to reliably reproduce monthly hfs independent calibration can allow the selected spd driven models to reproduce the observed streamflow as much as possible but the derived model parameters may not be the best choice for the reproduction of hfs in addition different hydrological processes exhibited different sensitivities to the quality of spd there are more stringent requirements on the quality of spd for the effective reproduction of spatio temporal variations in hfs than for the satisfactory reproduction of streamflow even if spd driven models can reproduce streamflow satisfactorily it cannot guarantee the satisfactory reproduction of all basin scale hfs cspd are more suitable to drive hydrological process simulations than uspd among the selected spd imergf and 3b42 tend to possess the best observation accuracy and the best performance for hfs simulations the study helps to strengthen the application of spd in the hydrological sciences such as by providing guidance for model diagnosis and hydrological cycle mechanism

3211,the impacts of climate change on groundwater are poorly constrained particularly in regions such as sub saharan africa where global circulation models gcms project different directions of precipitation change moreover the timing of when climate change impacts on groundwater can be differentiated from natural variability has not been quantified here for the first time we estimate the time of emergence toe of climate change impacts on groundwater levels using time series from eight sites across burkina faso west africa we apply output data from historical and rcp8 5 runs of cmip5 gcms to lumped groundwater models for each site and estimate toe by calculating signal to noise ratios for each site and cmip5 model we show that in addition to inconsistent direction of climate change impacts across different gcms there is inconsistency in the toe of climate change signals in future groundwater levels particularly in drying gcms across the eight sites between 5 4 and 13 13 cmip5 gcms of a possible 23 show a toe associated with decreases increases in groundwater levels toe from cmip5 gcms producing decreases in groundwater levels i e drying is highly variable between sites and gcms across all sites median toe 2049 interquartile range 48 years for cmip5 gcms producing increases in groundwater levels i e wetting toe appears to occur earlier and with less variability across all sites median toe 2011 interquartile range 11 years these results underline the need for development of no regrets adaptation measures in parallel with reductions in gcm uncertainty keywords groundwater climate change time of emergence sub saharan africa burkina faso 1 introduction groundwater provides approximately 50 of the worlds drinking water supplies smith et al 2016 as well as supporting livelihoods through productive uses and sustaining baseflow to surface waters although the potential for further development of groundwater in sub saharan africa ssa is recognised groundwater is already a crucial source of supply for many including dispersed rural populations and those in urban areas without access to piped supplies cobbing 2020 macdonald et al 2012 anthropogenic climate change is now unequivocal ipcc 2014 and a large number of studies have quantified the impacts of climate change on groundwater resources see a synopsis of reviews by smerdon 2017 and a more recent review by amanambu et al 2020 including a number of studies in ssa e g badou et al 2018 cuthbert et al 2019 kingston and taylor 2010 mileham et al 2009 it has generally been concluded that the choice of global circulation model gcms accounts for the greatest uncertainty in climate change impacts on groundwater smerdon 2017 gcms have been shown to disagree on the direction of climate change impacts on precipitation and hence groundwater recharge and levels when assessing impacts of climate change on groundwater a conventional approach often used ascott et al 2019 dams et al 2012 guardiola albert and jackson 2011 jackson et al 2011 moeck et al 2016 is to evaluate changes in groundwater recharge and levels in future time periods e g the 2050s 2080s in comparison to a baseline period e g 1950 2000 this approach is useful to understand the magnitude of potential changes in groundwater resources in future decades and has been widely used for other hydroclimatic variables bornemann et al 2019 however the method provides no indication of when climate change signals emerge from natural variability such information known as the time of emergence toe of climate change signals is highly relevant for decision makers natural and anthropogenic systems adapt to historic climate variability and impacts may occur only when climate change causes local weather conditions to move beyond historic conditions understanding when this may occur in the future can help decision makers prioritise when to implement actions in response to climate change impacts numerous studies have estimated toe for meteorological variables gaetani et al 2020 giorgi and bi 2009 hawkins and sutton 2012 mora et al 2013 nguyen et al 2018 sui et al 2014 as well as for sea level lyu et al 2014 ocean properties henson et al 2017 keller et al 2014 aridification park et al 2018 and fire related weather indices abatzoglou et al 2019 a small number of studies have estimated toe for surface water resources chadwick et al 2021 leng et al 2016 muelchi et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 zhuan et al 2018 to date however no research has assessed toe for groundwater resources in ssa where existing shallow groundwater sources can be vulnerable to relatively small changes in groundwater recharge macdonald et al 2009 understanding toe can support decision makers in assessing the timing and scale of long term impacts of climate change in this paper the objective of this study is to quantify the toe of climate change signals on groundwater levels for the first time we hypothesize that in addition to the variability in the direction of climate change impacts on groundwater levels from gcms different gcms show significant variability in the toe of climate change signals we address this hypothesis by applying transient climate data from the cmip5 ensemble to eight lumped conceptual groundwater models across burkina faso developed by ascott et al 2020b and consider implications for management of groundwater resources in the ssa context 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area used in this research consisted of eight borehole sites across burkina faso west africa fig 1 the boreholes are predominantly located in shallow weathered basement rocks with one site dingasso located on fractured metasediments these sites are part of a wider long term groundwater level monitoring network of 52 boreholes operated by the direction g√©n√©rale des ressources en eau dgre of the government of burkina faso the boreholes used in this research have in the african context long time series of groundwater level observations with records dating back to the 1970s the boreholes have been subject to previous studies exploring precipitation recharge relationships cuthbert et al 2019 filippi et al 1990 reconstructing groundwater levels ascott 2021 ascott et al 2020b martin and thi√©ry 1987 and evaluating multidecadal changes in groundwater resources mouhouyouddine et al 2017 ascott et al 2020b showed that in comparison to other long term monitoring boreholes in burkina faso the eight boreholes in fig 1 are relatively unimpacted by changes in groundwater abstraction and land use with changes in groundwater levels predominantly controlled by changes in climate it should be recognised however that from the outset the hydrogeological conceptualisation of the eight sites is limited there is limited information on the aquifer properties and hydrostratigraphy and the nature of groundwater recharge diffuse vs focussed and discharge lateral groundwater flow any evapotranspiration processes this places constraints on the extent to which differences in future groundwater level changes between sites can be related to real world hydrogeological processes 2 2 groundwater model development and application of cmip5 data in this research we used the lumped conceptual groundwater model aquimod british geological survey 2019 mackay et al 2014b the structure of aquimod is shown in fig 2 aquimod has been specifically designed for modelling groundwater level time series at observation boreholes and was used by ascott et al 2020b in the development of groundwater level reconstructions at the eight sites used in this research fig 1 aquimod consists of three modules containing algorithms for soil drainage unsaturated zone water transfer and saturated groundwater flow the un fao method allen et al 1998 is used to estimate soil drainage this is then routed through the unsaturated zone using a weibull distribution function discharge from the saturated zone is calculated based on darcy s equation and up to three layers can be used to represent changes in hydraulic conductivity with depth time series of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet are required as driving data as well as observed groundwater level time series for calibration for a full description of the model the reader is referred to mackay et al 2014b in this research we used the aquimod models and best parameter sets reported in ascott et al 2020b and applied cmip5 gcm data as driving data we used a single parameter set for each model as this research focusses on exploring uncertainty in toe associated with different gcms rather than uncertainty in model parameterisation the calibrated models of ascott et al 2020b consist of a single layer saturated zone model developed using the aquimod code mackay et al 2014b which was shown to effectively match multidecadal groundwater level observations at the eight boreholes however it has been shown that some climate simulations in cmip5 ensemble in west africa predict much wetter futures black et al 2020 as a result groundwater levels are likely to rise substantially when applying these data to the models developed by ascott et al 2020b these single layer saturated zone models are not bounded by the ground surface and consequently application of climate data which are significantly wetter than the historical data for which the models were developed may result in unrealistic predictions of groundwater levels above the ground surface to address this we modified the models of ascott et al 2020b to incorporate a second layer which represents discharge at the land surface this is shown conceptually in fig 2 the boundary between the upper and lower layer z2 is defined as the ground surface and the upper layer has a very high hydraulic conductivity this acts to immediately discharge water from the model should groundwater levels reach the ground surface initially for all sites the hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer k2 was set to 106 m day this was successful in ensuring groundwater levels do not exceed the ground surface in five out of the eight models for three boreholes this resulted in model instability so we reduced k2 by trial and error until the model produced stable results with groundwater levels not exceeding the ground surface table 1 shows the parameter sets we used for each model based on the calibration undertaken by ascott et al 2020b as well as the values of k2 and z2 used in modifications to aquimod made in this research the addition of the second layer did not change the model predictions of historic observed groundwater levels in comparison to the results of the single layer models reported by ascott et al 2020b see near identical nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values for the different model structures reported in table 1 we used daily cmip5 data which have been interpolated to 0 5 degree resolution and bias corrected using the cumulative distribution function transform method michelangeli et al 2009 these data were reported by famien et al 2018 and also used by gaetani et al 2020 in estimation of toe of precipitation changes in west africa we used the rcp8 5 future simulation as this would produce the greatest climate change signal and a smaller number of cmip5 gcms report the rcp4 5 27 gcms and rcp2 6 scenarios 20 gcms in comparison to rcp 8 5 all 29 gcms this limitation is discussed further in section 4 4 we used daily bias corrected precipitation pr from the cmip5 gcms as direct inputs to aquimod and estimated potential evapotranspiration pet using the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 with input of daily net longwave radiation at the surface and air temperature windspeed and vapour pressure at 2 m height for each site pr and variables used to estimate pet were extracted from the 0 5 degree grid cell in which the site was located six cmcc cesm cmcc cm cmcc cms mpi esm lr mpi esm mr cnrm cm5 out the 29 gcms did not include relative humidity used to calculate vapour pressure above and thus we were unable to calculate pet using the penman monteith method which resulted in 23 gcms in total being used for this research daily net longwave radiation was unavailable so this was calculated using air temperature vapour pressure to calculate emissivity and the fraction of cloud cover calculated using the downwelling shortwave radiation and its clear sky value which depends on the latitude and time of year for each site and cmip5 model we applied a single daily time series for the historical and future rcp8 5 run for 1950 2099 we used the mean value of the groundwater level observations reported by ascott et al 2020b gwl as the initial head h we tested the sensitivity of the model results to the value of h by running the model projections with h as the mean groundwater level standard deviation gwl s d for each site and gcm we then calculated the normalised mean absolute error nmae defined here as the ratio of mean absolute error to the range between the modelled groundwater level time series driven using h gwl and h gwl s d we then averaged this across the 23 gcms to derive an nmae value per site across the eight sites nmae ranged from 0 02 nafona to 0 83 niangoloko indicating that changes in the initial head did not make significant impact on the long term groundwater level projections 2 3 estimation of time of emergence and evaluation of model results time of emergence was estimated using the signal noise approach applied to driving data daily pr and pet and modelled groundwater level data this approach has been applied extensively elsewhere gaetani et al 2020 hawkins and sutton 2012 and the method is as follows 1 fit separate fourth order polynomials to the historical and future time series of the variable of interest 2 the change in the fitted values of the future polynomial is signal 3 the standard deviation of the residuals of the historic polynomial is the noise 4 toe is defined as the point in the future where the signal noise ratio is 1 and remains so for the rest of the time series we first evaluated changes in groundwater levels from 1950 to 2100 for each site and cmip5 model by visual inspection to compare between the sites and between different cmip5 model runs we normalised mean 0 standard deviation 1 each groundwater level time series separately and presented these as a heatmap the ordering of the cmip5 models in the heatmap was defined by the trend of the groundwater level changes from 1950 to 2100 with cmip5 models ordered by those that produced groundwater levels with the greatest increasing wetting to decreasing drying trend we evaluated toe by splitting results by variable

not all borehole cmip5 model combinations produced a toe for all variables e g some borehole cmip5 model combinations produced a toe for pet toepet but not for groundwater levels toegwl or pr toepr which reduced the number of borehole cmip5 model combinations with a complete set of values for the variables in the correlation analysis above we therefore also separately calculated correlations

by aquimod for the eight sites over 1950 2100 for each cmip5 model the cmip5 models in each heatmap are ordered from models which result in increasing trends in groundwater levels wetting to those producing decreasing trends drying at ouagadougou it can be observed that there is no consistent direction of change in groundwater levels in the future with some aquimod models driven by the cmip5 data projecting long term increases in groundwater levels and some projecting decreases there is some consistency across the different sites in terms of application of cmip5 data resulting in higher blue in the top right of the heatmaps and lower red in the bottom right of the heatmaps groundwater levels in the future albeit with some exceptions for example application of bnu esm results in higher groundwater levels in the future in all sites apart from niangoloko the magnitude of the temporal variability in groundwater level response to climate forcing also varies between sites arbinda bassinko niangoloko ouagadougou and tougou show greater variability whilst tibou dingasso and nafona show smaller variability there is a significant positive correlation between dgwl and grt p 0 01

variable toe is split between cmip5 models that show increasing or decreasing trends in the respective variable not all cmip5 models result in a toe between 2005 and 2100 for each site and variable this is consistent with results presented for west africa by gaetani et al 2020 and this results in different numbers of cmip5 models contributing to the boxplots shown in fig 4 this limitation is discussed further in section 4 4 toepr occurs later and with a greater spread for cmip5 models with decreasing future pr median toe 2077 iqr 49 years than for cmip5 models with increasing future pr

differences in the direction and magnitude of changes in groundwater levels for 1950 2100 application of cmip5 data to the aquimod models in this research has resulted in divergent projections of groundwater levels fig 3 to 2100 with some cmip5 models projecting increases and some projecting decreases this is consistent with findings from global reviews of studies assessing impacts of climate change on groundwater which showed little consensus in the direction of change in the amount of groundwater recharge smerdon 2017 regionally this is also consistent with pr projections in west africa reported by gaetani et al 2020 which show no consensus on the direction of change the projections of pr characteristics e g rainfall amount intensity in our study area are highly uncertain previous comparisons against observations do not attempt to identify certain gcms as more or less reliable than others roehrig et al 2013 and all coupled models are subject to similar biases in sea surface temperatures ssts and hence pr seasonal cycle dunning et al 2017 further good skill in the historical period is no guarantee that the future climate is projected accurately the similarities across the sites in which cmip5 models result in decreasing or increasing trends in future groundwater levels is unsurprising when considering the locations of the sites and the grid resolutions of the cmip5 data the sites cover an area of approximately 4 degrees of both longitude and latitude fig 1 table 1 and the bias corrected cmip5 data is at 0 5 degree resolution famien et al 2018 with some of the cmip5 model native grid resolution being up to 2 8 degrees miroc esm and miroc esm chem consequently the sites only cover a small number of grid cells with some sites e g ouagadougou and bassinko within the same grid cell in these cases sites have the same driving pr data and very similar pet data very small differences in pet occur in these cases due to differences in latitude used to estimate clear sky downwelling radiation within the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 whilst the direction of changes in groundwater levels is principally controlled by pr and pet projections derived from the cmip5 gcms differences in the magnitude of long term groundwater level changes between the sites are likely to be due to differences in the calibrated hydraulic property values in the aquimod models developed by ascott et al 2020b and used in this research ascott et al 2020b showed that the eight boreholes could be split into those showing historic multi decadal variability arbinda bassinko niangoloko ouagadougou and tougou and those showing intra annual variability tibou dingasso nafona with the modelled groundwater response time controlling the differences between the groups these groupings are also apparent in the differences in the magnitude of future groundwater level changes between the sites shown in fig 3 and also highlighted by the significant positive correlation between dgwl and grt presented in section 3 1 the sites showing greater long term changes in future groundwater levels are those classified as showing historic multi decadal variability by ascott et al 2020b these sites have longer modelled grt than those sites classified as showing intra annual variability and smaller changes in future groundwater levels longer grts will result in a greater memory effect with modelled groundwater levels being controlled by multiple years of recharge accumulations deficits as discussed in section 2 1 the limited conceptual information available for each of the sites makes it challenging to directly infer the real world hydrogeological causes of the differences in the future magnitude of groundwater level changes between the sites nevertheless table 1 shows that the principal difference between the groupings in terms of the modelled hydraulic properties that make up the modelled grt is differences in the modelled aquifer length with this parameter varying by an order of magnitude between the two groups 4 2 groundwater level time of emergence and relationships with meteorological variables whilst numerous workers have estimated toe for other hydrometeorological variables as discussed in section 1 our study is the first to estimate toe for groundwater levels our estimates of toe for pr and groundwater levels fig 4 agree with regional estimates of toe for pr which showed no robust signal in change of cumulative pr in burkina faso gaetani et al 2020 the correlation analyses presented in section 3 2 suggest that whilst the hydrogeological properties characterised by the grt of each site appear to affect the magnitude of future groundwater level changes as illustrated by the differences in responses between the sites in fig 3 there is no relationship between grt or ai and toegwl toegwl appears to be principally controlled by toepr and toepet fig 5 fig 6 which is an unsurprising result given the divergent predictions of toepr produced by the cmip5 gcms in the region gaetani et al 2020 the relationship between toepr and toegwl differs between cmip5 gcms which show wetting and drying trends fig 6 in cmip5 gcms which show decreases in future pr fig 6 left toegwl occurs earlier than toepr due to increases in pet driven by increases in temperature and early occurrence of toepet fig 4 in cmip5 gcms which show increases in future pr fig 6 right toegwl results are more complex future increases in pr may be offset by increases in pet which may result in toegwl toepr relationships being closer to the 1 1 line however toegwl appears to still occur before toepr which highlights the importance of toepet in controlling toegwl the observed correlations between toepr and toepet and the change in absolute pr and pet fig 7 respectively are also intuitive results larger absolute changes will result in a greater toe signal the changes in the fitted values of the future polynomial see section 2 3 relative to noise and so the point in the future where the signal noise ratio is 1 occurs earlier differences between toe of meteorological and hydrological stream flow reservoir levels variables have been previously reported in studies by zhuan et al 2018 and chadwick et al 2021 and differences in toe for pr pet and groundwater levels reported in our study fig 4 agree with this this supports the assertion of chadwick et al 2021 that toe of specific hydrological variables is of more relevance than meteorological variables for water resource applications interestingly the early toegwl in comparison to toepr discussed above and presented in fig 6 contrasts with the results of zhuan et al 2018 who showed that in their study toe of streamflow occurred after toepr this was due to the gcm data used by zhuan et al 2018 always showing a significant wetting trend and so increases in temperature and pet partially offset and delay impacts on streamflow it should also be noted that there is a wide range of different approaches adopted to toe estimation using different numbers of gcms rcms different approaches to gcm averaging and different approaches to estimation of toe metrics consequently it is challenging to make direct comparisons between results of different studies to that end a set of common methodologies for estimation of toe for hydrometeorological applications would be beneficial 4 3 implications for groundwater management and climate change adaptation this analysis shows no consistent direction of climate change impact on groundwater levels nor when these impacts will occur this highlights the need for improved gcms over west africa in particular to achieve more consistency in the direction of change in the amount of pr the lack of consistency in the toe assessment poses significant challenges in developing specific groundwater management responses and adaptation measures both in nature and timing in this context no regrets approaches are the most appropriate groundwater development although growing across ssa is still relatively small compared with renewable groundwater resources cobbing 2020 macdonald et al 2021 although steps have been taken to address the imbalance the current gap between demand and supply of water in ssa is generally still marked with resulting challenges in meeting un sustainable development goal 6 ensure access to water and sanitation for all chitonge et al 2020 velis et al 2017 this gap is likely to widen with the large projected rise in population for most regions of ssa ezeh et al 2020 with increasing pet increasing demand for food and changes to rainfall patterns there will also be the need for supplementary watering of crops abegunde et al 2019 macdonald et al 2009 the development of groundwater through well sited and constructed boreholes has the potential to meet local water supply needs where groundwater conditions are favourable even where groundwater recharge sees a long term decrease bianchi et al 2020 in conjunction with effective water use and long term monitoring of groundwater storage development of groundwater abstraction is therefore the key no regrets action to support water supply needs which can be taken in spite of the uncertainty in the direction magnitude and timing of climate change impacts on groundwater highlighted by this research 4 4 limitations and further work there are a number of limitations to our research and areas of further work which we detail herein in this research we only used a single cmip5 emissions scenario rcp8 5 under less extreme emissions scenarios rcp2 6 4 5 it would be anticipated that toe may occur later in time or potentially not at all there are a number of different methodologies in the climate science literature to estimate toe and further work to explore the sensitivity of toegwl to different methodologies as has been undertaken for pr by gaetani et al 2020 and different emissions scenarios may be beneficial this would support the development of a common set of methodologies for toe estimation beyond the study area application of the approach used in this research in an area with less divergent gcm predictions may yield more consistent results in this analysis we calculate toe for each site variable and cmip5 gcm separately split up by gcms which show wetting and drying trends in the future this approach is advantageous as it allows comparisons to be made in toe between variables sites and the direction of change and to evaluate variability across the cmip5 gcms this approach is limited however by some cmip5 models not producing a toe for certain variables and sites resulting in different numbers of cmip5 models contributing to the results fig 4 the correlation analysis used to explore relationships between toe of different variables figs 5 7 was unaffected by this as we used a complete set of toe results for the different variables a detailed evaluation of the relationships between toe for the different variables and sites for each individual gcm may be beneficial but is beyond the scope of this research the boreholes used in this research have been shown to be relatively unimpacted by changes in groundwater abstraction and land use with historic changes in groundwater levels predominantly controlled by changes in climate ascott et al 2020b however in the future it is plausible that emergence of climate change impacts on rainfall and pet may cause feedbacks resulting in changes in abstraction and land use which could affect groundwater levels for example in a drying scenario reduced pr and increased pet aridification and less reliable rainfed agriculture may result in an increased reliance on groundwater abstraction causing decreases in groundwater levels and earlier toegwl these feedbacks between climate drivers groundwater levels and anthropogenic influences are complex and highlights the importance of long term monitoring that is unaffected by abstraction and land use change to detect impacts of climate change on groundwater levels ascott et al 2020a cuthbert et al 2019 sorensen et al 2021 it also highlights the need for the land surface schemes that are embedded in these climate models to better reflect the effects of anthropogenic influences on the water cycle e g pokhrel et al 2012 this combined with high resolution convection permitting model runs should result in much more reliable pr predictions see e g kendon et al 2021 we used one groundwater model structure and one parameter set for each borehole in this research this is intentional as 1 this study is explicitly aiming to quantify uncertainty in toe associated with different cmip5 models and 2 there is uncertainty in the conceptual model which cannot justify the use of a more complex approach when considering absolute impacts of climate change on groundwater levels previous researchers have suggested that climate model uncertainty is more significant than groundwater model structure and parameter uncertainty smerdon 2017 further work to evaluate whether this is true in the case of toegwl is required in this research we report the direction of climate change the relative magnitude of change i e magnitude normalised for comparability between sites and cmip5 gcms and toegwl we have not considered the absolute magnitude of changes in groundwater levels when groundwater levels go beyond observed ranges there is low confidence in the magnitude of changes as groundwater levels may be affected by interaction with system boundaries e g the land surface lower permeability bedrock at depth and our conceptual understanding of these boundaries is poor moreover the conceptual model on which aquimod is based may not capture processes occurring in future climatic and land use conditions that affect groundwater recharge and discharge e g the potential for increased recharge with greater surface ponding of water from more intense rainfall events there is a need for field investigations e g long term pumping tests groundwater recharge measurements to better characterise groundwater flow at these sites which would allow testing and refinement of different groundwater model structure and parameter sets and more confidence in the magnitude of groundwater level changes associated with climate change when these are beyond observed ranges 5 conclusions in this study we applied pr and pet inputs to the aquimod model structure for eight boreholes in burkina faso to estimate time of emergence toe of climate change impacts on groundwater levels for the first time we conclude that there is no consistent direction of climate change impacts on groundwater levels with aquimod producing groundwater levels with either increasing and decreasing trends depending on the cmip5 gcm used as driving data there is no consistent toe of climate change signals in groundwater levels toegwl occurs later and with a greater spread when aquimod driven by cmip5 gcms produces decreasing groundwater level trends across all sites median toe 2049 interquartile range 48 years than those producing increasing groundwater level trends across all sites median toe 2011 interquartile range 11 years whilst hydraulic properties affect the magnitude of future groundwater level changes toegw is controlled by toepr and toepet toepr and toepet are correlated with the magnitude of future changes in pr and pet the results highlight the need for reductions in gcm uncertainty and for implementation of no regrets adaptation measures such as the sustainable development of groundwater which will be of benefit in any climate future 6 data statement aquimod is publicly available from the british geological survey 2019 under uk open

3211,the impacts of climate change on groundwater are poorly constrained particularly in regions such as sub saharan africa where global circulation models gcms project different directions of precipitation change moreover the timing of when climate change impacts on groundwater can be differentiated from natural variability has not been quantified here for the first time we estimate the time of emergence toe of climate change impacts on groundwater levels using time series from eight sites across burkina faso west africa we apply output data from historical and rcp8 5 runs of cmip5 gcms to lumped groundwater models for each site and estimate toe by calculating signal to noise ratios for each site and cmip5 model we show that in addition to inconsistent direction of climate change impacts across different gcms there is inconsistency in the toe of climate change signals in future groundwater levels particularly in drying gcms across the eight sites between 5 4 and 13 13 cmip5 gcms of a possible 23 show a toe associated with decreases increases in groundwater levels toe from cmip5 gcms producing decreases in groundwater levels i e drying is highly variable between sites and gcms across all sites median toe 2049 interquartile range 48 years for cmip5 gcms producing increases in groundwater levels i e wetting toe appears to occur earlier and with less variability across all sites median toe 2011 interquartile range 11 years these results underline the need for development of no regrets adaptation measures in parallel with reductions in gcm uncertainty keywords groundwater climate change time of emergence sub saharan africa burkina faso 1 introduction groundwater provides approximately 50 of the worlds drinking water supplies smith et al 2016 as well as supporting livelihoods through productive uses and sustaining baseflow to surface waters although the potential for further development of groundwater in sub saharan africa ssa is recognised groundwater is already a crucial source of supply for many including dispersed rural populations and those in urban areas without access to piped supplies cobbing 2020 macdonald et al 2012 anthropogenic climate change is now unequivocal ipcc 2014 and a large number of studies have quantified the impacts of climate change on groundwater resources see a synopsis of reviews by smerdon 2017 and a more recent review by amanambu et al 2020 including a number of studies in ssa e g badou et al 2018 cuthbert et al 2019 kingston and taylor 2010 mileham et al 2009 it has generally been concluded that the choice of global circulation model gcms accounts for the greatest uncertainty in climate change impacts on groundwater smerdon 2017 gcms have been shown to disagree on the direction of climate change impacts on precipitation and hence groundwater recharge and levels when assessing impacts of climate change on groundwater a conventional approach often used ascott et al 2019 dams et al 2012 guardiola albert and jackson 2011 jackson et al 2011 moeck et al 2016 is to evaluate changes in groundwater recharge and levels in future time periods e g the 2050s 2080s in comparison to a baseline period e g 1950 2000 this approach is useful to understand the magnitude of potential changes in groundwater resources in future decades and has been widely used for other hydroclimatic variables bornemann et al 2019 however the method provides no indication of when climate change signals emerge from natural variability such information known as the time of emergence toe of climate change signals is highly relevant for decision makers natural and anthropogenic systems adapt to historic climate variability and impacts may occur only when climate change causes local weather conditions to move beyond historic conditions understanding when this may occur in the future can help decision makers prioritise when to implement actions in response to climate change impacts numerous studies have estimated toe for meteorological variables gaetani et al 2020 giorgi and bi 2009 hawkins and sutton 2012 mora et al 2013 nguyen et al 2018 sui et al 2014 as well as for sea level lyu et al 2014 ocean properties henson et al 2017 keller et al 2014 aridification park et al 2018 and fire related weather indices abatzoglou et al 2019 a small number of studies have estimated toe for surface water resources chadwick et al 2021 leng et al 2016 muelchi et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 zhuan et al 2018 to date however no research has assessed toe for groundwater resources in ssa where existing shallow groundwater sources can be vulnerable to relatively small changes in groundwater recharge macdonald et al 2009 understanding toe can support decision makers in assessing the timing and scale of long term impacts of climate change in this paper the objective of this study is to quantify the toe of climate change signals on groundwater levels for the first time we hypothesize that in addition to the variability in the direction of climate change impacts on groundwater levels from gcms different gcms show significant variability in the toe of climate change signals we address this hypothesis by applying transient climate data from the cmip5 ensemble to eight lumped conceptual groundwater models across burkina faso developed by ascott et al 2020b and consider implications for management of groundwater resources in the ssa context 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area used in this research consisted of eight borehole sites across burkina faso west africa fig 1 the boreholes are predominantly located in shallow weathered basement rocks with one site dingasso located on fractured metasediments these sites are part of a wider long term groundwater level monitoring network of 52 boreholes operated by the direction g√©n√©rale des ressources en eau dgre of the government of burkina faso the boreholes used in this research have in the african context long time series of groundwater level observations with records dating back to the 1970s the boreholes have been subject to previous studies exploring precipitation recharge relationships cuthbert et al 2019 filippi et al 1990 reconstructing groundwater levels ascott 2021 ascott et al 2020b martin and thi√©ry 1987 and evaluating multidecadal changes in groundwater resources mouhouyouddine et al 2017 ascott et al 2020b showed that in comparison to other long term monitoring boreholes in burkina faso the eight boreholes in fig 1 are relatively unimpacted by changes in groundwater abstraction and land use with changes in groundwater levels predominantly controlled by changes in climate it should be recognised however that from the outset the hydrogeological conceptualisation of the eight sites is limited there is limited information on the aquifer properties and hydrostratigraphy and the nature of groundwater recharge diffuse vs focussed and discharge lateral groundwater flow any evapotranspiration processes this places constraints on the extent to which differences in future groundwater level changes between sites can be related to real world hydrogeological processes 2 2 groundwater model development and application of cmip5 data in this research we used the lumped conceptual groundwater model aquimod british geological survey 2019 mackay et al 2014b the structure of aquimod is shown in fig 2 aquimod has been specifically designed for modelling groundwater level time series at observation boreholes and was used by ascott et al 2020b in the development of groundwater level reconstructions at the eight sites used in this research fig 1 aquimod consists of three modules containing algorithms for soil drainage unsaturated zone water transfer and saturated groundwater flow the un fao method allen et al 1998 is used to estimate soil drainage this is then routed through the unsaturated zone using a weibull distribution function discharge from the saturated zone is calculated based on darcy s equation and up to three layers can be used to represent changes in hydraulic conductivity with depth time series of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet are required as driving data as well as observed groundwater level time series for calibration for a full description of the model the reader is referred to mackay et al 2014b in this research we used the aquimod models and best parameter sets reported in ascott et al 2020b and applied cmip5 gcm data as driving data we used a single parameter set for each model as this research focusses on exploring uncertainty in toe associated with different gcms rather than uncertainty in model parameterisation the calibrated models of ascott et al 2020b consist of a single layer saturated zone model developed using the aquimod code mackay et al 2014b which was shown to effectively match multidecadal groundwater level observations at the eight boreholes however it has been shown that some climate simulations in cmip5 ensemble in west africa predict much wetter futures black et al 2020 as a result groundwater levels are likely to rise substantially when applying these data to the models developed by ascott et al 2020b these single layer saturated zone models are not bounded by the ground surface and consequently application of climate data which are significantly wetter than the historical data for which the models were developed may result in unrealistic predictions of groundwater levels above the ground surface to address this we modified the models of ascott et al 2020b to incorporate a second layer which represents discharge at the land surface this is shown conceptually in fig 2 the boundary between the upper and lower layer z2 is defined as the ground surface and the upper layer has a very high hydraulic conductivity this acts to immediately discharge water from the model should groundwater levels reach the ground surface initially for all sites the hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer k2 was set to 106 m day this was successful in ensuring groundwater levels do not exceed the ground surface in five out of the eight models for three boreholes this resulted in model instability so we reduced k2 by trial and error until the model produced stable results with groundwater levels not exceeding the ground surface table 1 shows the parameter sets we used for each model based on the calibration undertaken by ascott et al 2020b as well as the values of k2 and z2 used in modifications to aquimod made in this research the addition of the second layer did not change the model predictions of historic observed groundwater levels in comparison to the results of the single layer models reported by ascott et al 2020b see near identical nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values for the different model structures reported in table 1 we used daily cmip5 data which have been interpolated to 0 5 degree resolution and bias corrected using the cumulative distribution function transform method michelangeli et al 2009 these data were reported by famien et al 2018 and also used by gaetani et al 2020 in estimation of toe of precipitation changes in west africa we used the rcp8 5 future simulation as this would produce the greatest climate change signal and a smaller number of cmip5 gcms report the rcp4 5 27 gcms and rcp2 6 scenarios 20 gcms in comparison to rcp 8 5 all 29 gcms this limitation is discussed further in section 4 4 we used daily bias corrected precipitation pr from the cmip5 gcms as direct inputs to aquimod and estimated potential evapotranspiration pet using the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 with input of daily net longwave radiation at the surface and air temperature windspeed and vapour pressure at 2 m height for each site pr and variables used to estimate pet were extracted from the 0 5 degree grid cell in which the site was located six cmcc cesm cmcc cm cmcc cms mpi esm lr mpi esm mr cnrm cm5 out the 29 gcms did not include relative humidity used to calculate vapour pressure above and thus we were unable to calculate pet using the penman monteith method which resulted in 23 gcms in total being used for this research daily net longwave radiation was unavailable so this was calculated using air temperature vapour pressure to calculate emissivity and the fraction of cloud cover calculated using the downwelling shortwave radiation and its clear sky value which depends on the latitude and time of year for each site and cmip5 model we applied a single daily time series for the historical and future rcp8 5 run for 1950 2099 we used the mean value of the groundwater level observations reported by ascott et al 2020b gwl as the initial head h we tested the sensitivity of the model results to the value of h by running the model projections with h as the mean groundwater level standard deviation gwl s d for each site and gcm we then calculated the normalised mean absolute error nmae defined here as the ratio of mean absolute error to the range between the modelled groundwater level time series driven using h gwl and h gwl s d we then averaged this across the 23 gcms to derive an nmae value per site across the eight sites nmae ranged from 0 02 nafona to 0 83 niangoloko indicating that changes in the initial head did not make significant impact on the long term groundwater level projections 2 3 estimation of time of emergence and evaluation of model results time of emergence was estimated using the signal noise approach applied to driving data daily pr and pet and modelled groundwater level data this approach has been applied extensively elsewhere gaetani et al 2020 hawkins and sutton 2012 and the method is as follows 1 fit separate fourth order polynomials to the historical and future time series of the variable of interest 2 the change in the fitted values of the future polynomial is signal 3 the standard deviation of the residuals of the historic polynomial is the noise 4 toe is defined as the point in the future where the signal noise ratio is 1 and remains so for the rest of the time series we first evaluated changes in groundwater levels from 1950 to 2100 for each site and cmip5 model by visual inspection to compare between the sites and between different cmip5 model runs we normalised mean 0 standard deviation 1 each groundwater level time series separately and presented these as a heatmap the ordering of the cmip5 models in the heatmap was defined by the trend of the groundwater level changes from 1950 to 2100 with cmip5 models ordered by those that produced groundwater levels with the greatest increasing wetting to decreasing drying trend we evaluated toe by splitting results by variable

which reduced the number of borehole cmip5 model combinations with a complete set of values for the variables in the correlation analysis above we therefore also separately calculated correlations

by aquimod for the eight sites over 1950 2100 for each cmip5 model the cmip5 models in each heatmap are ordered from models which result in increasing trends in groundwater levels wetting to those producing decreasing trends drying at ouagadougou it can be observed that there is no consistent direction of change in groundwater levels in the future with some aquimod models driven by the cmip5 data projecting long term increases in groundwater levels and some projecting decreases there is some consistency across the different sites in terms of application of cmip5 data resulting in higher blue in the top right of the heatmaps and lower red in the bottom right of the heatmaps groundwater levels in the future albeit with some exceptions for example application of bnu esm results in higher groundwater levels in the future in all sites apart from niangoloko the magnitude of the temporal variability in groundwater level response to climate forcing also varies between sites arbinda bassinko niangoloko ouagadougou and tougou show greater variability whilst tibou dingasso and nafona show smaller variability there is a significant positive correlation between dgwl and grt p 0 01

variable toe is split between cmip5 models that show increasing or decreasing trends in the respective variable not all cmip5 models result in a toe between 2005 and 2100 for each site and variable this is consistent with results presented for west africa by gaetani et al 2020 and this results in different numbers of cmip5 models contributing to the boxplots shown in fig 4 this limitation is discussed further in section 4 4 toepr occurs later and with a greater spread for cmip5 models with decreasing future pr median toe 2077 iqr 49 years than for cmip5 models with increasing future pr

differences in the direction and magnitude of changes in groundwater levels for 1950 2100 application of cmip5 data to the aquimod models in this research has resulted in divergent projections of groundwater levels fig 3 to 2100 with some cmip5 models projecting increases and some projecting decreases this is consistent with findings from global reviews of studies assessing impacts of climate change on groundwater which showed little consensus in the direction of change in the amount of groundwater recharge smerdon 2017 regionally this is also consistent with pr projections in west africa reported by gaetani et al 2020 which show no consensus on the direction of change the projections of pr characteristics e g rainfall amount intensity in our study area are highly uncertain previous comparisons against observations do not attempt to identify certain gcms as more or less reliable than others roehrig et al 2013 and all coupled models are subject to similar biases in sea surface temperatures ssts and hence pr seasonal cycle dunning et al 2017 further good skill in the historical period is no guarantee that the future climate is projected accurately the similarities across the sites in which cmip5 models result in decreasing or increasing trends in future groundwater levels is unsurprising when considering the locations of the sites and the grid resolutions of the cmip5 data the sites cover an area of approximately 4 degrees of both longitude and latitude fig 1 table 1 and the bias corrected cmip5 data is at 0 5 degree resolution famien et al 2018 with some of the cmip5 model native grid resolution being up to 2 8 degrees miroc esm and miroc esm chem consequently the sites only cover a small number of grid cells with some sites e g ouagadougou and bassinko within the same grid cell in these cases sites have the same driving pr data and very similar pet data very small differences in pet occur in these cases due to differences in latitude used to estimate clear sky downwelling radiation within the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 whilst the direction of changes in groundwater levels is principally controlled by pr and pet projections derived from the cmip5 gcms differences in the magnitude of long term groundwater level changes between the sites are likely to be due to differences in the calibrated hydraulic property values in the aquimod models developed by ascott et al 2020b and used in this research ascott et al 2020b showed that the eight boreholes could be split into those showing historic multi decadal variability arbinda bassinko niangoloko ouagadougou and tougou and those showing intra annual variability tibou dingasso nafona with the modelled groundwater response time controlling the differences between the groups these groupings are also apparent in the differences in the magnitude of future groundwater level changes between the sites shown in fig 3 and also highlighted by the significant positive correlation between dgwl and grt presented in section 3 1 the sites showing greater long term changes in future groundwater levels are those classified as showing historic multi decadal variability by ascott et al 2020b these sites have longer modelled grt than those sites classified as showing intra annual variability and smaller changes in future groundwater levels longer grts will result in a greater memory effect with modelled groundwater levels being controlled by multiple years of recharge accumulations deficits as discussed in section 2 1 the limited conceptual information available for each of the sites makes it challenging to directly infer the real world hydrogeological causes of the differences in the future magnitude of groundwater level changes between the sites nevertheless table 1 shows that the principal difference between the groupings in terms of the modelled hydraulic properties that make up the modelled grt is differences in the modelled aquifer length with this parameter varying by an order of magnitude between the two groups 4 2 groundwater level time of emergence and relationships with meteorological variables whilst numerous workers have estimated toe for other hydrometeorological variables as discussed in section 1 our study is the first to estimate toe for groundwater levels our estimates of toe for pr and groundwater levels fig 4 agree with regional estimates of toe for pr which showed no robust signal in change of cumulative pr in burkina faso gaetani et al 2020 the correlation analyses presented in section 3 2 suggest that whilst the hydrogeological properties characterised by the grt of each site appear to affect the magnitude of future groundwater level changes as illustrated by the differences in responses between the sites in fig 3 there is no relationship between grt or ai and toegwl toegwl appears to be principally controlled by toepr and toepet fig 5 fig 6 which is an unsurprising result given the divergent predictions of toepr produced by the cmip5 gcms in the region gaetani et al 2020 the relationship between toepr and toegwl differs between cmip5 gcms which show wetting and drying trends fig 6 in cmip5 gcms which show decreases in future pr fig 6 left toegwl occurs earlier than toepr due to increases in pet driven by increases in temperature and early occurrence of toepet fig 4 in cmip5 gcms which show increases in future pr fig 6 right toegwl results are more complex future increases in pr may be offset by increases in pet which may result in toegwl toepr relationships being closer to the 1 1 line however toegwl appears to still occur before toepr which highlights the importance of toepet in controlling toegwl the observed correlations between toepr and toepet and the change in absolute pr and pet fig 7 respectively are also intuitive results larger absolute changes will result in a greater toe signal the changes in the fitted values of the future polynomial see section 2 3 relative to noise and so the point in the future where the signal noise ratio is 1 occurs earlier differences between toe of meteorological and hydrological stream flow reservoir levels variables have been previously reported in studies by zhuan et al 2018 and chadwick et al 2021 and differences in toe for pr pet and groundwater levels reported in our study fig 4 agree with this this supports the assertion of chadwick et al 2021 that toe of specific hydrological variables is of more relevance than meteorological variables for water resource applications interestingly the early toegwl in comparison to toepr discussed above and presented in fig 6 contrasts with the results of zhuan et al 2018 who showed that in their study toe of streamflow occurred after toepr this was due to the gcm data used by zhuan et al 2018 always showing a significant wetting trend and so increases in temperature and pet partially offset and delay impacts on streamflow it should also be noted that there is a wide range of different approaches adopted to toe estimation using different numbers of gcms rcms different approaches to gcm averaging and different approaches to estimation of toe metrics consequently it is challenging to make direct comparisons between results of different studies to that end a set of common methodologies for estimation of toe for hydrometeorological applications would be beneficial 4 3 implications for groundwater management and climate change adaptation this analysis shows no consistent direction of climate change impact on groundwater levels nor when these impacts will occur this highlights the need for improved gcms over west africa in particular to achieve more consistency in the direction of change in the amount of pr the lack of consistency in the toe assessment poses significant challenges in developing specific groundwater management responses and adaptation measures both in nature and timing in this context no regrets approaches are the most appropriate groundwater development although growing across ssa is still relatively small compared with renewable groundwater resources cobbing 2020 macdonald et al 2021 although steps have been taken to address the imbalance the current gap between demand and supply of water in ssa is generally still marked with resulting challenges in meeting un sustainable development goal 6 ensure access to water and sanitation for all chitonge et al 2020 velis et al 2017 this gap is likely to widen with the large projected rise in population for most regions of ssa ezeh et al 2020 with increasing pet increasing demand for food and changes to rainfall patterns there will also be the need for supplementary watering of crops abegunde et al 2019 macdonald et al 2009 the development of groundwater through well sited and constructed boreholes has the potential to meet local water supply needs where groundwater conditions are favourable even where groundwater recharge sees a long term decrease bianchi et al 2020 in conjunction with effective water use and long term monitoring of groundwater storage development of groundwater abstraction is therefore the key no regrets action to support water supply needs which can be taken in spite of the uncertainty in the direction magnitude and timing of climate change impacts on groundwater highlighted by this research 4 4 limitations and further work there are a number of limitations to our research and areas of further work which we detail herein in this research we only used a single cmip5 emissions scenario rcp8 5 under less extreme emissions scenarios rcp2 6 4 5 it would be anticipated that toe may occur later in time or potentially not at all there are a number of different methodologies in the climate science literature to estimate toe and further work to explore the sensitivity of toegwl to different methodologies as has been undertaken for pr by gaetani et al 2020 and different emissions scenarios may be beneficial this would support the development of a common set of methodologies for toe estimation beyond the study area application of the approach used in this research in an area with less divergent gcm predictions may yield more consistent results in this analysis we calculate toe for each site variable and cmip5 gcm separately split up by gcms which show wetting and drying trends in the future this approach is advantageous as it allows comparisons to be made in toe between variables sites and the direction of change and to evaluate variability across the cmip5 gcms this approach is limited however by some cmip5 models not producing a toe for certain variables and sites resulting in different numbers of cmip5 models contributing to the results fig 4 the correlation analysis used to explore relationships between toe of different variables figs 5 7 was unaffected by this as we used a complete set of toe results for the different variables a detailed evaluation of the relationships between toe for the different variables and sites for each individual gcm may be beneficial but is beyond the scope of this research the boreholes used in this research have been shown to be relatively unimpacted by changes in groundwater abstraction and land use with historic changes in groundwater levels predominantly controlled by changes in climate ascott et al 2020b however in the future it is plausible that emergence of climate change impacts on rainfall and pet may cause feedbacks resulting in changes in abstraction and land use which could affect groundwater levels for example in a drying scenario reduced pr and increased pet aridification and less reliable rainfed agriculture may result in an increased reliance on groundwater abstraction causing decreases in groundwater levels and earlier toegwl these feedbacks between climate drivers groundwater levels and anthropogenic influences are complex and highlights the importance of long term monitoring that is unaffected by abstraction and land use change to detect impacts of climate change on groundwater levels ascott et al 2020a cuthbert et al 2019 sorensen et al 2021 it also highlights the need for the land surface schemes that are embedded in these climate models to better reflect the effects of anthropogenic influences on the water cycle e g pokhrel et al 2012 this combined with high resolution convection permitting model runs should result in much more reliable pr predictions see e g kendon et al 2021 we used one groundwater model structure and one parameter set for each borehole in this research this is intentional as 1 this study is explicitly aiming to quantify uncertainty in toe associated with different cmip5 models and 2 there is uncertainty in the conceptual model which cannot justify the use of a more complex approach when considering absolute impacts of climate change on groundwater levels previous researchers have suggested that climate model uncertainty is more significant than groundwater model structure and parameter uncertainty smerdon 2017 further work to evaluate whether this is true in the case of toegwl is required in this research we report the direction of climate change the relative magnitude of change i e magnitude normalised for comparability between sites and cmip5 gcms and toegwl we have not considered the absolute magnitude of changes in groundwater levels when groundwater levels go beyond observed ranges there is low confidence in the magnitude of changes as groundwater levels may be affected by interaction with system boundaries e g the land surface lower permeability bedrock at depth and our conceptual understanding of these boundaries is poor moreover the conceptual model on which aquimod is based may not capture processes occurring in future climatic and land use conditions that affect groundwater recharge and discharge e g the potential for increased recharge with greater surface ponding of water from more intense rainfall events there is a need for field investigations e g long term pumping tests groundwater recharge measurements to better characterise groundwater flow at these sites which would allow testing and refinement of different groundwater model structure and parameter sets and more confidence in the magnitude of groundwater level changes associated with climate change when these are beyond observed ranges 5 conclusions in this study we applied pr and pet inputs to the aquimod model structure for eight boreholes in burkina faso to estimate time of emergence toe of climate change impacts on groundwater levels for the first time we conclude that there is no consistent direction of climate change impacts on groundwater levels with aquimod producing groundwater levels with either increasing and decreasing trends depending on the cmip5 gcm used as driving data there is no consistent toe of climate change signals in groundwater levels toegwl occurs later and with a greater spread when aquimod driven by cmip5 gcms produces decreasing groundwater level trends across all sites median toe 2049 interquartile range 48 years than those producing increasing groundwater level trends across all sites median toe 2011 interquartile range 11 years whilst hydraulic properties affect the magnitude of future groundwater level changes toegw is controlled by toepr and toepet toepr and toepet are correlated with the magnitude of future changes in pr and pet the results highlight the need for reductions in gcm uncertainty and for implementation of no regrets adaptation measures such as the sustainable development of groundwater which will be of benefit in any climate future 6 data statement aquimod is publicly available from the british geological survey 2019 under uk open

3212,machine learning especially deep learning methods have been widely used for runoff prediction in recent years models based on the sequence to sequence seq2seq framework were recently introduced into the field of rainfall runoff modeling in this paper we demonstrate a new design of a seq2seq model which shows higher prediction accuracy than previous seq2seq models our new design takes advantage of the high linear correlation between historical runoff and future runoff and processes the runoff input through a linear layer our new seq2seq model named seq2seq lrp linear runoff processing is combined with the attention mechanism seq2seq lrp a and compared with three seq2seq benchmark models seq2seq 1 seq2seq 2 and seq2seq 3 the five models seq2seq lrp seq2seq lrp a seq2seq 1 seq2seq 2 seq2seq 3 were used to simulate runoff in the yutan sub catchment fujian province southeast china using hourly runoff and rainfall measurements from 2000 to 2014 the results show that the novel seq2seq lrp and seq2seq lrp a models are better suited in hourly flood prediction than the seq2seq benchmark models and the seq2seq lrp a model performs best among the five models keywords gru sequence to sequence linear runoff processing attention mechanism flood prediction 1 introduction machine learning especially deep learning is now widely used for runoff prediction chen et al 2021 ding et al 2020 sit et al 2020 among the various deep learning approaches the long short time memory network lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 an improved version of recurrent neural networks rnn is becoming more and more popular in runoff prediction kratzert et al 2018 applied the lstm model to rainfall runoff modeling for the first time with promising results our previous paper gao et al 2020 showed that the gated recurrent unit gru network a variant of lstm performs equally well and requires a simpler structure and fewer parameters subsequently rnn lstm gru models have been widely used in the field of runoff prediction with promising performances lees et al 2021 li et al 2021 jiang et al 2022 rahimzad et al 2021 xiang and demir 2020 an rnn model takes a sequence of data as input the size of which can be defined by the user but the size of the output data is not as flexible as that of the input data in general rnn models output only one value or a sequence of data that is of the same length as the input to address the inflexibility of the output size in rnn a sequence to sequence seq2seq or encoder decoder model was proposed cho et al 2014 sutskever et al 2014 a key feature of the seq2seq model compared with rnn models is that the lengths of the input and output sequence can be different this feature of the seq2seq model is highly useful in many fields kao et al 2020 first applied the seq2seq framework to multi step ahead flood forecasting they proposed a seq2seq model that can be used for multi step flood prediction for up to 6 h xiang et al 2020 proposed a model based on the seq2seq framework that can encode multiple input sequences including runoff rainfall and evapotranspiration to predict runoff at the hourly time scale yin et al 2021a proposed a multi state vector seq2seq model which has better performance than the seq2seq model using only one state vector for multi day ahead runoff predictions yin et al 2021b also applied seq2seq models to predict runoff in ungauged basins with promising results a major group of deep learning models in hourly runoff prediction uses historical rainfall and runoff as input since these data are most commonly available most of the models so far do not treat historical rainfall and runoff differently in model training and prediction in spite of their fundamental differences in their physical meanings hu et al 2018 kao et al 2020 the mechanisms through which historical runoff and rainfall determine future runoff are completely different rainfall is the main driving force of runoff and the relationship between rainfall and runoff is affected by multiple hydrological processes and parameters the relationship between historical runoff and future runoff is relatively simple there is no causality but a high linear correlation between historical and future runoff suggested by the large correlation coefficients between runoff at time t and at time t i i from 1 to 9 at the yutan gauge station studied in this paper table 1 considering the differences in the two types of input xiang et al 2020 first proposed to input historical rainfall and runoff into two encoders lstm networks in this study we propose a novel seq2seq architecture that processes historical runoff data with a linear layer in the decoder and show that the new architecture is better suited for hourly flood prediction in addition the attention mechanism which is often used together with seq2seq models is employed in this study the attention mechanism was proposed to address problems in processing long sequence information by seq2seq models bahdanau et al 2014 the attention mechanism may improve the accuracy of the seq2seq model in runoff prediction with a long forecast time the seq2seq models combined with attention mechanism have been applied successfully in many fields bahdanau et al 2014 luong et al 2015 vaswani et al 2017 including runoff prediction yin et al 2021b we expect that the novel seq2seq architecture we propose will have even higher accuracy in hourly runoff prediction if coupled with the attention mechanism in summary we develop a new seq2seq model named seq2seq lrp linear runoff processing and combine it with the attention mechanism seq2seq lrp a for hourly flood prediction we evaluate whether the seq2seq models with the new design produce better results than other seq2seq models in flood prediction and if so under what conditions the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the seq2seq lrp seq2seq lrp a models and three other seq2seq models used as benchmarks are introduced and the model evaluation metrics are presented in section 3 5 we present modeling results using a case study in the yutan sub catchment in fujian province china finally section 6 concludes the paper 2 methods in this section we present the architecture of the seq2seq lrp and seq2seq lrp a models proposed for the first time in this study and the three seq2seq models used as benchmarks 2 1 the seq2seq lrp model the architecture of the seq2seq lrp model is shown in fig 1 the historical rainfall data r 1 r 2 r m are processed by the rnn cells in the encoder rain module and the extracted hidden state hr goes into the decoder module the decoder in the seq2seq lrp model predicts y m 1 y m 2 y m n sequentially with y t 1 used as input for prediction of y t since the correlation coefficient between predicted runoff and historical runoff is very high we use the last linear layer of the seq2seq lrp model to extract information from the historical runoff sequence d 1 d 2 d m the main feature of this seq2seq model is that historical runoff is processed through a linear layer directly instead of going through the rnn as the rainfall data lstm or gru are commonly used for the rnn cell in seq2seq models gru has been shown to perform equally well as lstm in runoff prediction and has fewer parameters compared to lstm gao et al 2020 therefore we use gru for the rnn cell in this paper 2 2 the seq2seq lrp a model attention mechanism models are widely used in natural language processing and computer vision vaswani et al 2017 xu et al 2015 the seq2seq lrp a model used in this paper is obtained by coupling the seq2seq lrp model with the attention mechanism adapted from the seq2seq attention model proposed by luong et al 2015 in the field of natural language processing as shown in fig 2 the seq2seq lrp a model has the same encoder decoder structure the result y t 1 at time t 1 and the vector h 1 e h 2 e h m e generated by the encoder are taken as input to obtain the output result y t at time t through the following steps 1 the gru unit accepts y t 1 as input and outputs the decoded vector h t d 2 the attention weight coefficient sequence Œ± t 1 Œ± t 2 Œ± t m is calculated using h t d and the vector sequence h 1 e h 2 e h m e with the formula 1 Œ± t 1 Œ± t 2 Œ± t m h t d t w t a h 1 e h 2 e h m e where w t a is the weight matrix 3 the attention weight coefficient sequence Œ± t 1 Œ± t 2 Œ± t m is normalized by a softmax function to obtain the sequence Œ± t 1 Œ± t 2 Œ± t m 2 Œ± t i exp Œ± t i j 1 m exp Œ± t j 4 the attention encoding vector c t is calculated following 3 c t j 1 m Œ± t j h j e 5 c t h t d and d 1 d 2 d m are concatenated and then passed through a linear layer leading to the final result y t the above steps are repeated n times to get the final output sequence y m 1 y t 1 y t y m n through such calculation each yt extracts effective information not only from h t d from the decoder but also from each of the encoder vectors h 1 e h 2 e h m e this method retains the capability of the seq2seq lrp model to extract sequential information and is not affected by input with long time steps it should be noted that in the seq2seq lrp and seq2seq lrp a models the linear layer and the attention weight matrix w t a in seq2seq lrp a are updated for each lead time because the historical rainfall and runoff data may have different impacts on the prediction results of different lead times 2 3 the three seq2seq models used as benchmarks in this study three seq2seq models are used as benchmark models which are denoted as seq2seq 1 seq2seq 2 and seq2seq 3 respectively as shown in figs 3 5 the seq2seq 1 model is similar to the seq2seq model adopted by kao et al 2020 in the seq2seq 1 model the historical rainfall and runoff are fed to the same encoder and the resulting hidden state h is processed by the decoder for subsequent calculations the seq2seq 2 model is inspired by the seq2seq model adopted by xiang et al 2020 in the seq2seq 2 model the historical rainfall and runoff are processed by two encoders of rnn cells named encoders rain and encoders dis the two encoders generate hidden states h r and h d the sum of which is provided to the decoder for subsequent calculations the seq2seq 3 model is a modification of seq2seq 2 which uses the encoder dis module to extract the information from historical runoff and outputs h d and then h d is fed into the last linear layer of the model for processing all of the three benchmark models use rnn to process historical runoff data 2 4 performance metrics the performance of all the developed models is evaluated with the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse the root mean square error rmse the coefficient of determination r2 top peak flow error tpe and the kling gupta efficiency kge calculated as follows 4 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 5 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n 6 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i

the number of the top 2 peak flow values Œ≤ Œº p Œº o is the mean bias Œ± œÉ p œÉ o is the variability bias and Œº and œÉ stand for the mean and standard deviation r is the linear correlation coefficient 9 r i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 among these metrics nse is one of the most widely used for the assessment of rainfall runoff simulation kumar et al 2016 with its value ranging from negative infinity to 1 values of nse smaller than zero mean that the simulated result is worse than just using the mean observed value for prediction an nse value close to 1 means that the predictions are accurate the rmse value represents the error between the forecasted and the observed values and its unit is the same as the output value of the model a model with its rmse value close to 0 suggests that it can produce accurate forecasts the value of rmse ranges from 0 perfect fit to infinity no fit the r2 value is commonly used to evaluate the linear correlation between model outputs and target outputs with its value ranging from 0 no fit to 1 perfect fit tpe is used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the peak flow the top 2 runoff in this study the tpe value ranges from 0 to infinity and smaller tpe values indicate a better model prediction of peak flow yin et al 2021a kge combines correlation bias and variability into one objective metric and its ideal value is

shaxi river basin in fujian province china there are four rain gauge stations including the shuixi yutan hucun and quanshang stations within the yutan sub catchment the yutan gauge station is located at the outlet of the yutan sub catchment with runoff measurements this study collects hourly flow runoff data from the yutan gauge station and hourly precipitation data from the four gauge stations from 2000 to 2014 after data preprocessing 55 rainfall and runoff events including 8022 hourly rainfall and runoff records are used in this study details of the study area and the data preprocessing steps are presented in our previous publication gao et al 2020 of the 55 rainfall runoff events the first 33 are used for training the middle 11 for verification and the last 11 for testing information about the training validation and testing datasets is compiled in table 2 the mean rainfall of the four gauge stations and runoff data of the yutan station are shown in fig 6 3 2 settings of the input sequence and output sequence two parameters are important in generating training datasets in runoff prediction one is the lead time and the other is the time step gao et al 2020 the prediction accuracy increases with increasing time step so that a relatively large value for the time step is preferred for the yutan sub catchment the prediction accuracy does not increase anymore when the time step is greater than 7 h gao et al 2020 we use a time step of 15 h and a max lead time of 9 h i e we predict runoff from time t 1 to time t 9 by using rainfall and runoff from time t 14 to time t 3 3 hyperparameters of models and other settings for the hyperparameters 16 neurons in the hidden layer are used for all models adam is used as the optimizer and the initial learning rate is set to 0 001 the batch size is set to 64 and the mse function is used as the loss function consistent with that in gao et al 2020 the early stopping technology is used to dynamically control the size of the epoch to prevent over fitting during training the maximum training epoch is set to 1000 and the early patience is set to 70 the parameters related to the early stopping are explained in fischer and krauss 2018 the models are developed in python 3 8 using the pytorch framework the computer specifications are nvidia geforce rtx 3050ti gpu and intel r7 5800 cpu with 16 gb memory the numbers of parameters of the five models are shown in table 3 the computation time of the five models are around 10 20 min and varies due to the early stopping adopted in our models all simulations involved in this paper are repeated 10 times and the mean values of each evaluation index are calculated 4 result the performances of the seq2seq lrp a seq2seq lrp models and the three benchmark models are shown in fig 7 the values of nse rmse r2 tpe and kge all show that our proposed seq2seq lrp model performs significantly better than the other three seq2seq models seq2seq 1 seq2seq 2 and seq2seq 3 in predicting hourly runoff with a short lead time the differences become smaller as the lead time increases this indicates that the design where the historical runoff data are processed directly through the linear layer can significantly improve the accuracy of short lead time flood prediction the three benchmark models all process historical runoff data using rnn cells which produce less ideal results therefore it appears that the simple linear layer is better suited for processing historical runoff data when predicting future runoff than the more complicated rnn cells observed and modeled time sequence of runoff by the five models in the first and fifth rainfall runoff event in the testing step are shown in figs 8 and 9 with 1 h 2 h and 3 h lead times it can be visually confirmed that the predicted runoff by the seq2seq lrp a and seq2seq lrp models are more consistent with the observed values than the other three seq2seq models the values of nse rmse r2 tpe and kge also show that the seq2seq lrp a model performs better than the seq2seq lrp model in predicting hourly flood with almost all lead times although the differences are small the results of 10 simulations using the two models with lead times of 7 8 and 9 h are shown in fig 10 it is suggested that the addition of the attention mechanism further improves our proposed seq2seq lrp model it is worth mentioning that the seq2seq lrp a model has more parameters than the seq2seq lrp model table 3 so the comparison is not strictly fair however we tested seq2seq lrp models with more parameters by increasing the number of neurons and layers and the seq2seq lrp a still performs better with even less parameters we visualized the parameters related to the predicted runoff and historical runoff in the linear layer of the seq2seq lrp model in fig 11 it can be seen that when predicting runoff at all lead times t 1 to t 9 the seq2seq lrp model mainly relies on historical runoff at time t and t 1 this shows that the historical runoff at time t and t 1 contributes most to the predicted runoff at all lead times compared to those at other time steps this is consistent with our observation that the correlation is the strongest between future runoff and historical runoff at t and t 1 5 discussion 5 1 underlying mechanisms for the better performance of the new models our new designs of the seq2seq lrp and seq2seq lrp a models are inspired by the high linear correlation between previous runoff and future runoff the results in section 4 show that the new seq2seq lrp and seq2seq lrp a models perform better than the benchmark seq2seq models especially with short lead times even though the runoff input is processed with a simple linear layer our results suggest that a linear layer is better suited for processing runoff input than more complicated rnn cells used in the benchmark seq2seq models and the significant improvement in prediction accuracy in our new seq2seq lrp and seq2seq lrp a models especially with short lead times is likely due to the high linear correlation between runoff at time t and at time t i i 1 2 3 to test this hypothesis we conduct supplementary experiments where random rainfall data are used for model training the seq2seq lrp and seq2seq 2 models are tested with random rainfall data labeled with r compared with the seq2seq lrp model with original rainfall data the statistics of the model results are shown in fig 12 it is shown that even if meaningless rainfall data are used as input the two models still have high flood prediction accuracy with a short lead time this suggests that runoff prediction with a short lead time does not require the real rainfall input and the prediction of future runoff relies almost completely on historical runoff data however for runoff prediction with a long lead time the prediction results of the two models with random rainfall data are much worse than those of the model with original rainfall data in other words the models rely more on the rainfall data as the lead time increases because of the random rainfall data used in the seq2seq lrp r and seq2seq 2 r simulations the differences in the model performances can be attributed only to the different methods in processing runoff data with a lead time of 1 h the nse value of the seq2seq lrp r simulation is almost 1 while the nse value of seq2seq 2 r is about 0 9 this is due to the extremely high correlation between runoff at t and at t 1 and the fact that the seq2seq lrq takes full advantage of the high correlation as the lead time increases the correlation between historical runoff and future runoff becomes weaker and the differences in the seq2seq lrp r and seq2seq 2 r simulations becomes smaller and even reversed the above hypothesis applies not only to the model proposed in this paper but also to all data driven models developed for hourly flood prediction in which historical rainfall and runoff are used as input because runoff is both an input and the prediction target while rainfall is an independent hydrological driving force their roles in runoff prediction are different these differences should be reflected in machining learning models for better representation of the hydrological processes and for higher prediction accuracy in our model we exploit the fact that time series of hourly runoff are highly correlated and use a simple linear layer to process runoff input in seq2seq models which shows better results than using much more complicated rnn cells this type of practice can also be used in other types of machine learning models with similar input and output variables 5 2 influence of the maximum lead time on model prediction accuracy another advantage of the new models proposed in this paper besides higher prediction accuracy is that the effect of the maximum lead time is minimized in fig 13 we show experimental results where the maximum lead time are 3 6 and 9 h it is observed that the accuracy of the seq2seq 1 seq2seq 2 and seq2seq 3 models decreases with increasing maximum lead time for a given lead time i e the models are negatively affected when the required maximum time lead is large even though the exact lead time to be predicted is the same in contrast the seq2seq lrp and seq2seq lrp a models have almost identical prediction accuracy independent of the maximum time lead therefore if the seq2seq 1 or 2 3 model is used for flood prediction the maximum lead time should be set as small as possible while meeting practical needs when the seq2seq lrp or seq2seq lrp a model is used for flood forecasting the maximum lead time can be set as big as possible without affecting the model s accuracy at smaller lead times 5 3 limitations and implications our new seq2seq lrp and seq2seq lrp a models are tested in a common scenario where historical rainfall and runoff data are available and only these data are used as input these two models can also be applied to scenarios where additional rainfall forecast is available for runoff prediction which may further increase prediction accuracy future studies may be devoted to evaluating the impact of adding predicted rainfall on runoff prediction using the two proposed models in this study and other seq2seq models the new models take advantage of the high correlation between history runoff and future runoff and perform better with short lead times the improvement of prediction accuracy decreases with increasing lead time and becomes minor when the lead time reaches 9 h we therefore recommend that the new models are applied to short lead time runoff prediction if possible our results also show that the prediction of future runoff with deep learning relies heavily on its correlation with historical runoff rather than a mechanistic relationship between rainfall and runoff this may explain why adding historical runoff as input data can significantly increase prediction accuracy compared to just using rainfall data as input hu et al 2018 kao et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 in cases where historical runoff data are not available the prediction of future runoff becomes much more challenging which is the target of future studies 6 conclusions in this paper we develop a novel seq2seq model named seq2seq lrp for hourly flood prediction with historical rainfall and runoff as input the new model uses a linear layer to process historical runoff data instead of rnn cells as in previous seq2seq model the model is further combined with the attention mechanism leading to a new seq2seq lrp a model the two models are applied in the yutan sub catchment where we compare their performances with three benchmark seq2seq models and show that by using a linear layer for processing runoff input the new models achieve higher prediction accuracy we suggest that other machining learning methods using rainfall and runoff as input for hourly runoff prediction treat the two different types of input data separately as is done in this study processing historical runoff with a complicated rnn cell makes the prediction worse credit authorship contribution statement shuai gao methodology software formal analysis writing

3212,machine learning especially deep learning methods have been widely used for runoff prediction in recent years models based on the sequence to sequence seq2seq framework were recently introduced into the field of rainfall runoff modeling in this paper we demonstrate a new design of a seq2seq model which shows higher prediction accuracy than previous seq2seq models our new design takes advantage of the high linear correlation between historical runoff and future runoff and processes the runoff input through a linear layer our new seq2seq model named seq2seq lrp linear runoff processing is combined with the attention mechanism seq2seq lrp a and compared with three seq2seq benchmark models seq2seq 1 seq2seq 2 and seq2seq 3 the five models seq2seq lrp seq2seq lrp a seq2seq 1 seq2seq 2 seq2seq 3 were used to simulate runoff in the yutan sub catchment fujian province southeast china using hourly runoff and rainfall measurements from 2000 to 2014 the results show that the novel seq2seq lrp and seq2seq lrp a models are better suited in hourly flood prediction than the seq2seq benchmark models and the seq2seq lrp a model performs best among the five models keywords gru sequence to sequence linear runoff processing attention mechanism flood prediction 1 introduction machine learning especially deep learning is now widely used for runoff prediction chen et al 2021 ding et al 2020 sit et al 2020 among the various deep learning approaches the long short time memory network lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 an improved version of recurrent neural networks rnn is becoming more and more popular in runoff prediction kratzert et al 2018 applied the lstm model to rainfall runoff modeling for the first time with promising results our previous paper gao et al 2020 showed that the gated recurrent unit gru network a variant of lstm performs equally well and requires a simpler structure and fewer parameters subsequently rnn lstm gru models have been widely used in the field of runoff prediction with promising performances lees et al 2021 li et al 2021 jiang et al 2022 rahimzad et al 2021 xiang and demir 2020 an rnn model takes a sequence of data as input the size of which can be defined by the user but the size of the output data is not as flexible as that of the input data in general rnn models output only one value or a sequence of data that is of the same length as the input to address the inflexibility of the output size in rnn a sequence to sequence seq2seq or encoder decoder model was proposed cho et al 2014 sutskever et al 2014 a key feature of the seq2seq model compared with rnn models is that the lengths of the input and output sequence can be different this feature of the seq2seq model is highly useful in many fields kao et al 2020 first applied the seq2seq framework to multi step ahead flood forecasting they proposed a seq2seq model that can be used for multi step flood prediction for up to 6 h xiang et al 2020 proposed a model based on the seq2seq framework that can encode multiple input sequences including runoff rainfall and evapotranspiration to predict runoff at the hourly time scale yin et al 2021a proposed a multi state vector seq2seq model which has better performance than the seq2seq model using only one state vector for multi day ahead runoff predictions yin et al 2021b also applied seq2seq models to predict runoff in ungauged basins with promising results a major group of deep learning models in hourly runoff prediction uses historical rainfall and runoff as input since these data are most commonly available most of the models so far do not treat historical rainfall and runoff differently in model training and prediction in spite of their fundamental differences in their physical meanings hu et al 2018 kao et al 2020 the mechanisms through which historical runoff and rainfall determine future runoff are completely different rainfall is the main driving force of runoff and the relationship between rainfall and runoff is affected by multiple hydrological processes and parameters the relationship between historical runoff and future runoff is relatively simple there is no causality but a high linear correlation between historical and future runoff suggested by the large correlation coefficients between runoff at time t and at time t i i from 1 to 9 at the yutan gauge station studied in this paper table 1 considering the differences in the two types of input xiang et al 2020 first proposed to input historical rainfall and runoff into two encoders lstm networks in this study we propose a novel seq2seq architecture that processes historical runoff data with a linear layer in the decoder and show that the new architecture is better suited for hourly flood prediction in addition the attention mechanism which is often used together with seq2seq models is employed in this study the attention mechanism was proposed to address problems in processing long sequence information by seq2seq models bahdanau et al 2014 the attention mechanism may improve the accuracy of the seq2seq model in runoff prediction with a long forecast time the seq2seq models combined with attention mechanism have been applied successfully in many fields bahdanau et al 2014 luong et al 2015 vaswani et al 2017 including runoff prediction yin et al 2021b we expect that the novel seq2seq architecture we propose will have even higher accuracy in hourly runoff prediction if coupled with the attention mechanism in summary we develop a new seq2seq model named seq2seq lrp linear runoff processing and combine it with the attention mechanism seq2seq lrp a for hourly flood prediction we evaluate whether the seq2seq models with the new design produce better results than other seq2seq models in flood prediction and if so under what conditions the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the seq2seq lrp seq2seq lrp a models and three other seq2seq models used as benchmarks are introduced and the model evaluation metrics are presented in section 3 5 we present modeling results using a case study in the yutan sub catchment in fujian province china finally section 6 concludes the paper 2 methods in this section we present the architecture of the seq2seq lrp and seq2seq lrp a models proposed for the first time in this study and the three seq2seq models used as benchmarks 2 1 the seq2seq lrp model the architecture of the seq2seq lrp model is shown in fig 1 the historical rainfall data r 1 r 2 r m are processed by the rnn cells in the encoder rain module and the extracted hidden state hr goes into the decoder module the decoder in the seq2seq lrp model predicts y m 1 y m 2 y m n sequentially with y t 1 used as input for prediction of y t since the correlation coefficient between predicted runoff and historical runoff is very high we use the last linear layer of the seq2seq lrp model to extract information from the historical runoff sequence d 1 d 2 d m the main feature of this seq2seq model is that historical runoff is processed through a linear layer directly instead of going through the rnn as the rainfall data lstm or gru are commonly used for the rnn cell in seq2seq models gru has been shown to perform equally well as lstm in runoff prediction and has fewer parameters compared to lstm gao et al 2020 therefore we use gru for the rnn cell in this paper 2 2 the seq2seq lrp a model attention mechanism models are widely used in natural language processing and computer vision vaswani et al 2017 xu et al 2015 the seq2seq lrp a model used in this paper is obtained by coupling the seq2seq lrp model with the attention mechanism adapted from the seq2seq attention model proposed by luong et al 2015 in the field of natural language processing as shown in fig 2 the seq2seq lrp a model has the same encoder decoder structure the result y t 1 at time t 1 and the vector h 1 e h 2 e h m e generated by the encoder are taken as input to obtain the output result y t at time t through the following steps 1 the gru unit accepts y t 1 as input and outputs the decoded vector h t d 2 the attention weight coefficient sequence Œ± t 1 Œ± t 2 Œ± t m is calculated using h t d and the vector sequence h 1 e h 2 e h m e with the formula 1 Œ± t 1 Œ± t 2 Œ± t m h t d t w t a h 1 e h 2 e h m e where w t a is the weight matrix 3 the attention weight coefficient sequence Œ± t 1 Œ± t 2 Œ± t m is normalized by a softmax function to obtain the sequence Œ± t 1 Œ± t 2 Œ± t m 2 Œ± t i exp Œ± t i j 1 m exp Œ± t j 4 the attention encoding vector c t is calculated following 3 c t j 1 m Œ± t j h j e 5 c t h t d and d 1 d 2 d m are concatenated and then passed through a linear layer leading to the final result y t the above steps are repeated n times to get the final output sequence y m 1 y t 1 y t y m n through such calculation each yt extracts effective information not only from h t d from the decoder but also from each of the encoder vectors h 1 e h 2 e h m e this method retains the capability of the seq2seq lrp model to extract sequential information and is not affected by input with long time steps it should be noted that in the seq2seq lrp and seq2seq lrp a models the linear layer and the attention weight matrix w t a in seq2seq lrp a are updated for each lead time because the historical rainfall and runoff data may have different impacts on the prediction results of different lead times 2 3 the three seq2seq models used as benchmarks in this study three seq2seq models are used as benchmark models which are denoted as seq2seq 1 seq2seq 2 and seq2seq 3 respectively as shown in figs 3 5 the seq2seq 1 model is similar to the seq2seq model adopted by kao et al 2020 in the seq2seq 1 model the historical rainfall and runoff are fed to the same encoder and the resulting hidden state h is processed by the decoder for subsequent calculations the seq2seq 2 model is inspired by the seq2seq model adopted by xiang et al 2020 in the seq2seq 2 model the historical rainfall and runoff are processed by two encoders of rnn cells named encoders rain and encoders dis the two encoders generate hidden states h r and h d the sum of which is provided to the decoder for subsequent calculations the seq2seq 3 model is a modification of seq2seq 2 which uses the encoder dis module to extract the information from historical runoff and outputs h d and then h d is fed into the last linear layer of the model for processing all of the three benchmark models use rnn to process historical runoff data 2 4 performance metrics the performance of all the developed models is evaluated with the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse the root mean square error rmse the coefficient of

the number of the top 2 peak flow values Œ≤ Œº p Œº o is the mean bias Œ± œÉ p œÉ o is the variability bias and Œº and œÉ stand for the mean and standard deviation r is the linear correlation

ranging from negative infinity to 1 values of nse smaller than zero mean that the simulated result is worse than just using the mean observed value for prediction an nse value close to 1 means that the predictions are accurate the rmse value represents the error between the forecasted and the observed values and its unit is the same as the output value of the model a model with its rmse value close to 0 suggests that it can produce accurate forecasts the value of rmse ranges from 0 perfect fit to infinity no fit the r2 value is commonly used to evaluate the linear correlation between model outputs and target outputs with its value ranging from 0 no fit to 1 perfect fit tpe is used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the peak flow the top 2 runoff in this study the tpe value ranges from 0 to infinity and smaller tpe values indicate a better model prediction of peak flow yin et al 2021a kge combines correlation bias and variability into one objective metric and its ideal value is

input hu et al 2018 kao et al 2020 xiang et al 2020 in cases where historical runoff data are not available the prediction of future runoff becomes much more challenging which is the target of future studies 6 conclusions in this paper we develop a novel seq2seq model named seq2seq lrp for hourly flood prediction with historical rainfall and runoff as input the new model uses a linear layer to process historical runoff data instead of rnn cells as in previous seq2seq model the model is further combined with the attention mechanism leading to a new seq2seq lrp a model the two models are applied in the yutan sub catchment where we compare their performances with three benchmark seq2seq models and show that by using a linear layer for processing runoff input the new models achieve higher prediction accuracy we suggest that other machining learning methods using rainfall and runoff as input for hourly runoff prediction treat the two different types of input data separately as is done in this study processing historical runoff with a complicated rnn cell makes the prediction worse credit authorship contribution statement shuai gao methodology software formal analysis writing

3213,litter moisture content plays a critical role in fire danger rating systems and forest ecosystems soil moisture content has been proposed to affect litter moisture due to vapour flux and capillary rise from the soil however few models consider soil water content when predicting litter moisture and to our knowledge no model includes capillary fluxes in this study we represented soil moisture coupling in a physics based litter moisture prediction model by describing the vapour and capillary fluxes from the soil to litter we aimed to evaluate if litter moisture predictions can be improved by incorporating the hydrological process at the soil litter interface and explored the possible role of soil moisture in litter moisture simulations three model versions were compared against observations at a dry and wet experimental site in australia the original physics based model a model version extended with soil vapour flux only and a version that incorporates both soil vapour flux and capillary rise the simulation results suggest that soil moisture considerably influences litter moisture through soil vapour flux and capillary rise which can lead to more than 10 of oven dried weight particularly under wet soil conditions the corresponding model showed the best performance in comparison with field observations the contribution of upward soil moisture fluxes was small after long dry and warm periods but noticeable during more moist periods further research is needed to evaluate the revised model for a broader range of weather soil and litter conditions

introduction litter moisture content mc i e fine dead surface fuel moisture is a critical factor in determining fire ignition and spread renkin and despain 1992 rothermel 1983 varner et al 2015 slijepcevic et al 2018 rossa 2017 rossa 2018 litter moisture is also important for many fire danger rating systems including mcarthur s forest fire danger rating system operational for australian forests mcarthur 1967 and the canadian forest fire danger rating system stocks et al 1989 in addition litter typically composes the upper layer l layer of forest floors in many ecosystems stocks 1970 og√©e and brunet 2002 and it plays an important role in forest hydrological processes water balance and nutrient cycles marin et al 2000 giweta 2020 consequently accurate estimates of litter moisture are valuable for forest management and enable better prediction of potential fire danger and fire behaviour rothermel et al 1986 chuvieco et al 2004 matthews et al 2010 sullivan et al 2012 litter moisture changes in response to physical processes such as precipitation vapour exchange with the atmosphere and heat transport simard 1968 viney 1991 matthews 2014 these physical processes are directly associated with meteorological factors such as temperature relative humidity and precipitation manzello 2020 as litter is in contact with soil soil moisture has also been proposed to affect litter moisture hatton et al 1988 rothwell et al 1991 matthews 2014 for example in their field experiments in canberra australia hatton et al 1988 found that soil moisture contributed to higher eucalyptus litter moisture in the afternoon likely due to vapour exchange rothwell et al 1991 demonstrated the influence of soil moisture on litter moisture through capillary rise from the soil into the litter in aspen forests in alberta canada masinda et al 2021 used field observations to conclude that apart from temperature relative humidity and rainfall soil water content was another variable that significantly affected litter moisture in two north china pine plantations finally zhao et al 2022 demonstrated in a controlled factorial experiment that the influence of soil moisture on eucalyptus litter can occur via both vapour flux and capillary rise particularly when the soil is moist most models that predict litter moisture are empirical equations that only include temperature and air humidity as predictors sharples et al 2009 few studies considered soil moisture in litter moisture prediction models pook and gill 1993 demonstrated that litter moisture prediction was improved by including soil water content in an empirical linear regression model zhao et al 2021 incorporated soil vapour flux into a physics based litter moisture prediction model matthews 2006 resulting in better performance at wet sites however neither of the above models considered the role of capillary rise from the soil indeed to our knowledge so far no model has been proposed that explicitly includes capillary rise from the soil in litter moisture simulations in this study we address this by incorporating capillary rise into the revised physics based model of zhao et al 2021 which already includes vapour flux specifically the objectives of this study are 1 to include capillary rise from the soil into a physics based model to estimate litter moisture 2 to test if the extended model better describes litter moisture dynamics at two experimental sites in canberra australia and 3 to improve our understanding of the role of soil moisture in litter moisture simulations a novel contribution from this research is that for the first time capillary rise from the soil is explicitly incorporated into a physics based litter moisture prediction model the results have potential implications for fire risk prediction which should benefit from more accurate litter moisture predictions it also provides new insights into forest hydrology and ecology by identifying the potential hydraulic coupling between the leaf litter and the underlying soil on the forest floor although litter is an important component of the forest ecosystem the hydrological processes at the soil litter interface have rarely been studied schaap et al 1997 2 method soil moisture was used as a boundary condition on the physics based model matthews 2006 by considering both vapour exchange and capillary rise between soil and litter model vc vapour exchange between soil and litter is mainly through soil vapour flux zhao et al 2021 capillary rise from soil to litter is driven by capillary and adsorptive forces in the pore spaces zhao et al 2022 to evaluate the added value of coupling capillarity flux the simulations were compared to that of another two model versions the original model model o which excludes the influence of soil moisture altogether and a model version representing the original model incorporating soil vapour flux model v 2 1 original physics based model model o the physics based model model o was described in detail by matthews 2006 it is a multi layer process based model that estimates litter moisture by considering water and energy transfer processes in the litter bed which consists of three components litter air and liquid water the model we used is a simplified version which conceptualises the litter bed in two layers with above bounded by the atmosphere and below by the soil but excluding the moisture movement between the soil and litter matthews et al 2015 zhao et al 2021 the required boundary conditions include air temperature relative humidity wind speed solar radiation and precipitation the water and heat budget of the three components are calculated in each model layer based on six variables litter moisture content m in kg water per kg of dry litter amount of liquid water l in kg water per m3 of dry litter specific humidity q in kg of water vapour per kg of air litter temperature t m in k temperature of liquid water t l in k and air temperature t a in k the model is implemented at an hourly resolution fig 1 shows the water balance in the two layer physics based model as described above model o ignores moisture movement

australia from september 2019 to june 2021 the dry site 35 16 22 94 s 149 6 30 74 e is located in the natural open woodland which is flat and exposed with an open eucalyptus mannifera canopy overhead litter at the dry site is shallow and sometimes discontinuous the wet site 35 16 38 41 s 149 6 30 97 e is located in an irrigated rainforest at a slope 40 and adjacent to a gully this site has a denser overhead canopy and receives less solar radiation litter is a mixture of eucalyptus campanulata and nothofagus moorei with thick and continuous litter on the ground irrigation at this site occurs around three times a week with a total irrigation amount of 7 14 mm precipitation equivalent each week which leads to a high soil moisture content at this site at each site litter moisture was observed by placing 10 h fuel moisture stick sensors cs506 campbell scientific logan usa on the surface of litter surface litter moisture and beneath the litter in contact with soil subsurface litter moisture above canopy weather conditions were measured using a weather station installed at the dry site and this was considered to represent the above canopy weather conditions at both dry and wet sites given their proximity weather variables include temperature c relative humidity wind speed m s 1 net radiation w m 2 was measured by an nr lite2 net radiometer kipp and zonen b v company delft the netherlands rainfall mm was measured by a rain gauge and soil moisture m3 m 3 was measured by a hydra stevens water monitoring system inc in the top 50 mm of topsoil all variables were continuously logged every 30 min from september 2019 to june 2021 except wind speed which was recorded until january 2021 due to sensor damage from extreme weather litter depth was measured at the dry site 15 mm and wet site 25 mm the frequent irrigation at the wet site led to very high litter moisture which is a challenge for simulation matthews 2006 therefore from march 2020 a water proof plastic shelter was placed about 50 cm above the ground to stop irrigation and rainfall water from wetting the litter therefore data from march 2020 to june 2021was used for model testing at the wet site model vc was tested over the whole observation period from september 2019 to june 2021 at the dry site during this period the dry site experienced very dry and hot days up to 70 consecutive days with only minimal rainfall and temperatures as high as 42 c as well as cooler wet periods in the autumn winter period samples of surface 10 mm deep and subsurface 10 mm deep litter were collected at both sites with each sample taken from 5 random sub samples a minimum of 15 timesteps were sampled during the summer and autumn over the observation period the wet weight of litter samples was measured in the field the dry weight was determined in the laboratory after samples were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h matthews 2010 calibration of fuel stick sensors was based on regression models between the gravimetric litter moisture values and the fuel stick reading at the same timestep for the surface and subsurface litter the four calibration regressions at two sites yielded r2 values between 0 7 and 0 9 zhao et al 2022 indicating that the fuel sticks provide a suitable proxy measurement for each site s surface and subsurface litter soil samples were also collected in the top 10 cm of soil profiles at both sites and taken into the laboratory for particle size distribution analysis soil texture at the two sites is silty loam and soil moisture at field capacity was approximately 0 25 m3 m 3 which was estimated from in situ field measurements i e the water content approximately two or three days after saturation with rain or irrigation cassel and nielsen 1986 the parameters that were empirically found to most affect litter drying and wetting for example were leaf litter surface area to volume ratio equilibrium moisture parameters wetting rate surface water storage capacity and further related parameters slijepcevic et al 2015 parameters fitted to the observations were shown in table 1 the remaining parameters were left at the same values as zhao et al 2021 except litter depth which was replaced with measured mean litter depth at each site in the extended model model vc three new parameters were introduced including soil field capacity Œ∏fc saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and the parameter Œ± that describes unsaturated hydraulic conductivity model performance was assessed by comparing litter moisture predictions and observations at the dry and wet sites statistical performance metrics include the pearson s correlation r mean bias error mbe mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse willmott 1982 and the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 resco de dios et al 2015 the aic scores the model performance with a discount for the number of degrees of freedom in this case the number of fitted parameters with a lower aic indicating a better model the in situ measurements of air temperature c relative air humidity wind speed m s 1 rainfall mm soil moisture m3 m 3 and net radiation w m 2 were used as boundary conditions the missing wind speed values were interpolated from observed seasonal patterns all the models were implemented at an hourly resolution 3 results 3 1 model performance at the dry site at the dry site soil moisture content changes over time with the volumetric content in the range of 2 8 to 32 during the observation period the three models were able to describe seasonal litter moisture trends over the observation period fig 2 including model o representing the original physics based model ignoring moisture movement from the soil to litter model v representing the model extended with soil vapour flux only and model vc representing the model that incorporates both soil vapour flux and capillary rise showing similar pearson s correlations between predictions and observations at both surface and subsurface layers table 2 in absolute terms model vc performed better than models v and o as indicated by smaller aic mae and rmse the difference between the three models was small in the surface litter layer mae for moisture predictions in this layer decreased from 6 67 to 6 29 and rmse reduced from 10 88 to 10 52 when comparing model vc to models o and v for lower litter moisture content values litter moisture content below 30 the difference in surface litter moisture estimates between the three models was minor model vc performed slightly better than models v and o as indicated by slightly smaller aic mae and rmse table 2 however model vc clearly outperformed model v for the subsurface layer with model o performing the worst fig 3 pearson s correlation increased from 0 63 to 0 83 and rmse decreased from 7 17 to 3 81 table 2 all models predicted surface and subsurface moisture similarly well in the continuous hot and dry days in the summer from november 2019 to early january 2020 fig 4 during which period the observed moisture also showed low values generally below 10 only subsurface moisture estimates from model vc showed relatively higher values following the infrequent rainfall events fig 4 in contrast the performance of the three models was different in autumn which is a cooler and typically moister period end of march to early may 2021 fig 5 all the models tended to underestimate surface and subsurface moisture model vc performed slightly better in the surface layer however it greatly improved subsurface moisture estimates and showed the best agreements with moisture observations fig 5 litter moisture content values below 10 are the most critical for forest fire ignition and more commonly occur in the dry summer for these low values the three models displayed similar performance in both surface and subsurface litter as indicated by similar mae and rmse table 2 there were no meaningful differences between the three models although model v showed a slightly better performance in the subsurface litter given the smaller aic table 2 however for litter moisture content in the range of 10 and 30 the difference between the three models was more noticeable overall especially in the subsurface litter table 2 model o under estimated surface and subsurface litter moisture while model v improved the estimates and model vc performed the best among the three models the improvement was more apparent in the subsurface litter noting r increased from 0 49 to 0 69 mae decreased from 7 40 to 3 04 and rmse decreased from 8 59 to 4 37 for models o and vc respectively 3 2 model performance at the wet site at the wet site soil moisture content is relatively high with an average volumetric value above 25 and a maximum value at 37 5 in the observation period all three models predicted litter mc similarly well in the surface litter layer and the difference of surface litter moisture estimates from the three models was slight overall fig 6 models o and v both tended to underestimate litter moisture in the subsurface litter layer over the whole year may 2020 to may 2021 with an almost 10 of oven dried weight bias from model o model vc improved this underestimation with higher predicted values fig 6 overall model vc described surface and subsurface litter moisture dynamics best figs 6 and 7 despite the small difference of surface litter moisture estimates from the three models models o and v both underestimated surface litter moisture while model vc improved surface litter moisture estimates the mae and rmse decreased to 2 06 and 2 65 respectively table 3 there were apparent differences in subsurface litter moisture predictions using the three models with the model performance increasing from model o to models v and vc fig 7 by only incorporating soil vapour flux model v improved subsurface litter moisture predictions mae decreased from 8 62 to 3 74 and rmse from 8 87 to 4 23 table 3 however after including both vapour and capillary rise from the soil model vc mae and rmse were reduced further to 1 72 and 2 16 respectively table 3 both surface and subsurface litter moisture observations were relatively high during the summer period november 2020 to february 2021 at this wet site with values generally already above 10 fig 6 unlike the dry site fig 4 for the wet site there was an apparent difference in the litter moisture predictions obtained with the three models with models o and v underestimating both surface and subsurface litter moisture while model vc simulated litter moisture closer to the observations fig 7 4 discussion the physics based model matthews 2006 was extended with both vapour and capillary fluxes from the soil to predict litter moisture and was compared to moisture predictions from the original physics based model which ignores soil moisture or a model version extended with soil vapour flux only at a dry and a wet experimental site results demonstrate that the influence of soil moisture on litter moisture through soil vapour flux and capillary rise varies with soil and micrometeorological conditions comparisons of the three models at the two sites suggest that soil water content is an important factor in determining litter moisture particularly under wet conditions litter moisture is more strongly coupled with the soil under wetter soil conditions and in wetter periods e g autumn conversely the influence of soil moisture on litter is negligible under dry summer conditions when soil is also very dry figs 3 and 4 this can be directly attributed to the magnitude of moisture contribution from the soil due to vapour flux and capillary rise which tends to be very limited under dry soil conditions this can be explained by the restricted soil vapour flux and rapid decrease in hydraulic conductivity accompanying a decrease in soil water content bhatnagar et al 1979 yamanaka and yonetani 1999 our findings are consistent with sullivan and matthews 2013 who set soil vapour flux to zero in the original physics based model to predict litter moisture at a dry site in tasmania australia conversely higher soil moisture content during wetter periods enhances vapour and capillary movement from soil to litter as also suggested by hatton et al 1988 the importance of soil moisture likely explains the underestimation of eucalyptus litter moisture in the models of mcarthur 1967 van wagner and pickett 1985 and rothermel et al 1986 when the eucalyptus leaves were placed on moist soil rakhmatulina et al 2021 also concluded that ignoring the influence of soil moisture is likely to cause underestimation of litter moisture and overestimation of fire risk under wet conditions especially in the spring the consistent underestimation of litter moisture by the original model at the wet site could be attributed to consistently high soil water content this suggests that soil moisture is more likely to play an important role in litter moisture under moist conditions the improvement of litter moisture estimates from model v model only extended with soil vapour flux was noticeable compared with predictions from model o this is also consistent with our previous findings that model v was able to improve litter moisture predictions when soil is relatively wet zhao et al 2021 however incorporating vapour flux and capillary rise model vc resulted in even better estimations of litter moisture at the wet site fig 7 and table 3 the apparent contribution from capillary rise suggests this may be an important process at the soil litter interface this is consistent with schaap et al 1997 who estimated that capillary rise from the soil to the forest floor accounted for an equivalent of 25 of forest floor evaporation our results demonstrate the potentially important hydraulic coupling between the litter layer and underlying soil that has generally been neglected in previous research e g tamai et al 2001 keith et al 2010 the role of soil moisture in litter moisture simulations is also apparent when separating the moisture contributions from the soil vapour flux and capillary rise at the dry site fig 8 generally higher soil moisture leads to higher litter moisture as a result of increased moisture contributions from soil vapour and capillary fluxes fig 8 when the soil is sufficiently dry the moisture contributions from the soil to litter through vapour and capillary fluxes can be limited and almost negligible for example the moisture contribution from soil capillary rise was very small when soil moisture was no more than 5 at the experimental dry site whereas the contribution from soil vapour flux was almost zero however for higher soil moisture both vapour flux and capillary rise from the soil to litter tend to be important processes for litter moisture estimations which can lead to more than 10 of oven dry weight fig 8 the moisture contribution from soil vapour flux is enhanced with increased soil moisture whereas that from soil capillary rise may be limited fig 8 this can be explained by the contribution from capillary rise being not only related to soil moisture but also litter status given capillary flow from the soil to litter is only possible when a positive matric potential gradient between soil and litter exists rothwell et al 1991 zhao et al 2022 overall the degree of coupling with soil moisture is directly linked to soil conditions spatiotemporal soil moisture dynamics can be influenced by various environmental factors such as landscape position soil texture vegetation and other drivers of micro meteorological variables such as precipitation radiation and temperature chai et al 2021 thus because of denser overhead canopy cover and more frequent rainfall and irrigation the soil at the wet site experienced wetter conditions despite having a similar texture as at the dry site consequently litter was more affected by soil moisture likewise during drier periods e g summer litter dynamics appear less influenced by soil moisture than during wetter periods e g autumn this was confirmed by the contrasting simulation results for litter moisture below 10 and in the range of 10 30 at the dry site litter moisture values below 10 are most commonly associated with extreme fire days and they can markedly affect fire occurrence and fire behaviour felker et al 1982 resco de dios et al 2015 ellis et al 2022 such low values are generally achieved after a period of dry conditions i e high radiation and temperature low relative humidity and rainfall fig 4 when the soil has dried down through drainage and evaporation under such dry conditions the models representing soil fluxes displayed no or only marginally better performance than the original model in comparison litter moisture values above 10 often occur under slightly moist conditions e g in autumn at the dry site fig 5 and at the wet site fig 7 there was a noticeable influence of soil water content on litter moisture and the model extended with both vapour and capillary fluxes from the soil was the best model in those situations the improvement in litter moisture estimates in the range of 10 30 table 1 has implications for hazard reduction burning as the best burning results are generally achieved when litter moisture is between 9 and 16 when natural and artificial barriers are more effective and escaping fire can be suppressed more easily slijepcevic et al 2013 the improvement in litter moisture estimations under wet conditions also helps provide important information on ecosystem functioning such as carbon and nutrient cycling that is driven by leaf litter decomposition given leaf litter decomposition rate increases with high levels of litter moisture cisneros dozal et al 2007 giweta 2020 apart from environmental conditions the degree of coupling with soil moisture may also be influenced by litter and soil characteristics zhao et al 2021 for example litter at greater depth appears more influenced by soil moisture as it is less aerated and exposed this is consistent with results at the wet site where both surface and subsurface litter received noticeable but different moisture contributions from the soil fig 6 and table 3 the influence of soil properties on coupling is likely most through soil texture and its effect on the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soil e g water holding capacity and hydraulic conductivity hultine et al 2006 an important limitation of this research is that the extended model with both vapour and upward capillary fluxes was only tested at two nearby dry sclerophyll forest sites with similar soil properties and meteorology in canberra australia although the two sites covered a dynamic environmental gradient from dry to moist further research would be required to test the suitability of the extended model under a broader range of environmental ecological and meteorological conditions and soil and fuel types 5 conclusion we demonstrated that soil water content affects litter moisture predictions the contribution of moisture from the soil to litter is mainly through capillary rise and vapour flux from the soil it is minimal and effectively negligible under warm and dry conditions likely even more so for a shallow and discontinuous litter bed conversely the effect of soil moisture on litter moisture predictions is stronger under moist conditions e g cool season which can lead to more than 10 of oven dried weight especially for a deep litter bed models that ignore the influence of soil moisture conditions are likely to underestimate litter moisture during moist periods this has implications for forest fire danger prediction and ecosystems management e g fuel hazard reduction burning and leaf litter decomposition rate estimation future research priorities include evaluating the extended model under a wider variety of environmental conditions credit authorship contribution

3213,litter moisture content plays a critical role in fire danger rating systems and forest ecosystems soil moisture content has been proposed to affect litter moisture due to vapour flux and capillary rise from the soil however few models consider soil water content when predicting litter moisture and to our knowledge no model includes capillary fluxes in this study we represented soil moisture coupling in a physics based litter moisture prediction model by describing the vapour and capillary fluxes from the soil to litter we aimed to evaluate if litter moisture predictions can be improved by incorporating the hydrological process at the soil litter interface and explored the possible role of soil moisture in litter moisture simulations three model versions were compared against observations at a dry and wet experimental site in australia the original physics based model a model version extended with soil vapour flux only and a version that incorporates both soil vapour flux and capillary rise the simulation results suggest that soil moisture considerably influences litter moisture through soil vapour flux and capillary rise which can lead to more than 10 of oven dried weight particularly under wet soil conditions the corresponding model showed the best performance in comparison with field observations the contribution of upward soil moisture fluxes was small after long dry and warm periods but noticeable during more moist periods further research is needed to evaluate the revised model for a broader range of weather soil and litter conditions

introduction litter moisture content mc i e fine dead surface fuel moisture is a critical factor in determining fire ignition and spread renkin and despain 1992 rothermel 1983 varner et al 2015 slijepcevic et al 2018 rossa 2017 rossa 2018 litter moisture is also important for many fire danger rating systems including mcarthur s forest fire danger rating system operational for australian forests mcarthur 1967 and the canadian forest fire danger rating system stocks et al 1989 in addition litter typically composes the upper layer l layer of forest floors in many ecosystems stocks 1970 og√©e and brunet 2002 and it plays an important role in forest hydrological processes water balance and nutrient cycles marin et al 2000 giweta 2020 consequently accurate estimates of litter moisture are valuable for forest management and enable better prediction of potential fire danger and fire behaviour rothermel et al 1986 chuvieco et al 2004 matthews et al 2010 sullivan et al 2012 litter moisture changes in response to physical processes such as precipitation vapour exchange with the atmosphere and heat transport simard 1968 viney 1991 matthews 2014 these physical processes are directly associated with meteorological factors such as temperature relative humidity and precipitation manzello 2020 as litter is in contact with soil soil moisture has also been proposed to affect litter moisture hatton et al 1988 rothwell et al 1991 matthews 2014 for example in their field experiments in canberra australia hatton et al 1988 found that soil moisture contributed to higher eucalyptus litter moisture in the afternoon likely due to vapour exchange rothwell et al 1991 demonstrated the influence of soil moisture on litter moisture through capillary rise from the soil into the litter in aspen forests in alberta canada masinda et al 2021 used field observations to conclude that apart from temperature relative humidity and rainfall soil water content was another variable that significantly affected litter moisture in two north china pine plantations finally zhao et al 2022 demonstrated in a controlled factorial experiment that the influence of soil moisture on eucalyptus litter can occur via both vapour flux and capillary rise particularly when the soil is moist most models that predict litter moisture are empirical equations that only include temperature and air humidity as predictors sharples et al 2009 few studies considered soil moisture in litter moisture prediction models pook and gill 1993 demonstrated that litter moisture prediction was improved by including soil water content in an empirical linear regression model zhao et al 2021 incorporated soil vapour flux into a physics based litter moisture prediction model matthews 2006 resulting in better performance at wet sites however neither of the above models considered the role of capillary rise from the soil indeed to our knowledge so far no model has been proposed that explicitly includes capillary rise from the soil in litter moisture simulations in this study we address this by incorporating capillary rise into the revised physics based model of zhao et al 2021 which already includes vapour flux specifically the objectives of this study are 1 to include capillary rise from the soil into a physics based model to estimate litter moisture 2 to test if the extended model better describes litter moisture dynamics at two experimental sites in canberra australia and 3 to improve our understanding of the role of soil moisture in litter moisture simulations a novel contribution from this research is that for the first time capillary rise from the soil is explicitly incorporated into a physics based litter moisture prediction model the results have potential implications for fire risk prediction which should benefit from more accurate litter moisture predictions it also provides new insights into forest hydrology and ecology by identifying the potential hydraulic coupling between the leaf litter and the underlying soil on the forest floor although litter is an important component of the forest ecosystem the hydrological processes at the soil litter interface have rarely been studied schaap et al 1997 2 method soil moisture was used as a boundary condition on the physics based model matthews 2006 by considering both vapour exchange and capillary rise between soil and litter model vc vapour exchange between soil and litter is mainly through soil vapour flux zhao et al 2021 capillary rise from soil to litter is driven by capillary and adsorptive forces in the pore spaces zhao et al 2022 to evaluate the added value of coupling capillarity flux the simulations were compared to that of another two model versions the original model model o which excludes the influence of soil moisture altogether and a model version representing the original model incorporating soil vapour flux model v 2 1 original physics based model model o the physics based model model o was described in detail by matthews 2006 it is a multi layer process based model that estimates litter moisture by considering water and energy transfer processes in the litter bed which consists of three components litter air and liquid water the model we used is a simplified version which conceptualises the litter bed in two layers with above bounded by the atmosphere and below by the soil but excluding the moisture movement between the soil and litter matthews et al 2015 zhao et al 2021 the required boundary conditions include air temperature relative humidity wind speed solar radiation and precipitation the water and heat budget of the three components are calculated in each model layer based on six variables litter moisture content m in kg water per kg of dry litter amount of liquid water l in kg water per m3 of dry litter specific humidity q in kg of water vapour per kg of air litter temperature t m in k temperature of liquid water t l in k and air temperature t a in k the model is implemented at an hourly resolution fig 1 shows the water balance in the two layer physics based model as described above model o ignores moisture movement

surface litter due to the progressive upwards loss of connectivity between small pores in the organic matter as we observed from field experiments therefore we assume there was no capillary rise from

australia from september 2019 to june 2021 the dry site 35 16 22 94 s 149 6 30 74 e is located in the natural open woodland which is flat and exposed with an open eucalyptus mannifera canopy overhead litter at the dry site is shallow and sometimes discontinuous the wet site 35 16 38 41 s 149 6 30 97 e is located in an irrigated rainforest at a slope 40 and adjacent to a gully this site has a denser overhead canopy and receives less solar radiation litter is a mixture of eucalyptus campanulata and nothofagus moorei with thick and continuous litter on the ground irrigation at this site occurs around three times a week with a total irrigation amount of 7 14 mm precipitation equivalent each week which leads to a high soil moisture content at this site at each site litter moisture was observed by placing 10 h fuel moisture stick sensors cs506 campbell scientific logan usa on the surface of litter surface litter moisture and beneath the litter in contact with soil subsurface litter moisture above canopy weather conditions were measured using a weather station installed at the dry site and this was considered to represent the above canopy weather conditions at both dry and wet sites given their proximity weather variables include temperature c relative humidity wind speed m s 1 net radiation w m 2 was measured by an nr lite2 net radiometer kipp and zonen b v company delft the netherlands rainfall mm was measured by a rain gauge and soil moisture m3 m 3 was measured by a hydra stevens water monitoring system inc in the top 50 mm of topsoil all variables were continuously logged every 30 min from september 2019 to june 2021 except wind speed which was recorded until january 2021 due to sensor damage from extreme weather litter depth was measured at the dry site 15 mm and wet site 25 mm the frequent irrigation at the wet site led to very high litter moisture which is a challenge for simulation matthews 2006 therefore from march 2020 a water proof plastic shelter was placed about 50 cm above the ground to stop irrigation and rainfall water from wetting the litter therefore data from march 2020 to june 2021was used for model testing at the wet site model vc was tested over the whole observation period from september 2019 to june 2021 at the dry site during this period the dry site experienced very dry and hot days up to 70 consecutive days with only minimal rainfall and temperatures as high as 42 c as well as cooler wet periods in the autumn winter period samples of surface 10 mm deep and subsurface 10 mm deep litter were collected at both sites with each sample taken from 5 random sub samples a minimum of 15 timesteps were sampled during the summer and autumn over the observation period the wet weight of litter samples was measured in the field the dry weight was determined in the laboratory after samples were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h matthews 2010 calibration of fuel stick sensors was based on regression models between the gravimetric litter moisture values and the fuel stick reading at the same timestep for the surface and subsurface litter the four calibration regressions at two sites yielded r2 values between 0 7 and 0 9 zhao et al 2022 indicating that the fuel sticks provide a suitable proxy measurement for each site s surface and subsurface litter soil samples were also collected in the top 10 cm of soil profiles at both sites and taken into the laboratory for particle size distribution analysis soil texture at the two sites is silty loam and soil moisture at field capacity was approximately 0 25 m3 m

empirically found to most affect litter drying and wetting for example were leaf litter surface area to volume ratio equilibrium moisture parameters wetting rate surface water storage capacity and further related parameters slijepcevic et al 2015 parameters fitted to the observations were shown in table 1 the remaining parameters were left at the same values as zhao et al 2021 except litter depth which was replaced with measured mean litter depth at each site in the extended model model vc three new parameters were introduced including soil field capacity Œ∏fc saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat and the parameter Œ± that describes unsaturated hydraulic conductivity model performance was assessed by comparing litter moisture predictions and observations at the dry and wet sites statistical performance metrics include the pearson s correlation r mean bias error mbe mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse willmott 1982 and the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 resco de dios et al 2015 the aic scores the model performance with a discount for the number of degrees of freedom in this case the number of fitted parameters with a lower aic indicating a better model the in situ measurements of air temperature c relative air humidity wind speed m s 1 rainfall mm soil moisture m3 m 3 and net radiation w m 2 were used as boundary conditions the missing wind speed values were interpolated from observed seasonal patterns all the models were implemented at an hourly resolution 3 results 3 1 model performance at the dry site at the dry site soil moisture content changes over time with the volumetric content in the range of 2 8 to 32 during the observation period the three models were able to describe seasonal litter moisture trends over the observation period fig 2 including model o representing the original physics based model ignoring moisture movement from the soil to litter model v representing the model extended with soil vapour flux only and model vc representing the model that incorporates both soil vapour flux and capillary rise showing similar pearson s correlations between predictions and observations at both surface and subsurface layers table 2 in absolute terms model vc performed better than models v and o as indicated by smaller aic mae and rmse the difference between the three models was small in the surface litter layer mae for moisture predictions in this layer decreased from 6 67 to 6 29 and rmse reduced from 10 88 to 10 52 when comparing model vc to models o and v for lower litter moisture content values litter moisture content below 30 the difference in surface litter moisture estimates between the three models was minor model vc performed slightly better than models v and o as indicated by slightly smaller aic mae and rmse table 2 however model vc clearly outperformed model v for the subsurface layer with model o performing the worst fig 3 pearson s correlation increased from 0 63 to 0 83 and rmse decreased from 7 17 to 3 81 table 2 all models predicted surface and subsurface moisture similarly well in the continuous hot and dry days in the summer from november 2019 to early january 2020 fig 4 during which period the observed moisture also showed low values generally below 10 only subsurface moisture estimates from model vc showed relatively higher values following the infrequent rainfall events fig 4 in contrast the performance of the three models was different in autumn which is a cooler and typically moister period end of march to early may 2021 fig 5 all the models tended to underestimate surface and subsurface moisture model vc performed slightly better in the surface layer however it greatly improved subsurface moisture estimates and showed the best agreements with moisture observations fig 5 litter moisture content values below 10 are the most critical for forest fire ignition and more commonly occur in the dry summer for these low values the three models displayed similar performance in both surface and subsurface litter as indicated by similar mae and rmse table 2 there were no meaningful differences between the three models although model v showed a slightly better performance in the subsurface litter given the smaller aic table 2 however for litter moisture content in the range of 10 and 30 the difference between the three models was more noticeable overall especially in the subsurface litter table 2 model o under estimated surface and subsurface litter moisture while model v improved the estimates and model vc performed the best among the three models the improvement was more apparent in the subsurface litter noting r increased from 0 49 to 0 69 mae decreased from 7 40 to 3 04 and rmse decreased from 8 59 to 4 37 for models o and vc respectively 3 2 model performance at the wet site at the wet site soil moisture content is relatively high with an average volumetric value above 25 and a maximum value at 37 5 in the observation period all three models predicted litter mc similarly well in the surface litter layer and the difference of surface litter moisture estimates from the three models was slight overall fig 6 models o and v both tended to underestimate litter moisture in the subsurface litter layer over the whole year may 2020 to may 2021 with an almost 10 of oven dried weight bias from model o model vc improved this underestimation with higher predicted values fig 6 overall model vc described surface and subsurface litter moisture dynamics best figs 6 and 7 despite the small difference of surface litter moisture estimates from the three models models o and v both underestimated surface litter moisture while model vc improved surface litter moisture estimates the mae and rmse decreased to 2 06 and 2 65 respectively table 3 there were apparent differences in subsurface litter moisture predictions using the three models with the model performance increasing from model o to models v and vc fig 7 by only incorporating soil vapour flux model v improved subsurface litter moisture predictions mae decreased from 8 62 to 3 74 and rmse from 8 87 to 4 23 table 3 however after including both vapour and capillary rise from the soil model vc mae and rmse were reduced further to 1 72 and 2 16 respectively table 3 both surface and subsurface litter moisture observations were relatively high during the summer period november 2020 to february 2021 at this wet site with values generally already above 10 fig 6 unlike the dry site fig 4 for the wet site there was an apparent difference in the litter moisture predictions obtained with the three models with models o and v underestimating both surface and subsurface litter moisture while model vc simulated litter moisture closer to the observations fig 7 4 discussion the physics based model matthews 2006 was extended with both vapour and capillary fluxes from the soil to predict litter moisture and was compared to moisture predictions from the original physics based model which ignores soil moisture or a model version extended with soil vapour flux only at a dry and a wet experimental site results demonstrate that the influence of soil moisture on litter moisture through soil vapour flux and capillary rise varies with soil and micrometeorological conditions comparisons of the three models at the two sites suggest that soil water content is an important factor in determining litter moisture particularly under wet conditions litter moisture is more strongly coupled with the soil under wetter soil conditions and in wetter periods e g autumn conversely the influence of soil moisture on litter is negligible under dry summer conditions when soil is also very dry figs 3 and 4 this can be directly attributed to the magnitude of moisture contribution from the soil due to vapour flux and capillary rise which tends to be very limited under dry soil conditions this can be explained by the restricted soil vapour flux and rapid decrease in hydraulic conductivity accompanying a decrease in soil water content bhatnagar et al 1979 yamanaka and yonetani 1999 our findings are consistent with sullivan and matthews 2013 who set soil vapour flux to zero in the original physics based model to predict litter moisture at a dry site in tasmania australia conversely higher soil moisture content during wetter periods enhances vapour and capillary movement from soil to litter as also suggested by hatton et al 1988 the importance of soil moisture likely explains the underestimation of eucalyptus litter moisture in the models of mcarthur 1967 van wagner and pickett 1985 and rothermel et al 1986 when the eucalyptus leaves were placed on moist soil rakhmatulina et al 2021 also concluded that ignoring the influence of soil moisture is likely to cause underestimation of litter moisture and overestimation of fire risk under wet conditions especially in the spring the consistent underestimation of litter moisture by the original model at the wet site could be attributed to consistently high soil water content this suggests that soil moisture is more likely to play an important role in litter moisture under moist conditions the improvement of litter moisture estimates from model v model only extended with soil vapour flux was noticeable compared with predictions from model o this is also consistent with our previous findings that model v was able to improve litter moisture predictions when soil is relatively wet zhao et al 2021 however incorporating vapour flux and capillary rise model vc resulted in even better estimations of litter moisture at the wet site fig 7 and table 3 the apparent contribution from capillary rise suggests this may be an important process at the soil litter interface this is consistent with schaap et al 1997 who estimated that capillary rise from the soil to the forest floor accounted for an equivalent of 25 of forest floor evaporation our results demonstrate the potentially important hydraulic coupling between the litter layer and underlying soil that has generally been neglected in previous research e g tamai et al 2001 keith et al 2010 the role of soil moisture in litter moisture simulations is also apparent when separating the moisture contributions from the soil vapour flux and capillary rise at the dry site fig 8 generally higher soil moisture leads to higher litter moisture as a result of increased moisture contributions from soil vapour and capillary fluxes fig 8 when the soil is sufficiently dry the moisture contributions from the soil to litter through vapour and capillary fluxes can be limited and almost negligible for example the moisture contribution from soil capillary rise was very small when soil moisture was no more than 5 at the experimental dry site whereas the contribution from soil vapour flux was almost zero however for higher soil moisture both vapour flux and capillary rise from the soil to litter tend to be important processes for litter moisture estimations which can lead to more than 10 of oven dry weight fig 8 the moisture contribution from soil vapour flux is enhanced with increased soil moisture whereas that from soil capillary rise may be limited fig 8 this can be explained by the contribution from capillary rise being not only related to soil moisture but also litter status given capillary flow from the soil to litter is only possible when a positive matric potential gradient between soil and litter exists rothwell et al 1991 zhao et al 2022 overall the degree of coupling with soil moisture is directly linked to soil conditions spatiotemporal soil moisture dynamics can be influenced by various environmental factors such as landscape position soil texture vegetation and other drivers of micro meteorological variables such as precipitation radiation and temperature chai et al 2021 thus because of denser overhead canopy cover and more frequent rainfall and irrigation the soil at the wet site experienced wetter conditions despite having a similar texture as at the dry site consequently litter was more affected by soil moisture likewise during drier periods e g summer litter dynamics appear less influenced by soil moisture than during wetter periods e g autumn this was confirmed by the contrasting simulation results for litter moisture below 10 and in the range of 10 30 at the dry site litter moisture values below 10 are most commonly associated with extreme fire days and they can markedly affect fire occurrence and fire behaviour felker et al 1982 resco de dios et al 2015 ellis et al 2022 such low values are generally achieved after a period of dry conditions i e high radiation and temperature low relative humidity and rainfall fig 4 when the soil has dried down through drainage and evaporation under such dry conditions the models representing soil fluxes displayed no or only marginally better performance than the original model in comparison litter moisture values above 10 often occur under slightly moist conditions e g in autumn at the dry site fig 5 and at the wet site fig 7 there was a noticeable influence of soil water content on litter moisture and the model extended with both vapour and capillary fluxes from the soil was the best model in those situations the improvement in litter moisture estimates in the range of 10 30 table 1 has implications for hazard reduction burning as the best burning results are generally achieved when litter moisture is between 9 and 16 when natural and artificial barriers are more effective and escaping fire can be suppressed more easily slijepcevic et al 2013 the improvement in litter moisture estimations under wet conditions also helps provide important information on ecosystem functioning such as carbon and nutrient cycling that is driven by leaf litter decomposition given leaf litter decomposition rate increases with high levels of litter moisture cisneros dozal et al 2007 giweta 2020 apart from environmental conditions the degree of coupling with soil moisture may also be influenced by litter and soil characteristics zhao et al 2021 for example litter at greater depth appears more influenced by soil moisture as it is less aerated and exposed this is consistent with results at the wet site where both surface and subsurface litter received noticeable but different moisture contributions from the soil fig 6 and table 3 the influence of soil properties on coupling is likely most through soil texture and its effect on the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soil e g water holding capacity and hydraulic conductivity hultine et al 2006 an important limitation of this research is that the extended model with both vapour and upward capillary fluxes was only tested at two nearby dry sclerophyll forest sites with similar soil properties and meteorology in canberra australia although the two sites covered a dynamic environmental gradient from dry to moist further research would be required to test the suitability of the extended model under a broader range of environmental ecological and meteorological conditions and soil and fuel types 5 conclusion we demonstrated that soil water content affects litter moisture predictions the contribution of moisture from the soil to litter is mainly through capillary rise and vapour flux from the soil it is minimal and effectively negligible under warm and dry conditions likely even more so for a shallow and discontinuous litter bed conversely the effect of soil moisture on litter moisture predictions is stronger under moist conditions e g cool season which can lead to more than 10 of oven dried weight especially for a deep litter bed models that ignore the influence of soil moisture conditions are likely to underestimate litter moisture during moist periods this has implications for forest fire danger prediction and ecosystems management e g fuel hazard reduction burning

analytical model rgam applicability for estimating i in seven dissimilar plantations acer velutinum quercus castaneifolia pinus brutia picea abies and cupressus sempervirens l var horizontalis in the four reforested areas across the hyrcanian temperate forests northern iran field measurements were performed from may 2012 to march 2014 for 167 distinct throughfall and gross rainfall observations according to our results the effects of inter species variation on i value was evident as p abies might be the most excellent among the five frequently used tree species for planting project in temperate forests if the primary goal of plantation is to decrease erosion and surface runoff as it intercepted and evaporated more rainfall than other species our findings showed that in terms of average based calculation the mean of free throughfall coefficient p value in evergreen needle leaved reforestations 0 47 was lower than those calculated for deciduous broad leaved reforestations 0 59 and vice versa for the canopy storage capacity s 1 85 mm vs 1 36 mm respectively and mean of the ratio of evaporation rate to the mean of rainfall intensity during saturated canopy conditions e r 0 45 vs 0 38 respectively the rgam satisfactorily estimated i for all species except for a velutinum stand because the estimation error of i was lower than 15 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency was equal to or higher than 0 87 in conclusion using data from a short time study period to derive canopy ecohydrological parameters as well as modeling i by the rgam is advisable in reforestation areas across the

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the hyrcanian temperate forest also called caspian temperate forest occupies the northern part of iran and is considered one of the most important biomes in the world rahbarisisakht et al 2021 this ecosystem has roughly 850 km long and 110 km wide with a total area of 1 9 million ha accounting for 15 of all iranian forests and 1 1 of the country s land area these forests are threatened by agriculture livestock production urbanization and wood harvesting sagheb talebi et al 2014 the forest rangeland and watershed organization of iran frwo policies has been implemented to monitor illegal logging change the domestic energy sources from wood to fossil fuels and undertake tree planting across the hyrcanian temperate forest thus an intensified effort in forest restoration in these forests was initiated in the early 1960s converting degraded forests and shrublands to fast growing evergreen plantation forests mainly picea abies

and manhas 2012 calvo alvarado et al 2018 have been shown to positively correlate with i value forest canopies capture rainfall on leaf and stem surfaces and prevent slow and reduce precipitation reaching the ground affecting streamflow swank and douglass 1974 nowak et al 2020 moreover quantifying i for a given forest type can effectively inform forest management practices for improvement in water regulation yu et al 2019 understanding the relationship between the canopy water balance and the different forest species would play an important role in accurately predicting how plantation with new species affects i and water resources a variety of i process models ranging from simple empirical type models jackson 1975 and probabilistic models calder 1977 to the sophisticated data demanding model like gash type models gash 1979 gash et al 1995 are currently available for making i predictions see the review paper by muzylo et al 2009 the gash gash 1979 and revised versions gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 are the most commonly used models for estimating i in forested ecosystems see review by muzylo et al 2009 the reformulated gash analytical model hereafter rgam was revised from the original model to predict i for sparse forests open forests valente et al 1997 and has been extensively applied over various climate types around the world e g mediterranean aboal et al 1999 semiarid sadeghi et al 2015a 2017 continental price carlyle moses 2003 and monsoon climate zones wallace mcjannet 2008 however to the best of the authors knowledge only a few studies have tested the rgam in large areas n√°var 2017 and it is the first time to apply the rgam to estimate i for reforested ecosystems in the hyrcanian temperate forests of northern iran furthermore the rgam has been applied less frequently to deciduous forests than evergreen forests ma et al 2019 in developing countries in particular collecting accurate data on all the necessary climatic or canopy structural variables is difficult moreover in many cases such as iran i models are useful where the majority of the country s territory consists of small un gauged or poorly gauged canopy hydrological instruments thus developing more efficient i estimating tools for situations characterized by few climatic data and canopy structural parameters is of great importance although the rgams have been extensively adopted for estimating i values their performances across different climatic zones of iran have been seldom reported sadeghi et al 2015a 2017 nazari et al 2020 especially at a large scale hence this research examines the applicability of the rgam gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 for estimating i in dissimilar plantations across the hyrcanian temperate forests of northern iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and species description the research was conducted in seven plantations in the four reforested areas table 1 fig 1 the selected stands represent a variety of forest canopy architectures ranging from the smooth barked broad leaved canopy of acer velutinum av to the rough barked needle leaved canopy of pinus brutia pb or picea abies pa leaf phenology noticeably differs among the selected stands as av and quercus castaneifolia qc are deciduous while pb pa and cupressus sempervirens l var horizontalis cs are evergreen species measurements of stand structural and canopy hydrological parameters for each forest stand were performed in circular plots with an area of 0 5 ha mean diameter at breast height dbh diameter of the tree at 1 3 m above ground fluctuated from 12 cm for the cs to 65 cm in the qc1 table 1 tree height varied greatly among the forest stands with the shortest height for pb 12 m and the tallest in pa1 27 5 m table 1 the greatest stem density was observed for cs against the lowest stem density for qc1 table 1 basal area exhibited a wide range across plantations from 10 6 m2 ha 1 for pb stand to 83 7 m2 ha 1 for qc1 stand table 1 due to the lack of meteorological stations inside the studied sites we used meteorological data recorded from the nearest synoptic meteorological stations recording reliable long term meteorological data for each reforested stand table 1 the ranges of annual precipitation and temperature in the studied sites are 13 2 16 8 c and 469 880 mm respectively table 1 based on the de martonne climate index de martonne 1926 whole plantations were distributed in all common climate types of the hyrcanian temperate forest mediterranean cs qc1 and pa2 semi humid qc2 av and pb and humid pa1 climate classifications table 1 2 2 procedure 2 2 1 canopy hydrological parameters field measurements were performed from may 2012 to march 2014 only rain storms over 0 4 mm were measured and included in the analysis the minimum inter event dry period between discrete rain events was 6 to 12 h depending on the site and sunny or cloudy days gross rainfall pg at each plantation was measured by 5 to 10 funnel type plastic handmade rain gauges with 10 cm funnel diameter and 22 cm heights located at an adjacent open area as close as possible to the studied reforestations ca 100 m far away horizontal angles between the pg rain gauges and the top of the nearest tree were smaller than 45 hence the impact of the surrounding trees on pg was minimized asdak et al 1998 throughfall tf was collected under the canopy of each plantation using 20 50 handmade rain gauges the same design as those used for pg measurements basically if the studied area is large enough regional to national then using different rain gauges numbers for collecting pg and tf is seemed to be rational since it is more difficult to gain the same data same rain gauge numbers for the whole territory e g navar 2017 tf rain gauges were randomly located under and between the trees inside the study plot of each stand pg and tf were measured immediately after a rain the quantities of water in the pg and tf rain gauges were measured manually using a graduated cylinder with an accuracy of 1 ml the average of the rain gauges was used to estimate pg and tf per storm in our study sites due to field observation and a small portion of stemflow from annual pg e g lankreijer et al 1993 sun et al 2013 no attempts were made to measure stemflow hence i was derived to be the difference between pg and tf 2 2 2 reformulated gash analytical model interception is commonly estimated by using the gash type models muzylo et al 2009 due to simplicity low input requirement and low programming complexity the original analytical model proposed by gash 1979 represents rainfall input as a series of discrete storms that are separated by intervals sufficiently long for the canopy and stems to dry completely this model presents a limitation in the description of sparse forest stands which can prevent the simulated canopy from wetting up thus this model was subsequently reformulated due to its unsuitability for estimating i in sparse forest stands gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 the rgam needs the following parameters to be determined pg canopy saturation point p g canopy storage capacity s free throughfall coefficient p and mean of the ratio of evaporation rate to the mean of rainfall intensity during saturated canopy conditions e r to determine canopy ecohydrological parameters in each stand rainfall was divided into two groups rainfall events less than canopy inflection point pre saturation point r1 line and equal or more than canopy saturation points post saturation point r2 line then two regression lines with two slopes a and two interception points b were displayed by fitting a linear regression line to a graph relating pg x axis to tf y axis the p g mm is the maximum amount of pg required to saturate the canopy is given by the following equation 1 p g b 2 a 1 a 2 where b2 is the interception point of the post saturation line r2 regression line a2 is the slope of the post saturation point and a1 is the slope of the pre saturation point the s canopy ecohydrological parameter is the minimum amount of rainfall the canopy can hold while saturated and is estimated using the mean method universally applied by various researchers see review by friesen et al 2015 the p canopy ecohydrological parameter determines how much tf reaches the forest floor without any canopy contact one minus slope of the r2 regression line i e a2 provided an estimate of e r while the slope of the r1 regression line i e a1 supplied an estimate of p the rgam is the most widely used model for estimating i see review by muzylo et al 2009 this model is simple versatile and needs a few easily derived parameters from pg and tf observations in each forest stand the following equation explains the i value during small storms that have not fully saturated the canopy ic 2 i c c j 1 m p g j where m is the number of storms needed to saturate the canopy and c is the canopy closure fraction c was assumed to equal 1 p gash et al 1995 the amount of i needed to saturate the canopy for n storms is specified as in pg p g and equals the sum of iw ia and is where iw is pg lost during canopy wetting ia is evaporation after the rain ceased and is is defined as evaporation from the canopy after saturation these i variables are calculated as 3 i w n c p g n c s c 4 i a n c s c 5 i s e r j 1 n p g j p g 6 i n i w i a i s s c is the s per unit area of cover and is defined as s c s c gash et al 1995 total interception loss it is the sum of ic and in 2 3 statistical analysis for evaluating of the rgam at each forest stand the database after being randomized was divided into two subsets 70 for the calibrating fitting or running phase and 30 for validating phase several quantitative metrics for model performance evaluation in i studies have been used in recent years four following statistical metrics were used in this study nazari et al 2020 yadeta et al 2020 1 root mean square error rmse 2 mean error percentage error 3 the nash sutcliffe efficiency ce nash sutcliffe 1970 and 4 the pearson correlation r 7 rmse n 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 0 5 8 c e 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n denotes the number of prediction observation pairs pi denotes the predicted value oi denotes the observed values and o is the average of the observed values the rmse is a non negative metric with no upper bound and the result for a perfect model will be zero error ranges from to with zero being the ideal value for an ideal model ce is expected to range from to one with one reflecting a perfect model r values always range between 1 strong negative relationship and 1 strong positive relationship and values at or close to zero imply a weak or no significant relationship a paired t test with a 95 confidence interval p 0 05 was used to compare i values between modeled and observed storms spss ver 24 was used for all statistical analyses overall flowchart of the methodology is shown in fig 2 3 results 3 1 rainfall conditions there were 167 pg storms recorded from 2012 to 2014 across all measurement sites and pg ranged from 0 5 mm to 60 2 mm table 2 mean pg se was 16 7 1 0 mm across all plantations while site specific mean pg fluctuated from 11 5 mm for the pa1 stand to 19 4 mm in cs and qc1 stands table 2 3 2 overview of rainfall interception the seven stands evaporated i very differently in all reforested stands mean i pg ranged from as low as 33 6 for the qc2 stand to as high as 70 5 for the pa1 stand table 3 in the gorgan study sites maximum i pg were measured at 100 however in others the maximum i pg was approximately 90 5 pa1 table 3 the minimum i pg were observed in qc1 forest plantation 11 7 table 3 generally higher standard errors se were observed for i pg in the cs 4 29 and qc1 species 3 90 compared to forests in other areas table 3 a negative logarithmic relationship existed between i pg and pg in the forest stands except pb stand in the sari study site table 3 significant positive linear relationships between i and pg were observed across all studied sites fig 3 the correlation coefficient r2 between i and pg has a little fluctuating 0 78 to 0 94 for the pb and av reforestations respectively fig 3 slopes of the regression lines i versus pg were wide ranging 0 30 for the qc2 to 0 61 for the cs fig 3 for all forest stands the intercept of a regression line between i and pg was statistically significant p 0 05 fig 3 3 3 canopy ecohydrological parameters all canopy ecohydrological parameters varied noticeably among reforested stands table 4 across forest stands p g varied drastically for qc2 av and pb to cs stands 3 30 mm vs 10 11 mm respectively table 4 s value increased by 1276 from qc2 to pa1 0 21 mm vs 2 68 mm correspondingly table 4 the lowest and highest value of p were observed for the pa1 and qc1 plantations respectively table 4 e r from qc2 canopies increased by over around 2 1 times compared to the cs stand table 4 3 4 reformulated gash analytical model 3 4 1 calibrating the reformulated gash analytical model the rgam estimated i well for all studied reforestations figs 4 5 and 6 table 5 for four forest stands the model underestimated i error varied from 0 7 for pa1 to 17 8 for av and for the rest stands model overestimated i error ranged from 1 7 9 5 for cs and qc2 respectively table 5 figs 4 and 6 according to the ce metric the model s overall performance fitted for reforested stands was fine ce 0 73 0 95 table 5 the pearson correlation r along with its significance p value between the observed i and modeled i during the calibrating phase were shown in table 5 there was a strong positive correlation between observed i and modeled i in all studied stands r 0 87 0 97 table 5 the mean comparison between measured and estimated i values in the calibrating phase were not statistically different for all studied plantations p 0 05 fig 6 3 4 2 validating the reformulated gash analytical model for all 30 validating parameter storms for studied reforestations the absolute values of the error metric were lower than 16 and the ce metric ranged from 0 87 to 0 99 table 5 hence the rgam estimated i well for the validating phase figs 7 and 8 table 5 moreover a paired t test suggested no significant differences between measured and estimated i for the studied species p 0 05 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 effects of species type changes on rainfall interception the average i pg values in evergreen needle leaved stands mean 58 2 and deciduous broad leaved stands mean 43 7 in our study matched those reported by previous studies e g sadeghi et al 2016 2020 ma et al 2019 the decreased i pg in the deciduous broad leaved species may depend on the reduction in canopy cover as a result a decrease in an intercepting surface as has been shown in past research sadeghi et al 2017 2018 fathizadeh et al 2020 2021 differences in canopy structure may explain the differences between the species pa1 trees were considerably taller than other stands table 1 higher tree height typically decreases boundary layer resistance resulting in higher evaporative losses during storms pypker et al 2005 furthermore the orientation of the tree leaves likely affects i attarod et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2016 pa and cs leaves are more parallel to the ground than other species resulting in greater i reviews of the literature show that evergreen needle leaved tend to have greater i capacity than deciduous broad leaved species e g abbasian et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2016 and these findings are in good agreement with previous work synthesizing i studies carlyle moses and gash 2011 it is possible that the higher i was due to the higher tree density leaf area index lai and canopy cover in needle leaved stands than in broad leaved stands which may have been resulted in a higher e r during rainfall gash et al 1995 ≈°raj et al 2008 ma et al 2019 the higher value of i for needle leaved species has implications for foresters dealing with selecting suitable species according to the project goal pa might be the best of the five species for plantation if the primary goal is set to limit erosion and stormwater runoff as it intercepts more rainfall than other species qc trees are to consider minimizing i and increasing net rainfall throughfall stemflow to support surface and groundwater supplies a deciduous species with low i like qc would not only reduce i losses to the surface but would decrease transpiration during the dry season due to a reduction in leaf area limousin et al 2009 restoration plan of the hyrcanian deciduous forest of northern iran by planting exotic species like pa which had a greater i and s values were extensively performed by iran s frwo and may have considerable effects on ecosystem ecohydrology through altered net rainfall supply the results confirmed that the amount of pg had a significant impact on i as pg increases i pg ratio decreases hence frequent small storms typically result in the greatest proportion of pg lost to i similar to the other research e g sadeghi et al 2014 2015a b abbasian et al 2015 pg magnitude alone is the most effective parameter for estimating i indicating that climate change induced alterations to pg magnitude may have implications for forest and water managers in iran when the same species experiences different climate conditions they can differentially partition pg into i something clearly evident for qc or pa in two different climates table 3 a negative logarithmic relationship existed between i pg and pg in the studied stands except pb stand with a polynomial relationship as with past research e g jackson 1975 staelens et al 2008 most tree species have a negative logarithmic fit between i p g and p g the interception by trees generally showed a rapidly increasing trend with pg below its maximum s value and would slow down when beyond the value thus the logarithmic model was mostly used to fit the relationships between i pg and pg zhang et al 2016 in contrast the polynomial relationship between i pg and pg was reported for other pinus genus around the world cai et al 2008 li et al 2016 the dispersion of the i pg described in this study particularly for the pb stand fig 3 has been found in the literature for other forest stands llorens et al 1997 xiao et al 2000 sadeghi et al 2015b dispersion is partly attributed to the basal area as the lowest basal area was observed in the pb stand hence long term measurement is needed to find a statistical relationship between i pg and pg in sparser forests like pb stand in our studied case 4 2 effects of species type changes on canopy hydrological parameters the comparison of canopy ecohydrological parameters provided by this study against the values found by other research is not reasonable because variations in canopy structural parameters e g lai plant area index wood area index basal area dbh the roughness of trunks and leaves and tree height are definitely affecting canopy ecohydrological values crockford richardson 2000 carlyle moses gash 2011 sadeghi et al 2015a b junior et al 2019 the free throughfall coefficient p dimensionless from 0 to 1 a structural parameter assumed to be one minus the canopy cover c is a sensitive parameter for modeling i ma et al 2019 and it is also an important parameter usually considered in forest water resource management p for the entire measuring period fluctuated from 0 27 pa1 stand to 0 82 qc1 stand and in terms of average based calculation the mean of p value in needle leaved reforestations was lower than those calculated for broad leaved reforestations mean value 0 47 against 0 59 respectively table 4 which is quite comparable with other temperate forests ma et al 2019 sefidi et al 2020 for example ma et al 2019 reported that the measured average annual p was 0 52 for the broad leaved robinia pseudoacacia stand and 0 38 for the needle leaved pinus tabuliformis stand these results indicated that the canopy interception fraction in evergreen needle leaved was higher than that of deciduous broad leaved stands from an ecohydrological point of view the p coefficient impacts soil water content and nutrient cycling it reflects the fraction of rainfall that passes through the canopy but does not contact the canopy surface and removes dry deposition in the canopy asadian 2007 in terms of average based our results confirmed that evergreen needle leaved tend to have greater s than broad leaved species mean value 1 85 mm vs 1 36 mm respectively table 4 which agrees well with the findings for other temperate forests e g li et al 2015 ma et al 2019 sefidi et al 2020 the calculated s in the present study fell within the range reported in the literature reviews for example muzylo et al 2012 estimated s by quercus pubescens as between 0 17 mm leafless period and 0 49 mm leafed period ma et al 2019 showed average s was significantly higher in the growing season 1 34 mm relative to the dormant season 0 20 mm for robinia pseudoacacia plantations in china the s values for evergreen needle leaved reforestations were calculated within the range reported for other evergreen needle leaved forests 0 5 3 0 mm llorens gallart 2000 for example grunicke et al 2020 presented s value of 2 92 mm for a picea abies stand moreover an increased canopy openness canopy openness is equal to the free throughfall value table 4 can increase light exposure of branches as well as aerodynamic conductance pypker et al 2005 and therefore alter the micrometeorological conditions within the canopy e g wind speed temperature and humidity that control evaporation from the s value for example a higher wind speed might reduce the calculated s thus the lower p and higher s values in the evergreen needle leaved stand induce less net rainfall reaching the forest floor and hence aggravate soil water scarcity in this temperate region undergoing re afforestation projects the mean e r derived from the regression analysis was found to be higher in cs compared with other reforestations table 4 furthermore the average e r was greater for the evergreen needle leaved species mean 0 45 compared to the values reported for deciduous broad leaved species mean 0 38 table 3 muzylo et al 2012 indicated these values to be 0 21 for the leafed season against 0 10 for the leafless season this supports the theory of enhanced evaporation due to stand changes however to prove which factors lead to this effect would require a more detailed analysis of meteorological conditions and evaporation during and after rain storms grunicke et al 2020 4 3 performance of the reformulated gash analytical model the rgam estimated well the total i in the deciduous broad leaved and evergreen needle leaved reforestations and showed a fairly good agreement between observed and predicted i which may be the consequence of different event characteristics in addition to different canopy characteristics in most cases except av stand during the validation phase the estimation error of i was lower than 15 and the ce metric was equal to or higher than 0 87 table 5 rgam error mainly happened for large storms as previously described by other scientists schellekens et al 1999 limousin et al 2008 sadeghi et al 2015a nazari et al 2020 this finding demonstrated that the rgam predicted more accurately for small storms i e pre saturation point where i was dependent on p g and s canopy ecohydrological parameters for larger rain storms i e post saturation point s rapidly saturates and e r has more control on i leading to a bias between the observed and predicted i values sadeghi et al 2015a on the other hand for small rain storms the rgam components that govern i during canopy wetting and evaporation after the rain ceased tend to be greater and i is strongly affected by s in this study e r s and c were assumed to be constant over the whole rainfall event using constant parameter values for annual i modeling possibly lead to significant under or over estimations ma et al 2019 this assumption caused the discrepancy between modeled and measured i huang et al 2017 therefore to avoid these errors monthly or phenological based parameter values have been recommended for use in i modeling murakami et al 2007 muzylo et al 2012 sadeghi et al 2018 hakimi et al 2018 in fact e r coefficient should correspond to the period after the tree canopy is completely saturated another limitation was that canopy cover c values were taken for the same species of mature trees from a different study area c varies in different environments even for the same tree species deljouei et al 2018 deviation in c probably causes biases in the estimation of both s and p in the rgam furthermore variations in leaf phenology of species during the different phenophase should be considered sadeghi et al 2018 leaf phenology determines the timing of the emergence of leaves the growth of leaves and leaf senescence sadeghi et al 2018 hence it is highly recommended that the dynamic value of canopy hydrological parameters for the applicability of the rgam also should be considered in future research especially for deciduous species this approach potentially improves the performance of the i models van stan et al 2016 moreover n√°var 2017 showed that where forest interception was estimated and cloud water interception gained prediction results improved therefore there is an urgent need for forest i models to account for cloud water interception in the hyrcanian temperate forest ecosystems where the fog water input and fog interception are remarkable dezhban et al 2019 the simulation approach presented in this study used mean annual parameters for simulating i by applying the rgam as shown by the cumulative rainfall and per storm analyses as well as by the statistical indicators despite some inaccuracies in results this approach leads to a less complex simulation with reliable approximations hence rgam can be useful when it is not possible to use more expensive instrumentation to parameterize rainfall partitioning since it does not require monitoring canopy structural parameters e g lai and canopy closure also equations of the rgam are simplified our findings suggested that rgam for i prediction was better fitted in evergreen needle leaved stands rather than deciduous broad leaved stands due to lower error metric mean absolute values 7 6 vs 12 9 for the evergreen needle leaved and deciduous broad leaved stands respectively and higher ce metric mean 0 95 vs 0 93 correspondingly table 5 figs 4 6 these results were comparable to previous findings in other temperate rainfall interception studies ma et al 2019 for example ma et al 2019 highlighted that in terms of error and ce metrics the rgam performed better for pinus tabuliformis than for robinia pseudoacacia as canopy hydrological parameters were considered constant for the deciduous species we expected the erroneous of the rgam for the deciduous stands would be higher than in comparison those of the evergreen species the derived ce metric for the rgam was comparable to previous findings in other temperate regions i studies generally ranging from 0 44 to 0 94 e g bryant et al 2005 fan et al 2014 sadeghi et al 2015a 2017 ma et al 2019 in addition to its several theoretical and practical implications this study also has several limitations that could be examined in future studies it remains a challenging task to model rainfall interception over large areas while considering both the physical characteristics of the process and the spatial variability of vegetation cover and climate without introducing significant simplifications or uncertainties of measurements muzylo et al 2009 linhoos and siegert 2016 compared five i models rgam gash rutter sparse rutter and liu models using uncertainty analysis and found that the rgam is sensitive to the s parameter hence future modeling efforts should aim to obtain reliable measurements of s also some future research directions have been presented including canopy structural parameters rainfall characteristics and climatic parameters over spatio temporal analysis on large scales hence care should be taken about extrapolating i results over a heterogeneous landscape and different meteorological characteristics snyder et al 2022 5 conclusions we arrived to the following conclusions 1 studied species are widely used in plantation projects in the temperate regions of asian e g iran afghanistan azerbaijan and turkey and european e g romania switzerland georgia greece and germany countries the effects of inter species variation on interception value were evident as picea abies might be the most excellent among the five commonly used temperate re afforestation species for planting projects if the primary goal of plantation is to decrease erosion and surface runoff as it intercepted and evaporated more rainfall than other species 2 the results confirmed that canopy ecohydrological parameters canopy saturation point p g canopy storage capacity s free throughfall coefficient p and mean of the ratio of evaporation rate to the mean of rainfall intensity during saturated canopy conditions e r and hence the amount of intercepted rainfall can be drastically changed with forest stand characteristics e g species type dbh and tree height 3 according to the rgam applicability using data from a short time study period as well as small numbers of rain storms to derive canopy hydrological parameters is advisable for modeling rainfall interception in reforestation stands across hyrcanian temperate forests this is very important in practical applications especially for developing countries where some ecohydrological parameters may be missing or absent because of technical reasons or lack of opportunities to support this conclusion for similar areas in temperate climate zones testing the rgam with more extended measurements of rainfall partitioning are required credit authorship contribution statement touba panahande formal analysis

3214,modeling rainfall interception i is fundamental for understanding the forests role in ecohydrological processes in local and regional scales this research examines the reformulated gash analytical model rgam applicability for estimating i in seven dissimilar plantations acer velutinum quercus castaneifolia pinus brutia picea abies and cupressus sempervirens l var horizontalis in the four reforested areas across the hyrcanian temperate forests northern iran field measurements were performed from may 2012 to march 2014 for 167 distinct throughfall and gross rainfall observations according to our results the effects of inter species variation on i value was evident as p abies might be the most excellent among the five frequently used tree species for planting project in temperate forests if the primary goal of plantation is to decrease erosion and surface runoff as it intercepted and evaporated more rainfall than other species our findings showed that in terms of average based calculation the mean of free throughfall coefficient p value in evergreen needle leaved reforestations 0 47 was lower than those calculated for deciduous broad leaved reforestations 0 59 and vice versa for the canopy storage capacity s 1 85 mm vs 1 36 mm respectively and mean of the ratio of evaporation rate to the mean of rainfall intensity during saturated canopy conditions e r 0 45 vs 0 38 respectively the rgam satisfactorily estimated i for all species except for a velutinum stand because the estimation error of i was lower than 15 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency was equal to or higher than 0 87 in conclusion using data from a short time study period to derive canopy ecohydrological parameters as well as modeling i by the rgam is advisable in reforestation areas across the hyrcanian temperate forests and regions with similar forest and meteorological attributes keywords broad leaved trees ecohydrology forest ecosystems needle leaved trees temperate forest data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the hyrcanian temperate forest also called caspian temperate forest occupies the northern part of iran and is considered one of the most important biomes in the world rahbarisisakht et al 2021 this ecosystem has roughly 850 km long and 110 km wide with a total area of 1 9 million ha accounting for 15 of all iranian forests and 1 1 of the country s land area these forests are threatened by agriculture livestock production urbanization and wood harvesting sagheb talebi et al 2014 the forest rangeland and watershed organization of iran frwo policies has been implemented to monitor illegal logging change the domestic energy sources from wood to fossil fuels and undertake tree planting across the hyrcanian temperate forest thus an intensified effort in forest restoration in these forests was initiated in the early 1960s converting degraded forests and shrublands to fast growing evergreen plantation forests mainly picea abies abbasian et al 2015 attarod et al 2018 therefore there are several plantations with endemic and exotic species in degraded forests which certainly affect the hydrological cycle of the forest ecosystem like streamflow swank douglas 1974 transpiration ford et al 2011 and rainfall partitioning abbasian et al 2015 attarod et al 2018 rainfall partitioning is the relationship between gross rainfall pg and plant canopies divided into three portions throughfall stemflow and rainfall interception loss lin et al 2020 rainfall interception i is the amount of rain that falls on plant canopies and stems trunks but never enters the forest floor instead of evaporating from the wet canopies during and after a rain event sadeghi et al 2020 literature reviews showed that i can be of major importance in

and manhas 2012 calvo alvarado et al 2018 have been shown to positively correlate with i value forest canopies capture rainfall on leaf and stem surfaces and prevent slow and reduce precipitation reaching the ground affecting streamflow swank and douglass 1974 nowak et al 2020 moreover quantifying i for a given forest type can effectively inform forest management practices for improvement in water regulation yu et al 2019 understanding the relationship between the canopy water balance and the different forest species would play an important role in accurately predicting how plantation with new species affects i and water resources a variety of i process models ranging from simple empirical type models jackson 1975 and probabilistic models calder 1977 to the sophisticated data demanding model like gash type models gash 1979 gash et al 1995 are currently available for making i predictions see the review paper by muzylo et al 2009 the gash gash 1979 and revised versions gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 are the most commonly used models for estimating i in forested ecosystems see review by muzylo et al 2009 the reformulated gash analytical model hereafter rgam was revised from the original model to predict i for sparse forests open forests valente et al 1997 and has been extensively applied over various climate types around the world e g mediterranean aboal et al 1999 semiarid sadeghi et al 2015a 2017 continental price carlyle moses 2003 and monsoon climate zones wallace mcjannet 2008 however to the best of the authors knowledge only a few studies have tested the rgam in large areas n√°var 2017 and it is the first time to apply the rgam to estimate i for reforested ecosystems in the hyrcanian temperate forests of northern iran furthermore the rgam has been applied less frequently to deciduous forests than evergreen forests ma et al 2019 in developing countries in particular collecting accurate data on all the necessary climatic or canopy structural variables is difficult moreover in many cases such as iran i models are useful where the majority of the country s territory consists of small un gauged or poorly gauged canopy hydrological instruments thus developing more efficient i estimating tools for situations characterized by few climatic data and canopy structural parameters is of great importance although the rgams have been extensively adopted for estimating i values their performances across different climatic zones of iran have been seldom reported sadeghi et al 2015a 2017 nazari et al 2020 especially at a large scale hence this research examines the applicability of the rgam gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 for estimating i in dissimilar plantations across the hyrcanian temperate forests of northern iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and species description the research was conducted in seven plantations in the four reforested areas table 1 fig 1 the selected stands represent a variety of forest canopy architectures ranging from the smooth barked broad leaved canopy of acer velutinum av to the rough barked needle leaved canopy of pinus brutia pb or picea abies pa leaf phenology noticeably differs among the selected stands as av and quercus castaneifolia qc are deciduous while pb pa and cupressus sempervirens l var horizontalis cs are evergreen species measurements of stand structural and canopy hydrological parameters for each forest stand were performed in circular plots with an area of 0 5 ha mean diameter at breast height dbh diameter of the tree at 1 3 m above ground fluctuated from 12 cm for the cs to 65 cm in the qc1 table 1 tree height varied greatly among the forest stands with the shortest height for pb 12 m and the tallest in pa1 27 5 m table 1 the greatest stem density was observed for cs against the lowest stem density for qc1 table 1 basal area exhibited a wide range across plantations from 10 6 m2 ha 1 for pb stand to 83 7 m2 ha 1 for qc1 stand table 1 due to the lack of meteorological stations inside the studied sites we used meteorological data recorded from the nearest synoptic meteorological stations recording reliable long term meteorological data for each reforested stand table 1 the ranges of annual precipitation and temperature in the studied sites are 13 2 16 8 c and 469 880 mm respectively table 1 based on the de martonne climate index de martonne 1926 whole plantations were distributed in all common climate types of the hyrcanian temperate forest mediterranean cs qc1 and pa2 semi humid qc2 av and pb and humid pa1 climate classifications table 1 2 2 procedure 2 2 1 canopy hydrological parameters field measurements were performed from may 2012 to march 2014 only rain storms over 0 4 mm were measured and included in the analysis the minimum inter event dry period between discrete rain events was 6 to 12 h depending on the site and sunny or cloudy days gross rainfall pg at each plantation was measured by 5 to 10 funnel type plastic handmade rain gauges with 10 cm funnel diameter and 22 cm heights located at an adjacent open area as close as possible to the studied reforestations ca 100 m far away horizontal angles between the pg rain gauges and the top of the nearest tree were smaller than 45 hence the impact of the surrounding trees on pg was minimized asdak et al 1998 throughfall tf was collected under the canopy of each plantation using 20 50 handmade rain gauges the same design as those used for pg measurements basically if the studied area is large enough regional to national then using different rain gauges numbers for collecting pg and tf is seemed to be rational since it is more difficult to gain the same data same rain gauge numbers for the whole territory e g navar 2017 tf rain gauges were randomly located under and between the trees inside the study plot of each stand pg and tf were measured immediately after a rain the quantities of water in the pg and tf rain gauges were measured manually using a graduated cylinder with an accuracy of 1 ml the average of the rain gauges was used to estimate pg and tf per storm in our study sites due to field observation and a small portion of stemflow from annual pg e g lankreijer et al 1993 sun et al 2013 no attempts were made to measure stemflow hence i was derived to be the difference between pg and tf 2 2 2 reformulated gash analytical model interception is commonly estimated by using the gash type models muzylo et al 2009 due to simplicity low input requirement and low programming complexity the original analytical model proposed by gash 1979 represents rainfall input as a series of discrete storms that are separated by intervals sufficiently long for the canopy and stems to dry completely this model presents a limitation in the description of sparse forest stands which can prevent the simulated canopy from wetting up thus this model was subsequently reformulated due to its unsuitability for estimating i in sparse forest stands gash et al 1995 valente et al 1997 the rgam needs the following parameters to be determined pg canopy saturation point p g canopy storage capacity s free throughfall coefficient p and mean of the ratio of evaporation rate to the mean of rainfall intensity during saturated canopy conditions e r to determine canopy ecohydrological parameters in each stand rainfall was divided into two groups rainfall events less than canopy inflection point pre saturation point r1 line and equal or more than canopy saturation points post saturation point r2 line then two regression lines with two slopes a and two interception points b were displayed by fitting a linear regression line to a graph relating pg x axis to tf y axis the p g mm is the maximum amount of pg required to saturate the canopy is given by the following equation 1 p g b 2 a 1 a 2 where b2 is the interception point of the post saturation line r2 regression line a2 is the slope of the post saturation point and a1 is the slope of the pre saturation point the s canopy ecohydrological parameter is the minimum amount of rainfall the canopy can hold while saturated and is estimated using the mean method universally applied by various researchers see review by friesen et al 2015 the p canopy ecohydrological parameter determines how much tf reaches the forest floor without any canopy contact one minus slope of the r2 regression line i e a2 provided an estimate of e r while the slope of the r1 regression line i e a1 supplied an estimate of p the rgam is the most widely used model for estimating i see review by muzylo et al 2009 this model is simple versatile and needs a few easily derived parameters from pg and tf observations in each forest stand the following equation explains the i value during small storms that have not fully saturated the canopy ic 2 i c c j 1 m p g j where m is the number of storms needed to saturate the canopy and c is the canopy closure fraction c was assumed to equal 1 p gash et al 1995 the amount of i needed to saturate the canopy for n storms is specified as in pg p g and equals the sum of iw ia and is where iw is pg lost during canopy wetting ia is evaporation after the rain ceased and is is defined as evaporation from the canopy after saturation these i variables are calculated as 3 i w n c p g n c s c 4 i a n c s c 5 i s e r j 1 n p g j p g 6 i n i w i a i s s c is the s per unit area of cover and is defined as s c s c gash et al 1995 total interception loss it is the sum of ic and in 2 3 statistical analysis for evaluating of the rgam at each forest stand the database after being randomized was divided into two subsets 70 for the calibrating fitting or running phase and 30 for validating phase several quantitative metrics for model performance evaluation in i studies have been used in recent years four following statistical metrics were used in this study nazari et al 2020 yadeta et al 2020 1 root mean square error rmse 2 mean error percentage error 3 the nash sutcliffe efficiency ce nash sutcliffe 1970 and 4 the pearson correlation r 7 rmse n 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 0 5 8 c e 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n denotes the number of prediction observation pairs pi denotes the predicted value oi denotes the observed values and o is the average of the observed values the rmse is a non negative metric with no upper bound and the result for a perfect model will be zero error ranges from to with zero being the ideal value for an ideal model ce is expected to range from to one with one reflecting a perfect model r values always range between 1 strong negative relationship and 1 strong positive relationship and values at or close to zero imply a weak or no significant relationship a paired t test with a 95 confidence interval p 0 05 was used to compare i values between modeled and observed storms spss ver 24 was used for all statistical analyses overall flowchart of the methodology is shown in fig 2 3 results 3 1 rainfall conditions there were 167 pg storms recorded from 2012 to 2014 across all measurement sites and pg ranged from 0 5 mm to 60 2 mm table 2 mean pg se was 16 7 1 0 mm across all plantations while site specific mean pg fluctuated from 11 5 mm for the pa1 stand to 19 4 mm in cs and qc1 stands table 2 3 2 overview of rainfall interception the seven stands evaporated i very differently in all reforested stands mean i pg ranged from as low as 33 6 for the qc2 stand to as high as 70 5 for the pa1 stand table 3 in the gorgan study sites maximum i pg were measured at 100 however in others the maximum i pg was approximately 90 5 pa1 table 3 the minimum i pg were observed in qc1 forest plantation 11 7 table 3 generally higher standard errors se were observed for i pg in the cs 4 29 and qc1 species 3 90 compared to forests in other areas table 3 a negative logarithmic relationship existed between i pg and pg in the forest stands except pb stand in the sari study site table 3 significant positive linear relationships between i and pg were observed across all studied sites fig 3 the correlation coefficient r2 between i and pg has a little fluctuating 0 78 to 0 94 for the pb and av reforestations respectively fig 3 slopes of the regression lines i versus pg were wide ranging 0 30 for the qc2 to 0 61 for the cs fig 3 for all forest stands the intercept of a regression line between i and pg was statistically significant p 0 05 fig 3 3 3 canopy ecohydrological parameters all canopy ecohydrological parameters varied noticeably among reforested stands table 4 across forest stands p g varied drastically for qc2 av and pb to cs stands 3 30 mm vs 10 11 mm respectively table 4 s value increased by 1276 from qc2 to pa1 0 21 mm vs 2 68 mm correspondingly table 4 the lowest and highest value of p were observed for the pa1 and qc1 plantations respectively table 4 e r from qc2 canopies increased by over around 2 1 times compared to the cs stand table 4 3 4 reformulated gash analytical model 3 4 1 calibrating the reformulated gash analytical model the rgam estimated i well for all studied reforestations figs 4 5 and 6 table 5 for four forest stands the model underestimated i error varied from 0 7 for pa1 to 17 8 for av and for the rest stands model overestimated i error ranged from 1 7 9 5 for cs and qc2 respectively table 5 figs 4 and 6 according to the ce metric the model s overall performance fitted for reforested stands was fine ce 0 73 0 95 table 5 the pearson correlation r along with its significance p value between the observed i and modeled i during the calibrating phase were shown in table 5 there was a strong positive correlation between observed i and modeled i in all studied stands r 0 87 0 97 table 5 the mean comparison between measured and estimated i values in the calibrating phase were not statistically different for all studied plantations p 0 05 fig 6 3 4 2 validating the reformulated gash analytical model for all 30 validating parameter storms for studied reforestations the absolute values of the error metric were lower than 16 and the ce metric ranged from 0 87 to 0 99 table 5 hence the rgam estimated i well for the validating phase figs 7 and 8 table 5 moreover a paired t test suggested no significant differences between measured and estimated i for the studied species p 0 05 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 effects of species type changes on rainfall interception the average i pg values in evergreen needle leaved stands mean 58 2 and deciduous broad leaved stands mean 43 7 in our study matched those reported by previous studies e g sadeghi et al 2016 2020 ma et al 2019 the decreased i pg in the deciduous broad leaved species may depend on the reduction in canopy cover as a result a decrease in an intercepting surface as has been shown in past research sadeghi et al 2017 2018 fathizadeh et al 2020 2021 differences in canopy structure may explain the differences between the species pa1 trees were considerably taller than other stands table 1 higher tree height typically decreases boundary layer resistance resulting in higher evaporative losses during storms pypker et al 2005 furthermore the orientation of the tree leaves likely affects i attarod et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2016 pa and cs leaves are more parallel to the ground than other species resulting in greater i reviews of the literature show that evergreen needle leaved tend to have greater i capacity than deciduous broad leaved species e g abbasian et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2016 and these findings are in good agreement with previous work synthesizing i studies carlyle moses and gash 2011 it is possible that the higher i was due to the higher tree density leaf area index lai and canopy cover in needle leaved stands than in broad leaved stands which may have been resulted in a higher e r during rainfall gash et al 1995 ≈°raj et al 2008 ma et al 2019 the higher value of i for needle leaved species has implications for foresters dealing with selecting suitable species according to the project goal pa might be the best of the five species for plantation if the primary goal is set to limit erosion and stormwater runoff as it intercepts more rainfall than other species qc trees are to consider minimizing i and increasing net rainfall throughfall stemflow to support surface and groundwater supplies a deciduous species with low i like qc would not only reduce i losses to the surface but would decrease transpiration during the dry season due to a reduction in leaf area limousin et al 2009 restoration plan of the hyrcanian deciduous forest of northern iran by planting exotic species like pa which had a greater i and s values were extensively performed by iran s frwo and may have considerable effects on ecosystem ecohydrology through altered net rainfall supply the results confirmed that the amount of pg had a significant impact on i as pg increases i pg ratio decreases hence frequent small storms typically result in the greatest proportion of pg lost to i similar to the other research e g sadeghi et al 2014 2015a b abbasian et al 2015 pg magnitude alone is the most effective parameter for estimating i indicating that climate change induced alterations to pg magnitude may have implications for forest and water managers in iran when the same species experiences different climate conditions they can differentially partition pg into i something clearly evident for qc or pa in two different climates table 3 a negative logarithmic relationship existed between i pg and pg in the studied stands except pb stand with a polynomial relationship as with past research e g jackson 1975 staelens et al 2008 most tree species have a negative logarithmic fit between i p g and p g the interception by trees generally showed a rapidly increasing trend with pg below its maximum s value and would slow down when beyond the value thus the logarithmic model was mostly used to fit the relationships between i pg and pg zhang et al 2016 in contrast the polynomial relationship between i pg and pg was reported for other pinus genus around the world cai et al 2008 li et al 2016 the dispersion of the i pg described in this study particularly for the pb stand fig 3 has been found in the literature for other forest stands llorens et al 1997 xiao et al 2000 sadeghi et al 2015b dispersion is partly attributed to the basal area as the lowest basal area was observed in the pb stand hence long term measurement is needed to find a statistical relationship between i pg and pg in sparser forests like pb stand in our studied case 4 2 effects of species type changes on canopy hydrological parameters the comparison of canopy ecohydrological parameters provided by this study against the values found by other research is not reasonable because variations in canopy structural parameters e g lai plant area index wood area index basal area dbh the roughness of trunks and leaves and tree height are definitely affecting canopy ecohydrological values crockford richardson 2000 carlyle moses gash 2011 sadeghi et al 2015a b junior et al 2019 the free throughfall coefficient p dimensionless from 0 to 1 a structural parameter assumed to be one minus the canopy cover c is a sensitive parameter for modeling i ma et al 2019 and it is also an important parameter usually considered in forest water resource management p for the entire measuring period fluctuated from 0 27 pa1 stand to 0 82 qc1 stand and in terms of average based calculation the mean of p value in needle leaved reforestations was lower than those calculated for broad leaved reforestations mean value 0 47 against 0 59 respectively table 4 which is quite comparable with other temperate forests ma et al 2019 sefidi et al 2020 for example ma et al 2019 reported that the measured average annual p was 0 52 for the broad leaved robinia pseudoacacia stand and 0 38 for the needle leaved pinus tabuliformis stand these results indicated that the canopy interception fraction in evergreen needle leaved was higher than that of deciduous broad leaved stands from an ecohydrological point of view the p coefficient impacts soil water content and nutrient cycling it reflects the fraction of rainfall that passes through the canopy but does not contact the canopy surface and removes dry deposition in the canopy asadian 2007 in terms of average based our results confirmed that evergreen needle leaved tend to have greater s than broad leaved species mean value 1 85 mm vs 1 36 mm respectively table 4 which agrees well with the findings for other temperate forests e g li et al 2015 ma et al 2019 sefidi et al 2020 the calculated s in the present study fell within the range reported in the literature reviews for example muzylo et al 2012 estimated s by quercus pubescens as between 0 17 mm leafless period and 0 49 mm leafed period ma et al 2019 showed average s was significantly higher in the growing season 1 34 mm relative to the dormant season 0 20 mm for robinia pseudoacacia plantations in china the s values for evergreen needle leaved reforestations were calculated within the range reported for other evergreen needle leaved forests 0 5 3 0 mm llorens gallart 2000 for example grunicke et al 2020 presented s value of 2 92 mm for a picea abies stand moreover an increased canopy openness canopy openness is equal to the free throughfall value table 4 can increase light exposure of branches as well as aerodynamic conductance pypker et al 2005 and therefore alter the micrometeorological conditions within the canopy e g wind speed temperature and humidity that control evaporation from the s value for example a higher wind speed might reduce the calculated s thus the lower p and higher s values in the evergreen needle leaved stand induce less net rainfall reaching the forest floor and hence aggravate soil water scarcity in this temperate region undergoing re afforestation projects the mean e r derived from the regression analysis was found to be higher in cs compared with other reforestations table 4 furthermore the average e r was greater for the evergreen needle leaved species mean 0 45 compared to the values reported for deciduous broad leaved species mean 0 38 table 3 muzylo et al 2012 indicated these values to be 0 21 for the leafed season against 0 10 for the leafless season this supports the theory of enhanced evaporation due to stand changes however to prove which factors lead to this effect would require a more detailed analysis of meteorological conditions and evaporation during and after rain storms grunicke et al 2020 4 3 performance of the reformulated gash analytical model the rgam estimated well the total i in the deciduous broad leaved and evergreen needle leaved reforestations and showed a fairly good agreement between observed and predicted i which may be the consequence of different event characteristics in addition to different canopy characteristics in most cases except av stand during the validation phase the estimation error of i was lower than 15 and the ce metric was equal to or higher than 0 87 table 5 rgam error mainly happened for large storms as previously described by other scientists schellekens et al 1999 limousin et al 2008 sadeghi et al 2015a nazari et al 2020 this finding demonstrated that the rgam predicted more accurately for small storms i e pre saturation point where i was dependent on p g and s canopy ecohydrological parameters for larger rain storms i e post saturation point s rapidly saturates and e r has more control on i leading to a bias between the observed and predicted i values sadeghi et al 2015a on the other hand for small rain storms the rgam components that govern i during canopy wetting and evaporation after the rain ceased tend to be greater and i is strongly affected by s in this study e r s and c were assumed to be constant over the whole rainfall event using constant parameter values for annual i modeling possibly lead to significant under or over estimations ma et al 2019 this assumption caused the discrepancy between modeled and measured i huang et al 2017 therefore to avoid these errors monthly or phenological based parameter values have been recommended for use in i modeling murakami et al 2007 muzylo et al 2012 sadeghi et al 2018 hakimi et al 2018 in fact e r coefficient should correspond to the period after the tree canopy is completely saturated another limitation was that canopy cover c values were taken for the same species of mature trees from a different study area c varies in different environments even for the same tree species deljouei et al 2018 deviation in c probably causes biases in the estimation of both s and p in the rgam furthermore variations in leaf phenology of species during the different phenophase should be considered sadeghi et al 2018 leaf phenology determines the timing of the emergence of leaves the growth of leaves and leaf senescence sadeghi et al 2018 hence it is highly recommended that the dynamic value of canopy hydrological parameters for the applicability of the rgam also should be considered in future research especially for deciduous species this approach potentially improves the performance of the i models van stan et al 2016 moreover n√°var 2017 showed that where forest interception was estimated and cloud water interception gained prediction results improved therefore there is an urgent need for forest i models to account for cloud water interception in the hyrcanian temperate forest ecosystems where the fog water input and fog interception are remarkable dezhban et al 2019 the simulation approach presented in this study used mean annual parameters for simulating i by applying the rgam as shown by the cumulative rainfall and per storm analyses as well as by the statistical indicators despite some inaccuracies in results this approach leads to a less complex simulation with reliable approximations hence rgam can be useful when it is not possible to use more expensive instrumentation to parameterize rainfall partitioning since it does not require monitoring canopy structural parameters e g lai and canopy closure also equations of the rgam are simplified our findings suggested that rgam for i prediction was better fitted in evergreen needle leaved stands rather than deciduous broad leaved stands due to lower error metric mean absolute values 7 6 vs 12 9 for the evergreen needle leaved and deciduous broad leaved stands respectively and higher ce metric mean 0 95 vs 0 93 correspondingly table 5 figs 4 6 these results were comparable to previous findings in other temperate rainfall interception studies ma et al 2019 for example ma et al 2019 highlighted that in terms of error and ce metrics the rgam performed better for pinus tabuliformis than for robinia pseudoacacia as canopy hydrological parameters were considered constant for the deciduous species we expected the erroneous of the rgam for the deciduous stands would be higher than in comparison those of the evergreen species the derived ce metric for the rgam was comparable to previous findings in other temperate regions i studies generally ranging from 0 44 to 0 94 e g bryant et al 2005 fan et al 2014 sadeghi et al 2015a 2017 ma et al 2019 in addition to its several theoretical and practical implications this study also has several limitations that could be examined in future studies it remains a challenging task to model rainfall interception over large areas while considering both the physical characteristics of the process and the spatial variability of vegetation cover and climate without introducing significant simplifications or uncertainties of measurements muzylo et al 2009 linhoos and siegert 2016 compared five i models rgam gash rutter sparse rutter and liu models using uncertainty analysis and found that the rgam is sensitive to the s parameter hence future modeling efforts should aim to obtain reliable measurements of s also some future research directions have been presented including canopy structural parameters rainfall characteristics and climatic parameters over spatio temporal analysis on large scales hence care should be taken about extrapolating i results over a heterogeneous landscape and different meteorological characteristics snyder et al 2022 5 conclusions we arrived to the following conclusions 1 studied species are widely used in plantation projects in the temperate regions of asian e g iran afghanistan azerbaijan and turkey and european e g romania switzerland georgia greece and germany countries the effects of inter species variation on interception value were evident as picea abies might be the most excellent among the five commonly used temperate re afforestation species for planting projects if the primary goal of plantation is to decrease erosion and surface runoff as it intercepted and evaporated more rainfall than other species 2 the results confirmed that canopy ecohydrological parameters canopy saturation point p g canopy storage capacity s free throughfall coefficient p and mean of the ratio of evaporation rate to the mean of rainfall intensity during saturated canopy conditions e r and hence the amount of intercepted rainfall can be drastically changed with forest stand characteristics e g species type dbh and tree height 3 according to the rgam applicability using data from a short time study period as well as small numbers of rain storms to derive canopy hydrological parameters is advisable for modeling rainfall interception in reforestation stands across hyrcanian temperate forests this is very important in practical applications especially for developing countries where some ecohydrological parameters may be missing or absent because of technical reasons or lack of opportunities to support this conclusion for similar areas in temperate climate zones testing the rgam with more extended measurements of rainfall partitioning are required credit authorship contribution statement touba panahande formal analysis
