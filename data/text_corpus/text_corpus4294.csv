shown in fig 6 the slope of the stress strain curve in the elastic region is taken as the elastic modulus from fig 6 it is clear that the stress strain curve at four experimental temperature has obvious upper and lower yields points after the stress strain curves reach the highest point that is the ultimate tensile strength the curves drop significantly and then fracture based on the results of stress strain tensile experiments at the four experimental temperatures the mechanical properties such as yield strength ultimate tensile strength and percentage reduction of area are average values of the three replicated specimens the average values are shown in fig 7 a e fig 7 a shows the change of the elastic modulus of eh36 steel with experimental temperature it can be obtained that the elastic modulus at 60 c 40 c 20 c and 20 c are 2 18 gpa 2 32 gpa 2 28 gpa and 2 07 gpa respectively with the decrease of temperature from 20 cto 40 c the elastic modulus of eh36 steel shows a significant increase trend with an increase of 12 08 however when the temperature decreases to 60 c the elastic modulus results suddenly decrease which may be caused by the brittle tough transition of the material fig 7 b shows the yield strength of eh36 steel at different experimental temperature it can be obtained from the figure that the yield strengths of eh36 steel at four experimental temperatures are 387 mpa 385 mpa 381 mpa and 366 mpa respectively as the temperature decreases the yield gradually increases the yield stress of eh36 steel at 60 cincreases by 5 74 compared with room temperature the increasing trend of yield stress gradually slows down fig 7 c shows the ultimate tensile strength of eh36 steel at four experimental temperatures it can be obtained from the fig 7 c that the variation tendency of ultimate tensile strength of eh36 with the experimental temperature is the same with the yield strength the ultimate tensile strengths of eh36 steel at temperatures of 60 c 40 c 20 c and 20 c are 537 mpa 532 mpa 527 mpa and 510mpa respectively with the decrease of temperature the tensile strength of eh36 steel increased slightly increasing by 5 29 fig 7 d and e are the elongation and reduction of area at different temperature it can be seen from the fig 7 d and e that the elongation and the reduction of area of eh36 show a decreasing trend with the decrease of temperature which means that the toughness of eh36 steel decreased and the brittleness increased with the decrease of temperature according to the low temperature mechanical properties experiments of eh36 steel in fig 7 it can be obtained that as the experimental temperature decreases the strength of the polar icebreaker ship steel eh36 increases and the plastic properties of the material decrease the eh36 steel has better mechanical properties under low temperature than normal temperature however the increase in brittleness leads to reduce fatigue fracture toughness of the material and increase the fatigue crack growth threshold so it is necessary to develop experimental research on the low temperature fatigue behavior of eh36 steel 3 3 eh36 steel low temperature fatigue performance according to the experimental research on the low temperature mechanical properties of eh36 steel it is obtained that the temperature has a significant effect on the mechanical properties of the eh36 steel during the operation of the polar ship the ice load continues to cyclically squeeze the structure the low temperature fatigue performance of eh36 steel is one of the key issues to ensure structure safe therefore the fatigue properties of eh36 steel at low temperature are studied by experimental method in this paper the experimental temperatures are 20 c and 60 c the fatigue crack growth rates experiments at load ratios 0 03 and 0 3 are performed both the two temperatures the experiment is terminated when the stress intensity factor range reaches approximately 40 mpa m0 5 the experimental results are shown below see fig 8 the effects of load ratios on the crack lengths of eh36 steel are shown in fig 9 at the same experimental temperatures the initial crack lengths a 0 of

03 the crack length is 38 28 mm and the corresponding number of cycles is 366654 when the experiment is terminated the crack length and number of cycles are 37 54 mm and 302351 at the load ratio r 0 3 when the experiment is terminated it can be obtained that the fatigue life decreases with the increase of the load r at the experimental temperature 20 c at the fatigue experimental temperature is 60 c the termination crack length a of eh36 steel is 38 7 mm and 37 6 mm for the load ratio 0 03 and 0 3 and the corresponding number of cycles n are 619626 and 552659 respectively by comparing the results of the two experimental temperature it can be obtained that the load ratio at room temperature and low temperature has a significant effect on the fatigue crack growth behavior of eh36 steel the fatigue life decreases with the increase of the load ration at the experimental temperature 20 c the lifetime is reduced by 17 54 and the fatigue life is reduced by 10 81 for the experimental temperature 60 c it means that the effect of the load ratio at low temperature on the fatigue life is less than the room temperature in order to more clearly analyze the effect of low temperature on fatigue life fig 9 shows the a n curves of eh36 steel at 20 c and 60 c under the same load ratio at the load ratio of 0 03 the number of cycles n at the end of the experiment is 366654 for 20 cand 619626 for 60 c at the load ratio of 0 3 the number of cycles n at the end of the experiment is 302351 for 20 c and 552659 for 60 c respectively it is found that the fatigue life of eh36 steel increases by 69 with decreasing temperature at the load ratio of 0 03 and the fatigue life increases by 82 89 at the load ratio of 0 3 the temperature has a significant effect on the fatigue crack propagation behavior of eh36 steel the fatigue life of eh36 steel greatly increases with the decrease of temperature and eh36 steel has better low temperature fatigue behavior during fatigue crack growth most of the life is consumed in the threshold region and paris region ouyang 1982 zhang 2006 wu 2009 li 2019 in this paper only the fatigue crack growth rate of the two regions were taken for comparative analysis the fatigue crack growth rates and threshold stress intensity factor ranges of eh36 steel at different experimental temperature and different load ratios are obtained the experimental results of the fatigue crack growth rates are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 in order to analyze the effect of temperature and load ratio on the fatigue crack growth rates of eh36 steel figs 10 and 11 show the fatigue crack growth rates at different loading ratios and different experimental temperatures it can be obtained from fig 10 that the load ratios have significant effects on the fatigue crack growth threshold of eh36 steel at two experimental temperatures at the experimental temperature 20 c the threshold stress intensity factor range of eh36 steel at two load ratios 0 03 and 0 3 are 16 mpa m0 5and 12 mpa m0 5 respectively at the experimental temperature 60 c the threshold stress intensity factor ranges are 17 2 mpa m0 5 and 13 4 mpa m0 5 respectively it can be obtained that the threshold stress intensity factor range decreases with the increase of the load ratio at the two experimental temperatures at two experimental temperatures the effect of the load ratio on the fatigue crack growth rate decreases with the increase of the stress intensity factor range finally the fatigue crack growth rate curves overlap under the two load ratios fig 11 shows the effect of experimental temperatures on the fatigue crack growth threshold and fatigue crack growth rate of eh36 steel at two load ratios for the load ratio 0 03 and 0 3 the fatigue crack growth rate threshold of eh36 steel increases with the decease of experimental temperature the fatigue crack growth rate of eh36 steel at 60 c is lower than that at 20 c at the load ratios of 0 3 the effect of temperature on fatigue crack growth rate and threshold is more significant good resistance to crack initiation and crack growth of eh36 steel at low temperature are verified by the experiments under different experimental temperatures and load ratios 4 conclusion the tensile experiments threshold experiments and fatigue crack growth rate experiments of the eh36 for polar icebreaker ship steel are carried

tensile strength of eh36 steel increase and the plastic properties of the material decrease with the decrease of the experimental temperature eh36 steel has better low temperature mechanical properties 2 both load ratio and experimental temperature have a significant effect on fatigue life of eh36 steel the fatigue life decreases with the increase of the load ratio the effect of load ratio on fatigue life at low temperature is less than that at room temperature the fatigue life of eh36 steel has been greatly improved with the increase of temperature 3 the threshold stress intensity factor ranges and fatigue crack growth rates of eh36 steel are investigated under different experimental temperatures and different load ratios the threshold stress intensity factor ranges decrease with the increase of load ratios the effect of the load ratio on the fatigue crack growth rates decrease with the increase of stress intensity factor ranges finally the fatigue crack growth rates overlap under the two load ratios the threshold stress intensity factor ranges of eh36 increase with the decrease of experimental temperatures the fatigue crack growth rates of eh36 steel at low temperature are lower than room temperature under higher load ratio the effect of temperature on fatigue crack growth rate and threshold stress intensity factor range is more obvious 4 the fatigue

21471,since the inception of merchant ships bulk carriers have been used extensively for transporting cargo across oceans with the passage of time bulk carriers have been improvised to enhance both the cargo carrying capacity and safety of the cargo and crew the target of this study is to address how stiffness reductions in the inner bottom plate and outer bottom plate affected the global redistribution of nominal stresses in double bottom of a bulk carrier vessel the redistribution effect is then studied in relation to the buckling capacity of the double bottom two different principles of stiffness reductions are carried out the first included reduced stiffness in the whole inner and outer bottom plate in the centre tank and neighbouring tank the second principle is to reduce stiffness in areas with compressive stresses only a parametric study varying the degree of stiffness reductions and type of material coefficient is carried out for each principle the results show that the reduced stiffness properties leads to significant nominal stress redistribution leading to reduced transverse stresses this is most clearly seen for the thinnest outer bottom keywords finite element cargo hold model isotropic and orthotropic material reduced stiffness capacity check 1 introduction with the international association of classification societies iacs common structural rules csr for bulk carrier vessels for all vessels over 150 m in length a direct strength study in accordance with a three hold finite element modelling of cargo hold is necessary csr based structural design is a challenging activity involving the use of an integrated design framework iacs 2012 stamatelos et al 2011 introduced a methodology for the analytical assessment of local buckling and post buckling behaviour of isotropic and orthotropic stiffened plates the approach considers the stiffened panel segment located between two stiffeners while the remaining panel was replaced by equivalent transverse and rotational springs of varying stiffness which act as elastic edge supports a two dimensional ritz displacement function pb 2 ritz was utilized in the solution of the local buckling problem of isotropic and laminated symmetric composite panels with arbitrary edge boundary conditions the buckling analysis of the segment provided an accurate and conservative prediction of the panel local buckling behavior furthermore the developed methodology was extended in the prediction of the post buckling response of stiffened panels a comparison of the proposed methodology results to respective finite element fe results presented a satisfactory agreement amlashi and moan 2008 performed an ultimate strength analysis of the bulk carrier vessel hull girder with alternate load conditions important double bending of bottom in empty holds in ahl was examined due to the hull girder s combined global bending moment with local loads ultimate strength of hull girder is greatly diminished by local loads on double bottom effect of various design pressures on the strength of the hull girder was computed in accordance with csr and dnv codes finite element analysis findings can be utilized as a basis for developing simplified procedures for realistic ship hull design with combined load pattern kitamura et al 2011 carried put a structure optimization for the initial design stage of ship using fem a general bulk carrier was selected as the target ship both the shape of the bottom structure and the size of plate thickness of the bulk carrier were taken as design variable simultaneously for a weight minimal optimization problem five geometric dimensions and thirty one plate thicknesses were taken as the design variables for the shape and the size of the bottom structure respectively the yield stress for all elements of the three hold fem model and the buckling stress for the selected stiffened panels were evaluated as the constraint conditions the selected stiffened panels were on the bottom plate the inner bottom plate the girder plate the floor plate and the bilge hopper plate it was shown that the structural optimization with the design variables for the shape and size of the bottom structure can reduce the weight of ship structure and satisfy the constraint conditions effectively piscopo and scamardella 2020 concentrated on ultimate strength evaluation of intact and pitted uniaxial and biaxial compression platings to produce a common formulation that could be applied both in design phase of new vessels and in the evaluation methods of aged structures a large number of fe computations were carried out using ansys tool current formulas in harmonized standard structural rules for bulk carrier vessels were compared with the additional finite element analysis findings available in the literature and the design equations new uniaxial and biaxial compression equations in addition to the two step pitting corrosion wastage technique prove to be efficient for practical design purposes based on the findings xu et al 2015 assessed the degree to which a bulk carrier sinks when vessel was exposed to extreme wave loadings a hydro elastoplasticity hypothesis was suggested and relationship between broad elasto plastic deformation and wave load assessment was implemented to vessel s structure on premise that a plastic hinge was created in the mid ship area when hull girder collapsed under intense wave conditions a prediction of the degree of collapse was made using the hydro elastoplasticity method for a bulk carrier vessel that was exposed to an intense wave load the analysis revealed to what degree the hull girder could collapse in several short term sea states under extreme wave conditions at an excess probability of 1 1000 in order to examine the influence of local bending of double bottom on the ultimate hull girder strength pei et al 2012 performed a series of nonlinear calculation applying three different methods the first method is smith s method using in house code hullst to evaluate ultimate hull girder strength under pure bending the second was the application of new system recently developed by the authors this method was a combination of load motion analysis and progressive collapse analysis the third was nonlinear fem analysis using a commercial code msc marc it was found that bending deformation was produced not only in double bottom but also in bilge hopper tank and the ultimate hull girder strength was reduced by roughly 20 due to this local bending kim et al 2015 investigated various types of industry corrosion addition practices with regard to the ultimate strength performance of bulk carriers five types of corrosion additions namely previously applied structural design rule csr common structural rule harmonized csr time dependent corrosion wastage model four types of bulk carrier structures namely 37 k handysize 57 k supramax 82 k kamsarmax and 181 k capesize were studied the ultimate strength performance of hull girders and stiffened panels was examined through various corrosion additions used in industrial practices zheng and zhang 2012 performed the direct strength calculation of a 87000t bulk carrier in accordance with common structural rules for bulk carriers taking heavy ballast tank as an example this work elaborated the calculation process of the ship by initially obtaining the structure dimensions according to regulations then the compartment finite element model was generated for direct calculation the structure components that fail to meet the requirements were modified consequently the components dimensions that can satisfy the regulation were obtained hu et al 2001 analysed the ultimate longitudinal strength of a typical bulk carrier by using a simplified method the moment curvature curve the ultimate bending moment and the location of the instantaneous neutral axis at ultimate state were calculated for both hogging and sagging conditions of the ship under vertical bending the stress distribution over the hull cross section at ultimate state was also obtained the ultimate strength of the ship hull under combined vertical and horizontal bending moments was further investigated an interaction curve was obtained according to the results of a series of calculation for the hull subjected to bending conditions with different angles of curvature it was found that the interaction curve is asymmetrical because the hull cross section is not symmetrical about the horizontal axis and the behavior of the structural members under compression is different from that under tension due to the non linearity caused by buckling huang et al 2006 performed a research to evaluate the strength of a double hull bulk carrier structure and its optimum hull weight the midsection of a double hull bulk carrier was optimized using the evolutionary computation and the shear stress of a single hull and double hull structure was calculated respectively using the method of shear flow the result indicates that the weight of a double hull bulk carrier can be reduced to a reasonable amount in comparison with existing single hull types and the shear stresses of the side shell top and hopper tank are decreased significantly by using a double hull structure kitarović et al 2015 analysed a bulk carrier hull girder s ultimate strength in its mid ship section as determined by a progressive incremental iterative collapse analysis methodology suggested by iacs standard structural rules for bulk carriers in addition to initially prescribed load end shortening curves non linear finite element fe analysis curves were taken into account as well findings from both sets of curves were compared and discussed at both local and global levels for both hogging and sagging conditions servis et al 2003 developed a modelling procedure for bulk carrier vessels by means of finite element method to analyze structural integrity of these regions subject to loads described in the iacs it also recorded findings by using iacs loads from extensive nonlinear simulations shu and moan 2012 presented the ultimate strength of a capesize bulk carrier hull girder under combined global and local loads in the hogging and ahl condition is extensively and systematically investigated using nonlinear finite element fe analysis with abaqus software based on the results obtained by nonlinear fe analyses a practical interaction equation was established between global hogging bending capacity and average external sea pressure over the bottom özgüç and barltrop 2008 used a simplified method based on an incremental iterative approach to evaluate overall strength of a typical bulk carrier vessel s hull girder in the first position the vertical bending moment was investigated by seven different techniques the instant versus the curvature curvatures were calculated in both hogging and sagging cases and the values of the ultimate longitudinal moments at collapse second under the combined moment of vertical and horizontal bending the total force was accounted for in bending conditions with different curvature angles an interaction curve was obtained which corresponds to the results of the simulation series for the ship hull the interaction curve has been found to be asymmetrical since the hull cross section is not symmetrical with respect to the horizontal axis and the structural reaction of the compressed elements is different from the compressed elements due to nonlinearity induced by buckling mode shu and moan 2010 used nonlinear finite element analysis with abaqus tool to measure a capesize bulk carrier vessel s ultimate hull girder strength under combined global and local hogging and alternate load condition ahl loads a three cargo fe model with a fine mesh at the middle cargo hold was developed for non linear finite element study initial geometric imperfections had been implemented within middle cargo hold s double bottom the fe model had accounted for both material and geometric nonlinearities the most critical situation for the longitudinal force assessment of bulk carriers in hogging is the ahl position with an empty middle cargo hold subject to combined global and local loads the local loads such as external sea pressure and internal cargo pressure were applied according to normal structural rules for bulk carriers csr bc in hogging condition for heavy cargo ahl ultimate strength of hull girder with various local pressure load levels was examined it was drawn that ultimate strength of the hull girder due to action of local pressure loads could be considerably reduced compared to obtained with pure hogging bending bulk carriers were associated with high structural failure and foundation risks as well as severe human life loss roberts et al 2013 employed lloyd s accident records to analyze the degree to which dry bulk shipping has occurred over past 30 years and identified shipping factors with respect to risks of setting up bulk carriers and personnel casualties in recent years andric et al 2020 created the octopus csr design tool that was employed for structural design of the bulk carrier vessels designed in croatia and accordingly presented main achievements of preliminary design process the tools and techniques developed allow the structural engineering team so as to optimize structural designs whereas meeting csr s structural safety requirements the target of this study is to address how stiffness reductions in the inner bottom plate and outer bottom plate affected the global redistribution of nominal stresses in double bottom hull of a bulk carrier vessel the redistribution effect is then studied in relation to buckling capacity of double bottom two different principles of stiffness reductions are carried out the first included reduced stiffness in the whole inner and outer bottom plate in the centre tank and neighbouring tank the second principle is to reduce stiffness in areas with compressive stresses only a parametric study varying the degree of stiffness reductions and type of material coefficient is carried out for each principle the results show that the reduced stiffness properties leads to significant nominal stress redistribution leading to reduced transverse stresses this is most clearly seen for the thinnest outer bottom the reduced stiffness properties is implemented using the orthotropic material two rule load cases are analysed corresponding to loads at a 10 4 level applying on the midship model 1 1 analysed conditions the design of the analysed bulk carrier vessel is single hull double bottom arrangements with hoppers at the upper and lower corners to the midship section shown in fig 1 and table 1 presents it s the dimensions of longitudinal stiffeners structure is transversely framed and longitudinally stiffened each hold is accessed through a large hatch that is closed watertight with a hatch cover transverse bulkheads are typically corrugated with upper and lower stools that mimic the hoppers while the longitudinal structure provides the vessel with its resistance to global bending moments loads it is the transverse bulkheads that will experience the localized loading of the static weight of cargo or any sloshing loads associated with ballast or accidental flooding the loading conditions are analysed in accordance with dnvgl classification notes no 31 1 2012 two conditions are chosen as the governing load cases for the double bottom and shown in fig 2 lc1 gives compression in inner bottom and tension in outer bottom while lc2 gives compression in outer bottom and tension in inner bottom and deformation plot is shown in fig 3 1 2 reduced stiffness the purpose of current study is to evaluate the effect of changing membrane stiffness of the inner and outer bottom plating relative to the linear isotropic stiffness values used in standard fe analysis the arguments for reducing the linear membrane stiffness values is that it has been documented by non linear fe analysis and simplified code buckling models that the in plane membrane stiffness is significantly reduced due to initial buckles tolerances additional reductions are observed in areas experiencing compressive loading due to buckling a stiffened panel can be considered to have orthotropic membrane stiffness relations the stiffness matrix is symmetric and have four independent coefficients c11 c22 c12 and c33 these coefficients contain both the structural i e the stiffeners and plate orthotropy and material properties n 1 n 2 n 3 c 11 c 12 0 c 21 c 22 0 0 0 c 33 ε 1 ε 2 ε 3 here the n s represent forces per unit width and εi s represent the strains this is the most general description of a panel as illustrated in fig 4 however in linear fe models of the coarseness used in mid ship models the stiffeners and plates are modelled separately using 4 noded plate elements this means that the stiffness of the plating must be changed between the stiffeners separately and the format of the orthotropic plate stiffness matrix is then σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 c 11 c 12 0 c 21 c 22 0 0 0 c 33 ε 1 ε 2 ε 3 here σ1 σ2 and σ3 are the axial transverse and shear membrane stress respectively the corresponding stresses are sigmax sigmay sigmaxy and the orthotropic stiffness matrix is d 11 d 12 0 d 21 d 22 0 0 0 d 33 for stiffened panels typical for steel ships it was shown by non linear advance abaqus analysis and local panel strength that it is the buckling of the plate elements between stiffeners and girders that are the main cause to the large stiffness reductions moreover it was shown that the stiffness reductions of plates will be different in the different local load directions in particular it was documented that the transverse membrane stiffness c22 transverse to the stiffener direction is significantly reduced and the poisson effect term c12 c21 is significantly reduced compared to the linear isotropic value the axial membrane stiffness c11 in the stiffener direction is more marginally affected from buckling and the shear stiffness c33 is almost unchanged compared to the linear values these facts makes it necessary to use the orthotropic material option and not the standard isotropic material description e ν the present study then manipulates the material coefficients dij to also include non linear buckling effects and the coefficients have been varied systematically in order to study the separate effects of transverse c22 effect the poisson effect c12 and the combined effect by varying both coefficients simultaneously 1 3 linear elastic coefficients for isotropic material using the linear coefficients given below should give the same results as for the direct application of isotropic material modelling e and ν linear elastic isotropic material coefficients hooke s law for isotropic material are given in the orthotropic form as d 11 e 1 ν 2 d 12 e ν 1 ν 2 d 21 d 22 e 1 ν 2 d 33 e 2 1 ν a stress analysis was carried using these coefficients and it gave exactly the same results as for isotropic material description 1 4 reduced stiffness for orthotropic material orthotropic materials have three planes axes of symmetry an isotropic material in contrast has the same properties in every direction it can be proved that a material having two planes of symmetry must have a third one isotropic materials have an infinite number of planes of symmetry modified orthotropic stiffness coefficients accounting for reduced transverse stiffness c22 and reduced coupled stiffness c21 due to out of flatness and buckling effects d 11 e 1 ν 2 c 11 c 11 axial stiffness reduction factor d 12 e ν 1 ν 2 c 21 d 21 c 21 poisson effect stiffness reduction factor d 22 e 1 ν 2 c 22 c 22 transverse stiffness reduction factor d 33 e 2 1 ν c 33 c 33 shear stiffness reduction factor here the cij coefficients represent the relative stiffness reduction compared to the linear elastic value c11 and c22 is always kept equal to unity while c22 and c12 is reduced systematically both separately and combined for illustration of the drop of the stiffness coefficients due to the applied loading the dnvgl buckling code was run for the outer bottom panel between longitudinal and transverse frames in the region with 16 mm plating thickness the stiffness results are shown in fig 4 this figure illustrates the tangent stiffness properties at ultimate strength as function of the angle in the nominal stress space σ1 σ2 angle arctan σ1 σ2 the stiffness coefficients will start with the initial values at zero load and gradually converge towards the values given in fig 4 for increasing loading the most important information given in fig 5 is that it is seen that c22 and c12 that have a significant drop relative to their linear values while the other coefficients are marginally changed fig 5 gives then the stiffness reductions as function of the ratio between compression and tension stresses as follows 0 90 σx and σy are compression stresses 90 180 σx is tension stress while σy is compression stress 180 270 σx and σy are compression stresses 270 360 σx is compression stress while σy is tension stress as shown in fig 5 the transverse tangent stiffness reduction factor c22 green curve is below 0 4 at ultimate load if the transverse stresses are in compression the coupled stiffness reduction factor c21 pink curve is almost equal to zero in the same area based on the extreme values given by in fig 5 the fe model of a cargo hold model shown in fig 6 were analysed for varying stiffness reduction factors c21 and c22 varying from values found for zero load up to ultimate strength values two separate principles was used i stiffness reductions in the whole inner and outer bottom plate runs 2 3 5 in table 2 as below ii stiffness reduction only in compressed parts of inner and outer bottom plate run 4 in table 2 as below 2 fe model description the analysis has been carried out using the general purpose finite element program system dnvgl sesam 2009 that incorporates several program modules nauticus hull 2010 is dnvgl software package for strength assessment of hull structures it offers for efficient hull design and verification according to dnvgl rules 2018 and iacs common structural rules for bulk carriers and oil tankers csr bc ot available in different configurations from prescriptive rule check package to advanced systems for wave load and finite element analyses sesam is a complete strength assessment programme for engineering of ships that is based on the finite element methodology this software package has various modules which can be used depending on the type numerical simulation that is required to be carried out for the current study of bulk carrier vessel the following modules used that has been selected the modules relevant for this analysis are pre processing program prefem presel analysis program sestra post processing programs submod prepost and postfem 2 1 sestra sestra is a program for linear static and dynamic structural analysis within the sesam program system it uses a displacement based finite element method sestra computes the local element matrices and load vectors assembles them into global matrices andload vectors the global matrices are used by algebraic numerical algorithms to do the requested static dynamic or linearized buckling analysis 2 2 submod the dnvgl 2016 submod programme allows a part of a global model to be re analysed to produce more accurate results for the local model separated from the global model the displacements from global model analysis applied as prescribed displacements at the boundary 2 3 postresp postresp is an interactive graphic postprocessor for processing and presentation of responses in terms of transfer functions in the frequency domain the transfer functions are usually generated by one of the hydrodynamic analysis programs in sesam but they may also be transfer functions for any other kind of response 2 4 prefem presel prefem presel is sesam s tool for assembling superelements to form the complete model a superelement is basically a finite element fe model of a part of the complete structure the sesam preprocessors genie and patran pre are used for creating first level superelements i e part models comprised of finite elements like beams shells etc presel puts these parts together to form superelement assemblies first level superelements are typically assembled to form second level superelement assemblies these are in turn assembled to form third level superelement assemblies and so on until the complete model and the top level super element assembly is formed sestra is the main module for linear static and dynamic analysis input data to sestra is read from the interface files from prefem which are the pre processors for modelling the geometry and loads output from sestra is then processed in prepost which builds a database of the result file sestra was also used to run a data check of the prefem geometry files which include calculation of the different loading conditions in order to check if loads were applied correctly finally postfem was employed in the post processing of the result database from prepost the program system may utilise the multilevel super element technique of the finite element method this technique makes it possible to divide large and complex structural models into smaller manageable parts or super elements which can be assembled to form the complete model only the first level super elements are composed of basic elements or finite elements 3 geometrical model the global model is presented in fig 6 the areas that are analysed and checked against buckling are shown in fig 7 web frame 173 is the middle frame in the middle tank 4 element types the performance of the model is closely linked to the type shape and aspect ratio of elements and the mesh topology that is used the mesh applied here is adequate for representing the cargo hold model and frame and girder model mesh size is based on 4 noded shell or membrane elements in combination with 2 noded beam or truss elements are used in general the mesh size should be decided on the basis of proper stiffness representation and load distribution of tank and sea pressure on shell or membrane elements there are minimum three elements over the height of girders the mesh should in general and as far as practical follow the stiffener system on the girder one two or three elements between transverse girders by using three elements it normally matches with the mainframes local stiffener bending is included in the results one element between longitudinals this contributes to a correct load transfer from the longitudinal to the transverse frame inside hopper tank top wing areas and wing tanks the mesh are normally limited by the longitudinals in surrounding structure the mesh should follow the stiffener system on transverse girder webs as far as practicable the mesh should be fine enough to represent the shape of large openings in the web frame inside the hopper tank one element or more on each web and flange on the corrugations in corrugated bulkheads two elements might also be suggested this is satisfactory for determining the stress level in the bulkhead longitudinals and other continuous stiffeners are included in the model these are represented by 2 noded eccentric beam elements curved flanges are represented with their true effectivity in the model the local model is built up using a combination of shell and beam elements 4 node and 3 node shell elements are used to represent plates girders and frames while 2 node beam elements are used to define profile flanges a description of the 4 node shell element is presented in fig 8 5 boundary conditions all lines at the centreline have been given boundary conditions to represent symmetrical conditions the transverse bulkheads are connected to springs at the shipside both ends are fixed in x direction rotation about y axis and rotation about z axis the units and basic material data are given in table 3 6 assumptions and simplifications used in the fe models some assumptions and simplifications have been conducted regarding the modelling compared to the real structure with all its details the simplifications have negligible or conservative effect on the results presented in this study the simplifications made are described as below 1 the changes in plate thickness and stiffener size are modelled at the nearest geometry lines which do not always represent the actual position of the lines at which the dimensions change 2 secondary buckling stiffeners and tripping brackets are neglected 3 small openings which are structural unimportant have been neglected 4 the brackets at the intersection between longitudinal stiffeners and transverse plates are neglected 7 capacity check outer bottom the transverse compression stresses drops with decreasing plate stiffness as illustrated in figs 9 and 10 it is noted that if the transverse stiffness c22 is reduced and the coupled stiffness c21 is equal to 1 and the longitudinal stress will increase in compressed area only minor effects of the longitudinal stresses will be found in tension but the transverse stresses will be reduced also in tension fig 11 shows capacity curves and stress check for outer bottom in lc2 first quadrant only there is a small variation between the stresses in test case 4 and 5 in the compressed area this is because the stiffness factors are equal in compressed material in double bottom there is more difference in the material in tension as expected in the figures of both a preliminary uncalibrated version of the new proposed code buckling criterion is included together with the dnvgl ship rules 2018 for biaxial buckling and numerical results using advance abaqus it is remarked that the biaxial buckling curve of the ship rules do not include the overall lateral panel buckling for the outer bottom plating 16 mm the advance results predicts more strength than the dnvgl ship rules 2018 reduced stiffening modelling results in smaller stresses in the plating especially in the transverse direction depending on the level of stiffness reduction the applied nominal stresses will move from the unsafe side of the uls buckling boundary to the safe side inner bottom fig 12 shows capacity curves and stress check for inner bottom with varying stiffness reduction factors c21 and c22 in inner and inner bottom lc1 as shown in fig 13 in the figures both a preliminary uncalibrated version of the new proposed code buckling criterion is included together with the dnvgl ship rules 2018 for biaxial buckling and numerical results using advance abaqus it is remarked that the biaxial buckling curve of the ship rules do not include the overall lateral panel buckling for the inner bottom plating 22 mm this has the effect that dnvgl ship rules 2018 predict more strength than advance results reduced stiffness modelling results in smaller stresses in the plating especially in the transverse direction since the plating here is relatively thick the reduced stiffness modelling do not influence the strength assessment since the linear applied nominal stresses without stiffness reductions already is on the safe side of the uls buckling boundary 8 girders in double bottom it has been shown that the calculated stresses in the inner and outer bottom have decreased if the stiffness is reduced this section presents how this will infect the stresses and deformations in the longitudinal and transverse girders longitudinal girder nominal stresses of inner bottom for different stiffness reduction factors are presented in table 5 and the stresses are given in table 6 are average stresses above the girder height and frame length stresses given in table 7 are average stresses above the girder height taken were the von mises stresses are at the maximum value a reduction of the stiffness in the inner and outer plate from c21 c22 1 0 to c21 0 0 and c22 0 6 will increase the bending moment in the longitudinal girders a minor increase of the shear stresses can also be seen web frame stresses given in table 8 are average stresses above the web height and between two longitudinal girders stresses given in table 9 are average stresses above the web height taken were the von mises stresses are at the maximum value a reduction of the stiffness in the inner and outer plate from c21 c22 1 0 to c21 0 0 and c22 0 6 will give a minor increase of the bending moment in the web frames in double bottom a minor increase of the shear stresses can also be seen table 10 presents deformation of web frame 173 in cl for varying plate stiffness 9 conclusions present study addresses reduced stiffness parameters for elastically deformed buckled plates these properties are meant for application on the vessel hull level using linear finite element model with appropriate meshing the aim with such applications is to improve the assessment of the nominal stress flow in bulk carrier vessel hulls accepting that elastic buckling deflections occurs in local areas with high compressive stresses and thin plating when buckling elastically say typically between stiffeners plates behave like an isotropic material physically this means that the change of in place stiffness due to elastic buckling can be very different in the axial transverse and shear direction these features are important for proper handling of redistribution of stresses between stiffened panels and surrounding structures and the option of isotropic orthotropic material models in standard linear fe tools can be employed for coping this effect the reduced stiffness principle have been applied to the double bottom structure of a bulk carrier the reduced stiffness principle considers the effect of initial buckles tolerances and buckling behaviour of plating in an overall sense leading to a global redistribution of nominal stresses in the double bottom a parametric study have been carried out by systematically varying the most important stiffness parameters c22 and c12 the reduced stiffness principles lead to significant transverse stress reductions of the order of 30 40 for the double bottom the stress redistribution leads to marginally higher shear stresses in the inner and outer bottom plating and some higher bending stresses in the longitudinally girders double bottoms of the present type is very torsional stiff and the reduction in transverse bending stiffness is not critical as long as the torsional stiffness is unchanged the capacity of the double bottom has also been checked with respect to present ship buckling criterion new buckling code proposal and non linear advance abaqus results the buckling check do not include the hull girder bending stresses and is thus not complete moreover the buckling code and advance results represent an ultimate strength state of the panel and the dnvgl curves plotted is for acceptable usage factor equal to unity the loads are also pure ship rule conditions with loads at a 10 4 level which means that they do not represent any extreme condition strictly they should not be measured against uls capacity of the panels however the motivation for the present study was to test out the possibilities of orthotropic material modelling to include buckling effects of the double bottom it was shown that the principles of the method work and that the transverse stress component is significantly reduced in areas where the plating is most prone to buckling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

stage of ship using fem a general bulk carrier was selected as the target ship both the shape of the bottom structure and the size of plate thickness of the bulk carrier were taken as design variable simultaneously for a weight minimal optimization problem five geometric dimensions and thirty one plate thicknesses were taken as the design variables for the shape and the size of the bottom structure respectively the yield stress for all elements of the three hold fem model and the buckling stress for the selected stiffened panels were evaluated as the constraint conditions the selected stiffened panels were on the bottom plate the inner bottom plate the girder plate the floor plate and the bilge hopper plate it was shown that the structural optimization with the design variables for the shape and size of the bottom structure can reduce the weight of ship structure and satisfy the constraint conditions effectively piscopo and scamardella 2020 concentrated on ultimate strength evaluation of intact and pitted uniaxial and biaxial compression platings to produce a common formulation that could be applied both in design phase of new vessels and in the evaluation methods of aged structures a large number of fe computations were carried out using ansys tool current formulas in harmonized standard structural rules for bulk carrier vessels were compared with the additional finite element analysis findings available in the literature and the design equations new uniaxial and biaxial compression equations in addition to the two step pitting corrosion wastage technique prove to be efficient for practical design purposes based on the findings xu et al 2015 assessed the degree to which a bulk carrier sinks when vessel was exposed to extreme wave loadings a hydro elastoplasticity hypothesis was suggested and relationship between broad elasto plastic deformation and wave load assessment was implemented to vessel s structure on premise that a plastic hinge was created in the mid ship area when hull girder collapsed under intense wave conditions a prediction of the degree of collapse was made using the hydro elastoplasticity method for a bulk carrier vessel that was exposed to an intense wave load the analysis revealed to what degree the hull girder could collapse in several short term sea states under extreme wave conditions at an excess probability of 1 1000 in order to examine the influence of local bending of double bottom on the ultimate hull girder strength pei et al 2012 performed a series of nonlinear calculation applying three different methods the first method is smith s method using in house code hullst to evaluate ultimate hull girder strength under pure bending the second was the application of new system recently developed by the authors this method was a combination of load motion analysis and progressive collapse analysis the third was nonlinear fem analysis using a commercial code msc marc it was found that bending deformation was produced not only in double bottom but also in bilge hopper tank and the ultimate hull girder strength was reduced by roughly 20 due to this local bending kim et al 2015 investigated various types of industry corrosion addition practices with regard to the ultimate strength performance of bulk carriers five types of corrosion additions namely previously applied structural design rule csr common structural rule harmonized csr time dependent corrosion wastage model four types of bulk carrier structures namely 37 k handysize 57 k supramax 82 k kamsarmax and 181 k capesize were studied the ultimate strength performance of hull girders and stiffened panels was examined through various corrosion additions used in industrial practices zheng and zhang 2012 performed the direct strength calculation of a 87000t bulk carrier in accordance with common structural rules for bulk carriers taking heavy ballast tank as an example this work elaborated the calculation process of the ship by initially obtaining the structure dimensions according to regulations then the compartment finite element model was generated for direct calculation the structure components that fail to meet the requirements were modified consequently the components dimensions that can satisfy the regulation were obtained hu et al 2001 analysed the ultimate longitudinal strength of a typical bulk carrier by using a simplified method the moment curvature curve the ultimate bending moment and the location of the instantaneous neutral axis at ultimate state were calculated for both hogging and sagging conditions of the ship under vertical bending the stress distribution over the hull cross section at ultimate state was also obtained the ultimate strength of the ship hull under combined vertical and horizontal bending moments was further investigated an interaction curve was obtained according to the results of a series of calculation for the hull subjected to bending conditions with different angles of curvature it was found that the interaction curve is asymmetrical because the hull cross section is not symmetrical about the horizontal axis and the behavior of the structural members under compression is different from that under tension due to the non linearity caused by buckling huang et al 2006 performed a research to evaluate the strength of a double hull bulk carrier structure and its optimum hull weight the midsection of a double hull bulk carrier was optimized using the evolutionary computation and the shear stress of a single hull and double hull structure was calculated respectively using the method of shear flow the result indicates that the weight of a double hull bulk carrier can be reduced to a reasonable amount in comparison with existing single hull types and the shear stresses of the side shell top and hopper tank are decreased significantly by using a double hull structure kitarović et al 2015 analysed a bulk carrier hull girder s ultimate strength in its mid ship section as determined by a progressive incremental iterative collapse analysis methodology suggested by iacs standard structural rules for bulk carriers in addition to initially prescribed load end shortening curves non linear finite element fe analysis curves were taken into account as well findings from both sets of curves were compared and discussed at both local and global levels for both hogging and sagging conditions servis et al 2003 developed a modelling procedure for bulk carrier vessels by means of finite element method to analyze structural integrity of these regions subject to loads described in the iacs it also recorded findings by using iacs loads from extensive nonlinear simulations shu and moan 2012 presented the ultimate strength of a capesize bulk carrier hull girder under combined global and local loads in the hogging and ahl condition is extensively and systematically investigated using nonlinear finite element fe analysis with abaqus software based on the results obtained by nonlinear fe analyses a practical interaction equation was established between global hogging bending capacity and average external sea pressure over the bottom özgüç and barltrop 2008 used a simplified method based on an incremental iterative approach to evaluate overall strength of a typical bulk carrier vessel s hull girder in the first position the vertical bending moment was investigated by seven different techniques the instant versus the curvature curvatures were calculated in both hogging and sagging cases and the values of the ultimate longitudinal moments at collapse second under the combined moment of vertical and horizontal bending the total force was accounted for in bending conditions with different curvature angles an interaction curve was obtained which corresponds to the results of the simulation series for the ship hull the interaction curve has been found to be asymmetrical since the hull cross section is not symmetrical with respect to the horizontal axis and the structural reaction of the compressed elements is different from the compressed elements due to nonlinearity induced by buckling mode shu and moan 2010 used nonlinear finite element analysis with abaqus tool to measure a capesize bulk carrier vessel s ultimate hull girder strength under combined global and local hogging and alternate load condition ahl loads a three cargo fe model with a fine mesh at the middle cargo hold was developed for non linear finite element study initial geometric imperfections had been implemented within middle cargo hold s double bottom the fe model had accounted for both material and geometric nonlinearities the most critical situation for the longitudinal force assessment of bulk carriers in hogging is the ahl position with an empty middle cargo hold subject to combined global and local loads the local loads such as external sea pressure and internal cargo pressure were applied according to normal structural rules for bulk carriers csr bc in hogging condition for heavy cargo ahl ultimate strength of hull girder with various local pressure load levels was examined it was drawn that ultimate strength of the hull girder due to action of local pressure loads could be considerably reduced compared to obtained with pure hogging bending bulk carriers were associated with high structural failure and foundation risks as well as severe human life loss roberts et al 2013 employed lloyd s accident records to analyze the degree to which dry bulk shipping has occurred over past 30 years and identified shipping factors with respect to risks of setting up bulk carriers and personnel casualties in recent years andric et al 2020 created the octopus csr design tool that was employed for structural design of the bulk carrier vessels designed in croatia and accordingly presented main achievements of preliminary design process the tools and techniques developed allow the structural engineering team so as to optimize structural designs whereas meeting csr s structural safety requirements the target of this study is to address how stiffness reductions in the inner bottom plate and outer bottom plate affected the global redistribution of nominal stresses in double bottom hull of a bulk carrier vessel the redistribution effect is then studied in relation to buckling capacity of double bottom two different principles of stiffness reductions are carried out the first included reduced stiffness in the whole inner and outer bottom plate in the centre tank and neighbouring tank the second principle is to reduce stiffness in areas with compressive stresses only a parametric study varying the degree of stiffness reductions and type of material coefficient is carried out for each principle the results show that the reduced stiffness properties leads to significant nominal stress redistribution leading to reduced transverse stresses this is most clearly seen for the thinnest outer bottom the reduced stiffness properties is implemented using the orthotropic material two rule load cases are analysed corresponding to loads at a 10 4 level applying on the midship model 1 1 analysed conditions the design of the analysed bulk carrier vessel is single hull double bottom arrangements with hoppers at the upper and lower corners to the midship section shown in fig 1 and table 1 presents it s the dimensions of longitudinal stiffeners structure is transversely framed and longitudinally stiffened each hold is accessed through a large hatch that is closed watertight with a hatch cover transverse bulkheads are typically corrugated with upper and lower stools that mimic the hoppers while the longitudinal structure provides the vessel with its resistance to global bending moments loads it is the transverse bulkheads that will experience the localized loading of the static weight of cargo or any sloshing loads associated with ballast or accidental flooding the loading conditions are analysed in accordance with dnvgl classification notes no 31 1 2012 two conditions are chosen as the governing load cases for the double bottom and shown in fig 2 lc1 gives compression in inner bottom and tension in outer bottom while lc2 gives compression in outer bottom and tension in inner bottom and deformation plot is shown in fig 3 1 2 reduced stiffness the purpose of current study is to evaluate the effect of changing membrane stiffness of the inner and outer bottom plating relative to the linear isotropic stiffness values used in standard fe analysis the arguments for reducing the linear membrane stiffness values is that it has been documented by non linear fe analysis and simplified code buckling models that the in plane membrane stiffness is significantly reduced due to initial buckles tolerances additional reductions are observed in areas experiencing compressive loading due to buckling a stiffened panel can be considered to have orthotropic membrane stiffness relations the stiffness matrix is symmetric and have four independent coefficients c11 c22 c12 and c33 these coefficients contain both the structural i e the stiffeners and plate orthotropy and material properties n 1 n 2 n 3 c 11 c 12 0 c 21 c 22 0 0 0 c 33 ε 1 ε 2 ε 3 here the n s represent forces per unit width and εi s represent the strains this is the most general description of a panel as illustrated in fig 4 however in linear fe models of the coarseness used in mid ship models the stiffeners and plates are modelled separately using 4 noded plate elements this means that the stiffness of the plating must be changed between the stiffeners separately and the format of the orthotropic plate stiffness matrix is then σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 c 11 c 12 0 c 21 c 22 0 0 0 c 33 ε 1 ε 2 ε 3 here σ1 σ2 and σ3 are the axial transverse and shear membrane stress respectively the corresponding stresses are sigmax sigmay sigmaxy and the orthotropic stiffness matrix is d 11 d 12 0 d 21 d 22 0 0 0 d 33 for stiffened panels typical for steel ships it was shown by non linear advance abaqus analysis and local panel strength that it is the buckling of the plate elements between stiffeners and girders that are the main cause to the large stiffness reductions moreover it was shown that the stiffness reductions of plates will be different in the different local load directions in particular it was documented that the transverse membrane stiffness c22 transverse to the stiffener direction is significantly reduced and the poisson effect term c12 c21 is significantly reduced compared to the linear isotropic value the axial membrane stiffness c11 in the stiffener direction is more marginally affected from buckling and the shear stiffness c33 is almost unchanged compared to the linear values these facts makes it necessary to use the orthotropic material option and not the standard isotropic material description e ν the present study then manipulates the material coefficients dij to also include non linear buckling effects and the coefficients have been varied systematically in order to study the separate effects of transverse c22 effect the poisson effect c12 and the combined effect by varying both coefficients simultaneously 1 3 linear elastic coefficients for isotropic material using the linear coefficients given below should give the same results as for the direct application of isotropic material modelling e and ν linear elastic isotropic material coefficients hooke s law for isotropic material are given in the orthotropic form as d 11 e 1 ν 2 d 12 e ν 1 ν 2 d 21 d 22 e 1 ν 2 d 33 e 2 1 ν a stress analysis was carried using these coefficients and it gave exactly the same results as for isotropic material description 1 4 reduced stiffness for orthotropic material orthotropic materials have three planes axes of symmetry an isotropic material in contrast has the same properties in every direction it can be proved that a material having two planes of symmetry must have a third one isotropic materials have an infinite number of planes of symmetry modified orthotropic stiffness coefficients accounting for reduced transverse stiffness c22 and reduced coupled stiffness c21 due to out of flatness and buckling effects d 11 e 1 ν 2 c 11 c 11 axial stiffness reduction factor d 12 e ν 1 ν 2 c 21 d 21 c 21 poisson effect stiffness reduction factor d 22 e 1 ν 2 c 22 c 22 transverse stiffness reduction factor d 33 e 2 1 ν c 33 c 33 shear stiffness reduction factor here the cij coefficients represent the relative stiffness reduction compared to the linear elastic value c11 and c22 is always kept equal to unity while c22 and c12 is reduced systematically both separately and combined for illustration of the drop of the stiffness coefficients due to the applied loading the dnvgl buckling code was run for the outer bottom panel between longitudinal and transverse frames in the region with 16 mm plating thickness the stiffness results are shown in fig 4 this figure illustrates the tangent stiffness properties at ultimate strength as function of the angle in the nominal stress space σ1 σ2 angle arctan σ1 σ2 the stiffness coefficients will start with the initial values at zero load and gradually converge towards the values given in fig 4 for increasing loading the most important information given in fig 5 is that it is seen that c22 and c12 that have a significant drop relative to their linear values while the other coefficients are marginally changed fig 5 gives then the stiffness reductions as function of the ratio between compression and tension stresses as follows 0 90 σx and σy are compression stresses 90 180 σx is tension stress while σy is compression stress 180 270 σx and σy are compression stresses 270 360 σx is compression stress while σy is tension stress as shown in fig 5 the transverse tangent stiffness reduction factor c22 green curve is below 0 4 at ultimate load if the transverse stresses are in compression the coupled stiffness reduction factor c21 pink curve is almost equal to zero in the same area based on the extreme values given by in fig 5 the fe model of a cargo hold model shown in fig 6 were analysed for varying stiffness reduction factors c21 and c22 varying from values found for zero load up to ultimate strength values two separate principles was used i stiffness reductions in the whole inner and outer bottom plate runs 2 3 5 in table 2 as below ii stiffness reduction only in compressed parts of inner and outer bottom plate run 4 in table 2 as below 2 fe model description the analysis has been carried out using the general purpose finite element program system dnvgl sesam 2009 that incorporates several program modules nauticus hull 2010 is dnvgl software package for strength assessment of hull structures it offers for efficient hull design and verification according to dnvgl rules 2018 and iacs common structural rules for bulk carriers and oil tankers csr bc ot available in different configurations from prescriptive rule check package to advanced systems for wave load and finite element analyses sesam is a complete strength assessment programme for engineering of ships that is based on the finite element methodology this software package has various modules which can be used depending on the type numerical simulation that is required to be carried out for the current study of bulk carrier vessel the following modules used that has been selected the modules relevant for this analysis are pre processing program prefem presel analysis program sestra post processing programs submod prepost and postfem 2 1 sestra sestra is a program for linear static and dynamic structural analysis within the sesam program system it uses a displacement based finite element method sestra computes the local element matrices and load vectors assembles them into global matrices andload vectors the global matrices are used by algebraic numerical algorithms to do the requested static dynamic or linearized buckling analysis 2 2 submod the dnvgl 2016 submod programme allows a part of a global model to be re analysed to produce more accurate results for the local model separated from the global model the displacements from global model analysis applied as prescribed displacements at the boundary 2 3 postresp postresp is an interactive graphic postprocessor for processing and presentation of responses in terms of transfer functions in the frequency domain the transfer functions are usually generated by one of the hydrodynamic analysis programs in sesam but they may also be transfer functions for any other kind of response 2 4 prefem presel prefem presel is sesam s tool for assembling superelements to form the complete model a superelement is basically a finite element fe model of a part of the complete structure the sesam preprocessors genie and patran pre are used for creating first level superelements i e part models comprised of finite elements like beams shells etc presel puts these parts together to form superelement assemblies first level superelements are typically assembled to form second level superelement assemblies these are in turn assembled to form third level superelement assemblies and so on until the complete model and the top level super element assembly is formed sestra is the main module for linear static and dynamic analysis input data to sestra is read from the interface files from prefem which are the pre processors for modelling the geometry and loads output from sestra is then processed in prepost which builds a database of the result file sestra was also used to run a data check of the prefem geometry files which include calculation of the different loading conditions in order to check if loads were applied correctly finally postfem was employed in the post processing of the result database from prepost the program system may utilise the multilevel super element technique of the finite element method this technique makes it possible to divide large and complex structural models into smaller manageable parts or super elements which can be assembled to form the complete model only the first level super elements are composed of basic elements or finite elements 3 geometrical model the global model is presented in fig 6 the areas that are analysed and checked against buckling are shown in fig 7 web frame 173 is the middle frame in the middle tank 4 element types the performance of the model is closely linked to the type shape and aspect ratio of elements and the mesh topology that is used the mesh applied here is adequate for representing the cargo hold model and frame and girder model mesh size is based on 4 noded shell or membrane elements in combination with 2 noded beam or truss elements are used in general the mesh size should be decided on the basis of proper stiffness representation and load distribution of tank and sea pressure on shell or membrane elements there are minimum three elements over the height of girders the mesh should in general and as far as practical follow the stiffener system on the girder one two or three elements between transverse girders by using three elements it normally matches with the mainframes local stiffener bending is included in the results one element between longitudinals this contributes to a correct load transfer from the longitudinal to the transverse frame inside hopper tank top wing areas and wing tanks the mesh are normally limited by the longitudinals in surrounding structure the mesh should follow the stiffener system on transverse girder webs as far as practicable the mesh should be fine enough to represent the shape of large openings in the web frame inside the hopper tank one element or more on each web and flange on the corrugations in corrugated bulkheads two elements might also be suggested this is satisfactory for determining the stress level in the bulkhead longitudinals and other continuous stiffeners are included in the model these are represented by 2 noded eccentric beam elements curved flanges are represented with their true effectivity in the model the local model is built up using a combination of shell and beam elements 4 node and 3 node shell elements are used to represent plates girders and frames while 2 node beam elements are used to define profile flanges a description of the 4 node shell element is presented in fig 8 5 boundary conditions all lines at the centreline have been given boundary conditions to represent symmetrical conditions the transverse bulkheads are connected to springs at the shipside both ends are fixed in x direction rotation about y axis and rotation about z axis the units and basic material data are given in table 3 6 assumptions and simplifications used in the fe models some assumptions and simplifications have been conducted regarding the modelling compared to the real structure with all its details the simplifications have negligible or conservative effect on the results presented in this study the simplifications made are described as below 1 the changes in plate thickness and stiffener size are modelled at the nearest geometry lines which do not always represent the actual position of the lines at which the dimensions change 2 secondary buckling stiffeners and tripping brackets are neglected 3 small openings which are structural unimportant have been neglected 4 the brackets at the intersection between longitudinal stiffeners and transverse plates are neglected 7 capacity check outer bottom the transverse compression stresses drops with decreasing plate stiffness as illustrated in figs 9 and 10 it is noted that if the transverse stiffness c22 is reduced and the coupled stiffness c21 is equal to 1 and the longitudinal stress will increase in compressed area only minor effects of the longitudinal stresses will be found in tension but the transverse stresses will be reduced also in tension fig 11 shows capacity curves and stress check for outer bottom in lc2 first quadrant only there is a small variation between the stresses in test case 4 and 5 in the compressed area this is because the stiffness factors are equal in compressed material in double bottom there is more difference in the material in tension as expected in the figures of both a preliminary uncalibrated version of the new proposed code buckling criterion is included together with the dnvgl ship rules 2018 for biaxial buckling and numerical results using advance abaqus it is remarked that the biaxial buckling curve of the ship rules do not include the overall lateral panel buckling for the outer bottom plating 16 mm the advance results predicts more strength than the dnvgl ship rules 2018 reduced stiffening modelling results in smaller stresses in the plating especially in the transverse direction depending on the level of stiffness reduction the applied nominal stresses will move from the unsafe side of the uls buckling boundary to the safe side inner bottom fig 12 shows capacity curves and stress check for inner bottom with varying stiffness reduction factors c21 and c22 in inner and inner bottom lc1 as shown in fig 13 in the figures both a preliminary uncalibrated version of the new proposed code buckling criterion is included together with the dnvgl ship rules 2018 for biaxial buckling and numerical results using advance abaqus it is remarked that the biaxial buckling curve of the ship rules do not include the overall lateral panel buckling for the inner bottom plating 22 mm this has the effect that dnvgl ship rules 2018 predict more strength than advance results reduced stiffness modelling results in smaller stresses in the plating especially in the transverse direction since the plating here is relatively thick the reduced stiffness modelling do not influence the strength assessment since the linear applied nominal stresses without stiffness reductions already is on the safe side of the uls buckling boundary 8 girders in double bottom it has been shown that the calculated stresses in the inner and outer bottom have decreased if the stiffness is reduced this section presents how this will infect the stresses and deformations in the longitudinal and transverse girders longitudinal girder nominal stresses of inner bottom for different stiffness reduction factors are presented in table 5 and the stresses are given in table 6 are average stresses above the girder height and frame length stresses given in table 7 are average stresses above the girder height taken were the von mises stresses are at the maximum value a reduction of the stiffness in the inner and outer plate from c21 c22 1 0 to c21 0 0 and c22 0 6 will increase the bending moment in the longitudinal girders a minor increase of the shear stresses can also be seen web frame stresses given in table 8 are average stresses above the web height and between two longitudinal girders stresses given in table 9 are average stresses above the web height taken were the von mises stresses are at the maximum value a reduction of the stiffness in the inner and outer plate from c21 c22 1 0 to c21 0 0 and c22 0 6 will give a minor increase of the bending moment in the web frames in double bottom a minor increase of the shear stresses can also be seen table 10 presents deformation of web frame 173 in cl for varying plate stiffness 9 conclusions present study addresses reduced stiffness parameters for elastically deformed buckled plates these properties are meant for application on the vessel hull level using linear finite element model with appropriate meshing the aim with such applications is to improve the assessment of the nominal stress flow in bulk carrier vessel hulls accepting that elastic buckling deflections occurs in local areas with high compressive stresses and thin plating when buckling elastically say typically between stiffeners plates behave like an isotropic material physically this means that the change of in place stiffness due to elastic buckling can be very different in the axial transverse and shear direction these features are important for proper handling of redistribution of stresses between stiffened panels and surrounding structures and the option of isotropic orthotropic material models in standard linear fe tools can be employed for coping this effect the reduced stiffness principle have been applied to the double bottom structure of a bulk carrier the reduced stiffness principle considers the effect of initial buckles tolerances and buckling behaviour of plating in an overall sense leading to a global redistribution of nominal stresses in the double bottom a parametric study have been carried out by systematically varying the most important stiffness parameters c22 and c12 the reduced stiffness principles lead to significant transverse stress reductions of the order of 30 40 for the double bottom the stress redistribution leads to marginally higher shear stresses in the inner and outer bottom plating and some higher bending stresses in the longitudinally girders double bottoms of the present type is very torsional stiff and the reduction in transverse bending stiffness is not critical as long as the torsional stiffness is unchanged the capacity of the double bottom has also been checked with respect to present ship buckling criterion new buckling code proposal and non linear advance abaqus results the buckling check do not include the hull girder bending stresses and is thus not complete moreover the buckling code and advance results represent an ultimate strength state of the panel and the dnvgl curves plotted is for acceptable usage factor equal to unity the loads are also pure ship rule conditions with loads at a 10 4 level which means that they do not represent any extreme condition strictly they should not be measured against uls capacity of the panels however the motivation for the present study was to test out the possibilities of orthotropic material modelling to include buckling effects of the double bottom it was shown that the principles of the method work and that the transverse stress component is significantly reduced in areas where the plating is most prone to buckling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
21472,the study of evacuation on offshore platforms under fire is significant but has received little attention by previous researchers the evacuation process from offshore platforms under three distinct visibilities 10 m 1 m 10 m 1 m is investigated by a group of experiments and questionnaires with 120 participants the group evacuation activities of the participants regarding the evacuation time movement speed typical behavior and route choice were recorded and studied by 48 cameras and wristbands with bluetooth positioning function we ignited smoke bombs often used in the fire drill to generate the smoke which had a little irritating smell but is safe for people we investigated the speed in running mode and walking fast mode and the speed of participants with walking fast without smoke we obtained fits well with the data that imo recommend in addition we found the speed of participants does not always decrease in the smoke environment sometimes it increases when people are well aware of the surroundings finally we study the relationship between personnel characteristics and evacuation behavior with the help of hypothesis testing the study will be helpful to the guidelines of imo to be revised in the future and develop efficient evacuation strategy to guide the evacuation under fire in offshore platforms keywords offshore platform fire evacuation evacuation performance experimental research 1 introduction the deepwater semi submersible platform is the main living place for offshore oil exploration workers which includes various parts for accommodation recreation and material replenishment once the fire occurs the environment of the platform can be extremely dangerous making it difficult for people to evacuate successfully according to the historical records the deadliest offshore accident was the piper alpha disaster in the north sea in 1988 which resulted in 167 deaths in 2010 a severe oil leak accident happened in the deepwater horizon oil platform which caused an explosion and 11 people died in the gulf of mexico under the impact of a series of events involving large number of fatalities and economic losses on platforms the safety of offshore platforms is highly valued by the international maritime organization imo and national oil companies recently in 2016 the maritime safety committee msc of imo adopted circular 1533 entitled revised guidelines on evacuation analysis for new and existing passenger ships imo 2007 which requires passenger rolling ships and other passenger ships constructed after january 1 2020 must make evacuation analysis in the early stage of design the guideline offers two distinct methods of analysis a simplified evacuation analysis and an advanced evacuation analysis imo 2016 both the imo methods are subject to restrictive assumptions and omissions the influence of fire smoke is not taken into consideration as a disaster with high risk and great destruction fire has an important significance in the safety assessment of crew in offshore platforms this study will discuss the characteristics and changes of crew s behavior under visually handicapped conditions due to smoke during the experimental study the rest of this paper is as follows section 2 presents related studies on evacuation analysis of offshore platforms and earlier research on evacuation behaviour in fire section 3 presents the design of the experiment including the scenarios with different visibility the distribution of participants and the method of data collection section 4 shows the analysis of experimental results the evacuation routes choice movement speed evacuation time and some typical behaviors such as small group behavior was studied with different visibility conditions section 5 mainly describes the survey results of the two questionnaires and a comparative analysis between the experimental results and the results of questionnaires finally section 6 presents the conclusions and future directions 2 related works in recent years more and more researchers are paying attention to the evacuation performance of workers in offshore platforms but the evacuation scenarios they studied are not related to fire scenes in addition with regard to those evacuations studies under fire it is mostly concentrated in terrestrial buildings in section 2 1 the evacuation behaviour studies of people under fire were mainly reviewed section 2 2 reviews research about the evacuation performance in offshore platforms 2 1 earlier research on evacuation behaviour in fire the impact of fire on the evacuation performance of people is mainly the influence of smoke purser 1988 not only high temperature smoke burns people s respiratory tract but also the toxic gas components in the smoke can paralyze people s nerves causing people to lose consciousness gradually purser 1988 in addition the smoke will reduce the visibility significantly jin 1989 and thus interfere with their route choices fridolf et al 2013 due to ethical restrictions it is not advisable for participants to experiment in a real fire environment with good repeatability and low expense many pedestrian evacuation simulation models have been developed such as the social force model helbing and molnar 1995 the cellular automaton model burstedde et al 2001 which have become the main method for researchers to study the evacuation of people under fire and smoke zheng zheng et al 2017 proposes an extended floor field ff model to study the pedestrian evacuation dynamics with the influence of the fire and the smoke spreading in his model the vertical and horizontal propagation of smoke and the walking posture of bending and crawling are considered nguyen hung et al 2013 integrated the smoke effect and blind evacuation strategy within fire evacuation the simulation results were supported by empirical data from the metro supermarket bae bae and ryou 2015 developed a smoke effect model for representing the psychological pressure experienced when the evacuees are confronted with smoke or they move through the smoke the simulation analysis of models zheng 2011 shi and lee 2018 which lack accurate comparisons with experimental data is difficult to be used widely there are few experimental studies on fire evacuation with the limitations of ethics and experimental conditions the experiments cannot fully reproduce the impact of smoke on human evacuation such as the effects of high temperature and poisonous gas that the smoke produces purser 1988 so they mainly focus on the evacuation performance of people under visually handicapped conditions jeon jeon and hong 2009 conducted a personal evacuation experiment on 103 people in the underground four floors of the subway station to study the personal evacuation speed evacuation time and evacuation route choice in a limited visibility environment and found that the moving speed increased only when the phosphorescent sign was installed at intervals smaller than a person s step margrethe kobes kobes et al 2010 made a personal evacuation experiment on 103 people in the hotel to study the impact of personality characteristics and educational background on the evacuation path in addition it was found that the evacuation sign placed at a higher position was more effective under the smoke situation jeon jeon et al 2011 studied the consequences of evacuation experiments of 125 people and analyzed the personal evacuation time speed and evacuation route choices of people under four different visibility levels in underground shopping malls these experiments are mainly concentrated on individual evacuation experiments but the reality is that evacuation scenarios are often evacuated by many people and each person s evacuation speed and route choice can be affected by others isobe 2004 at present there are few experiments studies on the interaction of evacuation between many people under poor visibility xie zhang et al 2018 conducted an evacuation experiment on 75 people in a five story office building to study the speed and route choices of small groups on horizontal ground and stairs in three distinct visibility levels song s experiments cao et al 2018 found some typical behaviors such as helping behaviors and following behaviors in poor visibility by letting staff in the supermarket wearing low transmission glass until now we have not found the relevant experimental research about the evacuation of offshore platforms in fire that have been published the evacuation performance is linked to the layout of the building the type of terrain and the characteristics of people compared with the building structure on the land the cabin on the offshore platform is compactly arranged the route choice can be more complex and evacuation passages such as corridors and stairs are narrower and sharper in addition the crew on the platform is well trained so that their evacuation behavior will be different from other people 2 2 research on evacuation in offshore platforms researchers mainly study the evacuation of offshore platform by computer simulation tan et al 2017 the safety at sea company launched the shipwreck evacuation simulation system based on the discrete stochastic model namely evi vassalos et al 2003 additional software for ship evacuation includes maritime exodus galea et al 2014 and aeneas valanto 2006 cheng cheng et al 2017 develops a simulation model for offshore platforms to evaluate different evacuation intends to improve evacuation performance by integrating building information modeling bim technology and agent based model wang cai et al 2013 proposed an improved dynamic bayesian network dbn model by integrating markov model with bayesian network to predict the dynamic probability of offshore platform fire ginnis ginnis et al 2010 developed a multi user virtual reality vr system to support designers to assess passenger and crew activities on a ship for both normal and hectic conditions of operations there are very few experiments on the evacuation in real offshore platforms or ships some institutes such as katuhara the national maritime research institute of japan katsuhara et al 1999 brumley brumley and koss 2000 the maritime engineering cooperation research center of australian and the korean maritime university mechanical and eng 2013 have done researches on the movement behavior of people on a real ship and achieved the walking speed data of people of different ages in different types of channel structures during the berthing and navigation the main focus of their researches is to achieve the data of the walking speed of ships in separate floating and shaking situations without any fire situations involved the international maritime organization imo guidelines also recommend the maximum and minimum of travel speeds for different people in different types of channel structures galea et al 2014 without fire they didn t explicitly consider the effects of fire products listing or flooding on evacuation at all all of which are taken into account by the use of a safety factor however fire is the most devastating disaster with the high probability of occurrence in the platform pallardy 2010 studying the evacuation performance in the fire environment will play a major role in the accessibility and safety of the platform for accommodation this study is to analyze the evacuation performance of the crew in platforms under the influence of smoke with a series of experiments which will have a very significant meaning in the evacuation studies of the offshore platform under fire and can help the revision of evacuation guidelines 3 evacuation experiment 3 1 selected objects the experiment was conducted in a real offshore platform under construction in qidong city jiangsu province of china the offshore platform has seven decks among them the lower deck mezzanine deck and main deck mainly include recreation area fitness area dining area and also have the accommodation area that only occupy a small fraction in addition some engine rooms for energy supply with a high risk of fire are also included a and b deck are the main accommodation areas for platform workers and on c deck and d deck there are a small number of rooms including the control room and the engine room due to the large size of the entire offshore platform and the limited budget and number of participants for the experiments we chose some part areas of four decks to do the experiments which are mezzanine deck main deck a deck and b deck as shown in fig 1 considering that those area are where the crowds are mainly concentrated when the fire occurs 3 2 participants the participants in the experiment were all workers of the platform and very familiar with the evacuation routes of the platform there are 120 people in total only four of them are women and the others are men the average age of participants was 32 years with an average height of 173 3 cm and an average shoulder width of 48 cm as shown in figs 2 4 in this experiment the workers wore helmets work uniforms and special work shoes on the head of which a piece of iron was placed to protect the feet from injury so that it is heavier than normal shoes in addition because this experiment involved the smoke scenarios we provided each person with a cotton mask which can effectively block airborne microorganisms and particles from entering the nasal cavity of people as shown in fig 5 3 3 scenarios to investigate the influence of smoke conditions and layout of platform on the fire response performance of platform workers the research consists of experiments carried out under three different scenarios the first scenario is a situation without smoke in scenario 1 we try to let people distribute in the areas which people often gather and easily cause congestion when an emergency occurs so we have 80 persons on mezzanine deck 50 of which are in the cinema and 30 in the cabins there are also 20 persons and 20 persons respectively in the cabins on a deck and b deck the participants mainly distributed in areas like cabins cinema where people can easily gather the distribution of the experimental participants in detail is shown in table 1 below the second scenario happens with the smoke density changed fig 6 shows the propagation of smoke throughout the platform during the non working days most of the platform workers like to stay in the recreation areas and cabins for rest in mezzanine deck the coffee lounge is surrounded by cinemas dining rooms and cabins which can be a typical crowded and dangerous areas once the fire occurs so we chose the coffee lounge to be the smoke situation as shown in fig 1 regarding the choice of the smoke simulator in the previous experimental study some researchers like fridolf fridolf et al 2013 selected the smoke machines with generating uniform smoke while jeon jeon et al 2011 and cao cao et al 2018 use the plastic glasses with low light transmittance to simulate the visual obscuration by smoke although the method can control the visibility of smoke well the phenomenon of smoke stratification won t occur and it has no irritating effect on human breathing which can affect the walking posture zheng et al 2017 and speed of people so we chose to use smoke bombs often used in the fire drill as shown in fig 7 when the smoke bombs are ignited they will produce the smoke layer which is similar to the smoke generation and movement in real fire with the height gradually decreased in addition it will also have a little irritating smell but it is safe and doesn t contain toxic ingredients in scenario 2 when the height of the smoke layer at the entrance of the cinema drops to 2 m the height of the door the evacuation experiment begins with the alarm sound released by the electronic alarm system of the platform in each scenario during the entire evacuation process the visibility that can identify the luminaries like exit sign with fluorescent and objects gradually changes from more than 10 m at the beginning to about 1 m in the final fig 8 shows the process of the smoke propagation near the exit of coffee lounge in mezzanine deck the scenario 3 is also with smoke whose visibility is less than 1 m we continue to ignite the smoke bombs in the coffee lounge until the smoke layer fell to the ground with smoke filled the entire lounge in which the visibility is less than 1 m before the experiments the participants were told to evacuate as quickly as possible assuming that they were in a real fire scenario when an emergency occurs the workers of the offshore platform generally go to the temporary refuge and then board the lifeboats in the evacuation of platforms the refuge of the platform is located on main deck so in the three scenarios the escape routes of participants are from their initial location to the temporary refuge located on main deck we didn t appoint the evacuation routes of the participants they are free to decide their own routes in the platform the distribution of the experimental participants is the same in all scenarios as shown in table 1 in our experiments we randomize their initial location in every scenario 3 4 data gathering participants are requested to fill out the questionnaire before and after the evacuation experiment the question of the evacuation questionnaire is mainly about the basic characteristics of participants the psychological state of participants and the evacuation behavior of participants in the experiments the way finding behaviour of the participants is recorded by means of 48 cameras which were placed in the areas such as cabins corridors halls cinemas and stairs in addition each participant wears a wristband on his her hand each wristband has an electronic number that can be recognized by specific software the wristband adopts bluetooth location technology the positioning accuracy range of which is approximately 1 m 1 5 m by processing the experimental video data assisted with bluetooth positioning technology we can analyze the evacuation path speed and evacuation time of participants more clearly we uses two ropes to string many digital signs together with fixed interval of 0 5 m the starting point of each is above the left and right entrances of the cinema and the ending point of them are on the wall of the coffee lounge opposite the doors of the cinema through observing the video of camera above the entrances of the cinema we could calculate the visibility of the coffee lounge by identifying the numbers on the digital signs as shown in fig 9 for example if we can distinguish five digital sign numbers which are next to each other on a rope from the camera we can estimate the visibility is about 2 5 m 4 experimental results analysis 4 1 comparisons on evacuation results due to the visibility evacuation with smoke in the experiments is classified in scenarios 2 and 3 while scenario 1 is with good visibility it is observed that the smoke was mainly concentrated in the coffee lounge at the end of evacuation in scenario 2 and 3 with the smoke spreading around constantly only a little was distributed in corridor next to cabins and door near the staircase with which the visibility is more than 15 m and there is no significant difference in the measured evacuation speed in corridor between the three scenarios in scenario 2 we found it clear that as the visibility got worse the evacuation became more difficult the length of the evacuation route was longer and the movement speed decreased as a result the time required to complete the evacuation increased which is shown in tables 2 6 to our surprise in scenario 3 the high concentration smoke didn t slow down the speed of participants and conversely increased it compared to scenario 2 from the gait and words of people in the video we believe that people were eager to escape from the smoke environment with the familiar paths which were experienced in scenario 2 in addition we find the evacuation results of participants primarily distributed in a deck and b deck are affected due to the evacuation path change of evacuees primarily from mezzanine deck 4 2 comparisons of evacuation time the evacuation process can be divided into three certain basic activities namely cue validation decision making and movement to a safe place kobes et al 2010 since everyone was informed before the experiments and 95 of the personnel had experience in evacuation drills the response time of participants were very short with no more than 1 s so we measured the movement time of people by analyzing the data from video and the information of bluetooth location the results of the evacuation experiments are shown in tables 2 6 we recorded the total evacuation time when everyone arrived at the temporary refuge located on main deck in scenario 1 it was 84s in scenario 2 it was 90s which was 7 more than scenario 1 that is because on the one hand with smoke spreading the smoke obstructed the path that people plan to walk in advance so they changed their path to return back for example in scenario 2 those participants primarily from the cabins in mezzanine deck firstly went through the corridor to the coffee lounge and they found the smoke there then returned back to stair 1 through the corridor when they arrived at main deck through stair 1 they had to go through the corridor to the temporary refuge because stair 1 did not directly led to the temporary refuge like stair 2 so the evacuation path of scenario 2 was greatly extended compared to the evacuation path of scenario 1 during the entire evacuation process the other reason is that when the participants primarily from mezzanine deck met the participants primarily from b deck in main deck the occupant density became larger so that the speed of participants primarily from b deck reduced from 2 6 m s in scenario 1 2 21 m s in scenario 2 as table 3 shown in addition we can also find that the mean evacuation time in main deck increased from 7 7 s to 14 8 s in table 2 in scenario 3 the total evacuation time was only 65 s that was 22 less than scenario 1 though the smoke concentration in mezzanine deck was higher than what it was in scenario 1 in table 6 we can identify that the speed of participants in mezzanine deck in scenario 3 is larger than what it is in scenario 1 what s more many people in the video said the smoke was too thick hurry up the phenomena didn t appear in scenario 1 it shows that the participants want to stay away from the danger of vision loss and the slightly irritating smoke with their familiarity with the environment they don t need to spend too much time on finding the route especially when the layout of the environment was not complicated as a result their speed was faster than scenario 1 this is also confirmed by the interviews with some participants after the experiments however we need to note that it is difficult for people to go faster than in the situation with thin smoke for the irritating gases and high temperatures in real fire as shown in table 2 the evacuation time of participants from the b deck and a deck did not change obviously between the three scenarios because of the lack of smoke on these decks the speed of smoke propagation in mezzanine deck was not too fast so that there are little smoke in a deck and b deck what s more the position and evacuation path of participants were almost the same during the three scenarios this also shows that different visibility conditions caused by smoke have a huge impact on evacuation of people 4 3 comparisons of movement speed from the previous researches we know that the speed of occupants depends on the density of the occupants travel types fang et al 2004 travel conditions lee et al 2003 jin and yamada 1989 place types chen et al 2003 and occupant characteristics kady and davis 2009 lee et al 2003 jin and yamada 1989 chen et al 2003 boyce et al 1999 in our experiments the participants were told to evacuate as quickly as possible the movement speed of participants is adjusted according to occupant density once the occupant density is less than 2 per m 2 approximately from our results they tried to run during their evacuation otherwise they walk as soon as possible in the crowd through the video we find that people were always running in the corridors and staircases of the platform the pattern of walking fast only occurred in the coffee lounge of mezzanine deck when the occupant density is high especially the participants initially from cinema evacuated with the pattern of walking fast during the whole experiments the participants initially from the cabins in mezzanine deck changed their initial running mode to walking fast mode after they encountered the people from cinema so for the speed with the pattern of walking fast we just dealt with the data from participants initially from the cinema the movement speed with running mode in the straight corridor is studied in the experiments we mainly measured the speed of the corridor on the a deck b deck in the three scenarios and the mezzanine deck in scenario 1 and 3 because in these scenarios the phenomenon of returning back and staying in place didn t appear and people moved in one direction since there wasn t much smoke exists in these areas from beginning to end of the three scenarios the speed of running in a straight corridor we measured was the value without smoke from tables 3 6 we can see the speed of running in the corridor was between 1 91 m s and 2 3 m s when the occupant density was in the range of 1 3 per m 2 to 1 9 per m 2 and the speed of walking fast without smoke in the corridor was about 1 65 m s which have a good fit with the previous shi s research shi et al 2009 where the horizontal speed has a range of 0 8 1 8 m s based on the occupant density simultaneously it also matched well with the value of speed given by the imo which recommend that the speed of male crews should be in the range of 1 11 1 85 m s what s more we also find that they are well trained and queued into two columns like the military during the experiments as shown in fig 10 they adjusted their steps quickly to have the similar speed almost without congestion though the occupant density is relatively large in normal evacuation the speed on the stairs is influenced by many factors including the slope of the stairs the riser and tread of the staircases occupant density personnel characteristics and so on in this experiments we measured the speed of participants when they going up and down the stairs through analyzing the data the slope of the stair 1 and stair 2 is 37 and the step width of stair 1 and stair 2 is 1 25 m and 1 5 m respectively during the three scenarios the speed of going downstairs with running mode in no smoke situation was between 1 26 and 1 27 m s and the speed of going upstairs with running mode in no smoke situation was between 0 95 and 1 03 m s the average of which was slightly lower than the speed of going downstairs it is noted that the speed of going upstairs in scenario 2 and 3 was much faster than that of scenario 1 the maximum of which can be up to 1 37 m s from our interviews with participants after experiments we know that the participants who just escaped away from the smoke environment in mezzanine deck in scenario 2 and 3 are afraid that the smoke will spread to their own location again so they run as fast as possible in addition the speed we measured in stairs was higher than the data the imo recommend in which the speed of going upstairs is between 0 5 and 0 84 m s and the speed of going downstairs is between 0 76 and 1 26 m s imo 2007 these differences can be affected by the walking patterns in the imo experiment imo 2007 the participants are required to walk where in our experiments the participants can run in addition as the participants are the workers on the platform they will regularly participate in relevant escape drills in their work which help them evacuate better it is verified by previous studies jeon and hong 2009 that the limited visibility usually reduces the evacuation speed of participants as shown in table 2 table 5 and table 6 in scenario 2 with smoke in mezzanine deck the mean speed two patterns are all included of the participants initially from mezzanine deck was 1 34 m s which is 24 lower than 1 78 m s in scenario 1 without smoke this is because on one hand the smoke reduces the person s field of vision so they slowed down which is often seen in other studies jeon and hong 2009 the other is that 18 participants didn t want to travel through the thick smoke they hesitated stayed in place and finally turned back which led to the congestion in the corridor out of the cabins it was found that in scenario 2 the mean movement speed two patterns are all included of the participants initially from the cabins on main deck was 1 55 m s and the mean movement speed two patterns are all included of the participants from cinema is 1 21 m s we consider that it is due to the large occupant density in cinema at the beginning of the experiments when the visibility is more than 3 m the mean movement speed of participants with walking fast mode in mezzanine deck is about 1 61 m s with the smoke spreading continuously when the visibility is less than 3 m the mean movement speed of participants with walking fast mode in mezzanine deck decreased to 0 95 m s to our surprise in scenario 3 the mean movement speed of the participants with walking fast mode in the cinema was 1 36 m s which had increased by 12 compared to the speed of scenario 2 according to the interview after the experiments we know that they are familiar with the evacuation path and just follow the path they chose in scenario 2 they were stooped and their noses are covered by hands they hoped to escape from the smoke environment as soon as possible so they speeded up their pace the movement speed of running is varied due to the different distribution of participants in the three scenarios we use the paired sample t test to compare the speed of the main decks in three separate scenarios for participants with initial positions on b and a decks as shown in table 7 and table 8 there was no statistically valid difference in movement speed of participants primarily from a deck but the results of the participants with initial positions on the b deck was exactly the opposite it is because in the three scenarios the participants from a deck first arrived at main deck with only several persons at the end of the queue meeting the people from b deck and mezzanine deck so the overall average speed of the participants from a deck had not been significantly affected and p 0 05 in scenario 2 nearly half of the participants initially from b deck encountered the people from mezzanine deck on main deck so they slowed down with the speed changed from 2 6 m s to 2 21 m s in scenario 3 when the person from b deck first came to main deck the participants initially from the cabins of mezzanine deck had arrived at main deck because they did not have return behavior as a result the average speed of participants primarily from b deck reduced to 1 95 m s 4 4 comparisons of route choice when selecting an evacuation route participants usually consider the layout of the building the occupant density and the impact of smoke in fig 1 are the exits and the most chosen routes of each deck visualized in our experiments the participants are working in the platform so that they are very familiar with the evacuation routes of the platform as shown in table 9 in the three scenarios all of the participants chose route 8 on b deck and route 7 on a deck because they are usually familiar with the stair 1 and their initial position is near to the it as shown in fig 1 there are three routes for participants on main deck participants who arrived at main deck using stair 1 can choose route 10 or route 11 to the final temporary refuge the others who arrived at main deck from stair 2 all chose route 9 for 120 participants in scenario 1 the majority 67 of the participants escaped following route 9 and a smaller quantity 33 evacuated with route 10 conversely in scenario 2 only 37 of the participants chose route 9 while most 62 of them were like to evacuate through route 10 besides there were other 2 person chose route 11 by analyzing the video and bluetooth positioning data we find that the two persons were initially from a deck and always at the end of the evacuation queue when they reached main deck they encountered the crowd from mezzanine deck at last they chose route 11 which is the longest one among the three routes to avoid congestion table 10 and fig 9 shows the changes of route choice in mezzanine deck according to the propagation of smoke participants in mezzanine deck were mostly concentrated in the cinema and cabins in scenario 1 without smoke all of them chose to evacuate by using stair 2 which is wider than stair 1 and used more frequently in their daily life in scenario 2 with smoke some participants changed their original paths during the evacuation for those people initially from the cinema the majority 64 of them evacuated following route 2 about 24 12 persons of participants from the cinema chose route 4 at the beginning but half of them finally returned back to escape by using the stair 2 through route 3 when they encountered the crowd from the cabins in the corridor for participants initially from the cabins 80 of them just started their evacuation with route 6 like scenario 1 when the people at the front of the queue saw the smoke at the coffee lounge they stayed in place with hesitation and spread the information to other people and finally 60 of people returned back and chose route 5 this shows that people are afraid of the smoke environment during the evacuation and do not want to run across the smoke area even if the area is close to the exit in scenario 3 a larger quantity 80 of participants initially located in the cinema evacuated through route 2 compared to the quantity that chose route 3 20 all of the participants from the cabins chose route 5 as fig 12 shown the evacuation trajectory of people in the coffee lounge is different during the three scenarios in scenario 2 all of the participants like to evacuate along the sofa near the entrance of the cinema where the density of smoke is relatively lower than other area according to the interview after the experiments it may be due to people s psychological pressure on smoke so that people wanted to stay away from the area with thick smoke in the coffee lounge for another side smoke decreased the visibility of the environment so that the participants couldn t see the path clearly they evacuated along the edge of the obstacles to assist them to find the evacuation paths better this phenomenon is in agreement with the experiment results in previous isobe s studies isobe et al 2004 in scenario 3 everyone in mezzanine deck went straight to their target exists and no one hesitated and returned back they were familiar with the paths so that they ran faster though the visibility in the coffee lounge is less than 1 m from the observation of the experimental video some typical behaviors during the evacuation in smoke are found such as leader behavior ma et al 2017 following behavior cao et al 2018 and small group behavior xie et al 2018 which play an important role in influencing the choice of the evacuation paths in scenario 2 when the participants from cinema encountered the crowd from cabins at the corner of the corridor they shared the information with the participants from cabins that the lounge was filled with smoke which caused the evacuation of the people from cabins in the corridor to slow down even in a state of stagnation at this time a person just like the leader of the crowd said loudly go there go to the place without smoke most of the participants followed him to evacuate by stair 1 this phenomenon is also called following behavior for example as fig 11 shown one person ran toward the lounge at the beginning but later changed his direction to the cabins after the leader said the words as shown in table 10 60 of participants initially from cabins in mezzanine deck changed their evacuation direction to avoid being harmed by smoke because of following behavior so we believe once people know the route they chose is filled with the smoke after sharing the information with each other they will change their direction to another safe routes which can be applied in the later evacuation model the following behavior under limited visibility is beneficial for evacuation for those who cannot find the path in smoking environment in addition among the participants initially from cabins there were a small number of people who insist on the initial direction and didn t return back we are surprised that they evacuated with a group containing 5 persons and the speed of them was similar according to the video we find that their initial positions are in the same cabin which indicated the people from one cabin are more likely to evacuate together evacuation with the group can help them keep the speed relatively stable and fast in a smoke environment and more easily to find the exit 5 questionnaires before and after the experiments 120 participants were asked to fill out two questionnaires in total the questionnaires mainly investigated three parts including the basic characteristics of the personnel the psychological state of evacuation in the fire and the evacuation behavior in the experiments some useful results are obtained from the statistical analysis of the questionnaires 5 1 participants characteristics and behavior most participants 72 assert they are not emotional in their daily lives which means that they can effectively control his emotions keep calm and make decisions quickly when facing a dangerous situation the majority 95 of the participants have received education and training about fire evacuation before 98 of them were very familiar with the distribution of the evacuation paths on the platform so that they could find the evacuation paths easily and evacuated in an orderly manner with the results of questionnaires before the experiments 72 of the participants were inclined to follow others around them and chose the exit that most of people around them had chosen in scenario 2 of the experiments up to 88 chose this which is higher than the data from the questionnaires before the experiments almost all of the people 95 expected to wait in line when they encountered congestion in evacuation while in scenario 2 only 87 5 of people did it according to the questionnaires before the experiments when they were in the smoke environment about 44 of them were stooped and 55 of the people wanted to return back and look for new paths but in the experiments 92 of them chose to look for other new paths which is much higher than the results of questionnaires in addition we also find in the questionnaires after the experiments that some people mentioned they had passed through the smoke area but in actual experiments not it shows that the method of questionnaires to study the evacuation performance of people is limited the results of questionnaires cannot fully reflect the real performance of people in the evacuation process in addition we also investigated the most difficult area where the participants can easily feel scared and stressed when evacuating or moving forward as table 11 shown 51 of them thought the stairway is the most difficult area the stairs on the platform are sharper and narrower than those on the land where people gathered from each floor the second one mentioned very frequently is the turn of a corridor where people must change their direction and perhaps encountered others from the left or right direction that will caused the collision easily and make them feel stressed 10 of the participants chose the doors to the stairs which is another important area where people gathered into the staircases and always easily cause the congestion in addition other participants pointed out that the cinema exists stair landing and the exit to temporary refuge are also the relatively difficult area during the evacuation these areas can be considered for the future design of offshore platform with some research methods for example we can find a relatively good value for the width of the stairs through a series of evacuation simulations 5 2 influence of personal features on performance in evacuation we want to find the relationship between the personnel characteristics and evacuation performance from the statistical results of the questionnaire from the data we speculate that the blood type personality of participants and fire drill experience may be related to people s evacuation behavior as shown in tables 12 14 which has been published by our research team in the previous reports qi 2019 73 of people with a blood type 33 persons prefer to evacuate immediately after hearing the fire alarm without confirming the truth of the fire or observing other people s reactions which is higher than the average value 52 of 120 we have gotten while only 38 9 of people with o blood type 36 persons prefer to evacuate immediately after hearing the fire alarm what s more 96 4 of the people with a blood type chose not to return to pick up things which exceeded the average value that we have counted for people with a 26 persons or ab blood type 12 persons they are inclined to maintain a distance of 30 50 cm from the wall and others during the evacuation process we can get more details about the evacuation performance of people with other blood type from tables 12 14 about 20 of people with emotional personality whose emotions are easily affected by others prefer to return to pick up things the percentage of which is higher than people with rational personality 3 7 in addition when other people ran slower they are easily dissatisfied with the evacuation speed of others which is not good for a safe evacuation among those people who have the experience of fire drill 87 9 of them 114 persons will try to put out the fire in the early stages of the fire which indicates that having the experience of the fire drill can greatly improve the psychological quality and social responsibility in the fire facing the fire 97 of them will feel nervous but not panic so that they can judge the environment calmly they are more willing to obey the order keep a certain distance from the people around them and help others when they encounter the counterflow crowd they slow down their speed however those people who don t have experienced the fire drill are inclined to avoid the crowd and return to look for new paths which can easily cause congestion and collision from the data of speed we measured and the behavior of people in the video the entire evacuation process is efficient and orderly the results are consistent with what we observed in the experiment in addition we tried to calculate the p values which is known as hypothesis testing to help us explore the relationship between the personnel characteristics and evacuation performance the p stands for probability and measures how likely it is that any observed difference between groups is due to chance it measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis by convention the cut off between a large and a small p value is set at 0 05 when the p value is below 0 05 the results is generally referred to as being statistically significant akobeng and anthony 2016 as shown in table 15 the results indicate that the relationship is statistically significant between people s evacuation behavior and the blood type personality of participants fire drill experience however the use of a cut off for statistical significance based on a purely arbitrary value can easily lead to a misleading conclusion of accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis akobeng and anthony 2016 the results can be affected by many factors such as the sample size and the social backgrounds of participants the sample size of our experiments is just 120 persons which is not large enough all of the participants are made up of the workers of the platforms the social background of which is so single that cannot represent other social groups we need to consider the possibility of type i and ii errors a large scale surveys in japan and the us show that there is no relationship between blood type and human behavior kengo 2014 the result of which is contrary to our results if we get the conclusion that the relationship between the blood type and people s evacuation behavior is significant we may have made the type i error similarly we cannot determine the relationship between the personality of participants and people s evacuation behavior because of type i error but we believe our results have reference value for the evacuation of offshore platforms fire drill experience is considered to be related to the people s evacuation which is proved by many researcher kobes et al 2010 the results is also consistent with ours in addition due to the lack of the sample size we may have missed some meaningful conclusions which belongs to the type ii errors more experiments with larger sample size and people of different backgrounds are needed to do in our later work to find them 6 conclusions this research is mainly to analyze the evacuation performance of people in the smoke situation on the offshore platform we compared the movement speed route choice and evacuation time which are different in the three different scenarios and finally we obtained several qualitative and quantitative features from the experiments these features are summarized as follows 1 we measured the speed of running in corridors and stairs during our experiments without smoke the speed of running in corridor without smoke was between 1 91 m s and 2 3 m s when the occupant density is in the range of 1 3 per m 2 to 1 9 per m 2 and the speed of them going downstairs and upstairs without smoke was between 1 26 and 1 27 m s and 0 95 1 03 m s respectively the speed of walking fast without smoke in the corridor was about 1 65 m s which have a good fit with the value of speed given by the imo which recommend that the speed of male crews should be in the range of 1 11 1 85 m s the participants regularly participate in relevant escape drills in their work and can adjust their steps in time to avoid congestion which can be distinguished from the non trained personnel our results can help the imo guidelines to be revised in the future 2 normally when people are in a smoke situation smoke can hinder their vision which will affect their judgment about the environment around them and thus reduce the speed of participants but if they are familiar with the environment and the routes of evacuation their speed can be higher than the speed in the situations without smoke in scenario 2 the mean speed of the participants initially from mezzanine deck was 1 34 m s which was 24 lower than 1 78 m s in scenario 1 without smoke when the visibility is more than 3 m the mean movement speed of participants with walking fast mode in mezzanine deck is about 1 61 m s with the smoke spreading continuously when the visibility is less than 3 m the mean movement speed of participants with walking fast mode in mezzanine deck decreased to 0 95 m s but in scenario 3 it increased to 1 36 m s even though the smoke gets thicker we believe that it is due to the participants good familiarity with the environment and the psychological urgency of wanting escape from the smoke environment as soon as quickly however in the realistic thick smoke environments the irritating gases and high temperatures of the smoke are harmful to the human body which makes it difficult for people to go faster than in the situation with thin smoke we only considered the impact of visibility on the evacuation speed in these experiments 1 under normal circumstances people like to choose the path they are most familiar with for evacuation but when people evacuated in a smoke environment they would change their initial direction to return back according to the propagation of smoke to stay away from the area with smoke as much as possible 2 when people escape from the smoke environment to a new environment without smoke people will still keep vigilant and anxious for a while and continue to move forward quickly the speed of which can be faster than the speed in the same environment without smoke we can know it from the value of speed about going upstairs in scenario 3 which had reached 1 37 m s it is much larger than that of scenario 2 in the same stair 3 we find that following behavior and small group behavior is obvious under smoke situations which can alleviate their psychological stress relatively and help them find the exits more easily and when in the smoke environment people are more likely to evacuate along the edge of the obstacles to help them find paths which is consistent with previous studies isobe et al 2004 4 we investigated the characteristics of every participants through the questionnaires the majority of them have received good training about the fire evacuation and most of them think themselves are rational in their daily lives we think that is the reason why their speed is faster than normal people and they can evacuate in an orderly manner relatively in addition the results of the questionnaires analysis also show that the stairs on the platform the turn of corridor and the doors to the stairs are considered to be the most difficult section to evacuate or move forward for participants which is needed to pay attention in future design of the offshore platform what s more we explored the relationship between the personnel characteristics and evacuation performance with the help of the p value and discussed the possibility of type i and ii errors this study offers valuable evacuation data which is helpful to understand the evacuation performance and may serve to develop suggestions for improving the efficiency of evacuation under fire on the offshore platforms it is noted that the area used by our experiments only involves the three layers of the offshore platforms and we didn t consider the influence of the evacuation sign on the route more experiments about them should be performed in the future funding this work is being funded by ministry of industry and information technology treasury of china research and development of

21472,the study of evacuation on offshore platforms under fire is significant but has received little attention by previous researchers the evacuation process from offshore platforms under three distinct visibilities 10 m 1 m 10 m 1 m is investigated by a group of experiments and questionnaires with 120 participants the group evacuation activities of the participants regarding the evacuation time movement speed typical behavior and route choice were recorded and studied by 48 cameras and wristbands with bluetooth positioning function we ignited smoke bombs often used in the fire drill to generate the smoke which had a little irritating smell but is safe for people we investigated the speed in running mode and walking fast mode and the speed of participants with walking fast without smoke we obtained fits well with the data that imo recommend in addition we found the speed of participants does not always decrease in the smoke environment sometimes it increases when people are well aware of the surroundings finally we study the relationship between personnel characteristics and evacuation behavior with the help of hypothesis testing the study will be helpful to the guidelines of imo to be revised in the future and develop efficient evacuation strategy to guide the evacuation under fire in offshore platforms keywords offshore platform fire evacuation evacuation performance experimental research 1 introduction the deepwater semi submersible platform is the main living place for offshore oil exploration workers which includes various parts for accommodation recreation and material replenishment once the fire occurs the environment of the platform can be extremely dangerous making it difficult for people to evacuate successfully according to the historical records the deadliest offshore accident was the piper alpha disaster in the north sea in 1988 which resulted in 167 deaths in 2010 a severe oil leak accident happened in the deepwater horizon oil platform which caused an explosion and 11 people died in the gulf of mexico under the impact of a series of events involving large number of fatalities and economic losses on platforms the safety of offshore platforms is highly valued by the international maritime organization imo and national oil companies recently in 2016 the maritime safety committee msc of imo adopted circular 1533 entitled revised guidelines on evacuation analysis for new and existing passenger ships imo 2007 which requires passenger rolling ships and other passenger ships constructed after january 1 2020 must make evacuation analysis in the early stage of design the guideline offers two distinct methods of analysis a simplified evacuation analysis and an advanced evacuation analysis imo 2016 both the imo methods are subject to restrictive assumptions and omissions the influence of fire smoke is not taken into consideration as a disaster with high risk and great destruction fire has an important significance in the safety assessment of crew in offshore platforms this study will discuss the characteristics and changes of crew s behavior under visually handicapped conditions due to smoke during the experimental study the rest of this paper is as follows section 2 presents related studies on evacuation analysis of offshore platforms and earlier research on evacuation behaviour in fire section 3 presents the design of the experiment including the scenarios with different visibility the distribution of participants and the method of data collection section 4 shows the analysis of experimental results the evacuation routes choice movement speed evacuation time and some typical behaviors such as small group behavior was studied with different visibility conditions section 5 mainly describes the survey results of the two questionnaires and a comparative analysis between the experimental results and the results of questionnaires finally section 6 presents the conclusions and future directions 2 related works in recent years more and more researchers are paying attention to the evacuation performance of workers in offshore platforms but the evacuation scenarios they studied are not related to fire scenes in addition with regard to those evacuations studies under fire it is mostly concentrated in terrestrial buildings in section 2 1 the evacuation behaviour studies of people under fire were mainly reviewed section 2 2 reviews research about the evacuation performance in offshore platforms 2 1 earlier research on evacuation behaviour in fire the impact of fire on the evacuation performance of people is mainly the influence of smoke purser 1988 not only high temperature smoke burns people s respiratory tract but also the toxic gas components in the smoke can paralyze people s nerves causing people to lose consciousness gradually purser 1988 in addition the smoke will reduce the visibility significantly jin 1989 and thus interfere with their route choices fridolf et al 2013 due to ethical restrictions it is not advisable for participants to experiment in a real fire environment with good repeatability and low expense many pedestrian evacuation simulation models have been developed such as the social force model helbing and molnar 1995 the cellular automaton model burstedde et al 2001 which have become the main method for researchers to study the evacuation of people under fire and smoke zheng zheng et al 2017 proposes an extended floor field ff model to study the pedestrian evacuation dynamics with the influence of the fire and the smoke spreading in his model the vertical and horizontal propagation of smoke and the walking posture of bending and crawling are considered nguyen hung et al 2013 integrated the smoke effect and blind evacuation strategy within fire evacuation the simulation results were supported by empirical data from the metro supermarket bae bae and ryou 2015 developed a smoke effect model for representing the psychological pressure experienced when the evacuees are confronted with smoke or they move through the smoke the simulation analysis of models zheng 2011 shi and lee 2018 which lack accurate comparisons with experimental data is difficult to be used widely there are few experimental studies on fire evacuation with the limitations of ethics and experimental conditions the experiments cannot fully reproduce the impact of smoke on human evacuation such as the effects of high temperature and poisonous gas that the smoke produces purser 1988 so they mainly focus on the evacuation performance of people under visually handicapped conditions jeon jeon and hong 2009 conducted a personal evacuation experiment on 103 people in the underground four floors of the subway station to study the personal evacuation speed evacuation time and evacuation route choice in a limited visibility environment and found that the moving speed increased only when the phosphorescent sign was installed at intervals smaller than a person s step margrethe kobes kobes et al 2010 made a personal evacuation experiment on 103 people in the hotel to study the impact of personality characteristics and educational background on the evacuation path in addition it was found that the evacuation sign placed at a higher position was more effective under the smoke situation jeon jeon et al 2011 studied the consequences of evacuation experiments of 125 people and analyzed the personal evacuation time speed and evacuation route choices of people under four different visibility levels in underground shopping malls these experiments are mainly concentrated on individual evacuation experiments but the reality is that evacuation scenarios are often evacuated by many people and each person s evacuation speed and route choice can be affected by others isobe 2004 at present there are few experiments studies on the interaction of evacuation between many people under poor visibility xie zhang et al 2018 conducted an evacuation experiment on 75 people in a five story office building to study the speed and route choices of small groups on horizontal ground and stairs in three distinct visibility levels song s experiments cao et al 2018 found some typical behaviors such as helping behaviors and following behaviors in poor visibility by letting staff in the supermarket wearing low transmission glass until now we have not found the relevant experimental research about the evacuation of offshore platforms in fire that have been published the evacuation performance is linked to the layout of the building the type of terrain and the characteristics of people compared with the building structure on the land the cabin on the offshore platform is compactly arranged the route choice can be more complex and evacuation passages such as corridors and stairs are narrower and sharper in addition the crew on the platform is well trained so that their evacuation behavior will be different from other people 2 2 research on evacuation in offshore platforms researchers mainly study the evacuation of offshore platform by computer simulation tan et al 2017 the safety at sea company launched the shipwreck evacuation simulation system based on the discrete stochastic model namely evi vassalos et al 2003 additional software for ship evacuation includes maritime exodus galea et al 2014 and aeneas valanto 2006 cheng cheng et al 2017 develops a simulation model for offshore platforms to evaluate different evacuation intends to improve evacuation performance by integrating building information modeling bim technology and agent based model wang cai et al 2013 proposed an improved dynamic bayesian network dbn model by integrating markov model with bayesian network to predict the dynamic probability of offshore platform fire ginnis ginnis et al 2010 developed a multi user virtual reality vr system to support designers to assess passenger and crew activities on a ship for both normal and hectic conditions of operations there are very few experiments on the evacuation in real offshore platforms or ships some institutes such as katuhara the national maritime research institute of japan katsuhara et al 1999 brumley brumley and koss 2000 the maritime engineering cooperation research center of australian and the korean maritime university mechanical and eng 2013 have done researches on the movement behavior of people on a real ship and achieved the walking speed data of people of different ages in different types of channel structures during the berthing and navigation the main focus of their researches is to achieve the data of the walking speed of ships in separate floating and shaking situations without any fire situations involved the international maritime organization imo guidelines also recommend the maximum and minimum of travel speeds for different people in different types of channel structures galea et al 2014 without fire they didn t explicitly consider the effects of fire products listing or flooding on evacuation at all all of which are taken into account by the use of a safety factor however fire is the most devastating disaster with the high probability of occurrence in the platform pallardy 2010 studying the evacuation performance in the fire environment will play a major role in the accessibility and safety of the platform for accommodation this study is to analyze the evacuation performance of the crew in platforms under the influence of smoke with a series of experiments which will have a very significant meaning in the evacuation studies of the offshore platform under fire and can help the revision of evacuation guidelines 3 evacuation experiment 3 1 selected objects the experiment was conducted in a real offshore platform under construction in qidong city jiangsu province of china the offshore platform has seven decks among them the lower deck mezzanine deck and main deck mainly include recreation area fitness area dining area and also have the accommodation area that only occupy a small fraction in addition some engine rooms for energy supply with a high risk of fire are also included a and b deck are the main accommodation areas for platform workers and on c deck and d deck there are a small number of rooms including the control room and the engine room due to the large size of the entire offshore platform and the limited budget and number of participants for the experiments we chose some part areas of four decks to do the experiments which are mezzanine deck main deck a deck and b deck as shown in fig 1 considering that those area are where the crowds are mainly concentrated when the fire occurs 3 2 participants the participants in the experiment were all workers of the platform and very familiar with the evacuation routes of the platform there are 120 people in total only four of them are women and the others are men the average age of participants was 32 years with an average height of 173 3 cm and an average shoulder width of 48 cm as shown in figs 2 4 in this experiment the workers wore helmets work uniforms and special work shoes on the head of which a piece of iron was placed to protect the feet from injury so that it is heavier than normal shoes in addition because this experiment involved the smoke scenarios we provided each person with a cotton mask which can effectively block airborne microorganisms and particles from entering the nasal cavity of people as shown in fig 5 3 3 scenarios to investigate the influence of smoke conditions and layout of platform on the fire response performance of platform workers the research consists of experiments carried out under three different scenarios the first scenario is a situation without smoke in scenario 1 we try to let people distribute in the areas which people often gather and easily cause congestion when an emergency occurs so we have 80 persons on mezzanine deck 50 of which are in the cinema and 30 in the cabins there are also 20 persons and 20 persons respectively in the cabins on a deck and b deck the participants mainly distributed in areas like cabins cinema where people can easily gather the distribution of the experimental participants in detail is shown in table 1 below the second scenario happens with the smoke density changed fig 6 shows the propagation of smoke throughout the platform during the non working days most of the platform workers like to stay in the recreation areas and cabins for rest in mezzanine deck the coffee lounge is surrounded by cinemas dining rooms and cabins which can be a typical crowded and dangerous areas once the fire occurs so we chose the coffee lounge to be the smoke situation as shown in fig 1 regarding the choice of the smoke simulator in the previous experimental study some researchers like fridolf fridolf et al 2013 selected the smoke machines with generating uniform smoke while jeon jeon et al 2011 and cao cao et al 2018 use the plastic glasses with low light transmittance to simulate the visual obscuration by smoke although the method can control the visibility of smoke well the phenomenon of smoke stratification won t occur and it has no irritating effect on human breathing which can affect the walking posture zheng et al 2017 and speed of people so we chose to use smoke bombs often used in the fire drill as shown in fig 7 when the smoke bombs are ignited they will produce the smoke layer which is similar to the smoke generation and movement in real fire with the height gradually decreased in addition it will also have a little irritating smell but it is safe and doesn t contain toxic ingredients in scenario 2 when the height of the smoke layer at the entrance of the cinema drops to 2 m the height of the door the evacuation experiment begins with the alarm sound released by the electronic alarm system of the platform in each scenario during the entire evacuation process the visibility that can identify the luminaries like exit sign with fluorescent and objects gradually changes from more than 10 m at the beginning to about 1 m in the final fig 8 shows the process of the smoke propagation near the exit of coffee lounge in mezzanine deck the scenario 3 is also with smoke whose visibility is less than 1 m we continue to ignite the smoke bombs in the coffee lounge until the smoke layer fell to the ground with smoke filled the entire lounge in which the visibility is less than 1 m before the experiments the participants were told to evacuate as quickly as possible assuming that they were in a real fire scenario when an emergency occurs the workers of the offshore platform generally go to the temporary refuge and then board the lifeboats in the evacuation of platforms the refuge of the platform is located on main deck so in the three scenarios the escape routes of participants are from their initial location to the temporary refuge located on main deck we didn t appoint the evacuation routes of the participants they are free to decide their own routes in the platform the distribution of the experimental participants is the same in all scenarios as shown in table 1 in our experiments we randomize their initial location in every scenario 3 4 data gathering participants are requested to fill out the questionnaire before and after the evacuation experiment the question of the evacuation questionnaire is mainly about the basic characteristics of participants the psychological state of participants and the evacuation behavior of participants in the experiments the way finding behaviour of the participants is recorded by means of 48 cameras which were placed in the areas such as cabins corridors halls cinemas and stairs in addition each participant wears a wristband on his her hand each wristband has an electronic number that can be recognized by specific software the wristband adopts bluetooth location technology the positioning accuracy range of which is approximately 1 m 1 5 m by processing the experimental video data assisted with bluetooth positioning technology we can analyze the evacuation path speed and evacuation time of participants more clearly we uses two ropes to string many digital signs together with fixed interval of 0 5 m the starting point of each is above the left and right entrances of the cinema and the ending point of them are on the wall of the coffee lounge opposite the doors of the cinema through observing the video of camera above the entrances of the cinema we could calculate the visibility of the coffee lounge by identifying the numbers on the digital signs as shown in fig 9 for example if we can distinguish five digital sign numbers which are next to each other on a rope from the camera we can estimate the visibility is about 2 5 m 4 experimental results analysis 4 1 comparisons on evacuation results due to the visibility evacuation with smoke in the experiments is classified in scenarios 2 and 3 while scenario 1 is with good visibility it is observed that the smoke was mainly concentrated in the coffee lounge at the end of evacuation in scenario 2 and 3 with the smoke spreading around constantly only a little was distributed in corridor next to cabins and door near the staircase with which the visibility is more than 15 m and there is no significant difference in the measured evacuation speed in corridor between the three scenarios in scenario 2 we found it clear that as the visibility got worse the evacuation became more difficult the length of the evacuation route was longer and the movement speed decreased as a result the time required to complete the evacuation increased which is shown in tables 2 6 to our surprise in scenario 3 the high concentration smoke didn t slow down the speed of participants and conversely increased it compared to scenario 2 from the gait and words of people in the video we believe that people were eager to escape from the smoke environment with the familiar paths which were experienced in scenario 2 in addition we find the evacuation results of participants primarily distributed in a deck and b deck are affected due to the evacuation path change of evacuees primarily from mezzanine deck 4 2 comparisons of evacuation time the evacuation process can be divided into three certain basic activities namely cue validation decision making and movement to a safe place kobes et al 2010 since everyone was informed before the experiments and 95 of the personnel had experience in evacuation drills the response time of participants were very short with no more than 1 s so we measured the movement time of people by analyzing the data from video and the information of bluetooth location the results of the evacuation experiments are shown in tables 2 6 we recorded the total evacuation time when everyone arrived at the temporary refuge located on main deck in scenario 1 it was 84s in scenario 2 it was 90s which was 7 more than scenario 1 that is because on the one hand with smoke spreading the smoke obstructed the path that people plan to walk in advance so they changed their path to return back for example in scenario 2 those participants primarily from the cabins in mezzanine deck firstly went through the corridor to the coffee lounge and they found the smoke there then returned back to stair 1 through the corridor when they arrived at main deck through stair 1 they had to go through the corridor to the temporary refuge because stair 1 did not directly led to the temporary refuge like stair 2 so the evacuation path of scenario 2 was greatly extended compared to the evacuation path of scenario 1 during the entire evacuation process the other reason is that when the participants primarily from mezzanine deck met the participants primarily from b deck in main deck the occupant density became larger so that the speed of participants primarily from b deck reduced from 2 6 m s in scenario 1 2 21 m s in scenario 2 as table 3 shown in addition we can also find that the mean evacuation time in main deck increased from 7 7 s to 14 8 s in table 2 in scenario 3 the total evacuation time was only 65 s that was 22 less than scenario 1 though the smoke concentration in mezzanine deck was higher than what it was in scenario 1 in table 6 we can identify that the speed of participants in mezzanine deck in scenario 3 is larger than what it is in scenario 1 what s more many people in the video said the smoke was too thick hurry up the phenomena didn t appear in scenario 1 it shows that the participants want to stay away from the danger of vision loss and the slightly irritating smoke with their familiarity with the environment they don t need to spend too much time on finding the route especially when the layout of the environment was not complicated as a result their speed was faster than scenario 1 this is also confirmed by the interviews with some participants after the experiments however we need to note that it is difficult for people to go faster than in the situation with thin smoke for the irritating gases and high temperatures in real fire as shown in table 2 the evacuation time of participants from the b deck and a deck did not change obviously between the three scenarios because of the lack of smoke on these decks the speed of smoke propagation in mezzanine deck was not too fast so that there are little smoke in a deck and b deck what s more the position and evacuation path of participants were almost the same during the three scenarios this also shows that different visibility conditions caused by smoke have a huge impact on evacuation of people 4 3 comparisons of movement speed from the previous researches we know that the speed of occupants depends on the density of the occupants travel types fang et al 2004 travel conditions lee et al 2003 jin and yamada 1989 place types chen et al 2003 and occupant characteristics kady and davis 2009 lee et al 2003 jin and yamada 1989 chen et al 2003 boyce et al 1999 in our experiments the participants were told to evacuate as quickly as possible the movement speed of participants is adjusted according to occupant density once the occupant density is less than 2 per m 2 approximately from our results they tried to run during their evacuation otherwise they walk as soon as possible in the crowd through the video we find that people were always running in the corridors and staircases of the platform the pattern of walking fast only occurred in the coffee lounge of mezzanine deck when the occupant density is high especially the participants initially from cinema evacuated with the pattern of walking fast during the whole experiments the participants initially from the cabins in mezzanine deck changed their initial running mode to walking fast mode after they encountered the people from cinema so for the speed with the pattern of walking fast we just dealt with the data from participants initially from the cinema the movement speed with running mode in the straight corridor is studied in the experiments we mainly measured the speed of the corridor on the a deck b deck in the three scenarios and the mezzanine deck in scenario 1 and 3 because in these scenarios the phenomenon of returning back and staying in place didn t appear and people moved in one direction since there wasn t much smoke exists in these areas from beginning to end of the three scenarios the speed of running in a straight corridor we measured was the value without smoke from tables 3 6 we can see the speed of running in the corridor was between 1 91 m s and 2 3 m s when the occupant density was in the range of 1 3 per m 2 to 1 9 per m 2 and the speed of walking fast without smoke in the corridor was about 1 65 m s which have a good fit with the previous shi s research shi et al 2009 where the horizontal speed has a range of 0 8 1 8 m s based on the occupant density simultaneously it also matched well with the value of speed given by the imo which recommend that the speed of male crews should be in the range of 1 11 1 85 m s what s more we also find that they are well trained and queued into two columns like the military during the experiments as shown in fig 10 they adjusted their steps quickly to have the similar speed almost without congestion though the occupant density is relatively large in normal evacuation the speed on the stairs is influenced by many factors including the slope of the stairs the riser and tread of the staircases occupant density personnel characteristics and so on in this experiments we measured the speed of participants when they going up and down the stairs through analyzing the data the slope of the stair 1 and stair 2 is 37 and the step width of stair 1 and stair 2 is 1 25 m and 1 5 m respectively during the three scenarios the speed of going downstairs with running mode in no smoke situation was between 1 26 and 1 27 m s and the speed of going upstairs with running mode in no smoke situation was between 0 95 and 1 03 m s the average of which was slightly lower than the speed of going downstairs it is noted that the speed of going upstairs in scenario 2 and 3 was much faster than that of scenario 1 the maximum of which can be up to 1 37 m s from our interviews with participants after experiments we know that the participants who just escaped away from the smoke environment in mezzanine deck in scenario 2 and 3 are afraid that the smoke will spread to their own location again so they run as fast as possible in addition the speed we measured in stairs was higher than the data the imo recommend in which the speed of going upstairs is between 0 5 and 0 84 m s and the speed of going downstairs is between 0 76 and 1 26 m s imo 2007 these differences can be affected by the walking patterns in the imo experiment imo 2007 the participants are required to walk where in our experiments the participants can run in addition as the participants are the workers on the platform they will regularly participate in relevant escape drills in their work which help them evacuate better it is verified by previous studies jeon and hong 2009 that the limited visibility usually reduces the evacuation speed of participants as shown in table 2 table 5 and table 6 in scenario 2 with smoke in mezzanine deck the mean speed two patterns are all included of the participants initially from mezzanine deck was 1 34 m s which is 24 lower than 1 78 m s in scenario 1 without smoke this is because on one hand the smoke reduces the person s field of vision so they slowed down which is often seen in other studies jeon and hong 2009 the other is that 18 participants didn t want to travel through the thick smoke they hesitated stayed in place and finally turned back which led to the congestion in the corridor out of the cabins it was found that in scenario 2 the mean movement speed two patterns are all included of the participants initially from the cabins on main deck was 1 55 m s and the mean movement speed two patterns are all included of the participants from cinema is 1 21 m s we consider that it is due to the large occupant density in cinema at the beginning of the experiments when the visibility is more than 3 m the mean movement speed of participants with walking fast mode in mezzanine deck is about 1 61 m s with the smoke spreading continuously when the visibility is less than 3 m the mean movement speed of participants with walking fast mode in mezzanine deck decreased to 0 95 m s to our surprise in scenario 3 the mean movement speed of the participants with walking fast mode in the cinema was 1 36 m s which had increased by 12 compared to the speed of scenario 2 according to the interview after the experiments we know that they are familiar with the evacuation path and just follow the path they chose in scenario 2 they were stooped and their noses are covered by hands they hoped to escape from the smoke environment as soon as possible so they speeded up their pace the movement speed of running is varied due to the different distribution of participants in the three scenarios we use the paired sample t test to compare the speed of the main decks in three separate scenarios for participants with initial positions on b and a decks as shown in table 7 and table 8 there was no statistically valid difference in movement speed of participants primarily from a deck but the results of the participants with initial positions on the b deck was exactly the opposite it is because in the three scenarios the participants from a deck first arrived at main deck with only several persons at the end of the queue meeting the people from b deck and mezzanine deck so the overall average speed of the participants from a deck had not been significantly affected and p 0 05 in scenario 2 nearly half of the participants initially from b deck encountered the people from mezzanine deck on main deck so they slowed down with the speed changed from 2 6 m s to 2 21 m s in scenario 3 when the person from b deck first came to main deck the participants initially from the cabins of mezzanine deck had arrived at main deck because they did not have return behavior as a result the average speed of participants primarily from b deck reduced to 1 95 m s 4 4 comparisons of route choice when selecting an evacuation route participants usually consider the layout of the building the occupant density and the impact of smoke in fig 1 are the exits and the most chosen routes of each deck visualized in our experiments the participants are working in the platform so that they are very familiar with the evacuation routes of the platform as shown in table 9 in the three scenarios all of the participants chose route 8 on b deck and route 7 on a deck because they are usually familiar with the stair 1 and their initial position is near to the it as shown in fig 1 there are three routes for participants on main deck participants who arrived at main deck using stair 1 can choose route 10 or route 11 to the final temporary refuge the others who arrived at main deck from stair 2 all chose route 9 for 120 participants in scenario 1 the majority 67 of the participants escaped following route 9 and a smaller quantity 33 evacuated with route 10 conversely in scenario 2 only 37 of the participants chose route 9 while most 62 of them were like to evacuate through route 10 besides there were other 2 person chose route 11 by analyzing the video and bluetooth positioning data we find that the two persons were initially from a deck and always at the end of the evacuation queue when they reached main deck they encountered the crowd from mezzanine deck at last they chose route 11 which is the longest one among the three routes to avoid congestion table 10 and fig 9 shows the changes of route choice in mezzanine deck according to the propagation of smoke participants in mezzanine deck were mostly concentrated in the cinema and cabins in scenario 1 without smoke all of them chose to evacuate by using stair 2 which is wider than stair 1 and used more frequently in their daily life in scenario 2 with smoke some participants changed their original paths during the evacuation for those people initially from the cinema the majority 64 of them evacuated following route 2 about 24 12 persons of participants from the cinema chose route 4 at the beginning but half of them finally returned back to escape by using the stair 2 through route 3 when they encountered the crowd from the cabins in the corridor for participants initially from the cabins 80 of them just started their evacuation with route 6 like scenario 1 when the people at the front of the queue saw the smoke at the coffee lounge they stayed in place with hesitation and spread the information to other people and finally 60 of people returned back and chose route 5 this shows that people are afraid of the smoke environment during the evacuation and do not want to run across the smoke area even if the area is close to the exit in scenario 3 a larger quantity 80 of participants initially located in the cinema evacuated through route 2 compared to the quantity that chose route 3 20 all of the participants from the cabins chose route 5 as fig 12 shown the evacuation trajectory of people in the coffee lounge is different during the three scenarios in scenario 2 all of the participants like to evacuate along the sofa near the entrance of the cinema where the density of smoke is relatively lower than other area according to the interview after the experiments it may be due to people s psychological pressure on smoke so that people wanted to stay away from the area with thick smoke in the coffee lounge for another side smoke decreased the visibility of the environment so that the participants couldn t see the path clearly they evacuated along the edge of the obstacles to assist them to find the evacuation paths better this phenomenon is in agreement with the experiment results in previous isobe s studies isobe et al 2004 in scenario 3 everyone in mezzanine deck went straight to their target exists and no one hesitated and returned back they were familiar with the paths so that they ran faster though the visibility in the coffee lounge is less than 1 m from the observation of the experimental video some typical behaviors during the evacuation in smoke are found such as leader behavior ma et al 2017 following behavior cao et al 2018 and small group behavior xie et al 2018 which play an important role in influencing the choice of the evacuation paths in scenario 2 when the participants from cinema encountered the crowd from cabins at the corner of the corridor they shared the information with the participants from cabins that the lounge was filled with smoke which caused the evacuation of the people from cabins in the corridor to slow down even in a state of stagnation at this time a person just like the leader of the crowd said loudly go there go to the place without smoke most of the participants followed him to evacuate by stair 1 this phenomenon is also called following behavior for example as fig 11 shown one person ran toward the lounge at the beginning but later changed his direction to the cabins after the leader said the words as shown in table 10 60 of participants initially from cabins in mezzanine deck changed their evacuation direction to avoid being harmed by smoke because of following behavior so we believe once people know the route they chose is filled with the smoke after sharing the information with each other they will change their direction to another safe routes which can be applied in the later evacuation model the following behavior under limited visibility is beneficial for evacuation for those who cannot find the path in smoking environment in addition among the participants initially from cabins there were a small number of people who insist on the initial direction and didn t return back we are surprised that they evacuated with a group containing 5 persons and the speed of them was similar according to the video we find that their initial positions are in the same cabin which indicated the people from one cabin are more likely to evacuate together evacuation with the group can help them keep the speed relatively stable and fast in a smoke environment and more easily to find the exit 5 questionnaires before and after the experiments 120 participants were asked to fill out two questionnaires in total the questionnaires mainly investigated three parts including the basic characteristics of the personnel the psychological state of evacuation in the fire and the evacuation behavior in the experiments some useful results are obtained from the statistical analysis of the questionnaires 5 1 participants characteristics and behavior most participants 72 assert they are not emotional in their daily lives which means that they can effectively control his emotions keep calm and make decisions quickly when facing a dangerous situation the majority 95 of the participants have received education and training about fire evacuation before 98 of them were very familiar with the distribution of the evacuation paths on the platform so that they could find the evacuation paths easily and evacuated in an orderly manner with the results of questionnaires before the experiments 72 of the participants were inclined to follow others around them and chose the exit that most of people around them had chosen in scenario 2 of the experiments up to 88 chose this which is higher than the data from the questionnaires before the experiments almost all of the people 95 expected to wait in line when they encountered congestion in evacuation while in scenario 2 only 87 5 of people did it according to the questionnaires before the experiments when they were in the smoke environment about 44 of them were stooped and 55 of the people wanted to return back and look for new paths but in the experiments 92 of them chose to look for other new paths which is much higher than the results of questionnaires in addition we also find in the questionnaires after the experiments that some people mentioned they had passed through the smoke area but in actual experiments not it shows that the method of questionnaires to study the evacuation performance of people is limited the results of questionnaires cannot fully reflect the real performance of people in the evacuation process in addition we also investigated the most difficult area where the participants can easily feel scared and stressed when evacuating or moving forward as table 11 shown 51 of them thought the stairway is the most difficult area the stairs on the platform are sharper and narrower than those on the land where people gathered from each floor the second one mentioned very frequently is the turn of a corridor where people must change their direction and perhaps encountered others from the left or right direction that will caused the collision easily and make them feel stressed 10 of the participants chose the doors to the stairs which is another important area where people gathered into the staircases and always easily cause the congestion in addition other participants pointed out that the cinema exists stair landing and the exit to temporary refuge are also the relatively difficult area during the evacuation these areas can be considered for the future design of offshore platform with some research methods for example we can find a relatively good value for the width of the stairs through a series of evacuation simulations 5 2 influence of personal features on performance in evacuation we want to find the relationship between the personnel characteristics and evacuation performance from the statistical results of the questionnaire from the data we speculate that the blood type personality of participants and fire drill experience may be related to people s evacuation behavior as shown in tables 12 14 which has been published by our research team in the previous reports qi 2019 73 of people with a blood type 33 persons prefer to evacuate immediately after hearing the fire alarm without confirming the truth of the fire or observing other people s reactions which is higher than the average value 52 of 120 we have gotten while only 38 9 of people with o blood type 36 persons prefer to evacuate immediately after hearing the fire alarm what s more 96 4 of the people with a blood type chose not to return to pick up things which exceeded the average value that we have counted for people with a 26 persons or ab blood type 12 persons they are inclined to maintain a distance of 30 50 cm from the wall and others during the evacuation process we can get more details about the evacuation performance of people with other blood type from tables 12 14 about 20 of people with emotional personality whose emotions are easily affected by others prefer to return to pick up things the percentage of which is higher than people with rational personality 3 7 in addition when other people ran slower they are easily dissatisfied with the evacuation speed of others which is not good for a safe evacuation among those people who have the experience of fire drill 87 9 of them 114 persons will try to put out the fire in the early stages of the fire which indicates that having the experience of the fire drill can greatly improve the psychological quality and social responsibility in the fire facing the fire 97 of them will feel nervous but not panic so that they can judge the environment calmly they are more willing to obey the order keep a certain distance from the people around them and help others when they encounter the counterflow crowd they slow down their speed however those people who don t have experienced the fire drill are inclined to avoid the crowd and return to look for new paths which can easily cause congestion and collision from the data of speed we measured and the behavior of people in the video the entire evacuation process is efficient and orderly the results are consistent with what we observed in the experiment in addition we tried to calculate the p values which is known as hypothesis testing to help us explore the relationship between the personnel characteristics and evacuation performance the p stands for probability and measures how likely it is that any observed difference between groups is due to chance it measures the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis by convention the cut off between a large and a small p value is set at 0 05 when the p value is below 0 05 the results is generally referred to as being statistically significant akobeng and anthony 2016 as shown in table 15 the results indicate that the relationship is statistically significant between people s evacuation behavior and the blood type personality of participants fire drill experience however the use of a cut off for statistical significance based on a purely arbitrary value can easily lead to a misleading conclusion of accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis akobeng and anthony 2016 the results can be affected by many factors such as the sample size and the social backgrounds of participants the sample size of our experiments is just 120 persons which is not large enough all of the participants are made up of the workers of the platforms the social background of which is so single that cannot represent other social groups we need to consider the possibility of type i and ii errors a large scale surveys in japan and the us show that there is no relationship between blood type and human behavior kengo 2014 the result of which is contrary to our results if we get the conclusion that the relationship between the blood type and people s evacuation behavior is significant we may have made the type i error similarly we cannot determine the relationship between the personality of participants and people s evacuation behavior because of type i error but we believe our results have reference value for the evacuation of offshore platforms fire drill experience is considered to be related to the people s evacuation which is proved by many researcher kobes et al 2010 the results is also consistent with ours in addition due to the lack of the sample size we may have missed some meaningful conclusions which belongs to the type ii errors more experiments with larger sample size and people of different backgrounds are needed to do in our later work to find them 6 conclusions this research is mainly to analyze the evacuation performance of people in the smoke situation on the offshore platform we compared the movement speed route choice and evacuation time which are different in the three different scenarios and finally we obtained several qualitative and quantitative features from the experiments these features are summarized as follows 1 we measured the speed of running in corridors and stairs during our experiments without smoke the speed of running in corridor without smoke was between 1 91 m s and 2 3 m s when the occupant density is in the range of 1 3 per m 2 to 1 9 per m 2 and the speed of them going downstairs and upstairs without smoke was between 1 26 and 1 27 m s and 0 95 1 03 m s respectively the speed of walking fast without smoke in the corridor was about 1 65 m s which have a good fit with the value of speed given by the imo which recommend that the speed of male crews should be in the range of 1 11 1 85 m s the participants regularly participate in relevant escape drills in their work and can adjust their steps in time to avoid congestion which can be distinguished from the non trained personnel our results can help the imo guidelines to be revised in the future 2 normally when people are in a smoke situation smoke can hinder their vision which will affect their judgment about the environment around them and thus reduce the speed of participants but if they are familiar with the environment and the routes of evacuation their speed can be higher than the speed in the situations without smoke in scenario 2 the mean speed of the participants initially from mezzanine deck was 1 34 m s which was 24 lower than 1 78 m s in scenario 1 without smoke when the visibility is more than 3 m the mean movement speed of participants with walking fast mode in mezzanine deck is about 1 61 m s with the smoke spreading continuously when the visibility is less than 3 m the mean movement speed of participants with walking fast mode in mezzanine deck decreased to 0 95 m s but in scenario 3 it increased to 1 36 m s even though the smoke gets thicker we believe that it is due to the participants good familiarity with the environment and the psychological urgency of wanting escape from the smoke environment as soon as quickly however in the realistic thick smoke environments the irritating gases and high temperatures of the smoke are harmful to the human body which makes it difficult for people to go faster than in the situation with thin smoke we only considered the impact of visibility on the evacuation speed in these experiments 1 under normal circumstances people like to choose the path they are most familiar with for evacuation but when people evacuated in a smoke environment they would change their initial direction to return back according to the propagation of smoke to stay away from the area with smoke as much as possible 2 when people escape from the smoke environment to a new environment without smoke people will still keep vigilant and anxious for a while and continue to move forward quickly the speed of which can be faster than the speed in the same environment without smoke we can know it from the value of speed about going upstairs in scenario 3 which had reached 1 37 m s it is much larger than that of scenario 2 in the same stair 3 we find that following behavior and small group behavior is obvious under smoke situations which can alleviate their psychological stress relatively and help them find the exits more easily and when in the smoke environment people are more likely to evacuate along the edge of the obstacles to help them find paths which is consistent with previous studies isobe et al 2004 4 we investigated the characteristics of every participants through the questionnaires the majority of them have received good training about the fire evacuation and most of them think themselves are rational in their daily lives we think that is the reason why their speed is faster than normal people and they can evacuate in an orderly manner relatively in addition the results of the questionnaires analysis also show that the stairs on the platform the turn of corridor and the doors to the stairs are considered to be the most difficult section to evacuate or move forward for participants which is needed to pay attention in future design of the offshore platform what s more we explored the relationship between the personnel characteristics and evacuation performance with the help of the p value and discussed the possibility of type i and ii errors this study offers valuable evacuation data which is helpful to understand the evacuation performance and may serve to develop suggestions for improving the efficiency of evacuation under fire on the offshore platforms it is noted that the area used by our experiments only involves the three layers of the offshore platforms and we didn t consider the influence of the evacuation sign on the route more experiments about them should be performed in the future funding this work is being funded by ministry of industry and information technology treasury of china research and development of

21473,results of a series of uniaxial tests to investigate fracture initiation states of ah32 steel a ship structural steel are presented strains at fracture are obtained using digital image correlation analysis via davis lavision software and the corresponding states of stress are obtained via a plastic flow rule and a hardening relationship using the measured strains the strain fields are calculated to the point of fracture initiation where the fracture initiation is defined as the condition when the first visible crack appears in the digital image of the test specimen the software provides displacement and strain fields of the entire region and any specified sub region of the imaged surface which uses a so called geometric mask the strain values are mask size dependent due to the local nature of deformation before fracture therefore in the current study strain fields are obtained for various mask sizes to investigate the effect of mask size on failure strain i e strain localization phenomena with the minimum mask size chosen at roughly the limit of the continuum scale o 100 μm the evolution of the stress and strain fields as a function of loading is provided for different mask sizes moreover comparison of the failure strain as mask sizes are decreased provides information on strain convergence in this investigation non convergence behaviors are obtained for all experiments as failure strain increased as the mask sizes are decreased keywords fracture plasticity ductility digital image correlation scale effect ah32 steel 1 introduction as computer technology has advanced it has become possible to simulate impact and assess the energy absorption capacity of large complicated structures common vehicular structures such as ships and offshore structures aircrafts and automobiles typically are composed of thin walled components their structural designs take advantage of high stiffness to weight ratios leading to cost effective and energy efficient performance the safety of such structures depends in large part on the system s ability to withstand extreme loading events such as collision see e g calle and alves 2015 yu et al 2019 accidental impact from other objects see e g ji and oterkus 2018 jiang et al 2019 and in some cases explosions see e g gan et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 also during forming processes the structure s capacity to deform to prescribed shapes while maintaining integrity is essential thus predictive capability for examining structural deformation limits has become increasingly important in industrial design environments however loading to failure especially ductile failure remains an open question a criterion for brittle fracture usually requires the current state of stress whereas ductile fracture depends on the history of the state of stress and strain moreover the underlying mechanisms of ductile fracture are very complex the micro mechanism of ductile fracture can be categorized under three modes at high stress triaxiality large primary voids are formed with little or no nucleation of secondary voids these voids grow and coalesce to form microcracks this failure mode is referred as internal necking on the other hand at low stress triaxiality primary voids remain small and void nucleation is often observed in narrow bands of secondary voids this failure mode is often called as void sheeting besson 2010 at intermediate levels of stress triaxiality however these two modes may compete or co operate barsoum and faleskog 2007 the simulation of the deformation and eventual fracture of structural materials are fundamentally important and have received considerable attention at the micro scale pioneering ductile fracture models were developed by mcclintock 1968 rice and tracey 1969 needleman 1972 and gurson 1977 for void growth and coalescence on the other hand at the macro scale the most popular approach for the initiation of ductile fracture of metals is to establish the limiting equivalent strain to material failure based on the stress state the state of stress may be expressed in terms of the second deviatoric stress invariant and the mean stress e g stress triaxiality for two dimensional state of stress conditions and the third deviatoric stress invariant e g lode parameter as well for three dimensional state of stress conditions such proposals for characterizing ductile failure have been studied extensively and the following paragraph summarizes commonly used experimental measurement methods in ductile fracture of metals one forensic method of obtaining the failure strain is measuring the diameter or thickness of the fractured specimen see e g hancock and mackenzie 1976 mirza et al 1996 fourmeau et al 2013 frodal et al 2017 another method of obtaining the failure strain is using the experimental load deformation record substituted into the derived mathematical formulation of strain i e hybrid experimental analytical analysis see e g barsoum and faleskog 2007 another widely used approach to post process experimental results is extracting stress and strain fields from the corresponding finite element models that is hybrid experimental numerical analysis see e g bao and wierzbicki 2004 bonora et al 2005 bai and wierzbicki 2010 dunand and mohr 2010 luo et al 2012 fourmeau et al 2013 roth and mohr 2014 wang et al 2014 papasidero et al 2015 lou et al 2017 ha et al 2018 cerik et al 2019a gu et al 2020 in this approach both local stress and strain depend on the results of the finite element analyses and are not measured during experiments therefore the reliability of the results is strongly affected by the reliability of the numerical simulation lou et al 2017 sedmak 2018 an accurate measurement of strain can be obtained by use of an electrical resistance strain gauge however this method cannot be used for large strain measurements e g failure fracture strain as its range is generally limited to strain of 0 02 zhu et al 2015 moreover strain gauges only provide single point measurements that is full field measurement is not possible therefore in this study a direct measure of strain is obtained by digital image correlation dic strains are obtained by analyzing digital images that are recorded during the experiments with a phantom v710 high speed camera via davis lavision software davis 2015 the state of stress is calculated directly rather than through a numerical simulation by using a power law hardening relationship a plastic flow rule and the measured strains fracture initiation is defined as the condition when the first visible crack appears in the digital image of the test specimen the maximum correlation between interrogation windows in digital image correlation analyses corresponds to the displacement and this gives the vector length and direction for each window accordingly the choice of interrogation window size also known as subset size of a digital image correlation analyses is crucial and its effect on the analysis results has been studied extensively see e g schreier and sutton 2002 knauss et al 2003 yaofeng and pang 2007 pan et al 2008 reu 2014 2015a 2015b xu et al 2015a hassan et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 schreier and sutton 2002 investigated the error in displacement and strain as a function of interrogation window size for first and second order shape functions knauss et al 2003 investigated the error in displacement for various interrogation window sizes as well they also studied whether the addition of a second order displacement gradient improves the results later yaofeng pang 2007 introduced a parameter called subset entropy and they studied the interaction between subset entropy and interrogation window size whereas pan et al 2008 proposed an algorithm to choose the proper interrogation window size based on an accuracy model of the displacement measurement in a series of articles reu 2014 2015a 2015b discussed the minimum required interrogation window size with respect to the amount of speckle xu et al 2015a investigated the impact of subset size as well as shape functions on the accuracy of local deformation measurements e g plc bands hassan et al 2016 and zhang et al 2017 proposed a dynamic subset selection algorithm to optimize the subset size for each local pattern of region of interest in the current investigation multi pass interrogation windows decreasing in size from 256 pixels by 256 pixels to 8 pixels by 8 pixels are used in every case the final interrogation window implemented is a constant 8 pixels by 8 pixels the dic software provides displacement and strain fields of the entire region and any specified sub region of the imaged surface which is called a geometric mask a geometric mask is very similar to the finite element mesh concept hence the strain values are mask size dependent due to the local nature of deformation before fracture therefore in the current study strain fields are obtained for various mask sizes to investigate the effect of mask size on strain thus the objective of the current study is the investigation of the mask size on the initiation of ductile fracture at the continuum scale to further the understanding on the evolution of the nonlinear stress and strain states leading to ductile fracture moreover this study is to provide key parameters for predicting fracture of ductile materials in general and thus assist in the guidance of criteria development for materials other than that specifically addressed here the remainder of the article is as follows section 2 briefly describes dic and presents the experimental set up while section 3 contains the relevant continuum mechanics equations thereafter the uniaxial test results are presented in section 4 and the conclusions and discussion follow in section 5 2 experimental techniques and set up 2 1 digital image correlation digital image correlation dic is an optical image processing technique that uses mathematical tools to generate the difference between two digital images a possibly un deformed reference state image and a deformed state image for example the digital image correlation technique was developed at the university of south carolina in the early 1980s pan et al 2009 pan 2018 however it is worth noting that the fundamental notions are based on particle image velocimetry piv developed for fluid mechanics research the restriction to in plane deformation measurement is the main disadvantage of 2d dic compared to 3d dic also called stereo dic for quasi 3d and digital volume correlation for full 3d however having an easier experimental set up and faster recording and processing times i e less cost make 2d dic practical and useful this is the method used throughout the error of 2d dic due to out of plane motion both out of plane translation and out of plane rotation was formulated and examined experimentally by sutton et al 2008 in the experiments presented here these errors are very small compared to large plastic fracture strains and neglect of them affects the fracture strain calculation little hence they are ignored the impact of lens distortion on strain measurements was studied by lava et al 2013 in addition to their study of the influence of lens distortion on rigid body translation rigid body rotation and a uniaxial tensile test of a textile composite at low strain levels lava et al 2013 also investigated the influence of lens distortion at large strain levels on a uniaxial tensile test of ss304 steel as can clearly be seen from fig 13 of the cited reference the impact of lens distortion on strain measurements loses its importance and becomes negligible after approximately 1 5 2 0 strain in the fracture experiments presented here the strains are much larger and therefore such adverse effects of lens distortion are negligible 2 2 experimental setup all experiments are conducted at room temperature with ah32 steel which is commonly used in ship hull structures test specimens are machined by northwest tool of jackson mi use of digital image correlation requires a random pattern on the specimen surface as a carrier of deformation information pan et al 2010 dong and pan 2017 therefore all specimens are etched to create a random surface pattern for the digital image correlation analysis specimens are immersed in a 2 nital solution for a few hours to reveal the substructure of the material in the etching process a mixture of methanol and nitric acid is used as an alternative formulation as a mixture of ethanol and nitric acid is potentially explosive two uniaxial tests the uniaxial tests of a shear specimen and a 1in width specimen with semi circular groove are performed using a custom designed and built c clamp mechanism which is depicted in fig 1 a the c clamp is capable of experiencing a 7000 lbs 31176 n load exerted via its 7 1 lead screw the test specimen seen in fig 1a is a shear specimen note that the shear specimen is adapted from bao and wierzbicki s 2004 design for pure shear tests and the dimensions of the adapted specimen are provided in reyes et al 2009 a lintech corporation custom designed linear positioning mechanism rs150025 s5 n3 w1 f4 m00 c000 e00 b00 l15 0 is used to perform the other two uniaxial tests the low and the high speed uniaxial tests of a 6 mm width specimen an example set up for these uniaxial tests can be seen in fig 1b the test specimen seen in fig 1b is a 6 mm width specimen which is obtained by in house machining of a 1in width specimen a high speed camera operating at 6000 frames per second fps or 7500 fps is used to record digital images of the specimens during the experiments the frame rate is chosen according to the imposed indenter displacement speed the imager is a phantom v710 vision research ametek with full 1200 pixels by 800 pixels frame recording to 7500 fps the total memory in the imager 44 5 gb is such that it can record 22 253 frames when recording 1200 pixels x 800 pixels the lens is a nikkor with a 105 mm focal distance and an f stop aperture of 2 8 influence of the pixel resolution on strain measurement was discussed by efstathiou et al 2010 in the current study the pixel resolution range of the experiments varies between 13 7 μm and 16 5 μm this range is chosen to obtain digital images having pixel resolutions of approximately one grain size such that approximate grain to grain strain variation can be observed with the entire mid region of the test specimen being captured jia et al 2013 and zhou et al 2016 provided average grain sizes of ah32 steels they used in their experimental investigations and these published data suggest that the average grain size of ah32 steel ranges from 5 μm to 25 μm depending on the cooling process system used therefore the pixel resolution range of the experiments is on the order of the grain size the effect of grain size on plastic deformation damage mechanism and fracture behavior of metals is beyond the scope of the current investigation and studied elsewhere see e g tasan et al 2014 xu et al 2015b a number of researchers have observed strong grain level strain heterogeneity see e g raabe et al 2001 zhang and tong 2004 héripré et al 2007 haltom et al 2013 banerjee et al 2016 in their experimental work and numerical analysis meaning that the localization may occur at very small scales therefore the current research also presents an investigation of the scale effect however smaller scales than the continuum scale are beyond the scope of this study true stress strain curves of a uniaxial test for ah32 steel are presented in fig 2 the tests are conducted using an mts machine with a gauge length of an extensometer of one inch the specimen used in the low speed tensile test is a 1in width specimen the initial tensile yield stress and the ultimate tensile strength of the material are obtained as 436 mpa and 585 mpa respectively the red solid line is obtained by using the data from the 1in width specimen the applied speed is 0 1 mm s 1 with a corresponding average strain rate of approximately 0 002 s 1 on the other hand the cyan dashed line and the green dotted line are obtained using the data from 18 mm width specimens applied speed for the cyan dashed line is approximately 38 1 mm s 1 with a corresponding average strain rate of 1 s 1 whereas the speed for the green dotted line is approximately 76 2 mm s 1 with a corresponding average strain rate of 2 s 1 although positive strain rate sensitivity may be expected in stress strain behavior of metals fig 2 does not agree with this expectation the reason that the 2 s 1 strain rate experiment has lower yield stress and ductility may be due to dynamic strain aging dsa phenomenon dsa results in serrations in the stress strain curve and it is affected by strain rate and temperature moreover negative strain rate sensitivity is another indication of dsa kabirian et al 2014 serrated flow and negative strain rate sensitivity can be observed in the stress strain behavior of 2 s 1 strain rate experiment and this supports the occurrence of dsa note that dsa has been observed in other marine steels as well see e g choung et al 2013 the primary aim of the experimental investigation is to explore the effects of the measurement scale and the state of stress on the fracture behavior of metals particularly ah32 steel another aim of the experimental program is to provide data for researchers for validation and verification of fracture models as the experimental data on the characterization of ductile fracture of marine structural steels are scarce cerik et al 2019b 3 strain and stress triaxiality calculation 3 1 strain calculation in the description of the experimental work fracture strain is established by digital image correlation analysis a sub region of interest which is called a geometric mask is introduced such that this masked region can be used to investigate a specific sub region of the imaged surface average strains within the masked region are obtained as fluctuations in the strain field due to polycrystalline microstructure and the noise of the dic measurements can be reduced by averaging papasidero et al 2014 strains are calculated to the point of fracture initiation as the continuum scale is the subject of interest the initiation of fracture is established by observing the digital images of the test specimen again the fracture initiation is defined as the condition when the first visible crack appears in the digital image of the test specimen strains are calculated in a backward stepping manner that is the last frame which is the digital image of the specimen at the point of fracture initiation is taken as the first step and from there time is reversed by using a previous image and so forth that is the first frame is the last step the difference between forward steps forward strain calculation and backward steps backward strain calculation is only the sign of displacement vector the primary reason for doing backward strain calculation is that the exact material position of the fracture region is known in the last frame and can then be traced backwards in time to its location before loading this procedure is repeated for various mask sizes masks are positioned such that the crack region remains within the mask the crack region remains at the center of the mask for all cases except large mask sizes in the shear specimen where it remains on the left of mask center the reason is that the crack in the shear specimen forms near the specimen boundary the minimum acceptable mask size which is 16 16 pixels is chosen such that the masked region is still on the continuum scale the number of grains required to develop a continuum scale occurs when the grains have random orientations in a macroscopic manner this number for polycrystalline aggregates e g steel aluminum etc is approximately twenty leis et al 1985 tegart 1966 3 1 1 calculation of forward plastic strain the components of backward natural strain are defined as seymen et al 2016 1 ε i j b w 1 2 ln 1 2 e i j b w where e i j b w denote green lagrangian strain tensor and is given as 2 e i j b w 1 2 u i j u j i u m i u m j the current analysis only utilize surface displacement gradients that is i j m 1 2 let the backward natural strain and forward natural strain components of the last frame which is the digital image of the specimen at the point of fracture initiation be denoted as ε i j b w 1 and ε i j f w n respectively similarly let the backward natural strain and forward natural strain components of the first frame which is the digital image of the unstrained specimen be denoted as ε i j b w n and ε i j f w 1 respectively obviously ε i j b w 1 0 as this is the first step in the backward sense ε i j f w 1 0 as this is the first step in the forward sense and ε i j f w n ε i j b w n as natural strains are summable therefore the forward natural strain components are calculated in the following manner 3 ε i j f w k ε i j b w n ε i j b w n k 1 where k 1 2 n note that the natural strain increments d ε i j are components of a tensor hence transformation rules can be applied on the other hand natural strains ε i j are not components of a tensor malvern 1969 hence transformation rules cannot be applied 3 1 2 calculation of equivalent fracture strain the equivalent strain increment can be obtained by substituting forward natural strain increments into the expression 4 d ε e q p 2 3 d ε i j p d ε i j p where d ε i j p are the components of the plastic strain increment tensor as the surface that is considered in dic analysis is free of stress a state of plane stress is established hence σ 33 σ 13 σ 23 0 using the flow rule yields d ε 13 p d ε 23 p 0 moreover as the plastic strains are much greater than the elastic strains the elastic part of the total strain and the total strain increment can be neglected that is 5 d ε i j d ε i j p and ε i j ε i j p hence the total strain increment d ε i j obtained by dic analysis can be taken as the plastic strain increment d ε i j p in the above formulation i e in equation 4 therefore the equivalent strain increment yields the form 6 d ε e q 2 3 d ε 11 2 d ε 22 2 d ε 33 2 2 d ε 12 2 where d ε 11 d ε 22 and d ε 33 are the normal strain increments and d ε 12 is the shear strain increment strain increments on the surface d ε 11 d ε 22 and d ε 12 are computed by using the result of the dic analysis and equation 1 through equation 3 strain increment in the third direction the thickness direction is obtained by using the incompressibility d ε 11 d ε 22 d ε 33 0 that is 7 d ε 33 d ε 11 d ε 22 two different strain increment approaches can be applied in the calculation of equivalent strain the state of stress and the stress triaxiality in the first approach the strain increments are from the un deformed state to the current state whereas in the second approach strains are obtained by taking strain increments from the previous state to the current state 8 1 st approach ε e q k ε e q 1 d ε e q k 1 d ε e q k 1 9 2 nd approach ε e q k ε e q k 1 d ε e q k k 1 where k is the step number i e k 1 2 n moreover d ε e q q s represents the equivalent strain increment from step s to step q the only difference between the two approaches is the amount of strain increment considered these two approaches would lead to similar results for the cases of proportional loading for the cases of non proportional loading however the use of smaller strain increments that is the second approach is expected to provide more reliable results as the stress strain relationships i e the flow rule are based on the linear incremental relationships roth and mohr 2016 conducted numerical simulations to establish the optimum specimen geometry providing proportional loading histories at a given stress triaxiality nevertheless the experimental results indicate that proportional loading is generally not the case therefore only the results of the second approach will be presented here the reader is referred to akcay 2016 for a presentation of more comprehensive comparisons between the two approaches in this article fracture strain and failure strain are used interchangeably and they correspond to equivalent strain at fracture 3 2 stress calculation stress triaxiality and the state of stress are calculated using the measured strains by applying a plastic flow rule and a power law hardening relationship isotropic plasticity is utilized as mechanical properties of marine structural steels usually do not exhibit significant directional dependency see e g nemat nasser and guo 2003 cerik et al 2019a park et al 2019 3 2 1 calculation of stress triaxiality applying the flow rule for a plastic material desai and siriwardane 1984 the plastic strain increments are related to the true stress components as 10 d ε 11 p 2 3 λ σ 11 1 2 σ 22 σ 33 11 d ε 22 p 2 3 λ σ 22 1 2 σ 11 σ 33 12 d ε 12 p λ σ 12 where λ is a non negative scalar factor and may vary throughout the loading history define ψ 1 and ψ 2 as the ratios of the strain increments i e 13 d ε 22 ψ 1 d ε 11 14 d ε 12 ψ 2 d ε 11 using the flow rule expressions above these expressions can be utilized to obtain stress components for the case of the plane stress condition i e σ 33 σ 13 σ 23 0 15 σ 22 1 2 ψ 1 2 ψ 1 σ 11 16 σ 12 ψ 2 2 ψ 1 σ 11 the von mises equivalent stress for the plane stress condition is defined as 17 σ e q σ 11 2 σ 11 σ 22 σ 22 2 3 σ 12 2 substituting expressions for σ 22 equation 15 and σ 12 equation 16 into σ e q equation 17 yields 18 σ e q ψ e q t e n s i l e σ 11 where 19 ψ e q t e n s i l e 3 1 ψ 1 ψ 1 2 ψ 2 2 2 ψ 1 2 note that as the components of the stress state are expressed in terms of σ 11 and the sign of ψ e f f t e n s i l e is chosen positive i e tension in 1 1 direction 1 1 direction should be chosen in the direction of positive tensile loading however the state of stress should be expressed in terms of σ 12 for the shear test as the loading is dominated in the 1 2 direction 20 σ e q ψ e q s h e a r σ 12 where 21 ψ e q s h e a r 3 1 ψ 1 ψ 1 2 ψ 2 2 ψ 2 2 in addition the mean stress for the plane stress condition is 22 σ m 1 ψ 1 2 ψ 1 σ 11 or σ m 1 ψ 1 ψ 2 σ 12 finally the stress triaxiality can then be calculated as 23 η σ m σ e q 1 ψ 1 3 1 ψ 1 ψ 1 2 ψ 2 2 3 2 2 calculation of average stress triaxiality the average stress triaxiality is obtained by dividing the area under the equivalent strain stress triaxiality curve by the equivalent strain at fracture that is 24 η a v e 1 ε e q f 0 ε e f f f η d ε e q this integration is carried out numerically by using the trapezoidal rule note that as the stress triaxiality is not defined for the unloaded condition calculations and figures for the stress triaxiality are provided after the first loading point 3 2 3 obtaining the state of stress constitutive relationships can be expressed as in the form of following power law hardening relationship 25 σ e q ω ε e q n where ω is the strength coefficient n is the hardening exponent and the ε e q is the equivalent strain also the equivalent stress can be written in the form of equation 18 ψ e q t e n s i l e ψ 1 and ψ 2 can be obtained by equation 19 equation 13 and equation 14 respectively therefore the power law hardening relationship can be written as 26 σ 11 1 ψ e q t e n s i l e ω ε e q n the other two components of the true stress tensor i e σ 22 and σ 12 can be obtained from equation 15 and equation 16 respectively however the following relationship is used when the equivalent stress is expressed in terms of the shear stress σ 12 that is for the uniaxial test of the shear specimen 27 σ 12 1 ψ e q s h e a r ω ε e q n similarly the other two components of the stress tensor i e σ 11 and σ 22 can be obtained from equation 16 and equation 15 respectively finally the power law hardening parameters are computed as ω 868 4 mpa and n 0 128 by using the stress strain data from the uniaxial test the maximum load is 23598 n with the corresponding true stress and true strain of 667 2 mpa and 0 128 respectively hence the hardening exponent is obtained as n 0 128 moreover applying the hardening law with ε e q n 0 128 and σ e q 667 2 mpa gives a strength coefficient of ω 868 4 mpa 3 2 4 discussion on plane stress assumption equivalent strains and stress states in the current article are determined assuming the plane stress condition in contrast to the general belief that the plane stress assumption is appropriate to determine equivalent strain to fracture only for specific types of loading conditions see e g roth and mohr 2016 equivalent strain to fracture utilizing the plane stress assumption can be determined for various types of loading conditions see e g lou et al 2014 roth and mohr 2016 proposed that the plane stress assumption can be appropriate only for the cases of shear plane strain tension and equi biaxial tension loading conditions in their investigation roth and mohr 2016 investigated only four types of loading conditions i e shear plane strain tension and equi biaxial tension and uniaxial tension however the study of lou et al 2014 demonstrated that various types of loading conditions including compression shear combined shear and tension combined torsion and tension and uniaxial tension of a flat specimen a plate with circular hole and a pipe can result in plane stress fracture see table 1 of that article therefore one can infer that utilization of plane stress assumption in order to determine equivalent strain to fracture is not restricted to particular loading conditions however this statement does not mean that plane stress assumption can be utilized for any type of loading condition moreover the focus of the present study is on thin metal plating while bulk materials are beyond the scope of the present research in conclusion the authors believe that the plane stress assumption is reasonable herein including the cases of uniaxial tension of the flat specimen and the grooved specimen as the thicknesses of the specimens are very small compared to the other two dimensions in fact very good agreement between the data from the uniaxial test with the mts machine and the dic results see the result for the 1024 pixels by 256 pixels mask in section 4 1 1 where mts data and dic results are compared supports this assumption on the other hand there exist cases where a specimen can fail in the interior first if a specimen fails in the interior first determined equivalent strains based on surface strains i e 2d dic may not correspond to the exact failure strains hence 2d dic needs to be used cautiously in those cases however discussions of the mask size are valid regardless of the fracture initiation state of the entire specimen in other words the mask size is investigated on the surface of the material which must be in a state of plane stress 4 uniaxial test results uniaxial tests are conducted for three different specimen geometries all stresses presented in this section are the true stresses and all strains are the natural true strains unless otherwise stated moreover the subscript 11 corresponds to the longitudinal direction of the specimen and the subscript 22 corresponds to the width direction 4 1 analysis of 6 mm width specimen dic analyses are conducted for two different test speeds for this particular specimen type and they are presented in the following sub sections 4 1 1 test 1 this specimen is obtained by in house machining of an 18 mm width specimen the width of the specimen is reduced to capture the entire mid region during imaging a test speed of 0 2 inch second 5 08 mm s 1 is applied to the end of the test specimen with 6000 digital images recorded per second for this experiment the pixel resolution is approximately 16 5 μm per pixel note that the high speed camera and the experimental device are snychronized in this experiment three frames from the video recording are presented in fig 3 the vertical direction and the horizontal direction are the width direction and the longitudinal direction of the specimen respectively the regions depicted in each sub figure are approximately 645 665 pixels by 370 390 pixels diffuse necking starts around frame 5000 while fracture initiates around frame 7200 that is following an approximately 6 096 mm horizontal extension and cracks are clearly visible in frame 7441 as presented in fig 3b interestingly however as can be seen from frame 7443 and frame 7445 which are shown in fig 3c and fig 3d respectively fracture progresses rapidly in a different region than where the first macroscopic cracks are seen as one of the goals herein is to investigate the effects of length scale the images are analyzed using varying mask sizes the evolution of the natural strain and the equivalent strain within the masked region during the uniaxial test for different mask sizes are presented in fig 4 a and fig 4b the shear strain is zero or nearly zero for all mask sizes until the initiation of fracture i e frame 7200 where the analysis is curtailed assuming that the material is incompressible when the ratio of the transverse strain increment to the longitudinal strain increment is 0 50 the strain increment in the longitudinal direction and the equivalent strain increment exactly overlap if the shear strain increment is zero this overlap can be identified approximately in all mask sizes of the current analysis as the ratio of the transverse strain increment to the longitudinal strain increment is close to 0 50 moreover both the transverse strain ε 22 and the longitudinal strain ε 11 have relatively smaller slope until frame 1000 the reason for this behavior is that the specimen is likely still in the elastic region and or the elastic plastic transition region considering that poisson s ratio of steel is around 0 30 in the elastic range and having transverse to longitudinal strain ratios of 0 27 for 16 pixels by 16 pixels mask 0 33 for 32 pixels by 32 pixels mask 0 39 for 64 pixels by 64 pixels mask 0 35 for 128 pixels by 128 pixels mask and 0 24 for 192 pixels by 192 pixels mask support this view in fact as can be seen in the stress strain curve presented in fig 10 the corresponding point of frame 1000 lies on the elastic plastic transition region furthermore the longitudinal strain and the equivalent strain have nearly constant slope between frame 1000 and frame 5000 with the slope begins increasing around frame 5000 where diffuse necking starts finally it is worth noting the progressively increasing transverse strains for example for the 16 pixels by 16 pixels mask the transverse strain at frame 5000 is 0 082 while it reaches 0 258 at frame 7200 where fracture initiates the evolution of the true stress and the stress triaxiality within the masked region during the uniaxial test for different mask sizes are depicted in fig 5 and fig 6 the average stress triaxiality ranges between 0 34 and 0 37 and the stress triaxiality at fracture is higher than the theoretical stress triaxiality value of the purely uniaxial state which is 1 3 for all mask sizes the shear stress is zero or nearly zero for the larger mask sizes which represent more global behavior after frame 2000 however it is interesting to note the stress fluctuations at smaller mask sizes which represent more local behavior on the other hand stress fluctuations vanish as more global behavior is followed i e larger mask sizes as discussed in detail in akcay 2016 the authors believe that these fluctuations are due to plastic flow localization the sign of stress and stress triaxiality fluctuations first appear for the 64 pixels by 64 pixels mask and likewise it is seen that the magnitude of the fluctuations increases as the mask size is decreased note that the von mises stress has the same quantitative behavior both locally smaller mask sizes and more globally larger mask sizes as expected as the plastic constitutive and stress strain relationships that are used the hardening law and the flow rule are independent of a length scale in addition to the analysis above a very large mask size 1024 pixels by 256 pixels 16 896 mm 4 224 mm is investigated to explore the behavior of the entire region the size of the mask with respect to the specimen can be seen in fig 7 the red square represents the 32 pixels by 32 pixels mask whereas the blue rectangle represents the 1024 pixels by 256 pixels mask the image is obtained by davis lavision software and the color difference within the specimen is due to the variation of lighting intensity the evolution of the natural strain and the equivalent strain within the masked region during the uniaxial test for 1024 pixels by 256 pixel mask is presented in fig 4c the shear strain remains zero or nearly zero until the initiation of fracture i e frame 7200 where the analysis is curtailed moreover as the shear strain is nearly zero and the ratio of the strain increment in the transverse direction to the longitudinal direction is around 0 5 except for frame 1000 and after frame 7000 i e it ranges between 0 51 and 0 46 between frame 1000 and frame 6750 the strain in the longitudinal direction overlaps the equivalent strain this is because the global state of stress still experiences a nearly uniaxial stress state furthermore the hardening exponent n 0 128 computed by using the stress strain data from the uniaxial test with the mts machine agrees very well with the corresponding equivalent strain at frame 5000 see fig 4c where diffuse necking starts the uni directional stress strain curve σ 11 ε 11 curve nearly overlaps the equivalent stress strain curve von mises stress curve until frame 6750 however they then separate due to the development of the transverse stress σ 22 and the maximum difference with respect to uni directional stress is 7 2 which occurs at frame 7200 this supports the conclusion that the global state of stress still experiences a nearly uniaxial stress state until frame 6750 as discussed above therefore a global uni directional stress strain curve may be a fairly good representation of the global equivalent stress strain curve which is a general assumption in obtaining stress strain curves of materials through a conventional uniaxial test when the gauge length is sufficiently large compared to the localization zone nevertheless it is worth mentioning that global strains obtained by a conventional uniaxial test may not represent the actual strains in the localized zone the evolution of the longitudinal strain ε 11 and the transverse strain ε 22 for different mask sizes are presented in fig 8 both the transverse strain and the longitudinal strain are moderately affected by the mask size and the effect of mask size is more pronounced especially at later stages of the experiment for example the strain difference between the smallest and the largest mask size with respect to the largest mask size at the initiation of fracture i e at frame 7200 is 22 6 for the transverse strain whereas it is 27 1 for the longitudinal strain thus having different longitudinal and transverse strains for different mask sizes demonstrates that the strain is not exactly uniform within the neck region at the initiation of fracture however the percentages mentioned above are the maximum differences and that they are lower in the previous stages of the experiment hence uniform longitudinal strain and or uniform transverse strain assumptions may be reasonable depending on what stage of the uniaxial test is under consideration the evolution of the equivalent strain for the six scales studied from the results of this particular experiment is presented in fig 9 equivalent strains for all mask sizes except 1024 pixels by 256 pixels nearly overlap until after frame 4000 and then separation becomes clearer around frame 5000 where diffuse necking starts the most prominent feature of the figure as the experiment progresses is the increasing difference between the 1024 pixels by 256 pixels mask and the rest of the mask sizes this difference with respect to 1024 pixels by 256 pixels at the initiation of fracture i e at frame 7200 reaches 108 for the 192 pixels by 192 pixels mask and 168 for the 16 pixels by 16 pixels mask obviously global strains obtained by a conventional uniaxial test do not represent the actual strains in the localized zone as expected the average stress triaxiality η a v e the stress triaxiality at fracture η f r a c and the equivalent strain at fracture ε e q f are summarized in table 1 the equivalent strain at fracture increases as the mask size is decreased a sign of localization moreover the stress triaxiality at fracture and the average stress triaxiality increase as well as the mask size is decreased with the exception of 32 pixels by 32 pixels mask and 16 pixels by 16 pixels mask respectively finally the true stress strain curves for different mask sizes are presented together in fig 10 the flow rule and the power law hardening relationship with ω 868 4 mpa and n 0 128 are used to obtain the components of the stress tensor see section 3 2 for details of the dic analysis in addition the stress strain curve obtained via the mts machine is superposed on the same figure for comparison purposes solid lines with markers are obtained by the digital image correlation analysis whereas dashed lines are the results of the uniaxial test with the mts machine note that the dic analyses are conducted to the point of fracture initiation therefore the last marker of each color represents the fracture initiation point for different mask sizes the true stress strain curve in the figure is calculated based on the assumption of pure uniaxial stress state however as discussed above a nearly uniaxial stress state is maintained globally only until about frame 6750 which is even beyond the onset of diffuse necking that is a global equivalent strain of 0 20 in other words the true stress strain curve based on the global mts data i e σ 11 ε 11 curve does not represent the equivalent stress strain behavior of the material after a global equivalent strain of 0 20 for this specific material fairly good agreement between the mts uniaxial test result and the dic analysis demonstrates that the power law hardening relationship with calculated hardening parameters ω 868 4 m p a and n 0 128 fits reasonably well for this specific material aside from the mts based curves the equivalent stress strain curve is independent of the mask size as the plastic constitutive and stress strain relationships that are used the hardening law and the flow rule are independent of a length scale 4 1 2 test 2 this specimen has the same mid region geometry as the one presented in the previous sub section the only difference is that this test specimen is obtained by in house machining of a 1in width specimen whereas the one presented in the previous sub section is obtained by in house machining of a 18 mm width specimen this test specimen with the experimental set up can be seen in fig 1b again the width of the specimen is reduced to capture the entire mid region during imaging a test speed of 0 4 inch second 10 16 mm s 1 is applied to the end of the test specimen with 6000 digital images recorded per second for this experiment the pixel resolution is approximately 16 3 μm per pixel note that the high speed camera and the experimental device are also snychronized in this experiment fracture initiates around frame 3350 that is following an approximately 5 673 mm horizontal extension note that this displacement is slightly lower than the one obtained for the low speed test presented in the previous sub section dic analyses are conducted for three different mask sizes that is the 16 pixel by 16 pixel mask the smallest mask size the 32 pixels by 32 pixels mask and the 128 pixels by 128 pixels mask results are summarized in table 1 as can be seen from table 1 the fracture strains are lower for the higher strain rate test for all mask sizes investigated this is consistent with the fact that ductility of metals generally decreases with increase in strain rate although more data are required to reach a concrete conclusion one of the reasons for the smaller fracture strain is that the test specimen at high strain rate has a slightly lower displacement to fracture the effect of mask size on failure strain for both test speeds is shown in fig 11 for the case of lower test speed if the result of the 32 pixels by 32 pixels mask were excluded interestingly the other four points nearly fit a linear curve for the case of higher test speed on the other hand fracture strains for the 32 pixels by 32 pixels mask and the 128 pixels by 128 pixels mask are nearly equal this suggests that localization occurs and affects a region smaller than 32 pixels by 32 pixels and the strain is nearly uniform outside the localization zone moreover as can be seen in the figure a false convergence might be interpreted if the analyses were limited to a minimum of 32 pixels by 32 pixels obviously convergence behavior needs to be verified by multiple mask sizes 4 2 analysis of 1in width specimen with semi circular groove in the uniaxial test of 1in width specimen with semi circular groove the load displacement is applied rapidly by hand with 7500 digital images recorded per second for this experiment thus the test speed may not be constant a portion of the flat side of the specimen is the recorded region because the groove and non groove regions are not able to be captured simultaneously due to the depth of field constraint of the camera lens system the pixel resolution is approximately 15 3 μm per pixel note that the high speed camera and the experimental device are not snychronized in this experiment a very small lag in the recording might thus be possible therefore horizontal extension determined using the frame number may not provide the exact value frames from the video recording are presented in fig 12 the vertical and the horizontal directions are the width and the longitudinal directions of the specimen respectively the regions depicted in each sub figure are approximately 895 925 pixels by 520 550 pixels fracture initiates around frame 13893 and the initial crack can clearly be seen at frame 13894 depicted in fig 12b moreover final stages of the crack propagation are presented in fig 12c and fig 12d the effect of mask size on failure strain is presented in fig 13 the analytical relationship depicted in the figure was proposed by li and karr 2009 they found the effect of length scale on the fracture strain to be of the form 28 y ln a x b where x represents the length scale e g the length of the respective mask in the current article and y represents the fracture strain note that the material parameters a and b are determined by a best fit of the experimental results as can be seen from the figure there is no sign of convergence of the results as the length scales are reduced the average stress triaxiality η a v e the stress triaxiality at fracture η f r a c and the equivalent strain at fracture ε e q f are summarized in table 1 as can be seen from the table these strains are much lower than the ones obtained for the 6 mm width specimen one of the reasons is that the flat side of the specimen is expected to exhibit smaller strain than the one on the groove side due to bending caused by eccentricity hence it is believed that observed fracture on the flat side is the propagation of fracture moreover another reason for small equivalent strains at fracture can be the high stress triaxility 4 3 analysis of shear specimen the shear specimen design is adapted from bao and wierzbicki s 2004 design for pure shear tests and the dimensions of the adapted specimen are provided in reyes et al 2009 the load displacement is applied rapidly by hand with 7500 digital images recorded per second for this experiment as well thus the test speed may not be constant the experimental set up for the shear test can be seen in fig 1a the pixel resolution is approximately 13 7 μm per pixel note that the high speed camera and the experimental device are not snychronized in this experiment either a very small lag in the recording might thus be possible therefore again horizontal extension determined using the frame number may not provide the exact value three frames from the video recording are presented in fig 14 the vertical direction and the horizontal direction are the width direction and the longitudinal direction of the specimen respectively the regions depicted in each sub figure are approximately 890 920 pixels by 520 550 pixels fracture initiates around frame 6000 and the initial crack can clearly be seen at frame 7000 depicted in fig 14b moreover a later stage of the crack propagation is presented in fig 14c the evolution of the natural strain and the equivalent strain within the masked region during the uniaxial test of the shear specimen for different mask sizes is presented in fig 15 a and fig 15b the dominant strain component is the shear strain ε 12 as expected due to the specimen geometry the shear strain at the initiation of fracture is around 1 00 for the smallest two mask sizes i e 16 pixels by 16 pixels and 32 pixels by 32 pixels and it decreases as the mask size is increased nevertheless while the longitudinal strain ε 11 remain small until the initiation of fracture i e frame 6000 the transverse strain ε 22 increases with loading and reaches 0 36 and 0 17 for the smallest mask size and the largest mask size respectively i e 16 pixels by 16 pixels and 128 pixels by 128 pixels at the initiation of fracture the evolution of the true stress and the stress triaxiality within the masked region during the uniaxial test of the shear specimen for the largest mask size is shown in fig 16 the stress triaxiality at the initiation of the test i e at frame 1000 varies between 0 21 and 0 08 with the largest value in the smallest mask size and the smallest value in the largest mask size on the other hand the stress triaxiality at fracture varies between 0 13 and 0 03 whereas the average stress triaxiality varies between 0 20 and 0 17 note that the variations of the stress triaxiality at fracture and the average stress triaxiality exhibit no particular order regarding the mask size finally it is worth noting that the theoretical stress triaxiality for the pure shear state is zero shear stress remains very stable i e there are no fluctuations even for the smaller mask sizes however the longitudinal stress σ 11 and the transverse stress σ 22 have small fluctuations at reduced mask sizes as discussed above it is believed that these fluctuations are due to plastic flow localization furthermore fracture initiates very close to the edge of the gauge section with the state of stress between uniaxial compression and pure shear at the beginning of the experiment and proceeds towards a pure shear stress state with further loading see fig 16 the compressional rather than tensional state of stress might be caused by manual hand loading the development of the longitudinal stress and the large transverse stress shows that the exact pure shear condition is not achieved and this suggests that the geometry of the specimen and or loading conditions may be improved to satisfy a pure shear stress state a pure shear stress state may be achieved utilizing shear specimen designs with grooves in the thickness direction and this is a study for future research the current results shows that negligence of non linear shear displacement gradient terms that is u 1 2 b w 2 and u 2 1 b w 2 can mislead the analysis evolution of the natural strain components is depicted in fig 15c and fig 15d to emphasize the impact of non linear shear displacement gradient terms these figures capture so called experimental results when aforementioned two non linear terms are disregarded negligence of non linear shear displacement gradient terms may result in extremely inaccurate evaluation particularly in the evaluation of normal strain and normal stress components under shear dominated loading conditions the evolution of the equivalent strain for the four scales studied from the results of this particular experiment is presented in fig 17 the evolution of the strain exhibits the same qualitative behavior for all mask sizes investigated moreover an indication of convergence of the result appears as the length scales are reduced nevertheless this is not sufficient to draw a strain convergence conclusion as convergence behavior needs to be verified by multiple mask sizes the effect of mask size on failure strain is shown in fig 18 there may be strain convergence as the mask size is decreased however this can be affected by the arrangement choice of the masked regions therefore the effect of mask position on fracture strain is investigated as well for instance the 8 pixels by 8 pixels mask can be arranged in nine different ways with all the arrangements remaining within the 16 pixels by 16 pixels mask as an example two of these calculations are shown in fig 18 interestingly the crack region is positioned at the center of the mask for the one that has lower strain to failure while it is positioned on the edge of the mask for the one that has higher strain to failure similar fluctuations can be observed for the other mask sizes as well however the authors believe that these fluctuations should not be as large as the one observed for the 8 pixels by 8 pixels mask the reason for the large differences observed in using various 8 pixels by 8 pixels masks is that this mask size is so small such that micro structural variations are likely present and this mask size is apparently at the transition of the micro scale and the continuum scale another reason is that only four strain values are averaged to obtain the average strain within the mask region hence the sample space may be too small to provide a reliable average value therefore it is believed that the analysis should be limited to a minimum of 16 pixels by 16 pixels mask hence no convergence is observed at the continuum scale by considering this minimum mask size the average stress triaxiality η a v e the stress triaxiality at fracture η f r a c and the equivalent strain at fracture ε e q f are summarized in table 1 the stress triaxiality at fracture and the average stress triaxiality exhibit no particular order regarding the mask size however the equivalent strain at fracture increases as the mask size is decreased a sign of localization therefore choosing the appropriate gauge length in shear fracture characterization is crucial pathak et al 2019 considering the fact that large localized failure strains in excess of 100 is observed as the length scale decreases 5 conclusions results of this study provide significant insight on the evolution of the non linear stress and strain states leading to ductile fracture in particular the effects of the state of stress and the element mask size on the fracture behavior of a ship structural steel are explored in addition they provide key parameters for predicting fracture of ductile materials in general and thus assist in the guidance of criteria development for materials other than that specifically addressed here a widely used approach to post process experimental results is to extract stress and strain fields from the corresponding finite element models that is hybrid experimental numerical analysis see e g bao and wierzbicki 2004 bonora et al 2005 bai and wierzbicki 2010 dunand and mohr 2010 luo et al 2012 fourmeau et al 2013 roth and mohr 2014 wang et al 2014 papasidero et al 2015 lou et al 2017 ha et al 2018 cerik et al 2019a gu et al 2020 in that approach both stress and strain depend on the result of the finite element analyses and are not measured during experiments in the current study however a direct measure of displacement strain is obtained by digital image correlation analysis dic strains are obtained by analyzing digital images that are recorded during the experiments with a phantom v710 high speed camera via davis lavision software davis 2015 strains are calculated to the point of fracture initiation where the fracture initiation is defined as the condition when the first visible crack appears in the digital image of the test specimen after obtaining the engineering strain field a property called a geometric mask is applied to investigate a specific sub region of the imaged surface the natural strains are calculated from the measured engineering strains the corresponding state of stress is calculated directly by using the dic results via the constitutive relationships i e the power law hardening relationship and the stress strain relationships i e the flow rule for a plane stress condition a plane stress condition develops as the surface that is considered in the dic analysis is free of stress it is concluded that this method yields a superior measure of stress and strain fields a series of uniaxial tests is conducted and presented in section 4 two different strain increment approaches can be applied in the calculation of the equivalent strain the state of stress and the stress triaxiality in the first approach the strain increments are from the un deformed state to the current state whereas the values in the second approach are obtained by taking strain increments from the previous state to the current state akcay 2016 therefore the difference between the two approaches is the amount of strain increment considered these two approaches would lead to similar results for the cases of proportional loading for the cases of non proportional loading however the use of smaller strain increments that is the second approach is expected to provide more reliable results as the stress strain relationships i e the flow rule are based on the linear incremental relationships the experimental results indicate that proportional loading is generally not the case therefore only the results of the second approach are presented here in the uniaxial test of a 6 mm width specimen both the transverse strain and the longitudinal strain are moderately affected by the mask size and the effect of mask size is more pronounced especially at later stages of the experiment see fig 8 for example the strain difference between the smallest and the largest mask size with respect to the largest mask size at the initiation of fracture is 22 6 for the transverse strain whereas it is 27 1 for the longitudinal strain thus having different longitudinal and transverse strains for different mask sizes demonstrates that the strain is not uniform within the neck region at the initiation of fracture however the percentages mentioned above are the maximum differences and they are lower in the previous stages of the experiment hence uniform longitudinal strain and or uniform transverse strain assumptions may be reasonable depending on what stage of the uniaxial test is under consideration furthermore stress fluctuations at smaller mask sizes which represent local behavior are observed nevertheless stress fluctuations lose their magnitudes as more global behavior is followed i e as the mask size is increased hence the authors believe that the stress fluctuations are primarily due to plastic flow localization and spatial variations at the small scales mask sizes finite element studies of the mesh size dependence have been conducted previously and discussed widely in the literature however the present research is the first study to the authors knowledge that investigates the mesh mask size dependence through the direct measure of strain via dic analysis it is believed that strain localization is the main cause of the scale mask dependence on fracture strain in addition convergence behavior is also affected by the state of stress walters 2014 as the strain localization depends on it this has been observed by other researchers e g barsoum and faleskog 2007 hogström et al 2009 kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 walters 2014 the summary of the results of all uniaxial tests are presented in table 1 the strain rates listed are the average strain rates for the test range whereby the strain to failure is divided by the time to failure note that the strain rates at the instant of fracture are much higher in this investigation non convergence behaviors are obtained for all experiments i e failure strains increased as the mask sizes are decreased in this sense fracture can be considered as a singularity condition in which a change in length occurs of a vanishingly small current length the experimental analyses presented throughout are based on 2d dic analyses that is only the surface strain components are obtained the strain in the thickness direction is obtained using incompressibility condition a further study to obtain the exact value of the strain in the thickness direction would be the application of 3d dic also called stereo dic for quasi 3d and digital volume correlation for full 3d the application of incompressibility condition can also be validated in this manner the initiation of fracture is established by observing the digital images of the test specimen as the continuum scale is the subject of interest in other words the establishment of fracture initiation relies on human judgment scale effects the size of the initial crack for example affect the strain distribution and concentration see e g carroll et al 2012 as well as establishment of fracture initiation therefore a standardized and computerized automation of this establishment would accelerate the process and may provide more reliable results only one higher strain rate uniaxial test is investigated performing additional high speed experiments should be a consideration of a future study to explore the effect of strain rate on fracture strain credit authorship contribution statement

21473,results of a series of uniaxial tests to investigate fracture initiation states of ah32 steel a ship structural steel are presented strains at fracture are obtained using digital image correlation analysis via davis lavision software and the corresponding states of stress are obtained via a plastic flow rule and a hardening relationship using the measured strains the strain fields are calculated to the point of fracture initiation where the fracture initiation is defined as the condition when the first visible crack appears in the digital image of the test specimen the software provides displacement and strain fields of the entire region and any specified sub region of the imaged surface which uses a so called geometric mask the strain values are mask size dependent due to the local nature of deformation before fracture therefore in the current study strain fields are obtained for various mask sizes to investigate the effect of mask size on failure strain i e strain localization phenomena with the minimum mask size chosen at roughly the limit of the continuum scale o 100 μm the evolution of the stress and strain fields as a function of loading is provided for different mask sizes moreover comparison of the failure strain as mask sizes are decreased provides information on strain convergence in this investigation non convergence behaviors are obtained for all experiments as failure strain increased as the mask sizes are decreased keywords fracture plasticity ductility digital image correlation scale effect ah32 steel 1 introduction as computer technology has advanced it has become possible to simulate impact and assess the energy absorption capacity of large complicated structures common vehicular structures such as ships and offshore structures aircrafts and automobiles typically are composed of thin walled components their structural designs take advantage of high stiffness to weight ratios leading to cost effective and energy efficient performance the safety of such structures depends in large part on the system s ability to withstand extreme loading events such as collision see e g calle and alves 2015 yu et al 2019 accidental impact from other objects see e g ji and oterkus 2018 jiang et al 2019 and in some cases explosions see e g gan et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 also during forming processes the structure s capacity to deform to prescribed shapes while maintaining integrity is essential thus predictive capability for examining structural deformation limits has become increasingly important in industrial design environments however loading to failure especially ductile failure remains an open question a criterion for brittle fracture usually requires the current state of stress whereas ductile fracture depends on the history of the state of stress and strain moreover the underlying mechanisms of ductile fracture are very complex the micro mechanism of ductile fracture can be categorized under three modes at high stress triaxiality large primary voids are formed with little or no nucleation of secondary voids these voids grow and coalesce to form microcracks this failure mode is referred as internal necking on the other hand at low stress triaxiality primary voids remain small and void nucleation is often observed in narrow bands of secondary voids this failure mode is often called as void sheeting besson 2010 at intermediate levels of stress triaxiality however these two modes may compete or co operate barsoum and faleskog 2007 the simulation of the deformation and eventual fracture of structural materials are fundamentally important and have received considerable attention at the micro scale pioneering ductile fracture models were developed by mcclintock 1968 rice and tracey 1969 needleman 1972 and gurson 1977 for void growth and coalescence on the other hand at the macro scale the most popular approach for the initiation of ductile fracture of metals is to establish the limiting equivalent strain to material failure based on the stress state the state of stress may be expressed in terms of the second deviatoric stress invariant and the mean stress e g stress triaxiality for two dimensional state of stress conditions and the third deviatoric stress invariant e g lode parameter as well for three dimensional state of stress conditions such proposals for characterizing ductile failure have been studied extensively and the following paragraph summarizes commonly used experimental measurement methods in ductile fracture of metals one forensic method of obtaining the failure strain is measuring the diameter or thickness of the fractured specimen see e g hancock and mackenzie 1976 mirza et al 1996 fourmeau et al 2013 frodal et al 2017 another method of obtaining the failure strain is using the experimental load deformation record substituted into the derived mathematical formulation of strain i e hybrid experimental analytical analysis see e g barsoum and faleskog 2007 another widely used approach to post process experimental results is extracting stress and strain fields from the corresponding finite element models that is hybrid experimental numerical analysis see e g bao and wierzbicki 2004 bonora et al 2005 bai and wierzbicki 2010 dunand and mohr 2010 luo et al 2012 fourmeau et al 2013 roth and mohr 2014 wang et al 2014 papasidero et al 2015 lou et al 2017 ha et al 2018 cerik et al 2019a gu et al 2020 in this approach both local stress and strain depend on the results of the finite element analyses and are not measured during experiments therefore the reliability of the results is strongly affected by the reliability of the numerical simulation lou et al 2017 sedmak 2018 an accurate measurement of strain can be obtained by use of an electrical resistance strain gauge however this method cannot be used for large strain measurements e g failure fracture strain as its range is generally limited to strain of 0 02 zhu et al 2015 moreover strain gauges only provide single point measurements that is full field measurement is not possible therefore in this study a direct measure of strain is obtained by digital image correlation dic strains are obtained by analyzing digital images that are recorded during the experiments with a phantom v710 high speed camera via davis lavision software davis 2015 the state of stress is calculated directly rather than through a numerical simulation by using a power law hardening relationship a plastic flow rule and the measured strains fracture initiation is defined as the condition when the first visible crack appears in the digital image of the test specimen the maximum correlation between interrogation windows in digital image correlation analyses corresponds to the displacement and this gives the vector length and direction for each window accordingly the choice of interrogation window size also known as subset size of a digital image correlation analyses is crucial and its effect on the analysis results has been studied extensively see e g schreier and sutton 2002 knauss et al 2003 yaofeng and pang 2007 pan et al 2008 reu 2014 2015a 2015b xu et al 2015a hassan et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 schreier and sutton 2002 investigated the error in displacement and strain as a function of interrogation window size for first and second order shape functions knauss et al 2003 investigated the error in displacement for various interrogation window sizes as well they also studied whether the addition of a second order displacement gradient improves the results later yaofeng pang 2007 introduced a parameter called subset entropy and they studied the interaction between subset entropy and interrogation window size whereas pan et al 2008 proposed an algorithm to choose the proper interrogation window size based on an accuracy model of the displacement measurement in a series of articles reu 2014 2015a 2015b discussed the minimum required interrogation window size with respect to the amount of speckle xu et al 2015a investigated the impact of subset size as well as shape functions on the accuracy of local deformation measurements e g plc bands hassan et al 2016 and zhang et al 2017 proposed a dynamic subset selection algorithm to optimize the subset size for each local pattern of region of interest in the current investigation multi pass interrogation windows decreasing in size from 256 pixels by 256 pixels to 8 pixels by 8 pixels are used in every case the final interrogation window implemented is a constant 8 pixels by 8 pixels the dic software provides displacement and strain fields of the entire region and any specified sub region of the imaged surface which is called a geometric mask a geometric mask is very similar to the finite element mesh concept hence the strain values are mask size dependent due to the local nature of deformation before fracture therefore in the current study strain fields are obtained for various mask sizes to investigate the effect of mask size on strain thus the objective of the current study is the investigation of the mask size on the initiation of ductile fracture at the continuum scale to further the understanding on the evolution of the nonlinear stress and strain states leading to ductile fracture moreover this study is to provide key parameters for predicting fracture of ductile materials in general and thus assist in the guidance of criteria development for materials other than that specifically addressed here the remainder of the article is as follows section 2 briefly describes dic and presents the experimental set up while section 3 contains the relevant continuum mechanics equations thereafter the uniaxial test results are presented in section 4 and the conclusions and discussion follow in section 5 2 experimental techniques and set up 2 1 digital image correlation digital image correlation dic is an optical image processing technique that uses mathematical tools to generate the difference between two digital images a possibly un deformed reference state image and a deformed state image for example the digital image correlation technique was developed at the university of south carolina in the early 1980s pan et al 2009 pan 2018 however it is worth noting that the fundamental notions are based on particle image velocimetry piv developed for fluid mechanics research the restriction to in plane deformation measurement is the main disadvantage of 2d dic compared to 3d dic also called stereo dic for quasi 3d and digital volume correlation for full 3d however having an easier experimental set up and faster recording and processing times i e less cost make 2d dic practical and useful this is the method used throughout the error of 2d dic due to out of plane motion both out of plane translation and out of plane rotation was formulated and examined experimentally by sutton et al 2008 in the experiments presented here these errors are very small compared to large plastic fracture strains and neglect of them affects the fracture strain calculation little hence they are ignored the impact of lens distortion on strain measurements was studied by lava et al 2013 in addition to their study of the influence of lens distortion on rigid body translation rigid body rotation and a uniaxial tensile test of a textile composite at low strain levels lava et al 2013 also investigated the influence of lens distortion at large strain levels on a uniaxial tensile test of ss304 steel as can clearly be seen from fig 13 of the cited reference the impact of lens distortion on strain measurements loses its importance and becomes negligible after approximately 1 5 2 0 strain in the fracture experiments presented here the strains are much larger and therefore such adverse effects of lens distortion are negligible 2 2 experimental setup all experiments are conducted at room temperature with ah32 steel which is commonly used in ship hull structures test specimens are machined by northwest tool of jackson mi use of digital image correlation requires a random pattern on the specimen surface as a carrier of deformation information pan et al 2010 dong and pan 2017 therefore all specimens are etched to create a random surface pattern for the digital image correlation analysis specimens are immersed in a 2 nital solution for a few hours to reveal the substructure of the material in the etching process a mixture of methanol and nitric acid is used as an alternative formulation as a mixture of ethanol and nitric acid is potentially explosive two uniaxial tests the uniaxial tests of a shear specimen and a 1in width specimen with semi circular groove are performed using a custom designed and built c clamp mechanism which is depicted in fig 1 a the c clamp is capable of experiencing a 7000 lbs 31176 n load exerted via its 7 1 lead screw the test specimen seen in fig 1a is a shear specimen note that the shear specimen is adapted from bao and wierzbicki s 2004 design for pure shear tests and the dimensions of the adapted specimen are provided in reyes et al 2009 a lintech corporation custom designed linear positioning mechanism rs150025 s5 n3 w1 f4 m00 c000 e00 b00 l15 0 is used to perform the other two uniaxial tests the low and the high speed uniaxial tests of a 6 mm width specimen an example set up for these uniaxial tests can be seen in fig 1b the test specimen seen in fig 1b is a 6 mm width specimen which is obtained by in house machining of a 1in width specimen a high speed camera operating at 6000 frames per second fps or 7500 fps is used to record digital images of the specimens during the experiments the frame rate is chosen according to the imposed indenter displacement speed the imager is a phantom v710 vision research ametek with full 1200 pixels by 800 pixels frame recording to 7500 fps the total memory in the imager 44 5 gb is such that it can record 22 253 frames when recording 1200 pixels x 800 pixels the lens is a nikkor with a 105 mm focal distance and an f stop aperture of 2 8 influence of the pixel resolution on strain measurement was discussed by efstathiou et al 2010 in the current study the pixel resolution range of the experiments varies between 13 7 μm and 16 5 μm this range is chosen to obtain digital images having pixel resolutions of approximately one grain size such that approximate grain to grain strain variation can be observed with the entire mid region of the test specimen being captured jia et al 2013 and zhou et al 2016 provided average grain sizes of ah32 steels they used in their experimental investigations and these published data suggest that the average grain size of ah32 steel ranges from 5 μm to 25 μm depending on the cooling process system used therefore the pixel resolution range of the experiments is on the order of the grain size the effect of grain size on plastic deformation damage mechanism and fracture behavior of metals is beyond the scope of the current investigation and studied elsewhere see e g tasan et al 2014 xu et al 2015b a number of researchers have observed strong grain level strain heterogeneity see e g raabe et al 2001 zhang and tong 2004 héripré et al 2007 haltom et al 2013 banerjee et al 2016 in their experimental work and numerical analysis meaning that the localization may occur at very small scales therefore the current research also presents an investigation of the scale effect however smaller scales than the continuum scale are beyond the scope of this study true stress strain curves of a uniaxial test for ah32 steel are presented in fig 2 the tests are conducted using an mts machine with a gauge length of an extensometer of one inch the specimen used in the low speed tensile test is a 1in width specimen the initial tensile yield stress and the ultimate tensile strength of the material are obtained as 436 mpa and 585 mpa respectively the red solid line is obtained by using the data from the 1in width specimen the applied speed is 0 1 mm s 1 with a corresponding average strain rate of approximately 0 002 s 1 on the other hand the cyan dashed line and the green dotted line are obtained using the data from 18 mm width specimens applied speed for the cyan dashed line is approximately 38 1 mm s 1 with a corresponding average strain rate of 1 s 1 whereas the speed for the green dotted line is approximately 76 2 mm s 1 with a corresponding average strain rate of 2 s 1 although positive strain rate sensitivity may be expected in stress strain behavior of metals fig 2 does not agree with this expectation the reason that the 2 s 1 strain rate experiment has lower yield stress and ductility may be due to dynamic strain aging dsa phenomenon dsa results in serrations in the stress strain curve and it is affected by strain rate and temperature moreover negative strain rate sensitivity is another indication of dsa kabirian et al 2014 serrated flow and negative strain rate sensitivity can be observed in the stress strain behavior of 2 s 1 strain rate experiment and this supports the occurrence of dsa note that dsa has been observed in other marine steels as well see e g choung et al 2013 the primary aim of the experimental investigation is to explore the effects of the measurement scale and the state of stress on the fracture behavior of metals particularly ah32 steel another aim of the experimental program is to provide data for researchers for validation and verification of fracture models as the experimental data on the characterization of ductile fracture of marine structural steels are scarce cerik et al 2019b 3 strain and stress triaxiality calculation 3 1 strain calculation in the description of the experimental work fracture strain is established by digital image correlation analysis a sub region of interest which is called a geometric mask is introduced such that this masked region can be used to investigate a specific sub region of the imaged surface average strains within the masked region are obtained as fluctuations in the strain field due to polycrystalline microstructure and the noise of the dic measurements can be reduced by averaging papasidero et al 2014 strains are calculated to the point of fracture initiation as the continuum scale is the subject of interest the initiation of fracture is established by observing the digital images of the test specimen again the fracture initiation is defined as the condition when the first visible crack appears in the digital image of the test specimen strains are calculated in a backward stepping manner that is the last frame which is the digital image of the specimen at the point of fracture initiation is taken as the first step and from there time is reversed by using a previous image and so forth that is the first frame is the last step the difference between forward steps forward strain calculation and backward steps backward strain calculation is only the sign of displacement vector the primary reason for doing backward strain calculation is that the exact material position of the fracture region is known in the last frame and can then be traced backwards in time to its location before loading this procedure is repeated for various mask sizes masks are positioned such that the crack region remains within the mask the crack region remains at the center of the mask for all cases except large mask sizes in the shear specimen where it remains on the left of mask center the reason is that the crack in the shear specimen forms near the specimen boundary the minimum acceptable mask size which is 16 16 pixels is chosen such that the masked region is still on the continuum scale the number of grains required to develop a continuum scale occurs when the grains have random orientations in a macroscopic manner this number for polycrystalline aggregates e g steel aluminum etc is approximately twenty leis et al 1985 tegart 1966 3 1 1 calculation of forward plastic strain the components of backward natural strain are defined as seymen et al 2016 1 ε i j b w 1 2 ln 1 2 e i j b w where e i j b w denote green lagrangian strain tensor and is given as 2 e i j b w 1 2 u i j u j i u m i u m j the current analysis only utilize surface displacement gradients that is i j m 1 2 let the backward natural strain and forward natural strain components of the last frame which is the digital image of the specimen at the point of fracture initiation be denoted as ε i j b w 1 and ε i j f w n respectively similarly let the backward natural strain and forward natural strain components of the first frame which is the digital image of the unstrained specimen be denoted as ε i j b w n and ε i j f w 1 respectively obviously ε i j b w 1 0 as this is the first step in the backward sense ε i j f w 1 0 as this is the first step in the forward sense and ε i j f w n ε i j b w n as natural strains are summable therefore the forward natural strain components are calculated in the following manner 3 ε i j f w k ε i j b w n ε i j b w n k 1 where k 1 2 n note that the natural strain increments d ε i j are components of a tensor hence transformation rules can be applied on the other hand natural strains ε i j are not components of a tensor malvern 1969 hence transformation rules cannot be applied 3 1 2 calculation of equivalent fracture strain the equivalent strain increment can be obtained by substituting forward natural strain increments into the expression 4 d ε e q p 2 3 d ε i j p d ε i j p where d ε i j p are the components of the plastic strain increment tensor as the surface that is considered in dic analysis is free of stress a state of plane stress is established hence σ 33 σ 13 σ 23 0 using the flow rule yields d ε 13 p d ε 23 p 0 moreover as the plastic strains are much greater than the elastic strains the elastic part of the total strain and the total strain increment can be neglected that is 5 d ε i j d ε i j p and ε i j ε i j p hence the total strain increment d ε i j obtained by dic analysis can be taken as the plastic strain increment d ε i j p in the above formulation i e in equation 4 therefore the equivalent strain increment yields the form 6 d ε e q 2 3 d ε 11 2 d ε 22 2 d ε 33 2 2 d ε 12 2 where d ε 11 d ε 22 and d ε 33 are the normal strain increments and d ε 12 is the shear strain increment strain increments on the surface d ε 11 d ε 22 and d ε 12 are computed by using the result of the dic analysis and equation 1 through equation 3 strain increment in the third direction the thickness direction is obtained by using the incompressibility d ε 11 d ε 22 d ε 33 0 that is 7 d ε 33 d ε 11 d ε 22 two different strain increment approaches can be applied in the calculation of equivalent strain the state of stress and the stress triaxiality in the first approach the strain increments are from the un deformed state to the current state whereas in the second approach strains are obtained by taking strain increments from the previous state to the current state 8 1 st approach ε e q k ε e q 1 d ε e q k 1 d ε e q k 1 9 2 nd approach ε e q k ε e q k 1 d ε e q k k 1 where k is the step number i e k 1 2 n moreover d ε e q q s represents the equivalent strain increment from step s to step q the only difference between the two approaches is the amount of strain increment considered these two approaches would lead to similar results for the cases of proportional loading for the cases of non proportional loading however the use of smaller strain increments that is the second approach is expected to provide more reliable results as the stress strain relationships i e the flow rule are based on the linear incremental relationships roth and mohr 2016 conducted numerical simulations to establish the optimum specimen geometry providing proportional loading histories at a given stress triaxiality nevertheless the experimental results indicate that proportional loading is generally not the case therefore only the results of the second approach will be presented here the reader is referred to akcay 2016 for a presentation of more comprehensive comparisons between the two approaches in this article fracture strain and failure strain are used interchangeably and they correspond to equivalent strain at fracture 3 2 stress calculation stress triaxiality and the state of stress are calculated using the measured strains by applying a plastic flow rule and a power law hardening relationship isotropic plasticity is utilized as mechanical properties of marine structural steels usually do not exhibit significant directional dependency see e g nemat nasser and guo 2003 cerik et al 2019a park et al 2019 3 2 1 calculation of stress triaxiality applying the flow rule for a plastic material desai and siriwardane 1984 the plastic strain increments are related to the true stress components as 10 d ε 11 p 2 3 λ σ 11 1 2 σ 22 σ 33 11 d ε 22 p 2 3 λ σ 22 1 2 σ 11 σ 33 12 d ε 12 p λ σ 12 where λ is a non negative scalar factor and may vary throughout the loading history define ψ 1 and ψ 2 as the ratios of the strain increments i e 13 d ε 22 ψ 1 d ε 11 14 d ε 12 ψ 2 d ε 11 using the flow rule expressions above these expressions can be utilized to obtain stress components for the case of the plane stress condition i e σ 33 σ 13 σ 23 0 15 σ 22 1 2 ψ 1 2 ψ 1 σ 11 16 σ 12 ψ 2 2 ψ 1 σ 11 the von mises equivalent stress for the plane stress condition is defined as 17 σ e q σ 11 2 σ 11 σ 22 σ 22 2 3 σ 12 2 substituting expressions for σ 22 equation 15 and σ 12 equation 16 into σ e q equation 17 yields 18 σ e q ψ e q t e n s i l e σ 11 where 19 ψ e q t e n s i l e 3 1 ψ 1 ψ 1 2 ψ 2 2 2 ψ 1 2 note that as the components of the stress state are expressed in terms of σ 11 and the sign of ψ e f f t e n s i l e is chosen positive i e tension in 1 1 direction 1 1 direction should be chosen in the direction of positive tensile loading however the state of stress should be expressed in terms of σ 12 for the shear test as the loading is dominated in the 1 2 direction 20 σ e q ψ e q s h e a r σ 12 where 21 ψ e q s h e a r 3 1 ψ 1 ψ 1 2 ψ 2 2 ψ 2 2 in addition the mean stress for the plane stress condition is 22 σ m 1 ψ 1 2 ψ 1 σ 11 or σ m 1 ψ 1 ψ 2 σ 12 finally the stress triaxiality can then be calculated as 23 η σ m σ e q 1 ψ 1 3 1 ψ 1 ψ 1 2 ψ 2 2 3 2 2 calculation of average stress triaxiality the average stress triaxiality is obtained by dividing the area under the equivalent strain stress triaxiality curve by the equivalent strain at fracture that is 24 η a v e 1 ε e q f 0 ε e f f f η d ε e q this integration is carried out numerically by using the trapezoidal rule note that as the stress triaxiality is not defined for the unloaded condition calculations and figures for the stress triaxiality are provided after the first loading point 3 2 3 obtaining the state of stress constitutive relationships can be expressed as in the form of following power law hardening relationship 25 σ e q ω ε e q n where ω is the strength coefficient n is the hardening exponent and the ε e q is the equivalent strain also the equivalent stress can be written in the form of equation 18 ψ e q t e n s i l e ψ 1 and ψ 2 can be obtained by equation 19 equation 13 and equation 14 respectively therefore the power law hardening relationship can be written as 26 σ 11 1 ψ e q t e n s i l e ω ε e q n the other two components of the true stress tensor i e σ 22 and σ 12 can be obtained from equation 15 and equation 16 respectively however the following relationship is used when the equivalent stress is expressed in terms of the shear stress σ 12 that is for the uniaxial test of the shear specimen 27 σ 12 1 ψ e q s h e a r ω ε e q n similarly the other two components of the stress tensor i e σ 11 and σ 22 can be obtained from equation 16 and equation 15 respectively finally the power law hardening parameters are computed as ω 868 4 mpa and n 0 128 by using the stress strain data from the uniaxial test the maximum load is 23598 n with the corresponding true stress and true strain of 667 2 mpa and 0 128 respectively hence the hardening exponent is obtained as n 0 128 moreover applying the hardening law with ε e q n 0 128 and σ e q 667 2 mpa gives a strength coefficient of ω 868 4 mpa 3 2 4 discussion on plane stress assumption equivalent strains and stress states in the current article are determined assuming the plane stress condition in contrast to the general belief that the plane stress assumption is appropriate to determine equivalent strain to fracture only for specific types of loading conditions see e g roth and mohr 2016 equivalent strain to fracture utilizing the plane stress assumption can be determined for various types of loading conditions see e g lou et al 2014 roth and mohr 2016 proposed that the plane stress assumption can be appropriate only for the cases of shear plane strain tension and equi biaxial tension loading conditions in their investigation roth and mohr 2016 investigated only four types of loading conditions i e shear plane strain tension and equi biaxial tension and uniaxial tension however the study of lou et al 2014 demonstrated that various types of loading conditions including compression shear combined shear and tension combined torsion and tension and uniaxial tension of a flat specimen a plate with circular hole and a pipe can result in plane stress fracture see table 1 of that article therefore one can infer that utilization of plane stress assumption in order to determine equivalent strain to fracture is not restricted to particular loading conditions however this statement does not mean that plane stress assumption can be utilized for any type of loading condition moreover the focus of the present study is on thin metal plating while bulk materials are beyond the scope of the present research in conclusion the authors believe that the plane stress assumption is reasonable herein including the cases of uniaxial tension of the flat specimen and the grooved specimen as the thicknesses of the specimens are very small compared to the other two dimensions in fact very good agreement between the data from the uniaxial test with the mts machine and the dic results see the result for the 1024 pixels by 256 pixels mask in section 4 1 1 where mts data and dic results are compared supports this assumption on the other hand there exist cases where a specimen can fail in the interior first if a specimen fails in the interior first determined equivalent strains based on surface strains i e 2d dic may not correspond to the exact failure strains hence 2d dic needs to be used cautiously in those cases however discussions of the mask size are valid regardless of the fracture initiation state of the entire specimen in other words the mask size is investigated on the surface of the material which must be in a state of plane stress 4 uniaxial test results uniaxial tests are conducted for three different specimen geometries all stresses presented in this section are the true stresses and all strains are the natural true strains unless otherwise stated moreover the subscript 11 corresponds to the longitudinal direction of the specimen and the subscript 22 corresponds to the width direction 4 1 analysis of 6 mm width specimen dic analyses are conducted for two different test speeds for this particular specimen type and they are presented in the following sub sections 4 1 1 test 1 this specimen is obtained by in house machining of an 18 mm width specimen the width of the specimen is reduced to capture the entire mid region during imaging a test speed of 0 2 inch second 5 08 mm s 1 is applied to the end of the test specimen with 6000 digital images recorded per second for this experiment the pixel resolution is approximately 16 5 μm per pixel note that the high speed camera and the experimental device are snychronized in this experiment three frames from the video recording are presented in fig 3 the vertical direction and the horizontal direction are the width direction and the longitudinal direction of the specimen respectively the regions depicted in each sub figure are approximately 645 665 pixels by 370 390 pixels diffuse necking starts around frame 5000 while fracture initiates around frame 7200 that is following an approximately 6 096 mm horizontal extension and cracks are clearly visible in frame 7441 as presented in fig 3b interestingly however as can be seen from frame 7443 and frame 7445 which are shown in fig 3c and fig 3d respectively fracture progresses rapidly in a different region than where the first macroscopic cracks are seen as one of the goals herein is to investigate the effects of length scale the images are analyzed using varying mask sizes the evolution of the natural strain and the equivalent strain within the masked region during the uniaxial test for different mask sizes are presented in fig 4 a and fig 4b the shear strain is zero or nearly zero for all mask sizes until the initiation of fracture i e frame 7200 where the analysis is curtailed assuming that the material is incompressible when the ratio of the transverse strain increment to the longitudinal strain increment is 0 50 the strain increment in the longitudinal direction and the equivalent strain increment exactly overlap if the shear strain increment is zero this overlap can be identified approximately in all mask sizes of the current analysis as the ratio of the transverse strain increment to the longitudinal strain increment is close to 0 50 moreover both the transverse strain ε 22 and the longitudinal strain ε 11 have relatively smaller slope until frame 1000 the reason for this behavior is that the specimen is likely still in the elastic region and or the elastic plastic transition region considering that poisson s ratio of steel is around 0 30 in the elastic range and having transverse to longitudinal strain ratios of 0 27 for 16 pixels by 16 pixels mask 0 33 for 32 pixels by 32 pixels mask 0 39 for 64 pixels by 64 pixels mask 0 35 for 128 pixels by 128 pixels mask and 0 24 for 192 pixels by 192 pixels mask support this view in fact as can be seen in the stress strain curve presented in fig 10 the corresponding point of frame 1000 lies on the elastic plastic transition region furthermore the longitudinal strain and the equivalent strain have nearly constant slope between frame 1000 and frame 5000 with the slope begins increasing around frame 5000 where diffuse necking starts finally it is worth noting the progressively increasing transverse strains for example for the 16 pixels by 16 pixels mask the transverse strain at frame 5000 is 0 082 while it reaches 0 258 at frame 7200 where fracture initiates the evolution of the true stress and the stress triaxiality within the masked region during the uniaxial test for different mask sizes are depicted in fig 5 and fig 6 the average stress triaxiality ranges between 0 34 and 0 37 and the stress triaxiality at fracture is higher than the theoretical stress triaxiality value of the purely uniaxial state which is 1 3 for all mask sizes the shear stress is zero or nearly zero for the larger mask sizes which represent more global behavior after frame 2000 however it is interesting to note the stress fluctuations at smaller mask sizes which represent more local behavior on the other hand stress fluctuations vanish as more global behavior is followed i e larger mask sizes as discussed in detail in akcay 2016 the authors believe that these fluctuations are due to plastic flow localization the sign of stress and stress triaxiality fluctuations first appear for the 64 pixels by 64 pixels mask and likewise it is seen that the magnitude of the fluctuations increases as the mask size is decreased note that the von mises stress has the same quantitative behavior both locally smaller mask sizes and more globally larger mask sizes as expected as the plastic constitutive and stress strain relationships that are used the hardening law and the flow rule are independent of a length scale in addition to the analysis above a very large mask size 1024 pixels by 256 pixels 16 896 mm 4 224 mm is investigated to explore the behavior of the entire region the size of the mask with respect to the specimen can be seen in fig 7 the red square represents the 32 pixels by 32 pixels mask whereas the blue rectangle represents the 1024 pixels by 256 pixels mask the image is obtained by davis lavision software and the color difference within the specimen is due to the variation of lighting intensity the evolution of the natural strain and the equivalent strain within the masked region during the uniaxial test for 1024 pixels by 256 pixel mask is presented in fig 4c the shear strain remains zero or nearly zero until the initiation of fracture i e frame 7200 where the analysis is curtailed moreover as the shear strain is nearly zero and the ratio of the strain increment in the transverse direction to the longitudinal direction is around 0 5 except for frame 1000 and after frame 7000 i e it ranges between 0 51 and 0 46 between frame 1000 and frame 6750 the strain in the longitudinal direction overlaps the equivalent strain this is because the global state of stress still experiences a nearly uniaxial stress state furthermore the hardening exponent n 0 128 computed by using the stress strain data from the uniaxial test with the mts machine agrees very well with the corresponding equivalent strain at frame 5000 see fig 4c where diffuse necking starts the uni directional stress strain curve σ 11 ε 11 curve nearly overlaps the equivalent stress strain curve von mises stress curve until frame 6750 however they then separate due to the development of the transverse stress σ 22 and the maximum difference with respect to uni directional stress is 7 2 which occurs at frame 7200 this supports the conclusion that the global state of stress still experiences a nearly uniaxial stress state until frame 6750 as discussed above therefore a global uni directional stress strain curve may be a fairly good representation of the global equivalent stress strain curve which is a general assumption in obtaining stress strain curves of materials through a conventional uniaxial test when the gauge length is sufficiently large compared to the localization zone nevertheless it is worth mentioning that global strains obtained by a conventional uniaxial test may not represent the actual strains in the localized zone the evolution of the longitudinal strain ε 11 and the transverse strain ε 22 for different mask sizes are presented in fig 8 both the transverse strain and the longitudinal strain are moderately affected by the mask size and the effect of mask size is more pronounced especially at later stages of the experiment for example the strain difference between the smallest and the largest mask size with respect to the largest mask size at the initiation of fracture i e at frame 7200 is 22 6 for the transverse strain whereas it is 27 1 for the longitudinal strain thus having different longitudinal and transverse strains for different mask sizes demonstrates that the strain is not exactly uniform within the neck region at the initiation of fracture however the percentages mentioned above are the maximum differences and that they are lower in the previous stages of the experiment hence uniform longitudinal strain and or uniform transverse strain assumptions may be reasonable depending on what stage of the uniaxial test is under consideration the evolution of the equivalent strain for the six scales studied from the results of this particular experiment is presented in fig 9 equivalent strains for all mask sizes except 1024 pixels by 256 pixels nearly overlap until after frame 4000 and then separation becomes clearer around frame 5000 where diffuse necking starts the most prominent feature of the figure as the experiment progresses is the increasing difference between the 1024 pixels by 256 pixels mask and the rest of the mask sizes this difference with respect to 1024 pixels by 256 pixels at the initiation of fracture i e at frame 7200 reaches 108 for the 192 pixels by 192 pixels mask and 168 for the 16 pixels by 16 pixels mask obviously global strains obtained by a conventional uniaxial test do not represent the actual strains in the localized zone as expected the average stress triaxiality η a v e the stress triaxiality at fracture η f r a c and the equivalent strain at fracture ε e q f are summarized in table 1 the equivalent strain at fracture increases as the mask size is decreased a sign of localization moreover the stress triaxiality at fracture and the average stress triaxiality increase as well as the mask size is decreased with the exception of 32 pixels by 32 pixels mask and 16 pixels by 16 pixels mask respectively finally the true stress strain curves for different mask sizes are presented together in fig 10 the flow rule and the power law hardening relationship with ω 868 4 mpa and n 0 128 are used to obtain the components of the stress tensor see section 3 2 for details of the dic analysis in addition the stress strain curve obtained via the mts machine is superposed on the same figure for comparison purposes solid lines with markers are obtained by the digital image correlation analysis whereas dashed lines are the results of the uniaxial test with the mts machine note that the dic analyses are conducted to the point of fracture initiation therefore the last marker of each color represents the fracture initiation point for different mask sizes the true stress strain curve in the figure is calculated based on the assumption of pure uniaxial stress state however as discussed above a nearly uniaxial stress state is maintained globally only until about frame 6750 which is even beyond the onset of diffuse necking that is a global equivalent strain of 0 20 in other words the true stress strain curve based on the global mts data i e σ 11 ε 11 curve does not represent the equivalent stress strain behavior of the material after a global equivalent strain of 0 20 for this specific material fairly good agreement between the mts uniaxial test result and the dic analysis demonstrates that the power law hardening relationship with calculated hardening parameters ω 868 4 m p a and n 0 128 fits reasonably well for this specific material aside from the mts based curves the equivalent stress strain curve is independent of the mask size as the plastic constitutive and stress strain relationships that are used the hardening law and the flow rule are independent of a length scale 4 1 2 test 2 this specimen has the same mid region geometry as the one presented in the previous sub section the only difference is that this test specimen is obtained by in house machining of a 1in width specimen whereas the one presented in the previous sub section is obtained by in house machining of a 18 mm width specimen this test specimen with the experimental set up can be seen in fig 1b again the width of the specimen is reduced to capture the entire mid region during imaging a test speed of 0 4 inch second 10 16 mm s 1 is applied to the end of the test specimen with 6000 digital images recorded per second for this experiment the pixel resolution is approximately 16 3 μm per pixel note that the high speed camera and the experimental device are also snychronized in this experiment fracture initiates around frame 3350 that is following an approximately 5 673 mm horizontal extension note that this displacement is slightly lower than the one obtained for the low speed test presented in the previous sub section dic analyses are conducted for three different mask sizes that is the 16 pixel by 16 pixel mask the smallest mask size the 32 pixels by 32 pixels mask and the 128 pixels by 128 pixels mask results are summarized in table 1 as can be seen from table 1 the fracture strains are lower for the higher strain rate test for all mask sizes investigated this is consistent with the fact that ductility of metals generally decreases with increase in strain rate although more data are required to reach a concrete conclusion one of the reasons for the smaller fracture strain is that the test specimen at high strain rate has a slightly lower displacement to fracture the effect of mask size on failure strain for both test speeds is shown in fig 11 for the case of lower test speed if the result of the 32 pixels by 32 pixels mask were excluded interestingly the other four points nearly fit a linear curve for the case of higher test speed on the other hand fracture strains for the 32 pixels by 32 pixels mask and the 128 pixels by 128 pixels mask are nearly equal this suggests that localization occurs and affects a region smaller than 32 pixels by 32 pixels and the strain is nearly uniform outside the localization zone moreover as can be seen in the figure a false convergence might be interpreted if the analyses were limited to a minimum of 32 pixels by 32 pixels obviously convergence behavior needs to be verified by multiple mask sizes 4 2 analysis of 1in width specimen with semi circular groove in the uniaxial test of 1in width specimen with semi circular groove the load displacement is applied rapidly by hand with 7500 digital images recorded per second for this experiment thus the test speed may not be constant a portion of the flat side of the specimen is the recorded region because the groove and non groove regions are not able to be captured simultaneously due to the depth of field constraint of the camera lens system the pixel resolution is approximately 15 3 μm per pixel note that the high speed camera and the experimental device are not snychronized in this experiment a very small lag in the recording might thus be possible therefore horizontal extension determined using the frame number may not provide the exact value frames from the video recording are presented in fig 12 the vertical and the horizontal directions are the width and the longitudinal directions of the specimen respectively the regions depicted in each sub figure are approximately 895 925 pixels by 520 550 pixels fracture initiates around frame 13893 and the initial crack can clearly be seen at frame 13894 depicted in fig 12b moreover final stages of the crack propagation are presented in fig 12c and fig 12d the effect of mask size on failure strain is presented in fig 13 the analytical relationship depicted in the figure was proposed by li and karr 2009 they found the effect of length scale on the fracture strain to be of the form 28 y ln a x b where x represents the length scale e g the length of the respective mask in the current article and y represents the fracture strain note that the material parameters a and b are determined by a best fit of the experimental results as can be seen from the figure there is no sign of convergence of the results as the length scales are reduced the average stress triaxiality η a v e the stress triaxiality at fracture η f r a c and the equivalent strain at fracture ε e q f are summarized in table 1 as can be seen from the table these strains are much lower than the ones obtained for the 6 mm width specimen one of the reasons is that the flat side of the specimen is expected to exhibit smaller strain than the one on the groove side due to bending caused by eccentricity hence it is believed that observed fracture on the flat side is the propagation of fracture moreover another reason for small equivalent strains at fracture can be the high stress triaxility 4 3 analysis of shear specimen the shear specimen design is adapted from bao and wierzbicki s 2004 design for pure shear tests and the dimensions of the adapted specimen are provided in reyes et al 2009 the load displacement is applied rapidly by hand with 7500 digital images recorded per second for this experiment as well thus the test speed may not be constant the experimental set up for the shear test can be seen in fig 1a the pixel resolution is approximately 13 7 μm per pixel note that the high speed camera and the experimental device are not snychronized in this experiment either a very small lag in the recording might thus be possible therefore again horizontal extension determined using the frame number may not provide the exact value three frames from the video recording are presented in fig 14 the vertical direction and the horizontal direction are the width direction and the longitudinal direction of the specimen respectively the regions depicted in each sub figure are approximately 890 920 pixels by 520 550 pixels fracture initiates around frame 6000 and the initial crack can clearly be seen at frame 7000 depicted in fig 14b moreover a later stage of the crack propagation is presented in fig 14c the evolution of the natural strain and the equivalent strain within the masked region during the uniaxial test of the shear specimen for different mask sizes is presented in fig 15 a and fig 15b the dominant strain component is the shear strain ε 12 as expected due to the specimen geometry the shear strain at the initiation of fracture is around 1 00 for the smallest two mask sizes i e 16 pixels by 16 pixels and 32 pixels by 32 pixels and it decreases as the mask size is increased nevertheless while the longitudinal strain ε 11 remain small until the initiation of fracture i e frame 6000 the transverse strain ε 22 increases with loading and reaches 0 36 and 0 17 for the smallest mask size and the largest mask size respectively i e 16 pixels by 16 pixels and 128 pixels by 128 pixels at the initiation of fracture the evolution of the true stress and the stress triaxiality within the masked region during the uniaxial test of the shear specimen for the largest mask size is shown in fig 16 the stress triaxiality at the initiation of the test i e at frame 1000 varies between 0 21 and 0 08 with the largest value in the smallest mask size and the smallest value in the largest mask size on the other hand the stress triaxiality at fracture varies between 0 13 and 0 03 whereas the average stress triaxiality varies between 0 20 and 0 17 note that the variations of the stress triaxiality at fracture and the average stress triaxiality exhibit no particular order regarding the mask size finally it is worth noting that the theoretical stress triaxiality for the pure shear state is zero shear stress remains very stable i e there are no fluctuations even for the smaller mask sizes however the longitudinal stress σ 11 and the transverse stress σ 22 have small fluctuations at reduced mask sizes as discussed above it is believed that these fluctuations are due to plastic flow localization furthermore fracture initiates very close to the edge of the gauge section with the state of stress between uniaxial compression and pure shear at the beginning of the experiment and proceeds towards a pure shear stress state with further loading see fig 16 the compressional rather than tensional state of stress might be caused by manual hand loading the development of the longitudinal stress and the large transverse stress shows that the exact pure shear condition is not achieved and this suggests that the geometry of the specimen and or loading conditions may be improved to satisfy a pure shear stress state a pure shear stress state may be achieved utilizing shear specimen designs with grooves in the thickness direction and this is a study for future research the current results shows that negligence of non linear shear displacement gradient terms that is u 1 2 b w 2 and u 2 1 b w 2 can mislead the analysis evolution of the natural strain components is depicted in fig 15c and fig 15d to emphasize the impact of non linear shear displacement gradient terms these figures capture so called experimental results when aforementioned two non linear terms are disregarded negligence of non linear shear displacement gradient terms may result in extremely inaccurate evaluation particularly in the evaluation of normal strain and normal stress components under shear dominated loading conditions the evolution of the equivalent strain for the four scales studied from the results of this particular experiment is presented in fig 17 the evolution of the strain exhibits the same qualitative behavior for all mask sizes investigated moreover an indication of convergence of the result appears as the length scales are reduced nevertheless this is not sufficient to draw a strain convergence conclusion as convergence behavior needs to be verified by multiple mask sizes the effect of mask size on failure strain is shown in fig 18 there may be strain convergence as the mask size is decreased however this can be affected by the arrangement choice of the masked regions therefore the effect of mask position on fracture strain is investigated as well for instance the 8 pixels by 8 pixels mask can be arranged in nine different ways with all the arrangements remaining within the 16 pixels by 16 pixels mask as an example two of these calculations are shown in fig 18 interestingly the crack region is positioned at the center of the mask for the one that has lower strain to failure while it is positioned on the edge of the mask for the one that has higher strain to failure similar fluctuations can be observed for the other mask sizes as well however the authors believe that these fluctuations should not be as large as the one observed for the 8 pixels by 8 pixels mask the reason for the large differences observed in using various 8 pixels by 8 pixels masks is that this mask size is so small such that micro structural variations are likely present and this mask size is apparently at the transition of the micro scale and the continuum scale another reason is that only four strain values are averaged to obtain the average strain within the mask region hence the sample space may be too small to provide a reliable average value therefore it is believed that the analysis should be limited to a minimum of 16 pixels by 16 pixels mask hence no convergence is observed at the continuum scale by considering this minimum mask size the average stress triaxiality η a v e the stress triaxiality at fracture η f r a c and the equivalent strain at fracture ε e q f are summarized in table 1 the stress triaxiality at fracture and the average stress triaxiality exhibit no particular order regarding the mask size however the equivalent strain at fracture increases as the mask size is decreased a sign of localization therefore choosing the appropriate gauge length in shear fracture characterization is crucial pathak et al 2019 considering the fact that large localized failure strains in excess of 100 is observed as the length scale decreases 5 conclusions results of this study provide significant insight on the evolution of the non linear stress and strain states leading to ductile fracture in particular the effects of the state of stress and the element mask size on the fracture behavior of a ship structural steel are explored in addition they provide key parameters for predicting fracture of ductile materials in general and thus assist in the guidance of criteria development for materials other than that specifically addressed here a widely used approach to post process experimental results is to extract stress and strain fields from the corresponding finite element models that is hybrid experimental numerical analysis see e g bao and wierzbicki 2004 bonora et al 2005 bai and wierzbicki 2010 dunand and mohr 2010 luo et al 2012 fourmeau et al 2013 roth and mohr 2014 wang et al 2014 papasidero et al 2015 lou et al 2017 ha et al 2018 cerik et al 2019a gu et al 2020 in that approach both stress and strain depend on the result of the finite element analyses and are not measured during experiments in the current study however a direct measure of displacement strain is obtained by digital image correlation analysis dic strains are obtained by analyzing digital images that are recorded during the experiments with a phantom v710 high speed camera via davis lavision software davis 2015 strains are calculated to the point of fracture initiation where the fracture initiation is defined as the condition when the first visible crack appears in the digital image of the test specimen after obtaining the engineering strain field a property called a geometric mask is applied to investigate a specific sub region of the imaged surface the natural strains are calculated from the measured engineering strains the corresponding state of stress is calculated directly by using the dic results via the constitutive relationships i e the power law hardening relationship and the stress strain relationships i e the flow rule for a plane stress condition a plane stress condition develops as the surface that is considered in the dic analysis is free of stress it is concluded that this method yields a superior measure of stress and strain fields a series of uniaxial tests is conducted and presented in section 4 two different strain increment approaches can be applied in the calculation of the equivalent strain the state of stress and the stress triaxiality in the first approach the strain increments are from the un deformed state to the current state whereas the values in the second approach are obtained by taking strain increments from the previous state to the current state akcay 2016 therefore the difference between the two approaches is the amount of strain increment considered these two approaches would lead to similar results for the cases of proportional loading for the cases of non proportional loading however the use of smaller strain increments that is the second approach is expected to provide more reliable results as the stress strain relationships i e the flow rule are based on the linear incremental relationships the experimental results indicate that proportional loading is generally not the case therefore only the results of the second approach are presented here in the uniaxial test of a 6 mm width specimen both the transverse strain and the longitudinal strain are moderately affected by the mask size and the effect of mask size is more pronounced especially at later stages of the experiment see fig 8 for example the strain difference between the smallest and the largest mask size with respect to the largest mask size at the initiation of fracture is 22 6 for the transverse strain whereas it is 27 1 for the longitudinal strain thus having different longitudinal and transverse strains for different mask sizes demonstrates that the strain is not uniform within the neck region at the initiation of fracture however the percentages mentioned above are the maximum differences and they are lower in the previous stages of the experiment hence uniform longitudinal strain and or uniform transverse strain assumptions may be reasonable depending on what stage of the uniaxial test is under consideration furthermore stress fluctuations at smaller mask sizes which represent local behavior are observed nevertheless stress fluctuations lose their magnitudes as more global behavior is followed i e as the mask size is increased hence the authors believe that the stress fluctuations are primarily due to plastic flow localization and spatial variations at the small scales mask sizes finite element studies of the mesh size dependence have been conducted previously and discussed widely in the literature however the present research is the first study to the authors knowledge that investigates the mesh mask size dependence through the direct measure of strain via dic analysis it is believed that strain localization is the main cause of the scale mask dependence on fracture strain in addition convergence behavior is also affected by the state of stress walters 2014 as the strain localization depends on it this has been observed by other researchers e g barsoum and faleskog 2007 hogström et al 2009 kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 walters 2014 the summary of the results of all uniaxial tests are presented in table 1 the strain rates listed are the average strain rates for the test range whereby the strain to failure is divided by the time to failure note that the strain rates at the instant of fracture are much higher in this investigation non convergence behaviors are obtained for all experiments i e failure strains increased as the mask sizes are decreased in this sense fracture can be considered as a singularity condition in which a change in length occurs of a vanishingly small current length the experimental analyses presented throughout are based on 2d dic analyses that is only the surface strain components are obtained the strain in the thickness direction is obtained using incompressibility condition a further study to obtain the exact value of the strain in the thickness direction would be the application of 3d dic also called stereo dic for quasi 3d and digital volume correlation for full 3d the application of incompressibility condition can also be validated in this manner the initiation of fracture is established by observing the digital images of the test specimen as the continuum scale is the subject of interest in other words the establishment of fracture initiation relies on human judgment scale effects the size of the initial crack for example affect the strain distribution and concentration see e g carroll et al 2012 as well as establishment of fracture initiation therefore a standardized and computerized automation of this establishment would accelerate the process and may provide more reliable results only one higher strain rate uniaxial test is investigated performing additional high speed experiments should be a consideration of a future study to explore the effect of strain rate on fracture strain credit authorship contribution statement

21474,this note focus on the waypoints based path following control for the unmanned sail assisted vehicles usav aiming to release the constraints of the actuator failures and gain uncertainties the proposed scheme is formulated as two components i e the composite guidance part and the control part by utilizing the sign self selection algorithm the composite logic virtual ship lvs guidance law is developed in the scheme to program the real time heading angle for the usav the main superiorities of this design are to ensure the usav navigating efficiently and choose the corresponding sailing mode upwind mode downwind mode or crosswind mode furthermore to improve the effectiveness of the closed loop control system an event triggered robust neural control algorithm is targetly designed for the rudder actuator and the sail actuator by fusing the robust neural damping technique and the input event triggered mechanism in this algorithm the unknown terms of the system are tackled requiring no information of the system model and the external disturbances the transmission burden from the controller to the actuator is reduced and the unknown actuator failures and the gain uncertainties are compensated through four adaptive updated parameters based on the lyapunov analysis sufficient effort has been made to guarantee that all the signals of the closed loop control system are the semi global uniform ultimate bounded sguub finally the simulated results demonstrate the validity of the proposed control strategy keywords sail assisted vehicles lvs guidance path following control adaptive neural control event triggered inputs 1 introduction under the context of the weather warming and the resource depletion it is necessary to advance the transition from heat engines to some energy saving form of propulsion in marine surface vessels carter and carter 2010 in recent years more advanced marine applications have been explored in fields of the underactuated surface vehicles the sail assisted vehicle is a meaningful area of research in practical engineering due to its energy saving merits briere 2008 cruz and alves 2009 and many countries have invested amounts of finance to facilitate the construction and research of sail assisted vehicle represented by japan and europe shukla and ghosh 2009 however due to only equipping with the rudder and sail actuators and the propeller the unmanned sail assisted vehicle usav is characterized with the underactuated dynamics thus the control signals rudder angle and sail angle are applied to the practical closed loop system through the actuators and the actuators may frequently encounter gradual or abrupt failures due to the excess wear or the limited energy transportation corradini and orlando 2006 that may degrade the control system robust performance to improve the effectiveness and robustness of the path following control system it is necessary to further investigate the guidance and control subsystems for the usav the unmanned sail assisted vehicle has been a hot topic owing to its superiority of energy saving and the high economical efficiency in the marine transportation and many theoretical researches have been shown in the existing literatures e g the fuzzy logic system abril et al 1997 stelzer et al 2007 the reactive navigation technique guo et al 2011 and the modeling and heading control wille et al 2016 in yeh and bin 1992 the heading controller was developed based on the 3 degree of freedom dof dynamic model for the sail assisted vessels however the rolling attitude of the usav is easy to be affected by the environment due to the sail structure that may cause the instability or capsize of the usav considering the actual weather case the nonlinear 4 dof dynamics mathematical model for the sailing was first presented using the fossen s compact notation xiao and jouffroy 2011 and a heading control law was designed via the backstepping technique in order to further verify the accuracy of the dynamic model of the usav a novel course controller was designed using the integral backstepping method the sail angle was obtained by the table look up xiao et al 2012a xiao and jouffroy 2014 and the simulation results illustrated the good performance of the sail control law due to the thrust force mainly relies on the wind direction and wind speed a speed optimizer was presented towards the sail via a modified extreme seeking approach to obtain the optimal velocity xiao et al 2012b corno et al 2015 and control performance was illustrated based on the 4 dof nonlinear dynamic model in the abovementioned results the system model parameters and the actuators gain function are assumed to be known in the control process that may restrict the engineering application of the related theoretical algorithm to deal with more engineering practice conditions the neural networks and fuzzy logic approximator was applied in the control design to tackle the system uncertainty xu and shou 2018 tong and li 2014 the function approximator could improve the stability and reduce the computing burden of the control system furthermore the restriction of the actuators gain uncertainty was removed by employing the robust adaptive technique and the dynamic surface control in the fields of underactuated surface vessels qiao and zhang 2018a comparing with the course keeping algorithm the path following control could execute the special missions and be more fitted to marine engineering requirement however the path following control for the usav is seldom studied due to the complicate dynamics of the sail angle coupling with environment wind speed and direction especially the guidance principle for the upwind and downwind is difficult to obtain a straight line path following control scheme was designed using the table look up method in santos and junior 2016 the simulation experiment has been presented to show the control performance to carry out the nonlinear path following tasks a novel reactive path planning method was proposed to generate the reference signal pêtrès et al 2012 in this method the no go zones and don t go zones were taken into account and be considered as the virtual obstacles and the dynamic simulator shows that the proposed control algorithm could successfully guide the boat sailing between the predefined waypoints under the real time varying environment besides some actual tests have been provided for the sailboat alves and cruz 2014 a flexible mission programming system was presented to implement the missions of the upwind sailing and downwind sailing and the construction of mission programs was demonstrated by the actual tests to further improve the concise form of the guidance algorithm an improved integral line of sight los guidance law was derived in zhang et al 2019 note that a sign selection method was introduced to generate the upwind and downwind guidance signal the numerical simulated results demonstrate the good accuracy and performance of the closed loop control system however the los principle leaps in the desired yaw rate control during the transition from the straight line to the turning waypoint and may reduce the tracking performance for the waypoint based nonlinear path xiang et al 2017 jin 2016 in actuality in the aforementioned results the control signals are transmitted to the actuators continuously and that may overflow the transmission channel and the actuator failures may be frequently experienced because of the excess wear or the limited communication channel that may degrade the performance of the closed loop control system to overcome this challenge event triggered control was presented to reduce the signal communication with keeping satisfied control performance for the linear system cai et al 2013 szanto et al 2017 presents a new event triggered controller for the nonuniform sampled data control system to prompt the system stability performance that is an effective method to reduce the communication burden due to its transmission only when the event occurs in order to take into the actuator failures xing et al 2017 studies the event triggered control problem for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems subject to the possible actuator failures it should be noted that event triggered control with actuator failures are seldom applied to the underactuated surface vessels especially for the usav motivated by the above frameworks the waypoints based path following control is studied for the usav in the guidance term a composite logic virtual ship lvs guidance principle is developed for the waypoints based path for the control term an event triggered robust neural control algorithm is targetly designed for rudder angle δ r and the sail angle δ s with the actuator failures furthermore the main contributions of this note are summarized in the following twofold 1 a composite lvs guidance principle is developed for usav to generate the real time heading signal and the reference path is generated by the logic virtual ship for the crosswind condition the guidance principle is obtained through the lvs as for the upwind and downwind conditions the guidance principle is obtained by utilizing the sign self selection algorithm that is suited for the nautical practice and could improve the autonomous capability of the usav 2 an event triggered robust neural control algorithm is designed to tackle with path following problem for the usav via the robust neural damping technique and the input event triggered mechanism though the radial basis function neural networks rbf nns were used to approximate the system uncertainties the weights online learning is not required for the merits of the robust neural damping technique only four adaptive parameters are updated online to compensate the actuators gain uncertainty and actuator failures in addition the energy consumption and transmission burden of the actuators are largely reduced because of the input event triggered mechanism that could improve the applicability of the theoretical algorithm to the marine engineering 2 problem formulation and preliminaries throughout the paper

and jouffroy 2014 by using of newtonian and lagrangian mechanics through the physical reasoning and fossen s methodology the 4 dof mathematical model of the usav has been further established as eq 1

respectively d w u d w v d w p d w r are the forces or moments generated by the marine environment and the system perturbation x u y v k p n r indicate the hydrodynamic derivatives m i z i x describe

are the forces or moments generated by the sail rudder keel and hull and the more detailed expression can be referred in xiao and jouffroy 2014 in eq 2 the gain function t u 1 t u 2 f r can be with the form of eq 4 in the marine engineering the energy of actuators is finite thus there exists the constants t u 1 t u 1 t u 2 t u 2 and f r f r satisfied that 0 t u 1 t u 1 t u 1 0 t u 2 t u 2 t u 2 and 0 f r f r f r it is noted that the unknown constants t u 1 t u 1 t u 2 t u 2 and f r f r are only used for the stability analysis 4 t u 1 1 t p ρ w d p 4 k t j p t u 2 1 2 ρ a a s u a w 2 sin β w

and the rudder α h is the attack angle of rudder u r is the apparent speed of rudder and u a w is the apparent wind speed the apparent wind angle β w s in b frame can be described as β w s arctan 2 u a w v u a w u furthermore the sail angle can be expressed by for the usav the thrust is mainly provided by the propeller and the sail and the turning moment is mainly provided by the rudder the performance of the actuators could influence the effectiveness of the closed loop control system therefore one can define the υ δ i as the event triggered inputs related to the corresponding control input if the δ i a i r u denotes the output signals of the actuators i e the real control input signal implemented to the system so the fault model of actuators can be expressed as following 6 δ i a k δ i h υ δ i δ i h t t δ i h b t δ i h e where the 0 k δ i h 1 and δ i h denote the unknown constants denoting different fault model of actuators t δ i h s t δ i h e are the actuators fault time from the beginning to ending what s more the actuators fault model 6 includes the following cases 1 if k δ i h 1 δ i h 0 the actuators fault are not existing 2 if 0 k δ i h 1 δ i h 0 the actuators work in the partial loss of effectiveness ploe 3 if k δ i h 1 δ i h 0 the actuators are the bias fault remark 1 the sail assisted vehicles can be divide into two kinds based on the main thrust system one is the sail as the main propeller and the other is the propeller as the main propeller in this note the sail is considered as the mainly thrust and the the propeller is used to provide the constant thrust to compensate the thrust loss of the sail in addition the actuators inputs may encounter faults due to the large communication load or other unknown factors especially the sail actuator is easy affected by the varying environment and that may cause the invalid of the closed loop control system hence the actuators fault model is necessary and useful to the controller design remark 2 the nonlinear dynamic model 1 and 2 for the sailboat has been established in xiao and jouffroy 2014 comparing with existing model the external marine disturbance for the mathematical model has been taken into account in this note that meets the practical engineering requirements and that also could improve the reasonability of nonlinear mathematical model assumption 1 it is assumed that the uncertainty disturbance terms d w i i u v p r satisfy d w i d w i i u v p r where d w i i u v p r are the positive unknown constants assumption 2 based on the systematic analysis for the underactuated vessels in do 2010 the sway velocity v is passive bounded 2 2 rbf nns approximation in practice engineering neural networks and fuzzy logic system are generally applied as an effective tool to approximate the system uncertainties xu and sun 2017 jin 2019 in this note the rbf nns approximator is used for the process of controller design to settle the structure and parameter uncertainties therefore we introduced a useful lemma that will be employed later to promote the robustness and conciseness of the control algorithm lemma 1 tong and li 2010 for any given continuous function f x with f 0 0 defined in a compact set ω x r m by combining the rbf nns and the continous function separation techniques it can be approximated with any precision 7 f x s x ax ε x x ω x where s x s 1 x s 2 x s l x is a vector of rbf with the form of gaussian function 8 ε x is the random error constant with unknown upper bound ε x 8 s i x 1 2 π ς i exp x μ i t x μ i 2 ς i 2 i 1 2 l where l 1 is the node number of neural networks μ i denotes the center of receptive field and ς i indicates the width of the gaussian function m is the dimension number of the state vector x and a is a weight matrix expressed as following 9 a ϖ 11 ϖ 12 ϖ 1 m ϖ 21 ϖ 22 ϖ 2 m ϖ l 1 ϖ l 2 ϖ l m 3 composite lvs guidance for the usav in engineering practice the reference path is often generated by the waypoints w 1 w 2 w n with w i x i y i i 1 2 n and the marine surface vessels would converge to the desired reference path by employing the guidance principle the lvs guidance principle is usually applied to implement the path following control for the common marine surface vessels however different from the common marine surface vessels the sail angle is greatly influenced by the wind direction see fig 2 the navigated zone could divide into three zones i e the upwind zone fig 2 a the crosswind zone fig 2 b d and the downwind zone fig 2 c the upwind zone and the downwind zone could cause an invalid or an ineffective control of the usav in order to deal with these restrictions a zigzag route should be employed in upwind zone and downwind zone hence the composite lvs guidance principle was developed to generate the real time reference signal for the usav 3 1 crosswind zone guidance the objection of the lvs guidance is to offer the logic virtual ship as the reference which could sail along with the waypoints based path automatically with the desired velocity fig 3 describes the generally framework of the lvs guidance the key element in the proposed lvs guidance principle is the logic virtual ship with the form of eq 10 10 x r u r cos ψ r v r sin ψ r y r u r sin ψ r v r cos ψ r ψ r r r referring to fig 3 the dynamical assigned strategy of lvs is shown as following the reference path was generated by the lvs and the lvs position is indicated by x r y r the ψ r is the desired angle of lvs that also is the angle of w i 1 w i the reference signal ψ v of the real ship to the lvs could be derived as eq 11 11 ψ v 1 2 1 sgn x e sgn y e π arctan y e x e in order to facilitate the control design in the next step the ψ v is further expressed as 12 ψ d ψ v as for the position of usav can be described by x y and the following error operator 13 was introduced for the further control design 13 x e x r x y e y r y z e x e 2 y e 2 ψ e ψ d ψ 3 2 upwind and downwind zones guidance for the cases of the upwind sailing or the downwind sailing the single lvs guidance principle may not be enough to guide the usav to sail with the waypoints based path thus the composite lvs guidance law should be developed by utilizing the sign self selection algorithm aiming to the upwind and downwind zones separately when the heading angle ψ is in the upwind zone the upwind guidance law was employed to guide the usav to sail along with the zigzag route see fig 4 a if the upwind angle related to the real direction of wind ψ t w satisfies ψ t w π sgn ψ t w ψ r χ 1 and χ 1 is the boundary of upwind zone furthermore a sign function s t is defined to achieve the turning maneuvering and s t is described as 14 s t sgn h t d c j sgn s t 1 j 1 2 with h t x e 2 y e 2 sin ψ r ψ v where d c j is the definite distance threshold for upwind and downwind path t t 1 denote the present time point and the last time point respectively in eq 14 s t will adjust its sign automatically if h t d c 1 hence the desired reference signal ψ d for the upwind path can be expressed as 15 ψ d ψ t w π sgn ψ t w s t χ 1 similarly when the heading angle ψ is in the downwind zone the downwind guidance principle was introduced to guide the usav to sail along with the zigzag path see fig 4 b if the downwind angle related to the real direction of wind ψ t w satisfies ψ t w ψ r χ 2 and χ 2 is the boundary of downwind zone the desired reference signal ψ d for the downwind path can be expressed as 16 ψ d ψ t w s t χ 2 4 formulation of the event triggered robust neural controller considering the actuator faults model the nonlinear mathematical model 1 and 2 are further simplified as the following system 17 and 18 which are only for the control design in this section and then an event triggered robust neural control algorithm is designed by fusing the backstepping technique robust neural damping technique and input event triggered mechanism 17 ψ e ψ ψ d z e x r cos ψ d y r sin ψ d u cos ψ e v sin ψ e 18 ψ r cos φ

e α u u r e α r r to stabilize the error system 17 and the virtual control laws α u α r can be derived via the backstepping technique 19 α u cos ψ e 1 k z e z e δ x y x r cos ψ d y r sin ψ d v sin ψ e α r cos φ 1 k ψ e ψ e ψ d where k z e and k ψ e are both the positive design parameters the derivation of the virtual controllers α u and α r is difficult to acquire in the control engineering and that may cause the so called explosion of complexity in the next control design to evade this restriction and reduce the computational burden the differential of α u and α r can be obtained by employing the dsc technique qiao and zhang 2018b one lets the virtual controllers pass through the first order filters with the time constants τ i i e 20 τ i β i β i α i β i 0 α i 0 i u r where the q i β i α i i u r denote the errors of dynamic surface and the time derivations of them are derived as 21 q u β u α u q u τ u α u z e z e α u x r x r α u y r y r α u v r v r α u ψ d ψ d α u ψ e ψ e q u τ u a u z e z e x r x r y r y r v r v r ψ d ψ d ψ e ψ e q r q r τ r a r ψ e ψ e ψ d ψ d φ φ where a u and a r are the bounded continuous function and there exists the positive constants m u m r satisfying a u m u a r m r based on the aforemention the error dynamic 17 can be rewritten as 22 ψ e β r r e q r ψ d z e x r cos ψ d y r sin ψ d β u u e q u cos ψ e v sin ψ e step 2 at this step the derivative of the errors variables u e and r e can be obtained from eq 18 and eq 20 one can obtain the following dynamic 23 23 u e 1 m u m u β u m v v r f u t u 1 n n t u 2 k δ u h υ δ u δ u m u d w u

triggered mechanism with a time varying threshold which relies on the value of the control input command the control input signal for the actuators was rewritten as 24 υ δ i t ω δ i t k δ i t t k δ i t k 1 δ i i u r the event triggered rule is designed as 25 e δ i t ω δ i t υ δ i t t k 1 δ i inf t t k δ i e δ i t b δ i υ δ i d δ i where 0 b δ i 1 d δ i 0 denote the design parameters t k δ i k z is the input update time of the corresponding actuator the input signal of the corresponding actuator will remain unchanged as ω δ i t k δ i for all the time t t k δ i t k 1 δ i based on the above event triggered rule the ω δ i t υ δ i t b δ i υ δ i d δ i is satisfied in all the time thus the following two cases can be further discussed case 1 if υ δ i t 0 we have b δ i υ δ i d δ i ω δ i t υ δ i t b δ i υ δ i d δ i eq 26 can be derived as 26 ω δ i t υ δ i t λ δ i t b δ i υ δ i d δ i λ δ i t 1 1 case 2 if υ δ i t 0 we have b δ i υ δ i d δ i ω δ i t υ δ i t b δ i υ δ i d δ i eq 27 can be derived as 27 ω δ i t υ δ i t λ δ i t b δ i υ δ i d δ i λ δ i t 1 1 combining the case 1 and case 2 eq 28 can be constructed as 28 ω δ i t υ δ i t λ 1 δ i t b δ i υ δ i λ 2 δ i t d δ i with λ 1 δ i t λ 2 δ i t λ δ i t υ δ i t 0 λ 1 δ i t λ 2 δ i t λ δ i t υ δ i t 0 furthermore eq 28 can be reworded as 29 ω δ i t 1 λ 1 δ i t b δ i υ δ i λ 2 δ i t d δ i 30 υ δ i t ω δ i t 1 λ 1 δ i t b δ i λ 2 δ i t d δ i 1 λ 1 δ i t b δ i as for the nonlinear function f i ν i u r in eq 23 it can be approximated by using the lemma 1 i e 31 f i ν s ν a i ν ε ν s ν a i β ν s ν a i ν e ε ν s ν a i β ν b i s ν a i ϖ i ε ν where β ν β u v p β r ν e u e 0 0 r e ε ν denotes the random approximation error define constant b i a i f the normalized term a i m a i a i f thus one can obtain ϖ i a i m ν e b i ϖ i a i ν e by using the knowledge of linear algebra furthermore the robust neural damping term ξ i 2 is constructed as 32 ξ u 2 s ν a u β ν m v v r ε u m u d w u 2 s ν a u β ν d u 1 4 v 2 r 2 ε u m u d w u 2 ϑ u ϕ u ξ r 2 ϑ

according to the analysis of event triggered mechanism and rbf nns approximator the error dynamic 23 can be rewritten as eq 34 by combining eq 30 and eq 32 34 u e 1 m u m u β u ξ u s u b u ϖ u t u 2 k

due to the merits of three following points 1 the system uncertainties and marine environment disturbance were tackled by employing the rbf nns in addition nns weights are not required to update online due to the merits of robust neural damping technique 2 the gain uncertainty and actuator faults of the actuators were released through the adaptive parameters 3 the energy consumption and transmission burden of the actuators has been reduced by utilizing the input event triggered mechanism these superiorities could improve effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control algorithm

under the proposed control system square 5 numerical experiment the numerical experiment has been carried out under the simulated marine environment in this section the model based control scheme and the existing results in deng et al 2019 are chosen as the comparative experiments to illustrate the robustness and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy as for the model based controller it is designed based on the specific mathematical model of the usav that is to say the rbf nns are not employed to tackle the system parameters in the control design a prototype of the unmanned sail assisted vehicles is chosen as the control objective and the detailed system parameters can be referred in xiao and jouffroy 2014 for this purpose the waypoints based path is generated by the

sea wind and the irregular wind generated waves has been simulated by the introduced physical based mathematical model to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm the main wind speed u t

waves spectrums with fifth level sea state the waves spectrums and 3d view of the waves are shown in fig 5 the robustness of the proposed control algorithm can be illustrated under the above setting of the marine disturbance figs 6 10 describe the main numerical results of the path following experiment under the simulated marine environment fig 6 illustrates the comparison of the path following trajectory using the proposed scheme the model based control algorithm and one in deng et al 2019 it is obvious to note that the three algorithms could effectively stabilize usav to the waypoints based reference path and achieve the reasonable zigzag trajectory in the upwind and downwind zones though comparing with the two schemes the proposed lvs based scheme is with the better tracking performance especially in the vicinity of waypoints the proposed scheme could obtain the smooth turning trajectory and the deviation is smaller for the stage of straight line the corresponding comparison of control inputs are presented in fig 7 compared with the results in deng et al 2019 the proposed algorithm is with more reasonable control order and actual input note the stair stepping control order indicates that the order signal is sent to the actuator servo system only at the event triggered sampling point from the curve for actual input the unnecessary mechanical wear could be avoided by the proposed algorithm in addition it can be noted that the model based scheme is with the larger and more frequent control order though that can satisfies the physical constraints i e δ s 90 deg 90 deg δ r 30 deg 30 deg the possible reasons for the unsatisfactory performance may include two aspects 1 in the control law part of the salutary model dynamics is offset by the compensating terms that may deteriorate the stabilizing performance of the closed loop system 2 the effect of marine disturbances is not considered in the model based control law fig 8 gives the attitude variables of the two control scheme under the simulated ocean disturbance it is shown that the roll angle is obviously smaller under the proposed control algorithm and that could enhance the safety performance

21474,this note focus on the waypoints based path following control for the unmanned sail assisted vehicles usav aiming to release the constraints of the actuator failures and gain uncertainties the proposed scheme is formulated as two components i e the composite guidance part and the control part by utilizing the sign self selection algorithm the composite logic virtual ship lvs guidance law is developed in the scheme to program the real time heading angle for the usav the main superiorities of this design are to ensure the usav navigating efficiently and choose the corresponding sailing mode upwind mode downwind mode or crosswind mode furthermore to improve the effectiveness of the closed loop control system an event triggered robust neural control algorithm is targetly designed for the rudder actuator and the sail actuator by fusing the robust neural damping technique and the input event triggered mechanism in this algorithm the unknown terms of the system are tackled requiring no information of the system model and the external disturbances the transmission burden from the controller to the actuator is reduced and the unknown actuator failures and the gain uncertainties are compensated through four adaptive updated parameters based on the lyapunov analysis sufficient effort has been made to guarantee that all the signals of the closed loop control system are the semi global uniform ultimate bounded sguub finally the simulated results demonstrate the validity of the proposed control strategy keywords sail assisted vehicles lvs guidance path following control adaptive neural control event triggered inputs 1 introduction under the context of the weather warming and the resource depletion it is necessary to advance the transition from heat engines to some energy saving form of propulsion in marine surface vessels carter and carter 2010 in recent years more advanced marine applications have been explored in fields of the underactuated surface vehicles the sail assisted vehicle is a meaningful area of research in practical engineering due to its energy saving merits briere 2008 cruz and alves 2009 and many countries have invested amounts of finance to facilitate the construction and research of sail assisted vehicle represented by japan and europe shukla and ghosh 2009 however due to only equipping with the rudder and sail actuators and the propeller the unmanned sail assisted vehicle usav is characterized with the underactuated dynamics thus the control signals rudder angle and sail angle are applied to the practical closed loop system through the actuators and the actuators may frequently encounter gradual or abrupt failures due to the excess wear or the limited energy transportation corradini and orlando 2006 that may degrade the control system robust performance to improve the effectiveness and robustness of the path following control system it is necessary to further investigate the guidance and control subsystems for the usav the unmanned sail assisted vehicle has been a hot topic owing to its superiority of energy saving and the high economical efficiency in the marine transportation and many theoretical researches have been shown in the existing literatures e g the fuzzy logic system abril et al 1997 stelzer et al 2007 the reactive navigation technique guo et al 2011 and the modeling and heading control wille et al 2016 in yeh and bin 1992 the heading controller was developed based on the 3 degree of freedom dof dynamic model for the sail assisted vessels however the rolling attitude of the usav is easy to be affected by the environment due to the sail structure that may cause the instability or capsize of the usav considering the actual weather case the nonlinear 4 dof dynamics mathematical model for the sailing was first presented using the fossen s compact notation xiao and jouffroy 2011 and a heading control law was designed via the backstepping technique in order to further verify the accuracy of the dynamic model of the usav a novel course controller was designed using the integral backstepping method the sail angle was obtained by the table look up xiao et al 2012a xiao and jouffroy 2014 and the simulation results illustrated the good performance of the sail control law due to the thrust force mainly relies on the wind direction and wind speed a speed optimizer was presented towards the sail via a modified extreme seeking approach to obtain the optimal velocity xiao et al 2012b corno et al 2015 and control performance was illustrated based on the 4 dof nonlinear dynamic model in the abovementioned results the system model parameters and the actuators gain function are assumed to be known in the control process that may restrict the engineering application of the related theoretical algorithm to deal with more engineering practice conditions the neural networks and fuzzy logic approximator was applied in the control design to tackle the system uncertainty xu and shou 2018 tong and li 2014 the function approximator could improve the stability and reduce the computing burden of the control system furthermore the restriction of the actuators gain uncertainty was removed by employing the robust adaptive technique and the dynamic surface control in the fields of underactuated surface vessels qiao and zhang 2018a comparing with the course keeping algorithm the path following control could execute the special missions and be more fitted to marine engineering requirement however the path following control for the usav is seldom studied due to the complicate dynamics of the sail angle coupling with environment wind speed and direction especially the guidance principle for the upwind and downwind is difficult to obtain a straight line path following control scheme was designed using the table look up method in santos and junior 2016 the simulation experiment has been presented to show the control performance to carry out the nonlinear path following tasks a novel reactive path planning method was proposed to generate the reference signal pêtrès et al 2012 in this method the no go zones and don t go zones were taken into account and be considered as the virtual obstacles and the dynamic simulator shows that the proposed control algorithm could successfully guide the boat sailing between the predefined waypoints under the real time varying environment besides some actual tests have been provided for the sailboat alves and cruz 2014 a flexible mission programming system was presented to implement the missions of the upwind sailing and downwind sailing and the construction of mission programs was demonstrated by the actual tests to further improve the concise form of the guidance algorithm an improved integral line of sight los guidance law was derived in zhang et al 2019 note that a sign selection method was introduced to generate the upwind and downwind guidance signal the numerical simulated results demonstrate the good accuracy and performance of the closed loop control system however the los principle leaps in the desired yaw rate control during the transition from the straight line to the turning waypoint and may reduce the tracking performance for the waypoint based nonlinear path xiang et al 2017 jin 2016 in actuality in the aforementioned results the control signals are transmitted to the actuators continuously and that may overflow the transmission channel and the actuator failures may be frequently experienced because of the excess wear or the limited communication channel that may degrade the performance of the closed loop control system to overcome this challenge event triggered control was presented to reduce the signal communication with keeping satisfied control performance for the linear system cai et al 2013 szanto et al 2017 presents a new event triggered controller for the nonuniform sampled data control system to prompt the system stability performance that is an effective method to reduce the communication burden due to its transmission only when the event occurs in order to take into the actuator failures xing et al 2017 studies the event triggered control problem for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems subject to the possible actuator failures it should be noted that event triggered control with actuator failures are seldom applied to the underactuated surface vessels especially for the usav motivated by the above frameworks the waypoints based path following control is studied for the usav in the guidance term a composite logic virtual ship lvs guidance principle is developed for the waypoints based path for the control term an event triggered robust neural control algorithm is targetly designed for rudder angle δ r and the sail angle δ s with the actuator failures furthermore the main contributions of this note are summarized in the following twofold 1 a composite lvs guidance principle is developed for usav to generate the real time heading signal and the reference path is generated by the logic virtual ship for the crosswind condition the guidance principle is obtained through the lvs as for the upwind and downwind conditions the guidance principle is obtained by utilizing the sign self selection algorithm that is suited for the nautical practice and could improve the autonomous capability of the usav 2 an event triggered robust neural control algorithm is designed to tackle with path following problem for the usav via the robust neural damping technique and the input event triggered mechanism though the radial basis function neural networks rbf nns were used to approximate the system uncertainties the weights online learning is not required for the merits of the robust neural damping technique only four adaptive parameters are updated online to compensate the actuators gain uncertainty and actuator failures in addition the energy consumption and transmission burden of the actuators are largely reduced because of the input event triggered mechanism that could improve the applicability of the theoretical algorithm to the marine engineering 2 problem formulation and preliminaries throughout the paper

and jouffroy 2014 by using of newtonian and lagrangian mechanics through the physical reasoning and fossen s methodology the 4 dof mathematical model of the usav has been further established as eq 1 and eq 2 considering the environment disturbance 1 x u cos ψ v cos φ sin ψ y u sin ψ v cos φ cos ψ φ p ψ r cos φ 2 m u u m v v r f u t u 1 n n t u 2 δ u d w u m v v m u u r f v d w v m p p m g g m t

describe the surge sway displacement rolling angle and yaw angle in the inertial coordinate system v u v p r t r 3 are the surge sway rolling and yaw velocities in the body coordinate system respectively d w u d w v d w p d w r are the forces or moments generated by the marine environment and the system perturbation x u y v k p n r indicate the hydrodynamic derivatives m i z i x describe the mass of the usav the z axial moment of inertia and the x axial moment of inertia respectively g m t denotes the initial metacentric height and g is the gravitational acceleration f u f v f p f r are the forces or moments generated by the sail rudder keel and hull and the more detailed expression can be referred in xiao and jouffroy 2014 in eq 2 the gain function t u 1 t u 2 f r can be with the form of eq 4 in the marine engineering the energy of actuators is finite thus there exists the constants t u 1 t u 1 t u 2 t u 2 and f r f r satisfied that 0 t u 1 t u 1 t u 1 0 t u 2 t u 2 t u 2 and 0 f r f r f r it is noted that the unknown constants t u 1 t u 1 t u 2 t u 2 and f r f r are only used for the stability analysis 4 t u 1 1 t p ρ w d p 4 k t j p t u 2 1 2 ρ a a s u a w 2 sin β w

and the rudder α h is the attack angle of rudder u r is the apparent speed of rudder and u a w is the apparent wind speed the apparent wind angle β w s in b frame can be described as β w s arctan 2 u a w v u a w u furthermore the sail angle can be expressed by for the usav the thrust is mainly provided by the propeller and the sail and the turning moment is mainly provided by the rudder the performance of the actuators could influence the effectiveness of the closed loop control system therefore one can define the υ δ i as the event triggered inputs related to the corresponding control input if the δ i a i r u denotes the output signals of the actuators i e the real control input signal implemented to the system so the fault model of actuators can be expressed as following 6 δ i a k δ i h υ δ i δ i h t t δ i h b t δ i h e where the 0 k δ i h 1 and δ i h denote the unknown constants denoting different fault model of actuators t δ i h s t δ i h e are the actuators fault time from the beginning to ending what s more the actuators fault model 6 includes the following cases 1 if k δ i h 1 δ i h 0 the actuators fault are not existing 2 if 0 k δ i h 1 δ i h 0 the actuators work in the partial loss of effectiveness ploe 3 if k δ i h 1 δ i h 0 the actuators are the bias fault remark 1 the sail assisted vehicles can be divide into two kinds based on the main thrust system one is the sail as the main propeller and the other is the propeller as the main propeller in this note the sail is considered as the mainly thrust and the the propeller is used to provide the constant thrust to compensate the thrust loss of the sail in addition the actuators inputs may encounter faults due to the large communication load or other unknown factors especially the sail actuator is easy affected by the varying environment and that may cause the invalid of the closed loop control system hence the actuators fault model is necessary and useful to the controller design remark 2 the nonlinear dynamic model 1 and 2 for the sailboat has been established in xiao and jouffroy 2014 comparing with existing model the external marine disturbance for the mathematical model has been taken into account in this note that meets the practical engineering requirements and that also could improve the reasonability of nonlinear mathematical model assumption 1 it is assumed that the uncertainty disturbance terms d w i i u v p r satisfy d w i d w i i u v p r where d w i i u v p r are the positive unknown constants assumption 2 based on the systematic analysis for the underactuated vessels in do 2010 the sway velocity v is passive bounded 2 2 rbf nns approximation in practice engineering neural networks and fuzzy logic system are generally applied as an effective tool to approximate the system uncertainties xu and sun 2017 jin 2019 in this note the rbf nns approximator is used for the process of controller design to settle the structure and parameter uncertainties therefore we introduced a useful lemma that will be employed later to promote the robustness and conciseness of the control algorithm lemma 1 tong and li 2010 for any given continuous function f x with f 0 0 defined in a compact set ω x r m by combining the rbf nns and the continous function separation techniques it can be approximated with any precision 7 f x s x ax ε x x ω x where s x s 1 x s 2 x s l x is a vector of rbf with the form of gaussian function 8 ε x is the random error constant with unknown upper bound ε x 8 s i x 1 2 π ς i exp x μ i t x μ i 2 ς i 2 i 1 2 l where l 1 is the node number of neural networks μ i denotes the center of receptive field and ς i indicates the width of the gaussian function m is the dimension number of the state vector x and a is a weight matrix expressed as following 9 a ϖ 11 ϖ 12 ϖ 1 m ϖ 21 ϖ 22 ϖ 2 m ϖ l 1 ϖ l 2 ϖ l m 3 composite lvs guidance for the usav in engineering practice the reference path is often generated by the waypoints w 1 w 2 w n with w i x i y i i 1 2 n and the marine surface vessels would converge to the desired reference path by employing the guidance principle the lvs guidance principle is usually applied to implement the path following control for the common marine surface vessels however different from the common marine surface vessels the sail angle is greatly influenced by the wind direction see fig 2 the navigated zone could divide into three zones i e the upwind zone fig 2 a the crosswind zone fig 2 b d and the downwind zone fig 2 c the upwind zone and the downwind zone could cause an invalid or an ineffective control of the usav in order to deal with these restrictions a zigzag route should be employed in upwind zone and downwind zone hence the composite lvs guidance principle was developed to generate the real time reference signal for the usav 3 1 crosswind zone guidance the objection of the lvs guidance is to offer the logic virtual ship as the reference which could sail along with the waypoints based path automatically with the desired velocity fig 3 describes the generally framework of the lvs guidance the key element in the proposed lvs guidance principle is the logic virtual ship with the form of eq 10 10 x r u r cos ψ r v r sin ψ r y r u r sin ψ r v r cos ψ r ψ r r r referring to fig 3 the dynamical assigned strategy of lvs is shown as following the reference path was generated by the lvs and the lvs position is indicated by x r y r the ψ r is the desired angle of lvs that also is the angle of w i 1 w i the reference signal ψ v of the real ship to the lvs could be derived as eq 11 11 ψ v 1 2 1 sgn x e sgn y e π arctan y e x e in order to facilitate the control design in the next step the ψ v is further expressed as 12 ψ d ψ v as for the position of usav can be described by x y and the following error operator 13 was introduced for the further control design 13 x e x r x y e y r y z e x e 2 y e 2 ψ e ψ d ψ 3 2 upwind and downwind zones guidance for the cases of the upwind sailing or the downwind sailing the single lvs guidance principle may not be enough to guide the usav to sail with the waypoints based path thus the composite lvs guidance law should be developed by utilizing the sign self selection algorithm aiming to the upwind and downwind zones separately when the heading angle ψ is in the upwind zone the upwind guidance law was employed to guide the usav to sail along with the zigzag route see fig 4 a if the upwind angle related to the real direction of wind ψ t w satisfies ψ t w π sgn ψ t w ψ r χ 1 and χ 1 is the boundary of upwind zone furthermore a sign function s t is defined to achieve the turning maneuvering and s t is described as 14 s t sgn h t d c j sgn s t 1 j 1 2 with h t x e 2 y e 2 sin ψ r ψ v where d c j is the definite distance threshold for upwind and downwind path t t 1 denote the present time point and the last time point respectively in eq 14 s t will adjust its sign automatically if h t d c 1 hence the desired reference signal ψ d for the upwind path can be expressed as 15 ψ d ψ t w π sgn ψ t w s t χ 1 similarly when the heading angle ψ is in the downwind zone the downwind guidance principle was introduced to guide the usav to sail along with the zigzag path see fig 4 b if the downwind angle related to the real direction of wind ψ t w satisfies ψ t w ψ r χ 2 and χ 2 is the boundary of downwind zone the desired reference signal ψ d for the downwind path can be expressed as 16 ψ d ψ t w s t χ 2 4 formulation of the event triggered robust neural controller considering the actuator faults model the nonlinear mathematical model 1 and 2 are further simplified as the following system 17 and 18 which are only for the control design in this section and then an event triggered robust neural control algorithm is designed by fusing the backstepping technique robust neural damping technique and input event triggered mechanism 17 ψ e ψ ψ d z e x r cos ψ d y r sin ψ d u cos ψ e v sin ψ e 18 ψ r cos φ

α r cos φ 1 k ψ e ψ e ψ d where k z e and k ψ e are both the positive design parameters the derivation of the virtual controllers α u and α r is difficult to acquire in the control engineering and that may cause the so called explosion of complexity in the next control design to evade this restriction and reduce the computational burden the differential of α u and α r can be obtained by employing the dsc technique qiao and zhang 2018b one lets the virtual controllers pass through the first order filters with the time constants τ i i e 20 τ i β i β i α i β i 0 α i 0 i u r where the q i β i α i i u r denote the errors of dynamic surface and the time derivations of them are derived as 21 q u β u α u q u τ u α u z e z e α u x r x r α u y r y r α u v r v r α u ψ d ψ d α u ψ e ψ e q u τ u a u z e z e x r x r y r y r v r v r ψ d ψ d ψ e ψ e q r q r τ r a r ψ e ψ e ψ d ψ d φ φ where a u and a r are the bounded continuous function and there exists the positive constants m u m r satisfying a u m u a r m r based on the aforemention the error dynamic 17 can be rewritten as 22 ψ e β r r e q r ψ d z e x r cos ψ d y r sin ψ d β u u e q u cos ψ e v sin ψ e step 2 at this step the derivative of the errors variables u e and r e can be obtained from eq 18 and eq 20 one can obtain the following dynamic 23 23 u e 1 m u m u β u m v v r f u t u 1 n n t u 2 k δ u h υ δ u δ u m u d w u

triggered mechanism with a time varying threshold which relies on the value of the control input command the control input signal for the actuators was rewritten as 24 υ δ i t ω δ i t k δ i t t k δ i t k 1 δ i i u r the event triggered rule is designed as 25 e δ i t ω δ i t υ δ i t t k 1 δ i inf t t k δ i e δ i t b δ i υ δ i d δ i where 0 b δ i 1 d δ i 0 denote the design parameters t k δ i k z is the input update time of the corresponding actuator the input signal of the corresponding actuator will remain unchanged as ω δ i t k δ i for all the time t t k δ i t k 1 δ i based on the above event triggered rule the ω δ i t υ δ i t b δ i υ δ i d δ i is satisfied in all the time thus the following two cases can be further discussed case 1 if υ δ i t 0 we have b δ i υ δ i d δ i ω δ i t υ δ i t b δ i υ δ i d δ i eq 26 can be derived as 26 ω δ i t υ δ i t λ δ i t b δ i υ δ i d δ i λ δ i t 1 1 case 2 if υ δ i t 0 we have b δ i υ δ i d δ i ω δ i t υ δ i t b δ i υ δ i d δ i eq 27 can be derived as 27 ω δ i t υ δ i t λ δ i t b δ i υ δ i d δ i λ δ i t 1 1 combining the case 1 and case 2 eq 28 can be constructed as 28 ω δ i t υ δ i t λ 1 δ i t b δ i υ δ i λ 2 δ i t d δ i with λ 1 δ i t λ 2 δ i t λ δ i t υ δ i t 0 λ 1 δ i t λ 2 δ i t λ δ i t υ δ i t 0 furthermore eq 28 can be reworded as 29 ω δ i t 1 λ 1 δ i t b δ i υ δ i λ 2 δ i t d δ i 30 υ δ i t ω δ i t 1 λ 1 δ i t b δ i λ 2 δ i t d δ i 1 λ 1 δ i t b δ i as for the nonlinear function f i ν i u r in eq 23 it can be approximated by using the lemma 1 i e 31 f i ν s ν a i ν ε ν s ν a i β ν s ν a i ν e ε ν s ν a i β ν b i s ν a i ϖ i ε ν where β ν β u v p β r ν e u e 0 0 r e ε ν denotes the random approximation error define constant b i a i f the normalized term a i m a i a i f thus one can obtain ϖ i a i m ν e b i ϖ i a i ν e by using the knowledge of linear algebra furthermore the robust neural damping term ξ i 2 is constructed as 32 ξ u 2 s ν a u β ν m v v r ε u m u d w u 2 s ν a u β ν d u 1 4 v 2 r 2 ε u m u d w u 2 ϑ u ϕ u ξ r 2 ϑ

according to the analysis of event triggered mechanism and rbf nns approximator the error dynamic 23 can be rewritten as eq 34 by combining eq 30 and eq 32 34 u e 1 m u m u β u ξ u s u b u ϖ u t u 2 k

due to the merits of three following points 1 the system uncertainties and marine environment disturbance were tackled by employing the rbf nns in addition nns weights are not required to update online due to the merits of robust neural damping technique 2 the gain uncertainty and actuator faults of the actuators were released through the adaptive parameters 3 the energy consumption and transmission burden of the actuators has been reduced by utilizing the input event triggered mechanism these superiorities could improve effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control algorithm

under the proposed control system square 5 numerical experiment the numerical experiment has been carried out under the simulated marine environment in this section the model based control scheme and the existing results in deng et al 2019 are chosen as the comparative experiments to illustrate the robustness and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy as for the model based controller it is designed based on the specific mathematical model of the usav that is to say the rbf nns are not employed to tackle the system parameters in the control design a prototype of the unmanned sail assisted vehicles is chosen as the control objective and the detailed system parameters can be referred in xiao and jouffroy 2014 for this purpose the waypoints based path is generated by the waypoints w 1 0 m 0 m w 2 600 m 0 m w 3 600 m 600 m w 4 1200 m 600 m w 5 1200 m 0 m w 6 1800 m 0 m the initial states of the closed loop control system are expressed as x 0 y 0 φ 0 ψ 0 u 0 v 0 p 0 r 0

corresponding design parameters are taken as eq 47 besides the rbf nn in the control design is used to approximate the nonlinear function f u f r which contains 25 nodes with centers spaced of u v p r

sea wind and the irregular wind generated waves has been simulated by the introduced physical based mathematical model to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm the main wind speed u t w 10 5 m s and the main wind direction ψ t w 350 deg and the jonswap joint north sea wave observation project wave spectrums fossen 2011 is introduced to generated the time varying wind generated waves spectrums with fifth level sea state the waves spectrums and 3d view of the waves are shown in fig 5 the robustness of the proposed control algorithm can be illustrated under the above setting of the marine disturbance figs 6 10 describe the main numerical results of the path following experiment under the simulated marine environment fig 6 illustrates the comparison of the path following trajectory using the proposed scheme the model based control algorithm and one in deng et al 2019 it is obvious to note that the three algorithms could effectively stabilize usav to the waypoints based reference path and achieve the reasonable zigzag trajectory in the upwind and downwind zones though comparing with the two schemes the proposed lvs based scheme is with the better tracking performance especially in the vicinity of waypoints the proposed scheme could obtain the smooth turning trajectory and the deviation is smaller for the stage of straight line the corresponding comparison of control inputs are presented in fig 7 compared with the results in deng et al 2019 the proposed algorithm is with more reasonable control order and actual input note the stair stepping control order indicates that the order signal is sent to the actuator servo system only at the event triggered sampling point from the curve for actual input the unnecessary mechanical wear could be avoided by the proposed algorithm in addition it can be noted that the model based scheme is with the larger and more frequent control order though that can satisfies the physical constraints i e δ s 90 deg 90 deg δ r 30 deg 30 deg the possible reasons for the unsatisfactory performance may include two aspects 1 in the control law part of the salutary model dynamics is offset by the compensating terms that may deteriorate the stabilizing performance of the closed loop system 2 the effect of marine disturbances is not considered in the model based control law fig 8 gives the attitude variables of the two control scheme under the simulated ocean disturbance it is shown that the roll angle is obviously smaller under the proposed control algorithm and that could enhance the safety performance and fig 9 presents the estimation of the updating online parameter to compensate the effect of the actuator faults and gain uncertainties for further quantitative analysis the following three performance indexes 48 are introduced to evaluate the two schemes huang et al 2019 they are the mean integrated absolute error mie the mean integrated absolute error of control inputs mic and the mean integrated variation of control inputs miv which describe the responsiveness of system the energy consumption and the smoothness properties of the controllers detailed quantitative results are illustrated in table 1 48 mie 1 t e n d 0 0 t e n d e t d t mic 1 t e n d 0 0 t e n d u t d t miv 1 t e n d 0 0 t e n d u t 1 u t d t in the engineering practice the control program is executed in the hardware computing module e g the industrial process computer ipc the related burden some characteristic may play a significant role for application of the theoretical algorithm from this consideration one employs the corresponding indexes to survey the burden some performance of the two schemes i e the computing held memory cm the elapsed time et the occupancy percentage op of cpu and the trigger number tn the indexes cm et op can describe the computing burden while the tn is used to measure the trigger count i e the number of times that the control order is sent to activate the related actuators table 2 presents the quantitative burden some comparison for the proposed algorithm and the result in deng et al 2019 about the indexes cm et op it is easy to note that the proposed algorithm is with the outstanding performance in aspect of computing burden besides setting the solver period as 0 01s the tn is only 2893 under the proposed event triggered control law that could effectively reduce the occupation of the communication channel from the controller to actuators based on the above experiments and analysis the developed composite lvs guidance principle and event triggered robust neural control law satisfy the engineering practice 6 conclusion this paper investigates the composite lvs guidance principle and event triggered robust neural control algorithm for the usav to implement the waypoint based path following task in the presence of time varying marine environment the usav could achieve the smooth switch around the turning point owning to the sign self selection algorithm and the constraints of the actuator failures and gain uncertainties was released and compensated by the four adaptive parameters in addition the proposed controller improves upon the concise form and the small computing burden by fusing robust neural damping technique and the input event triggered mechanism furthermore the comparative experiments are presented under the simulated marine environment to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm from the data comparison results the proposed control algorithm has the superiorities in aspects of reducing the computing burden and the occupation of the communication channel form the controller to actuators credit authorship contribution statement guoqing zhang methodology software formal analysis writing
