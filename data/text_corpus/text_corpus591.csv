2955,the nonlinear relationships across spatially distributed irrigation actual evapotranspiration and crop yield and interactions between agriculture and ecology aggravate difficulties in water land and fertilizer resources optimization to address the above problems this paper developed a framework of footprint families based multi objective type 2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming ffmot2frccp it integrated the multi objective programming mop footprint families interval type 2 ahp it2ahp type 2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming t2frccp with spatially distributed water production functions spatially distributed irrigation yield functions and irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions were fitted simultaneously to simulate spatial heterogeneous yield considering nonlinear relationships across irrigation actual evapotranspiration and yield it overcomes disadvantages of traditional functions in neglecting spatially distributed water transfers between irrigation and evapotranspiration interactive relationships between agricultural and ecological effects were measured by footprint families containing water carbon ecological and energy footprint concurrently based on the life cycle approach besides both water shortage risk and yield loss risk were quantified and controlled with consideration of their conduction machines moreover weights across footprint families and risks were determined by the it2ahp approach by taking compound uncertainties of subjectivities of mangers into account in addition uncertainties of the runoff were handled by t2frccp approach the model was applied to yingke irrigation district to verify its application resulted showed that 1 ecological footprint decreased energy footprint carbon footprint and risks enlarged when flow levels changed though its high medium and low levels 2 yield loss risk varied from 0 to 0 27 while water shortage risk changed from 0 13 to 0 32 and crop yield losses occurred after water shortage risk took place 3 the actual evapotranspiration presented mismatching variations with yield because of their various irrigation thresholds the results could offer insight in how to measure and handle nonlinear relationships amid distributed actual evapotranspiration and yield under various water allocation schemes besides the results could provide optimal decisions giving consideration of agricultural and ecological balances for managers keywords spatially distributed water production functions footprint families interval type 2 ahp type 2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming uncertainties data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water land resources are basic and necessary elements for supporting food productions and sustainable economic social developments liu et al 2019 he et al 2019 however agricultural production ways such as labor machinery electric power and resources consumptions like water land fertilizer and energy resources inevitably generate ecological destructions such as non point pollution greenhouse emission kim et al 2021 osei owusu et al 2021 this means that resource consumptions can promise food security as well as result into ecological damages shah et al 2019 therefore it is essential to achieve a tradeoff between agricultural food and agricultural ecology by making reasonable water land and fertilizer allocation strategies to address the above multiple contradictory objectives the multi objective mathematical programming mop and fractional programming fp have been developed in recent years ahmad et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 compared with fp approach mop could reflect important degrees of objectives by giving respective weights weights of multiple objectives in the mop approach have been determined by objective and subjective weight approaches zhang et al 2020 chen 2020 objective weight focuses on objectivity and fairness while subjective approach emphasizes on subjectivities of managers on basic of their experiences and knowledge decision makers faced with resource strategies unavoidably play subjectivities under complexed variations of environments which leads to that subjective weight method has high opportunities to be applied in determining weights and frequently applied method is analytic hierarchy process ahp and it has been gradually and rapidly developed into uncertain ahp because of different knowledge backgrounds and cognitive levels of experts gundogdu and kahraman 2020 khashei siuki et al 2020 the broaden uncertain ahp methods contain interval ahp fuzzy ahp type 2 fuzzy ahp interval type 2 ahp it2ahp the complexities of above methods become larger while precisions become higher from left to right fox example the interval ahp transforms deterministic values into interval numbers while it2ahp converts deterministic values into interval type 2 fuzzy numbers developed from interval numbers therefore the it2ahp will be established to determine weights of multiple objectives in this paper the resources consumption in the process of yield production has been widely evaluated by life cycle method through transforming consumption into energy or carbon generation per unit of yield cakar et al 2020 ghani et al 2019 for example the energy footprint of diesel oil is 46 625 mj kg there are many kinds of footprints such as 3d footprint water footprint energy footprint carbon footprint which are called as footprint families li et al 2019 aguilera et al 2019 dai et al 2021 ecological footprint reflects land use efficiency covering land types of farmlands woodland grassland etc water footprint deems water resources as transporters to evaluate water use output for yield production besides energy footprint views energy as supports to assess energy use efficiency and carbon footprint reviews carbon generation as carriers to calculate carbon emission per unit of yield arbitrary two or three homogeneous footprints across footprint families have been applied to measure resource consumption efficiencies however spatially distributed footprint families caused by spatially heterogeneous soil types weather conditions were rarely quantified because of its complexities the spatially distributed yield as one import component of footprint families has been measured in many ways such as the distributed aquacrop model the distributed swap model etc han et al 2019 wang and guo 2021 unfortunately the crop simulation model is complex and not easy to use when there are multidimensional input data compared with crop simulation model water production function is easier to simulate yield such as quadratic function jessen model cousquer et al 2019 qi et al 2018 however previous water production functions are usually used to simulate homogeneous yield and incapable of quantify spatially distributed crop yield nevertheless these functions provide an insight into building spatially distributed water production functions therefore the distributed water production functions will be established in this paper actual evapotranspiration yield functions were usually adopted to calculate yield under a series of actual evapotranspiration tarkalson et al 2018 actual evapotranspiration replaced by sum of irrigation and rainfall was applied to fit functions in drought district assuming that irrigation was all used for actual evapotranspiration sharma and irmak 2021 irmak et al 2020 however the above assumption may not hold when there are excessive irrigations or soil water content supplies actual evapotranspiration the reason why the hypothesis is not invalid is that many boundary constraints in the functions such as water exchanges were neglected and questions that what conditions did the irrigation actual evaporation functions hold occur however the above problems are rarely clarified and addressed in recent years therefore fitting irrigation yield functions as well as irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions with consideration of spatially distributed soil water transformation is a potential way to simulate distributed yield precisely and identify establishment conditions of associated water production functions the system owns uncertainties under impacts of complexities and variations of hydro meteorological factors affecting robustness of decisions definitely to solve this problem uncertain programming methods have gradually developed and applied in water resources management such as interval programming fuzzy programming and stochastic programming xie et al 2018 kundzewicz et al 2018 the single uncertain programming has been rapidly developed into compound uncertain programming to handle more complexed uncertainties of parameters for example the runoff owns uncertainties of randomness and fuzziness this is because characteristic parameters of random runoff own fuzzy characters and are expressed as fuzzy numbers composed of minimum possible possible and maximum possible values determined by statistical approaches the compound uncertain programming approaches have rapidly applied in water resources management including fuzzy random chance constrained programming frccp type 2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming t2frccp etc the t2frccp was derived from the frccp by transforming fuzzy numbers into type 2 fuzzy numbers because fuzzy numbers existed uncertainties wang et al 2020 pourmand et al 2020 therefore the t2frccp approach will be developed in this paper the risks inevitably exist under environment of uncertainties in the system the usually seen risk types are water shortage risk and yield loss risk with inseparable conduction relationships qian et al 2020 uddameri et al 2020 the above two kinds of risks have been widely and separately researched in previous studies but unfortunately their conducting relationships were rarely explored therefore conducting relationships between water shortage risk and yield risk will be quantified and discovered in this paper this paper attempts to develop the footprint families based multi objective type 2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming ffmot2frccp for optimizing spatially distributed water land and fertilizer resources the first section shows formulation process of footprint families water production functions it2ahp t2frccp and ffmot2frccp secondly the specific optimization model and study areas will be introduced finally the optimization results will be analyzed and robustness of developed model will be discussed in detail the results can offer optimal decisions for managers about how to allocate irrigation amount fertilizer and land resources across multiple m crops to reach sustainable agricultural ecological development 2 methodology 2 1 interval type 2 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process it2fahp the it2fahp has advantages in reflecting the uncertainties of subjectivities of decision makers compared with the traditional ahp method the it2fahp method transforms deterministic judge value into interval type 2 fuzzy numbers it2fs on basic of ahp the it2fs is defined as follows 1 a a u a l a 1 l a 2 l a 3 l a 4 l h 1 a l h 2 a l a 1 u a 2 u a 3 u a 4 u h 1 a u h 2 a u where a is trapezoidal it2fs a u a l are type 1 fuzzy sets a 1 u a 2 u a 3 u a 4 u a 1 l a 2 l a 3 l a 4 l are the reference points of a h i a i u implies the membership value of the element a i j 1 u in the upper trapezoidal membership function a i u h j a i l implies the membership value of the element a i j 1 l in the lower trapezoidal

of pairwise comparison m is the matrix order ci is matrix consistency index and cr is consistency ratio and ri is consistency index the weights of objectives will be determined after the above four steps 2 2 type 2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming t2frccp t2frccp can deal with parameters presented as type 2 fuzzy random variables t2frv where average value and variance of stochastic variables are type 2 fuzzy numbers sets t2fns the formats of t2frccp are shown as follows 8 the pr ax q sh r ω 1 p 9 ax c ω h α δ sh φ 1 p where x is decision variables a is coefficient of x q sh r is type 2 fuzzy random variable t2frv c ω h α δ sh a n d φ 1 p l denote average value variance and inverse function of t2frv separately p is constraints violated probability α is cut levels of fuzzy numbers the nonlinear format of t2fns can be transformed into linear format by following steps and the definition of t2fns represented as ξ r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 θ l θ r trapezoidal fuzzy numbers is introduced before transformations r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 are real values and θ l θ r represents two parameters characterizing the spreads of primary membership grades of t2fns u ξ is secondary membership

simulation model the water production functions are fitted based on spatially distributed aquacrop simulation model the water production functions are used to simulate spatially distributed yield and actual evapotranspiration regarded as intermediate variables of optimization model to involve decision making fig 1 3 cade study 3 1 study area the study area yingke irrigation district yid is located at middle oasis of the heihe river basin northwest china fig 2 it is an important food base of china which is mainly from irrigation because the rainfall 120 mm is far less than the evapotranspiration 1200 mm the surface water resources and groundwater are 1 45 108m3 and 0 9 108 m3 separately and the field water use efficiencies of surface water and groundwater are 0 521 and 0 78 individually irrigation water consumption of the yid occupied about 10 of the middle oasis water demand but water shortage reaches 1 8 107m3 the main crops include seed corn field corn and wheat there are four soil types consisting of first soil t1 second soil t2 third soil t3 and fourth soil t4 different soil types have various field capacities and wilting points spatial variations of soil types and weather conditions make yield present characters of spatial heterogeneities and thus it is essential to conduct precise irrigation to improve irrigation water use efficiency and water productivity 3 2 problem statement weight plays a core role in determining optimal decision variables and objective values in the optimization model however weights obtained from experts scorings possess uncertainties because mangers have various preferences and focus on one objective runoff owns uncertainties owing to multiple variation hydrological meteorological data and their interactions increasing uncertainties and thus uncertain parameters and associated uncertain programming method need to develop to handle uncertainties in the system the actual evapotranspiration eta changes with soil types weather conditions and irrigation in practice but regular calculations of eta regarding that eta is sum of irrigation and rainfall this is not applicable because water transfer in the soil layer is neglected and might result into deviation in measuring water footprint and water use efficiency on basic of traditional eta and thus how eta varies with changes of external environment and how to quantify varied eta require to be resolved that water shortage is one risk resource of yield loss and how water shortage risk transforms into yield loss risk and what are their corresponding relationships need to be addressed to strengthen abilities of dealing with risks 3 3 data collection the data resources of fitting spatially distributed water production functions are irrigation and distributed yield time series where spatial yield is obtained from distributed aquacrop model under given irrigation amount the coefficients of irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions are fitted by irrigation and actual evapotranspiration attained from distributed aquacrop model under given irrigation amount the weights of footprint families and risks were calculated by the it2fahp approach other data are obtained from statistical yearbook references and local survey the comparison matrix interval type 2 ahp are shown in table 2 and linguistic variables of it2fns are shown in table 3 4 optimal results 4 1 fitted functions for yield and actual evapotranspiration 1 water production functions the twelve irrigation yield quadratic water production functions were fitted to calculate yields of the seed corn field corn and wheat under different soil types and various water allocation and the results are shown in fig 3 fig 3 disclosed that the sse of all fitted spatial heterogeneous yields changed from 0 15 to 1 38 and r2 varied from 0 95 to 0 99 and rmse fluctuated from 0 18 to 0 40 this meant that fitting goodness of twelve water production functions was well it could be seen that the yield was not zero and had a very small value as there was no irrigation and it enlarged firstly and lessened secondly with increase of irrigation accordance with actual condition the results indicated that yields under different soil types were different illustrating that fitting water production functions considering effects of spatial heterogeneous soil types on yield could improve accuracy of yield simulation effectively the yields of various crops were different for example the yields of the seed corn changed from 2246 kg hm2 to 9821 kg hm2 when irrigation amounts varied from 0 mm to 800 mm the yield of the field corn varied from 3480 kg hm2 to 11092 kg hm2 as irrigation amounts fluctuated from 0 mm to 800 mm the yield of the wheat changed from 92 kg hm2 to 4100 kg hm2 when irrigation amounts fluctuated from 0 mm to 700 mm besides irrigation thresholds corresponding to maximum yields of one crop under different soil type were different for example the irrigation thresholds of the seed corn were 574 mm 601 mm 555 mm and 541 mm for t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively this was because water demands of one crop under four soil types with various physical characters are different therefore building spatially distributed irrigation yield production functions can effectively distinguish spatially differences of yield and ascertain corresponding irrigation thresholds of crops 2 irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions there were twelve irrigation eta quadratic water production functions shown in fig 4 fig 4 disclosed that eta was not zero even though there was no irrigation which might be supplied by soil water content besides irrigation was not all used for eta because it might result into deep infiltration as there are excessive irrigation and fitting irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions could help figure out their water transfer relationships and grasp variations of actual eta helpful to measure water use efficiencies precisely therefore fitting spatial heterogeneous irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions could explore difference of eta with various soil types with variation of irrigation the results illustrated that eta of the seed corn changed from 204 2 mm to 541 7 mm when irrigation varied from 0 mm to 800 mm there were relatively huge differences between irrigation and eta firstly when irrigation was zero the eta was mainly supplied by rainfall and soil water content and then when irrigation reached its biggest value the eta was larger small than irrigation which illustrates that differences between eta and irrigation generate deep infiltration fig 4 demonstrates that the eta first increases and then decreases with increase of irrigation illustrating that reasonable irrigation could improve water use efficiency and reach water saving the results showed that the eta of the field corn fluctuated from 234 2 mm to 536 2 mm while eta of the wheat varied from 128 4 mm to 323 2 mm moreover the irrigation thresholds of eta of the seed corn were 571 mm 583 mm 591 mm and 577 mm for t1 t2 t3 and t4 individually the differences of irrigation thresholds of one crop also highlighted advantages of the distributed irrigation eta functions the eta presented quadratic curve relationships with irrigation having consistent variations with yield curves illustrating that yield had a positive relationship with eta the results disclosed that fitting eta and yield relationship was better than irrigation and yield relationship however the eta changed with irrigation and presented a nonlinear relationship with irrigation and thus these two kinds of water production functions were all fitted and used together 4 2 optimal water allocation optimal decision variables including water allocation irrigation area and fertilizer allocation could be obtained after 200 iterations based on ga approach shown in fig 5 fig 5 showed that the objectives had slight variation after 200 iterations and conclusion that objectives were convergent could be attained and the 171th individual corresponding to minimum deviation was selected as optimal solution fig 6 illustrated that water allocations of the seed corn under four soil types varied from 336 mm to 619 mm under three levels striding across a large degree of water ranges this was because of different available water resources under different flow levels and different water demands of crops under four soil types for high flow level water allocations of crops under four soil types changed from 442 mm to 619 mm covering a relatively large range compared with single irrigation value it could allocate water resources to different soil types and reach refined water resources management improve water use efficiencies effectively water allocations of the field corn under four soil type fluctuated from 314 mm to 530 mm slightly lower than water allocation of the seed corn presenting large degree of changes this regulation was also suitable for water allocation of wheat these results also highlighted advantages of spatially distributed water allocation schemes the results disclosed that water allocations of some dmus exceeded effective irrigation calculated by eta subtracting rainfall and ineffective water consumption appeared as expression of deep infiltration and water allocations of some dmus did not reach effective irrigation and water deficit emerged which was supplied by soil water resources the resulted demonstrated that using varied eta could understand compositions of eta and figure out blue water use condition more clearly for managers they could know what value of actual evapotranspiration was under given irrigation and recognize blue water use efficiency in a more precise way moreover they could allocate water resources to different crops under each flow level and soil type 4 3 optimal irrigation areas the irrigation areas differences across different dmus were big while differences among three flow levels were relatively small for seed corn across four soil types irrigation areas differences were relatively high these highlighted advantages of allocating land resources to different multiple kinds of soil types compared with traditional method regrading spatially heterogeneous soils as one soil type separations of soil types could effectively improve water use efficiency under limited available water resources fig 7 4 4 optimal fertilizer allocation the fertilizer intervals were 465 600 kg hm2 and fertilizer allocations of crops mainly concentrated on minimum fertilizer allocation this was because many fertilizer allocations increased grey footprint energy consumption and ghg emission even though it could improve crop yields the fertilizer allocation across three flow level had no obvious regulations but fertilizer allocation differences for one crop amid four soil types were high reaching about 15 kg hm2 besides fertilizer allocations of the seed corn with t2 and t3 and the field corn with t4 and wheat with t1 were relatively high the above regulations also emphasized advantages of spatially distributed fertilizer allocations fig 8 4 5 optimal footprint families and risks the results of ecological footprint ef3d water footprint cf energy footprint enf risks and total yield are shown in table 4 table 4 disclosed that ecological footprint under three hydrological years were all smaller than ecological capacity presenting status of ecological surplus this demonstrated that usages of water resources land resources and energy were below the maximum allowable ecological capacity the results showed that the ecological footprint fluctuated from 1 865 to 1 868 under three flow levels the ecological footprint under high flow level was biggest followed by middle and low flow levels this is because water land and energy consumption had deepest influences on ecology under high level because of its highest resources consumptions the water footprint was classified into blue water footprint green footprint and grey footprint reflecting multiple types of water resources usage and water waste generation conditions the water footprint changed from 0 769 m3 kg to 0 773 m3 kg as water flow changed across its three levels the water footprint under high level was biggest and this under low level was smallest in addition the carbon footprint reflected greenhouse generation paths and amounts in the process of agricultural productions it varied from 1 182 kgce kg to 1 214 kgce kg and increased with decrease of flow levels additionally the energy footprint exposed energy consumption per unit of yield covering labor machinery pesticides seed fertilizer and agricultural film it changed from 174 339 mj kg to 177 767 mj kg the results revealed that water shortage risk and yield loss risk varied from 0 155 to 0 190 within acceptable ranges the yield fluctuated from 93 65 104 kg to 95 72 104 kg under three flow levels and presenting relatively high yield differences across three flow levels this was mainly caused by water and land resources consumptions and high water and land consumptions resulted into big yields the resulted disclosed that yield variation tendencies were consistent with variations of ecological footprint and water footprint while inconsistent with changes of carbon footprint energy footprint and risks as changes of flow levels this was caused by different water energy and fertilizer consumptions and various yields under three flow levels highest water energy and fertilizer consumptions corresponded to biggest crop yield however the footprint families presented different variations with changes of yields after comprehensive resource consumptions per unit of yields as for aspect of footprints to clarify each component of footprints under each flow level the ef size ef depth blue water footprint green water footprint grey water footprint co2 carbon footprint ch4 carbon footprint n2o carbon footprint fertilizer pesticide plastic machinery labor energy footprint water shortage risk and yield loss risk were calculated shown in fig 9 fig 9 a illustrated that ecological depths valued 1 0 under three flow levels not exceeding ecological capacities besides the ecological sizes took 1 85 1 81 and 1 80 under three levels presenting decreasing tendencies this was because ecological footprint of cropland freshwater land and energy land lessened with decrease of flow levels the results showed that the land consumptions under three flow levels were 92 74 hm2 91 18 hm2 and 91 14 hm2 under three levels respectively besides the ecological footprint of crop land under three levels were 0 8246 0 8014 and 0 7938 and ecological footprints of energy land were 0 5024 0 4940 and 0 4938 and ecological footprints of freshwater land were 0 5024 0 4940 and 0 4938 as flow level changed from high level to medium level and from medium level to low level this was because that water allocations were 4 54 107m3 3 81 107m3 and 3 59 107m3 the results illustrated that the green water footprints were 0 1606 0 1615 and 0 1626 under three flow levels which is caused by comprehensive effects of rainfall and yields moreover the yields and irrigation amounts lessened with decrease of flow levels for example actual evapotranspiration were 4 7381 4 5202 4 4706 and the rainfall was 1 0284 104m3 the differences between actual evapotranspiration and rainfall were 3 7097 104m3 3 4918 104m3 and 3 442 104m3 separately compared with irrigation amounts there were ineffective irrigation amounts under three levels that valued 0 8303 0 3182 0 148 individually illustrating that effective irrigation water allocations and yields under high level were biggest moreover blue water footprints were 0 4902 0 4861 and 0 4858 respectively with regard to grey water footprint the fertilizer usages under three levels were 4 5024 104kg 4 3145 and 4 5029 individually in addition grey water footprint under medium level was smallest followed by high level and low levels the reasons are that the grey water footprint was positive with fertilizer amounts and negative with yield for energy footprint the footprint of seeds was biggest followed by agricultural film labor pesticides machinery and fertilizer that occupied about proportions of 31 25 19 15 10 of total energy consumptions and thus fertilizer energy footprint could be neglected the energy footprint enlarged with decrease of flow levels and took 174 34 mj kg 176 87 mj kg and 177 77 mj kg for three levels respectively this was because irrigation areas and yield played dominate role in determining final energy footprint the comprehensive effects of irrigation area and yield resulted into the above results it disclosed that high irrigation area water consumption and yield had lower energy consumption presenting mismatching condition this was because energy usage efficiency under high level was higher than middle and low levels under environment of better natural rainfall condition of high flow level the carbon footprints composed of co2 ch4 and n2o which was related to agricultural productions way and fertilizer usages the agricultural production was main resources of co2 emission and fertilizer usage was main causes of ch4 and n2o the co2 occupied about 74 of total greenhouse emission and ch4 and n2o occupied about 26 of total ghg emission the ghg emission increased with decrease of flow levels which mainly caused by fertilizer usages as for risks water shortage risk and yield loss risk occupied about 96 and 4 of total risk the risks increased with decease of flow levels which was because ratios between actual evapotranspiration and maximum evapotranspiration decreased when flow level changes through its three levels it also discovered that water shortage risk and yield loss risk presented mismatching regulations for managers the fertilizer usage could improve crop yield but cause ghg emission and grey water emission key point to tradeoff across yield ghg emission and grey water footprint was to figure out how to allocate fertilizer resources among crops land resources and water resources usage could enlarge yield but they belong to nonrenewable resources and contradictions and competitions among water and land resource across multiple water users inevitably occur the obtained optimal decisions can provide optimal water land and fertilizer allocation schemes and crop yield for managers moreover the optimal schemes could improve water use efficiency and protect ecological benefit and promise crop yield simultaneously 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with model without consideration of irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions this comparison was made because eta as an important element in determining blue water footprint regarded as sum of irrigation and rainfall and fixed eta was unable to reflect dynamic variations of eta with changes of irrigation to address the above problem relationships between irrigation and eta were fitted by fitted irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions and effects of soil types on eta were handled by fitting spatial heterogeneous irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions the differences of these two methods were that the maximum eta was fixed while the eta changes with irrigation in the second case taking the seed corn as an example the maximum eta was assumed to be a fixed value as 518 7 mm and 100 groups of irrigation amounts within minimum and maximum irrigation amounts were input into the fitted functions to calculate blue water footprint the blue water footprints calculated by these two methods were shown in fig 10 it could be seen that nonlinear eta enlarged with variations of irrigations and changed from 413 mm to 514 mm and reached maximum eta when irrigation took around 500 mm linear eta varied from 318 mm to 701 mm and always increased with irrigation however the eta had upper limit value and not always increased in reality and thus nonlinear eta was a more reasonable measurement tool fig 11 illustrated that blue water footprints calculated by linear eta were higher than these attained by nonlinear eta the bwf with nonlinear eta changed from 0 45 m3 kg to 0 62 m3 kg and water use efficiencies fluctuated from 1 60 kg m3 to 2 21 kg m3 the bwf with linear eta varied from 0 30 m3 kg to 0 63 m3 kg and water use efficiencies changed from 1 58 m3 kg to 3 29 m3 kg the bwf with nonlinear eta had higher precise change ranges compared with bwf with linear eta illustrating that blue water consumption with nonlinear eta was smaller than linear eta moreover the water use efficiency with these two eta illustrated that water use efficiency calculated by linear eta was higher than nonlinear eta exaggerating water use efficiency of blue water the variation of nonlinear eta could reflect actual bwf and water use efficiency more effectively an applicable indicator than linear one these highlighted advantages of spatially distributed irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions 5 2 comparison with model single risks this comparison was made because water demand risk and yield loss risk were different this meant that maximum water demand corresponding to biggest the crop yield but respective irrigation thresholds were different and this resulted into various water shortage risk and yield loss risk under the same irrigation amount and thus 100 individuals were used to calculate and compare differences of optimal solution under scenarios of considering two kinds of risks and single water shortage risk and the result was shown in fig 12 the results disclosed that water shortage risk and yield loss risk distributed in evenly on 45 degree line showing a synchronous and same degree of change the blue triangles meant relationships of actual water shortage risk and yield loss risk it could be seen that the water shortage risks were higher than yield loss risks for 100 individuals this was because water thresholds corresponding to maximum eta and maximum yield were different and the same water allocation resulted in different water shortage risk and yield loss risk the dimensions and orders of magnitude of eta and yield affected risks symmetry degree and relationships of these two risks therefore dimensionless of water shortage risk and yield loss risk were compared and the result is shown in fig 13 fig 13 disclosed that the points distributed evenly on 45 degree line illustrating the yield and water shortage presented same degree of variations water thresholds of yields of four dmus were lower than water thresholds of maximum evapotranspiration for twelve dmus water thresholds of other eight dmus possessed opposite tendencies if the water allocation valued 200 mm differences between water thresholds of maximum et and yields were almost same with differences between water thresholds of maximum eta and yield removing effects of dimensions the eta and yield of the seed corn with t1 under 200 mm were 0 6 and 0 4 and corresponding risks were 0 4 and 0 6 therefore mismatching phenomena of eta and yield existed which was caused by various irrigation thresholds this also indicated that fitting relationship between yield and eta was more applicable than relationship between yield and irrigation and thus some researches using irrigation amount to replace eta was not reasonable if relationship between irrigation and crop yield was used the relationship between irrigation and eta must matched fitly one obvious advantage of fitting simultaneously these two kinds of spatially distributed water production functions was that responses of eta on variation of irrigation were concerned and reflected these underlined advantages of proposed approaches 5 3 coordinated degree of footprint families the coordinated degree was cd used to measure relationships across footprint families its calculation steps are shown as cd c t c f x g x f x g x 2 2 k t f x g x 2 where c t denote coupling degree and coordination index respectively f x g x are each subsystem individually if cd is between 0 5 and 0 8 the cd belongs to high coordination and if it is between 0 8 and 1 the cd is extremely highest coordinated the ecological footprint was concerned and mutually concerned with energy footprint water footprint and yield footprint and thus their mutual cd donated as ef enf ef wf ef y was calculated to figure out coordinated degree of resources consumption and ecology the results are shown in table 5 the results illustrated that ecological footprint and energy footprint was in a high coordinated demonstrating that energy consumption and energy occupied land ecological footprint was in the reasonable coordination the above regulations also suitable for fresh water land ecological footprint and cropland ecological footprint the energy footprint generated carbon emission and energy was as a resource of yield and thus the coordinated degrees of enf y enf cf were computed which were in reasonable coordinated ranges this illustrated that fitness and adaptability across energy and carbon and yield were high coordinated and water footprint and yield water footprint and risks wf y wf r were all in acceptable coordination the above results highlighted advantages of optimal decision strategies 6 conclusion the footprint families based multi objective type 2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming ffmot2frccp was established to optimize spatially distributed water land and fertilizer resources in this paper it incorporated footprint families covering ecological footprint water footprint carbon footprint and energy footprint risks it2fahp t2frccp approaches with the spatially distributed water production functions the spatially distributed crop water production functions and irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions improve simulation accuracy of spatially heterogeneous crop yield besides they reflect variations of actual evapotranspiration with changes of irrigation and strengthen fitting goodness of simulation models together considerations of water shortage risk and yield loss risk from aspect of their conducting process enhance capacities of handling integrated risks synergy of distributed footprint families covering ecological footprint water footprint carbon footprint and energy footprint based on the life cycle approach can reflect mutual interactions and coordinated degree of agriculture and ecology subsystem and reach spatially precise resources managements moreover the developed model can deal with compound uncertain parameters expressed as type 2 fuzzy random variables and strength robustness of ahp by introducing interval type 2 ahp approach in addition the model was applied to a case study to verify its application the developed model was proved to be an effective tool to allocate multiple resources to multiple crops with consideration of spatially distributed crop yield at arid and semi arid district however it is unable to deal with other risk resources e g energy

as follows fig a3 the triangular fuzzy numbers are transformation version of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers when c2 c3 the trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers it can be seen that the trapezoidal fuzzy numbers cover more information than triangular fuzzy numbers because it has more character parameters besides the membership degree equals to 1 when variables range from c1 to c2 which is more accordance with reality because the it is hard to determine one certain maximum value following subjunctives of all mangers 1 a spatially distributed crop simulation model

2955,the nonlinear relationships across spatially distributed irrigation actual evapotranspiration and crop yield and interactions between agriculture and ecology aggravate difficulties in water land and fertilizer resources optimization to address the above problems this paper developed a framework of footprint families based multi objective type 2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming ffmot2frccp it integrated the multi objective programming mop footprint families interval type 2 ahp it2ahp type 2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming t2frccp with spatially distributed water production functions spatially distributed irrigation yield functions and irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions were fitted simultaneously to simulate spatial heterogeneous yield considering nonlinear relationships across irrigation actual evapotranspiration and yield it overcomes disadvantages of traditional functions in neglecting spatially distributed water transfers between irrigation and evapotranspiration interactive relationships between agricultural and ecological effects were measured by footprint families containing water carbon ecological and energy footprint concurrently based on the life cycle approach besides both water shortage risk and yield loss risk were quantified and controlled with consideration of their conduction machines moreover weights across footprint families and risks were determined by the it2ahp approach by taking compound uncertainties of subjectivities of mangers into account in addition uncertainties of the runoff were handled by t2frccp approach the model was applied to yingke irrigation district to verify its application resulted showed that 1 ecological footprint decreased energy footprint carbon footprint and risks enlarged when flow levels changed though its high medium and low levels 2 yield loss risk varied from 0 to 0 27 while water shortage risk changed from 0 13 to 0 32 and crop yield losses occurred after water shortage risk took place 3 the actual evapotranspiration presented mismatching variations with yield because of their various irrigation thresholds the results could offer insight in how to measure and handle nonlinear relationships amid distributed actual evapotranspiration and yield under various water allocation schemes besides the results could provide optimal decisions giving consideration of agricultural and ecological balances for managers keywords spatially distributed water production functions footprint families interval type 2 ahp type 2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming uncertainties data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water land resources are basic and necessary elements for supporting food productions and sustainable economic social developments liu et al 2019 he et al 2019 however agricultural production ways such as labor machinery electric power and resources consumptions like water land fertilizer and energy resources inevitably generate ecological destructions such as non point pollution greenhouse emission kim et al 2021 osei owusu et al 2021 this means that resource consumptions can promise food security as well as result into ecological damages shah et al 2019 therefore it is essential to achieve a tradeoff between agricultural food and agricultural ecology by making reasonable water land and fertilizer allocation strategies to address the above multiple contradictory objectives the multi objective mathematical programming mop and fractional programming fp have been developed in recent years ahmad et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 compared with fp approach mop could reflect important degrees of objectives by giving respective weights weights of multiple objectives in the mop approach have been determined by objective and subjective weight approaches zhang et al 2020 chen 2020 objective weight focuses on objectivity and fairness while subjective approach emphasizes on subjectivities of managers on basic of their experiences and knowledge decision makers faced with resource strategies unavoidably play subjectivities under complexed variations of environments which leads to that subjective weight method has high opportunities to be applied in determining weights and frequently applied method is analytic hierarchy process ahp and it has been gradually and rapidly developed into uncertain ahp because of different knowledge backgrounds and cognitive levels of experts gundogdu and kahraman 2020 khashei siuki et al 2020 the broaden uncertain ahp methods contain interval ahp fuzzy ahp type 2 fuzzy ahp interval type 2 ahp it2ahp the complexities of above methods become larger while precisions become higher from left to right fox example the interval ahp transforms deterministic values into interval numbers while it2ahp converts deterministic values into interval type 2 fuzzy numbers developed from interval numbers therefore the it2ahp will be established to determine weights of multiple objectives in this paper the resources consumption in the process of yield production has been widely evaluated by life cycle method through transforming consumption into energy or carbon generation per unit of yield cakar et al 2020 ghani et al 2019 for example the energy footprint of diesel oil is 46 625 mj kg there are many kinds of footprints such as 3d footprint water footprint energy footprint carbon footprint which are called as footprint families li et al 2019 aguilera et al 2019 dai et al 2021 ecological footprint reflects land use efficiency covering land types of farmlands woodland grassland etc water footprint deems water resources as transporters to evaluate water use output for yield production besides energy footprint views energy as supports to assess energy use efficiency and carbon footprint reviews carbon generation as carriers to calculate carbon emission per unit of yield arbitrary two or three homogeneous footprints across footprint families have been applied to measure resource consumption efficiencies however spatially distributed footprint families caused by spatially heterogeneous soil types weather conditions were rarely quantified because of its complexities the spatially distributed yield as one import component of footprint families has been measured in many ways such as the distributed aquacrop model the distributed swap model etc han et al 2019 wang and guo 2021 unfortunately the crop simulation model is complex and not easy to use when there are multidimensional input data compared with crop simulation model water production function is easier to simulate yield such as quadratic function jessen model cousquer et al 2019 qi et al 2018 however previous water production functions are usually used to simulate homogeneous yield and incapable of quantify spatially distributed crop yield nevertheless these functions provide an insight into building spatially distributed water production functions therefore the distributed water production functions will be established in this paper actual evapotranspiration yield functions were usually adopted to calculate yield under a series of actual evapotranspiration tarkalson et al 2018 actual evapotranspiration replaced by sum of irrigation and rainfall was applied to fit functions in drought district assuming that irrigation was all used for actual evapotranspiration sharma and irmak 2021 irmak et al 2020 however the above assumption may not hold when there are excessive irrigations or soil water content supplies actual evapotranspiration the reason why the hypothesis is not invalid is that many boundary constraints in the functions such as water exchanges were neglected and questions that what conditions did the irrigation actual evaporation functions hold occur however the above problems are rarely clarified and addressed in recent years therefore fitting irrigation yield functions as well as irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions with consideration of spatially distributed soil water transformation is a potential way to simulate distributed yield precisely and identify establishment conditions of associated water production functions the system owns uncertainties under impacts of complexities and variations of hydro meteorological factors affecting robustness of decisions definitely to solve this problem uncertain programming methods have gradually developed and applied in water resources management such as interval programming fuzzy programming and stochastic programming xie et al 2018 kundzewicz et al 2018 the single uncertain programming has been rapidly developed into compound uncertain programming to handle more complexed uncertainties of parameters for example the runoff owns uncertainties of randomness and fuzziness this is because characteristic parameters of random runoff own fuzzy characters and are expressed as fuzzy numbers composed of minimum possible possible and maximum possible values determined by statistical approaches the compound uncertain programming approaches have rapidly applied in water resources management including fuzzy random chance constrained programming frccp type 2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming t2frccp etc the t2frccp was derived from the frccp by transforming fuzzy numbers into type 2 fuzzy numbers because fuzzy numbers existed uncertainties wang et al 2020 pourmand et al 2020 therefore the t2frccp approach will be developed in this paper the risks inevitably exist under environment of uncertainties in the system the usually seen risk types are water shortage risk and yield loss risk with inseparable conduction relationships qian et al 2020 uddameri et al 2020 the above two kinds of risks have been widely and separately researched in previous studies but unfortunately their conducting relationships were rarely explored therefore conducting relationships between water shortage risk and yield risk will be quantified and discovered in this paper this paper attempts to develop the footprint families based multi objective type 2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming ffmot2frccp for optimizing spatially distributed water land and fertilizer resources the first section shows formulation process of footprint families water production functions it2ahp t2frccp and ffmot2frccp secondly the specific optimization model and study areas will be introduced finally the optimization results will be analyzed and robustness of developed model will be discussed in detail the results can offer optimal decisions for managers about how to allocate irrigation amount fertilizer and land resources across multiple m crops to reach sustainable agricultural ecological development 2 methodology 2 1 interval type 2 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process it2fahp the it2fahp has advantages in reflecting the uncertainties of subjectivities of decision makers compared with the traditional ahp method the it2fahp method transforms deterministic judge value into interval type 2 fuzzy numbers it2fs on basic of ahp the it2fs is defined as follows 1 a a u a l a 1 l a 2 l a 3 l a

a i u implies the membership value of the element a i j 1 u in the upper trapezoidal membership function a i u h j a i l implies the membership value of the element a i j 1 l in the lower trapezoidal

steps 2 2 type 2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming t2frccp t2frccp can deal with parameters presented as type 2 fuzzy random variables t2frv where average value and variance of stochastic

simulation model the water production functions are fitted based on spatially distributed aquacrop simulation model the water production functions are used to simulate spatially distributed yield and actual evapotranspiration regarded as intermediate variables of optimization model to involve decision making fig 1 3 cade study 3 1 study area the study area yingke irrigation district yid is located at middle oasis of the heihe river basin northwest china fig 2 it is an important food base of china which is mainly from irrigation because the rainfall 120 mm is far less than the evapotranspiration 1200 mm the surface water resources and groundwater are 1 45 108m3 and 0 9 108 m3 separately and the field water use efficiencies of surface water and groundwater are 0 521 and 0 78 individually irrigation water consumption of the yid occupied about 10 of the middle oasis water demand but water shortage reaches 1 8 107m3 the main crops include seed corn field corn and wheat there are four soil types consisting of first soil t1 second soil t2 third soil t3 and fourth soil t4 different soil types have various field capacities and wilting points spatial variations of soil types and weather conditions make yield present characters of spatial heterogeneities and thus it is essential to conduct precise irrigation to improve irrigation water use efficiency and water productivity 3 2 problem statement weight plays a core role in determining optimal decision variables and objective values in the optimization model however weights obtained from experts scorings possess uncertainties because mangers have various preferences and focus on one objective runoff owns uncertainties owing to multiple variation hydrological meteorological data and their interactions increasing uncertainties and thus uncertain parameters and associated uncertain programming method need to develop to handle uncertainties in the system the actual evapotranspiration eta changes with soil types weather conditions and irrigation in practice but regular calculations of eta regarding that eta is sum of irrigation and rainfall this is not applicable because water transfer in the soil layer is neglected and might result into deviation in measuring water footprint and water use efficiency on basic of traditional eta and thus how eta varies with changes of external environment and how to quantify varied eta require to be resolved that water shortage is one risk resource of yield loss and how water shortage risk transforms into yield loss risk and what are their corresponding relationships need to be addressed to strengthen abilities of dealing with risks 3 3 data collection the data resources of fitting spatially distributed water production functions are irrigation and distributed yield time series where spatial yield is obtained from distributed aquacrop model under given irrigation amount the coefficients of irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions are fitted by irrigation and actual evapotranspiration attained from distributed aquacrop model under given irrigation amount the weights of footprint families and risks were calculated by the it2fahp approach other data are obtained from statistical yearbook references and local survey the comparison matrix interval type 2 ahp are shown in table 2 and linguistic variables of it2fns are shown in table 3 4 optimal results 4 1 fitted functions for yield and actual evapotranspiration 1 water production functions the twelve irrigation yield quadratic water production functions were fitted to calculate yields of the seed corn field corn and wheat under different soil types and various water allocation and the results are shown in fig 3 fig 3 disclosed that the sse of all fitted spatial heterogeneous yields changed from 0 15 to 1 38 and r2 varied from 0 95 to 0 99 and rmse fluctuated from 0 18 to 0 40 this meant that fitting goodness of twelve water production functions was well it could be seen that the yield was not zero and had a very small value as there was no irrigation and it enlarged firstly and lessened secondly with increase of irrigation accordance with actual condition the results indicated that yields under different soil types were different illustrating that fitting water production functions considering effects of spatial heterogeneous soil types on yield could improve accuracy of yield simulation effectively the yields of various crops were different for example the yields of the seed corn changed from 2246 kg hm2 to 9821 kg hm2 when irrigation amounts varied from 0 mm to 800 mm the yield of the field corn varied from 3480 kg hm2 to 11092 kg hm2 as irrigation amounts fluctuated from 0 mm to 800 mm the yield of the wheat changed from 92 kg hm2 to 4100 kg hm2 when irrigation amounts fluctuated from 0 mm to 700 mm besides irrigation thresholds corresponding to maximum yields of one crop under different soil type were different for example the irrigation thresholds of the seed corn were 574 mm 601 mm 555 mm and 541 mm for t1 t2 t3 and t4 respectively this was because water demands of one crop under four soil types with various physical characters are different therefore building spatially distributed irrigation yield production functions can effectively distinguish spatially differences of yield and ascertain corresponding irrigation thresholds of crops 2 irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions there were twelve irrigation eta quadratic water production functions shown in fig 4 fig 4 disclosed that eta was not zero even though there was no irrigation which might be supplied by soil water content besides irrigation was not all used for eta because it might result into deep infiltration as there are excessive irrigation and fitting irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions could help figure out their water transfer relationships and grasp variations of actual eta helpful to measure water use efficiencies precisely therefore fitting spatial heterogeneous irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions could explore difference of eta with various soil types with variation of irrigation the results illustrated that eta of the seed corn changed from 204 2 mm to 541 7 mm when irrigation varied from 0 mm to 800 mm there were relatively huge differences between irrigation and eta firstly when irrigation was zero the eta was mainly supplied by rainfall and soil water content and then when irrigation reached its biggest value the eta was larger small than irrigation which illustrates that differences between eta and irrigation generate deep infiltration fig 4 demonstrates that the eta first increases and then decreases with increase of irrigation illustrating that reasonable irrigation could improve water use efficiency and reach water saving the results showed that the eta of the field corn fluctuated from 234 2 mm to 536 2 mm while eta of the wheat varied from 128 4 mm to 323 2 mm moreover the irrigation thresholds of eta of the seed corn were 571 mm 583 mm 591 mm and 577 mm for t1 t2 t3 and t4 individually the differences of irrigation thresholds of one crop also highlighted advantages of the distributed irrigation eta functions the eta presented quadratic curve relationships with irrigation having consistent variations with yield curves illustrating that yield had a positive relationship with eta the results disclosed that fitting eta and yield relationship was better than irrigation and yield relationship however the eta changed with irrigation and presented a nonlinear relationship with irrigation and thus these two kinds of water production functions were all fitted and used together 4 2 optimal water allocation optimal decision variables including water allocation irrigation area and fertilizer allocation could be obtained after 200 iterations based on ga approach shown in fig 5 fig 5 showed that the objectives had slight variation after 200 iterations and conclusion that objectives were convergent could be attained and the 171th individual corresponding to minimum deviation was selected as optimal solution fig 6 illustrated that water allocations of the seed corn under four soil types varied from 336 mm to 619 mm under three levels striding across a large degree of water ranges this was because of different available water resources under different flow levels and different water demands of crops under four soil types for high flow level water allocations of crops under four soil types changed from 442 mm to 619 mm covering a relatively large range compared with single irrigation value it could allocate water resources to different soil types and reach refined water resources management improve water use efficiencies effectively water allocations of the field corn under four soil type fluctuated from 314 mm to 530 mm slightly lower than water allocation of the seed corn presenting large degree of changes this regulation was also suitable for water allocation of wheat these results also highlighted advantages of spatially distributed water allocation schemes the results disclosed that water allocations of some dmus exceeded effective irrigation calculated by eta subtracting rainfall and ineffective water consumption appeared as expression of deep infiltration and water allocations of some dmus did not reach effective irrigation and water deficit emerged which was supplied by soil water resources the resulted demonstrated that using varied eta could understand compositions of eta and figure out blue water use condition more clearly for managers they could know what value of actual evapotranspiration was under given irrigation and recognize blue water use efficiency in a more precise way moreover they could allocate water resources to different crops under each flow level and soil type 4 3 optimal irrigation areas the irrigation areas differences across different dmus were big while differences among three flow levels were relatively small for seed corn across four soil types irrigation areas differences were relatively high these highlighted advantages of allocating land resources to different multiple kinds of soil types compared with traditional method regrading spatially heterogeneous soils as one soil type separations of soil types could effectively improve water use efficiency under limited available water resources fig 7 4 4 optimal fertilizer allocation the fertilizer intervals were 465 600 kg hm2 and fertilizer allocations of crops mainly concentrated on minimum fertilizer allocation this was because many fertilizer allocations increased grey footprint energy consumption and ghg emission even though it could improve crop yields the fertilizer allocation across three flow level had no obvious regulations but fertilizer allocation differences for one crop amid four soil types were high reaching about 15 kg hm2 besides fertilizer allocations of the seed corn with t2 and t3 and the field corn with t4 and wheat with t1 were relatively high the above regulations also emphasized advantages of spatially distributed fertilizer allocations fig 8 4 5 optimal footprint families and risks the results of ecological footprint ef3d water footprint cf energy footprint enf risks and total yield are shown in table 4 table 4 disclosed that ecological footprint under three hydrological years were all smaller than ecological capacity presenting status of ecological surplus this demonstrated that usages of water resources land resources and energy were below the maximum allowable ecological capacity the results showed that the ecological footprint fluctuated from 1 865 to 1 868 under three flow levels the ecological footprint under high flow level was biggest followed by middle and low flow levels this is because water land and energy consumption had deepest influences on ecology under high level because of its highest resources consumptions the water footprint was classified into blue water footprint green footprint and grey footprint reflecting multiple types of water resources usage and water waste generation conditions the water footprint changed from 0 769 m3 kg to 0 773 m3 kg as water flow changed across its three levels the water footprint under high level was biggest and this under low level was smallest in addition the carbon footprint reflected greenhouse generation paths and amounts in the process of agricultural productions it varied from 1 182 kgce kg to 1 214 kgce kg and increased with decrease of flow levels additionally the energy footprint exposed energy consumption per unit of yield covering labor machinery pesticides seed fertilizer and agricultural film it changed from 174 339 mj kg to 177 767 mj kg the results revealed that water shortage risk and yield loss risk varied from 0 155 to 0 190 within acceptable ranges the yield fluctuated from 93 65 104 kg to 95 72 104 kg under three flow levels and presenting relatively high yield differences across three flow levels this was mainly caused by water and land resources consumptions and high water and land consumptions resulted into big yields the resulted disclosed that yield variation tendencies were consistent with variations of ecological footprint and water footprint while inconsistent with changes of carbon footprint energy footprint and risks as changes of flow levels this was caused by different water energy and fertilizer consumptions and various yields under three flow levels highest water energy and fertilizer consumptions corresponded to biggest crop yield however the footprint families presented different variations with changes of yields after comprehensive resource consumptions per unit of yields as for aspect of footprints to clarify each component of footprints under each flow level the ef size ef depth blue water footprint green water footprint grey water footprint co2 carbon footprint ch4 carbon footprint n2o carbon footprint fertilizer pesticide plastic machinery labor energy footprint water shortage risk and yield loss risk were calculated shown in fig 9 fig 9 a illustrated that ecological depths valued 1 0 under three flow levels not exceeding ecological capacities besides the ecological sizes took 1 85 1 81 and 1 80 under three levels presenting decreasing tendencies this was because ecological footprint of cropland freshwater land and energy land lessened with decrease of flow levels the results showed that the land consumptions under three flow levels were 92 74 hm2 91 18 hm2 and 91 14 hm2 under three levels respectively besides the ecological footprint of crop land under three levels were 0 8246 0 8014 and 0 7938 and ecological footprints of energy land were 0 5024 0 4940 and 0 4938 and ecological footprints of freshwater land were 0 5024 0 4940 and 0 4938 as flow level changed from high level to medium level and from medium level to low level this was because that water allocations were 4 54 107m3 3 81 107m3 and 3 59 107m3 the results illustrated that the green water footprints were 0 1606 0 1615 and 0 1626 under three flow levels which is caused by comprehensive effects of rainfall and yields moreover the yields and irrigation amounts lessened with decrease of flow levels for example actual evapotranspiration were 4 7381 4 5202 4 4706 and the rainfall was 1 0284 104m3 the differences between actual evapotranspiration and rainfall were 3 7097 104m3 3 4918 104m3 and 3 442 104m3 separately compared with irrigation amounts there were ineffective irrigation amounts under three levels that valued 0 8303 0 3182 0 148 individually illustrating that effective irrigation water allocations and yields under high level were biggest moreover blue water footprints were 0 4902 0 4861 and 0 4858 respectively with regard to grey water footprint the fertilizer usages under three levels were 4 5024 104kg 4 3145 and 4 5029 individually in addition grey water footprint under medium level was smallest followed by high level and low levels the reasons are that the grey water footprint was positive with fertilizer amounts and negative with yield for energy footprint the footprint of seeds was biggest followed by agricultural film labor pesticides machinery and fertilizer that occupied about proportions of 31 25 19 15 10 of total energy consumptions and thus fertilizer energy footprint could be neglected the energy footprint enlarged with decrease of flow levels and took 174 34 mj kg 176 87 mj kg and 177 77 mj kg for three levels respectively this was because irrigation areas and yield played dominate role in determining final energy footprint the comprehensive effects of irrigation area and yield resulted into the above results it disclosed that high irrigation area water consumption and yield had lower energy consumption presenting mismatching condition this was because energy usage efficiency under high level was higher than middle and low levels under environment of better natural rainfall condition of high flow level the carbon footprints composed of co2 ch4 and n2o which was related to agricultural productions way and fertilizer usages the agricultural production was main resources of co2 emission and fertilizer usage was main causes of ch4 and n2o the co2 occupied about 74 of total greenhouse emission and ch4 and n2o occupied about 26 of total ghg emission the ghg emission increased with decrease of flow levels which mainly caused by fertilizer usages as for risks water shortage risk and yield loss risk occupied about 96 and 4 of total risk the risks increased with decease of flow levels which was because ratios between actual evapotranspiration and maximum evapotranspiration decreased when flow level changes through its three levels it also discovered that water shortage risk and yield loss risk presented mismatching regulations for managers the fertilizer usage could improve crop yield but cause ghg emission and grey water emission key point to tradeoff across yield ghg emission and grey water footprint was to figure out how to allocate fertilizer resources among crops land resources and water resources usage could enlarge yield but they belong to nonrenewable resources and contradictions and competitions among water and land resource across multiple water users inevitably occur the obtained optimal decisions can provide optimal water land and fertilizer allocation schemes and crop yield for managers moreover the optimal schemes could improve water use efficiency and protect ecological benefit and promise crop yield simultaneously 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with model without consideration of irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions this comparison was made because eta as an important element in determining blue water footprint regarded as sum of irrigation and rainfall and fixed eta was unable to reflect dynamic variations of eta with changes of irrigation to address the above problem relationships between irrigation and eta were fitted by fitted irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions and effects of soil types on eta were handled by fitting spatial heterogeneous irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions the differences of these two methods were that the maximum eta was fixed while the eta changes with irrigation in the second case taking the seed corn as an example the maximum eta was assumed to be a fixed value as 518 7 mm and 100 groups of irrigation amounts within minimum and maximum irrigation amounts were input into the fitted functions to calculate blue water footprint the blue water footprints calculated by these two methods were shown in fig 10 it could be seen that nonlinear eta enlarged with variations of irrigations and changed from 413 mm to 514 mm and reached maximum eta when irrigation took around 500 mm linear eta varied from 318 mm to 701 mm and always increased with irrigation however the eta had upper limit value and not always increased in reality and thus nonlinear eta was a more reasonable measurement tool fig 11 illustrated that blue water footprints calculated by linear eta were higher than these attained by nonlinear eta the bwf with nonlinear eta changed from 0 45 m3 kg to 0 62 m3 kg and water use efficiencies fluctuated from 1 60 kg m3 to 2 21 kg m3 the bwf with linear eta varied from 0 30 m3 kg to 0 63 m3 kg and water use efficiencies changed from 1 58 m3 kg to 3 29 m3 kg the bwf with nonlinear eta had higher precise change ranges compared with bwf with linear eta illustrating that blue water consumption with nonlinear eta was smaller than linear eta moreover the water use efficiency with these two eta illustrated that water use efficiency calculated by linear eta was higher than nonlinear eta exaggerating water use efficiency of blue water the variation of nonlinear eta could reflect actual bwf and water use efficiency more effectively an applicable indicator than linear one these highlighted advantages of spatially distributed irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions 5 2 comparison with model single risks this comparison was made because water demand risk and yield loss risk were different this meant that maximum water demand corresponding to biggest the crop yield but respective irrigation thresholds were different and this resulted into various water shortage risk and yield loss risk under the same irrigation amount and thus 100 individuals were used to calculate and compare differences of optimal solution under scenarios of considering two kinds of risks and single water shortage risk and the result was shown in fig 12 the results disclosed that water shortage risk and yield loss risk distributed in evenly on 45 degree line showing a synchronous and same degree of change the blue triangles meant relationships of actual water shortage risk and yield loss risk it could be seen that the water shortage risks were higher than yield loss risks for 100 individuals this was because water thresholds corresponding to maximum eta and maximum yield were different and the same water allocation resulted in different water shortage risk and yield loss risk the dimensions and orders of magnitude of eta and yield affected risks symmetry degree and relationships of these two risks therefore dimensionless of water shortage risk and yield loss risk were compared and the result is shown in fig 13 fig 13 disclosed that the points distributed evenly on 45 degree line illustrating the yield and water shortage presented same degree of variations water thresholds of yields of four dmus were lower than water thresholds of maximum evapotranspiration for twelve dmus water thresholds of other eight dmus possessed opposite tendencies if the water allocation valued 200 mm differences between water thresholds of maximum et and yields were almost same with differences between water thresholds of maximum eta and yield removing effects of dimensions the eta and yield of the seed corn with t1 under 200 mm were 0 6 and 0 4 and corresponding risks were 0 4 and 0 6 therefore mismatching phenomena of eta and yield existed which was caused by various irrigation thresholds this also indicated that fitting relationship between yield and eta was more applicable than relationship between yield and irrigation and thus some researches using irrigation amount to replace eta was not reasonable if relationship between irrigation and crop yield was used the relationship between irrigation and eta must matched fitly one obvious advantage of fitting simultaneously these two kinds of spatially distributed water production functions was that responses of eta on variation of irrigation were concerned and reflected these underlined advantages of proposed approaches 5 3 coordinated degree of footprint families the coordinated degree was cd used to measure relationships across footprint families its calculation steps are shown as cd c t c f x g x f x g x 2 2 k t f x g x 2 where c t denote coupling degree and coordination index respectively f x g x are each subsystem individually if cd is between 0 5 and 0 8 the cd belongs to high coordination and if it is between 0 8 and 1 the cd is extremely highest coordinated the ecological footprint was concerned and mutually concerned with energy footprint water footprint and yield footprint and thus their mutual cd donated as ef enf ef wf ef y was calculated to figure out coordinated degree of resources consumption and ecology the results are shown in table 5 the results illustrated that ecological footprint and energy footprint was in a high coordinated demonstrating that energy consumption and energy occupied land ecological footprint was in the reasonable coordination the above regulations also suitable for fresh water land ecological footprint and cropland ecological footprint the energy footprint generated carbon emission and energy was as a resource of yield and thus the coordinated degrees of enf y enf cf were computed which were in reasonable coordinated ranges this illustrated that fitness and adaptability across energy and carbon and yield were high coordinated and water footprint and yield water footprint and risks wf y wf r were all in acceptable coordination the above results highlighted advantages of optimal decision strategies 6 conclusion the footprint families based multi objective type 2 fuzzy random chance constrained programming ffmot2frccp was established to optimize spatially distributed water land and fertilizer resources in this paper it incorporated footprint families covering ecological footprint water footprint carbon footprint and energy footprint risks it2fahp t2frccp approaches with the spatially distributed water production functions the spatially distributed crop water production functions and irrigation actual evapotranspiration functions improve simulation accuracy of spatially heterogeneous crop yield besides they reflect variations of actual evapotranspiration with changes of irrigation and strengthen fitting goodness of simulation models together considerations of water shortage risk and yield loss risk from aspect of their conducting process enhance capacities of handling integrated risks synergy of distributed footprint families covering ecological footprint water footprint carbon footprint and energy footprint based on the life cycle approach can reflect mutual interactions and coordinated degree of agriculture and ecology subsystem and reach spatially precise resources managements moreover the developed model can deal with compound uncertain parameters expressed as type 2 fuzzy random variables and strength robustness of ahp by introducing interval type 2 ahp approach in addition the model was applied to a case study to verify its application the developed model was proved to be an effective tool to allocate multiple resources to multiple crops with consideration of spatially distributed crop yield at arid and semi arid district however it is unable to deal with other risk resources e g energy

2956,assessments of coastal wetland vulnerability to sea level rise slr frequently use simplified representations of tidal levels and sediment input i e average or representative values disregarding short and long term variations the expensive computational cost of using high resolution time series is one of the main reasons for such simplification however observed series contain short term variations such as severe storms and interannual variability induced by climate and ocean phenomena in this study we used a previously developed ecogeomorphological model and high performance computing to carry out simulations with observed and synthetic high resolution datasets to account for both types of variations we performed two experiments in the first experiment we used observed water levels and satellite derived sediment concentrations from 2002 to 2011 to assess the capability of the model to reproduce in situ measurements of soil elevation change in a mangrove saltmarsh wetland in se australia results showed increased wetland extent particularly in saltmarsh and soil elevation change in years with important storms but little effect on the long term trends of soil elevation and wetland evolution in the second experiment we implemented a monte carlo mc approach comprising 100 realizations of 100 year duration using synthetically generated input data based on 13 years of high resolution values of water levels and sediment load each simulation covered the period between 2000 and 2100 and included increases in slr following the rcp 8 5 scenario the mc results show that the variability of inputs generate uncertainties in wetland evolution with up to 20 of wetland area extent classified as highly uncertain during the second half of the century in agreement with the first experiment uncertainty was higher in saltmarsh in addition uncertainty in elevation change was lower than in wetland extent mc results were compared with simulations using representative sinusoidal waves and constant sediment concentration one using the mean tidal range and the other using a combination of neap mean and spring tidal ranges both simplified formulations underestimated wetland extent particularly in saltmarsh but the simulations with the combination of tidal ranges were able to match the soil elevation change results from the mc approach keywords coastal wetland ecogeomorphological model sea level rise sediment variability storms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the long term evolution of coastal wetlands has been extensively studied in recent years due to their potential vulnerability to the impacts of climate change kirwan et al 2016a lovelock et al 2015b rodriguez et al 2017 rogers et al 2019 saintilan et al 2021 saintilan et al 2020 sandi et al 2021 schuerch et al 2018b coastal wetlands are depositional environments which are continuously trapping sediments and building up their soil elevation to adapt to long term changes in sea levels cahoon et al 2021 howe et al 2009 morris et al 2012 predictions of wetland evolution are challenging due to the complexity of vegetation and geomorphological processes which vary considerably from place to place due to local conditions such as tidal amplitude morphology latitude and rainfall regime the timescale for physical and ecological processes in these wetlands is also highly variable ranging from hourly or daily scales i e tidal cycles controlling sediment transport to seasonal and intra annual scales i e rainy season and enso periods effects on sediment availability to geological scales i e soil processes leading to the formation of peatlands allen 2000 larsen 2019 however due to the limitations of data availability and computational capabilities the variability of these processes is typically oversimplified in assessment studies of coastal wetland vulnerability chu agor et al 2011 spencer et al 2016 wiberg et al 2020 resulting in predictions with unknown uncertainty for instance while the literature relating to the impact of storm surges in coastal wetlands is abundant bilskie et al 2016 cahoon 2006 leonardi et al 2018 michener et al 1997 rogers et al 2013 schuerch et al 2018a storm patterns and their potential modifications due to climate change are seldom included in such assessments the current work focuses on this particular issue taking advantage of the university of newcastle s high performance computer cluster a large set of simulations using long series of observed water levels and sediment concentration as input were carried out the results bring light to the distribution of predicted wetland vegetation and soil elevation change with important implications for coastal wetland management practices barua et al 2020 storms have a number of effects on coastal areas depending on their strength rainfall volume and wind gusts and the local characteristics of the site cahoon 2006 michener et al 1997 many studies show that suspended solids concentration ssc rapidly increases during storm surges due to elevated loads and resuspension lacy et al 2020 schuerch et al 2018a and consequently a larger amount of material is deposited over the wetland soil schuerch et al 2016 however other processes may affect the thickness of the deposited sediment such as soil compaction variation in groundwater storage localised erosion or root decomposition where mass vegetation mortality has occurred cahoon 2006 cahoon et al 2021 whelan et al 2005 severe events can result in more sediment delivery but also on increased erosion to the wetland soils in some cases sand spits adjacent to the wetland areas may be breached during severe events significantly improving sediment delivery in the following years schuerch et al 2018a in other cases severe events can wash away the sand spits reducing natural protection and favouring coastal erosion valdemoro et al 2007 and saltmarsh degradation leonardi et al 2016 in the absence of sand spits or large mudflat areas severe events may cause no modifications to the long term elevation change in a wetland rogers et al 2013 in addition to severe storms oscillations between neap and spring tides can affect sediment delivery amoudry and souza 2011 chanson et al 2008 especially where ssc is naturally high as observed in the san francisco bay lacy et al 2020 sediment is imported from adjacent water bodies during high tide if the overflow is calm and allows gravitational settling or if vegetation is dense enough to trap much of the ssc in degraded wetlands areas with bare soil lose sediment due to wave erosion and if this material is carried away through the tidal creeks the wetland may face a decrease in elevation leonardi et al 2018 at river estuaries ssc in tidal creeks is also affected by flood events in the river catchment as they enhance sediment transport from upstream land over the days following the event ganju et al 2013 martini et al 2004 at larger time scales i e seasonal to decadal the frequency of severe events may play an important role in the coastal wetland dynamics schuerch et al 2016 found correlations between records of sedimentation peaks and stormy years due to el niño events in multiple marshes over the rio de la plata estuary but the rates of soil elevation change in those marshes varied considerably such variability reflects the importance of local characteristics in sedimentation processes accretion rates and water turbidity may remain high over months after a big storm as observed in the hunter estuary rogers et al 2013 nevertheless even though sediment supply is highly variable over time this variability is frequently neglected in wetland vulnerability studies leonardi et al 2018 commonly coastal eco geomorphological models egm are developed to evaluate soil accretion and vegetation growth on a yearly or decadal basis variations in sediment concentration and water levels are acknowledged in the literature as important drivers of coastal wetland morphology however the majority of studies related to forecasting wetland evolution use simplified inputs that do not include such variations therefore many eco geomorphic processes are not fully accounted for wiberg et al 2020 different models address specific drivers that are considered dominating for specific study areas such as tidal constituents alizad et al 2016 dynamic shear stress carniello et al 2014 rainfall regime eslami andargoli et al 2009 effects of vegetation colonisation in soil stability schwarz et al 2018 and attenuation of water levels due to surface roughness and man made structures rodriguez et al 2017 sandi et al 2018 this variety of models with different mathematical complexity also represent a trade off between the computational times their spatial and temporal resolution and the number of modelled variables due to the long time scale of eco geomorphic simulations average input values for water depths and sediment concentration are used to reduce the complexity by assuming that processes will average over time thus ignoring the effects of severe events and variability at short time scales gao et al 2019 ran simulations on deltaic coastal wetlands using both average and high frequency time series as inputs to predict deltaic morphological evolution though overall trends in sedimentation and erosion were similar the use of unsteady input discharges gave more realistic results and allowed a tipping point for delta progradation decline to be detected in this study we explored how use of high frequency time series and short term variability in water levels and ssc from storms and extraordinary events affects wetland vegetation evolution and soil elevation change in a tidal flat we explore a series of scenarios using a previously developed eco geomorphological egm framework breda et al 2021 rodriguez et al 2017 for this purpose we conducted two separate numerical experiments in the first one we compared the results of this simulation of the tidal flat domain against with soil elevation measurements in mangrove saltmarsh and encroachment zones from a site with similar vegetation and tidal conditions rogers et al 2013 in the second experiment we implemented a monte carlo approach to reproduce the variability of water levels and sediment concentration in future years to forecast changes in the vegetation and elevation of the wetland platform over the current century for comparison with the monte carlo approach we ran two extra simulations over the same period using simplified representations of sinusoidal waves and constant ssc as inputs these type of simplified representations of the tidal regime are used commonly in coastal wetland vulnerability assessments breda et al 2021 d alpaos et al 2007 yousefi lalimi et al 2020 to reduce the computational cost the experiments were carried on a hypothetical tidal flat that is representative of the main physical features found in many of south eastern australian coastal wetlands the model parameters and the input data used for the egm correspond to the hunter river estuary this site has been the study area of previous works breda et al 2021 rodriguez et al 2017 rogers et al 2013 sandi et al 2018 some of which have also employed the same egm framework 2 material and methods in the egm framework adopted in this study originally introduced by rodriguez et al 2017 and later modified by breda et al 2021 a hydrodynamic model is used to simulate the tidal regime in the wetlands which is then linked to vegetation characteristics and accretion processes to simulate vegetation establishment or collapse and surface elevation change in this way feedback effects between hydrodynamics vegetation and soil surface elevation change are taken into account for all formulations please refer to supplementary information the hydrodynamic component is a fast 2d inundation model that has been extensively calibrated and validated in different types of wetlands saco et al 2020 sandi et al 2018 2019 sandi et al 2021 while the vegetation sediment transport and accretion components are based on state of the art formulations validated in the hunter river wetlands breda et al 2021 the simulation domain shown in fig 1 represents a hypothetical wetland with the average terrain characteristics found in the hunter river estuary se australia where the hydrodynamic and egm models were calibrated rodriguez et al 2017 the model domain was 250 m wide and 1500 m long discretised into 10x10mcells with a total of 3000 cells the time step used for the solution of the hydrodynamic model was 1 s to ensure numerical stability inputs and outputs for this model are in a 5 min discrete interval which is the same time step used in the sediment transport model the vegetation and soil elevation change models are on a yearly scale and both require the yearly averaged hydroperiod h and depth below mean high tide d as inputs 2 1 water level data the water level time series for the period 2002 to 2020 at the hunter estuary were obtained from waternsw https realtimedata waternsw com au for the stream gauge at hexham bridge id 210448 this station is close to the study area of rodriguez et al 2017 and sandi et al 2018 where the current modelling framework was calibrated the station provides water levels recorded every 15 min periods with gaps or inconsistent data were completed using a harmonic tide model grinsted 2020 fitted to the data 2 2 sediment concentration data series of suspended solids concentrations ssc were retrieved from two satellite products between 2002 and 2011 we adopted the total suspended matter tsm data provided by globcolour http globcolour info which is derived from meris satellite imagery the same method was used to provide average ssc values in a global modelling approach schuerch et al 2018b such datasets have also been implemented in other studies with different levels of accuracy for example ramakrishnan and rajawat 2012 used landsat derived ssc as the initial condition for a hydrodynamic and sediment transport model in the gulf of kachchh india even though the satellite product provided a reasonable concentration map throughout the studied site ssc was consistently underestimated teodoro et al 2007 compared different methods to estimate tsm for three different satellite products but did not find any significant difference between them in general all methods underestimated the in situ data for the hunter estuary meris case 2 derived data turbid waters in estuaries and lagoons near the shore underestimated local ssc rodriguez et al 2017 measurements at the site indicated that values of tsm were unreasonably low for the hunter estuary in the period 2002 to 2011 fig 2 a so we multiplied the meris tsm series by the ratio between in situ ssc measurements 37 g m 3 as reported in rodriguez et al 2017 and the average of 2002 2011 meris data 10 08 g m 3 see fig 2b the second tsm data period between 2018 and 2020 was retrieved from sentinel 2 images using the case 2 regional coastcolour c2rcc brockmann et al 2016 algorithm available in the snap toolbox https step esa int main snap is a desktop application freely distributed by the european space agency esa to manipulate satellite images the sentinel 2 product provides tsm data with a high spatial resolution and a 3 day average revisiting time c2rcc data does not underestimate sediment concentration brockmann et al 2016 besides removing days with high cloud cover no other post processing such as the rescaling was applied to the sentinel 2 tsm data series as this product is well suited for case 2 both series the rescaled meris and the sentinel 2 were aggregated into monthly averages as single measures might be affected by atmospheric conditions and tidal phase raag et al 2013 to verify if the different sources of ssc data are compatible we applied a few statistical tests the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to compare the cumulative distributions of both datasets the probability density functions described by both datasets are not inconsistent p 0 34 a visual comparison fig 3 also shows that both monthly datasets produce similar frequency histograms we also applied a t test and a kruskal wallis test for the mean and median of both samples both tests indicate the mean and median are consistent in both samples p 0 5 2 3 re sampled water level series long term simulations such as continuously simulating a domain with 3000 cells in time steps of 1 s over a period of 100 years are extremely demanding in terms of computational power and storage to avoid such a constraint some studies adopt a simple sinusoidal wave with a given amplitude and frequency that mimics the local average tidal phase best et al 2018 breda et al 2021 marani et al 2010 others take a short period of the year to represent the whole interval dissanayake et al 2012 kirwan and murray 2007 however these approaches remove the effects of short bursts in the water levels from storms and oscillations of the msl due to climate phenomena and ocean currents to verify the importance of including high frequency and short term variability in coastal wetland modelling we adopted a different approach to reduce the simulation time our approach consisted of re sampling the complete time series every four days effectively reducing the series length to one fourth of the original length fig 4 the resampling interval was selected after verifying that the frequency of high water level values was not substantially affected by the procedure we tested different resampling intervals from two to four days obtaining similar results fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a year long time series of water level can be replaced with every four days 75 reduction without losing the variability of the entire year we also compared monthly statistics between full and resampled series for mean tidal range hydroperiod and depth averaged ssc the difference was never higher than 2 while for monthly maximum levels it remains below 4 except for a few cases in which it reached 7 the reduced sampling was successful because the 4 day re sampling interval was substantially shorter than the typical severe storm duration which are the result of complex atmospheric phenomena oeh 2016 and last for longer despite the series reduction the computational time for mc simulations took up to 400 h 2 4 simulation of past storms the first experiment carried out in this work was the simulation of past events series of water levels and ssc between january 2002 and december 2011 were used as input for the egm framework this is the same period monitored in rogers et al 2013 and fortunately the only period with meris s satellite ssc derived data for the hunter river estuary fig 6 shows the monthly average maximum water levels and average sediment concentration during this period severe storms occurred during 2007 and 2011 the surface elevation and vegetation cover in the domain are updated at the end of every year please see the model description in the supplementary information the first is done by adding the accreted amount over the soil elevation followed by a smoothing procedure using a diffusive hillslope model kirkby 1971 to account for the natural redistribution of the sediment lovelock et al 2015a vegetation is updated based on establishment rules given the maximum water depth and the inundated period which also alters the surface roughness we compared the results of this simulation with soil elevation measurements presented in rogers et al 2013 for mangrove saltmarsh and encroachment zones a severe event occurred during this period more precisely in june of 2007 known as the pasha bulker storm oeh 2016 therefore the egm framework s performance in this period indicates its ability to address the effects of such events using the morphological parameters of the wetland as our simulation domain represents a simple wetland platform with the same average conditions as rogers et al 2013 we had to identify regions of the domain that are representative of the soil elevation measurements we divided our wetland into mangrove saltmarsh and transition zones as well as near channel close to inner channel and tidal flat away from inner channel zones 2 5 monte carlo simulation of future wetland conditions the second round of experiments was conducted to assess the effect of intra annual variability in the forecasts provided by the modelling framework using the monte carlo mc method we built 100 synthetic series of 100 year duration each to represent the period between 2000 and 2100 the time series for each year was composed by binding together hourly series for each month that were randomly drawn from the sample of 13 years for that particular month the hourly series for the 13 years of data were re sampled as explained in section 2 3 before applying the procedure in order to reduce computational time this procedure reproduces the seasonal behaviour of the tidal regime parameters and the variations due to severe events in the sediment load additionally mean water levels were increased for each year of the simulation according to slr projections from the rcp8 5 scenario church et al 2013 to represent the effects of a rising sea level two extra simulations using simplified sinusoidal waves were also implemented for comparison against the mc simulations a sinusoidal wave is created with the following equation 01 z w t sin t 2 π λ a 2 m s l where z w is the water level m at time t s λ is the wavelength s a is the wave amplitude m and msl is the local mean sea level m the first simplified series consists of a 12 hour long tidal wave with 1 3 m amplitude which is the average value found in the hunter estuary hexham bridge station as implemented by breda et al 2021 this wave is repeated for a total period of 96 h to ensure that flood and ebb effects are accurately represented over the entire domain the second simplified series consists of a composition of 8 sinusoidal waves as shown in fig 7 a where the wave amplitudes are given by the following sequence of tidal ranges neap 0 5 neap mean mean 0 5 mean spring spring 0 5 spring mean mean 0 5 mean neap both simplified series used a constant sediment input of 37 g m 3 as the local long term average rodriguez et al 2017 the outcomes of the mc simulations were compared with these two reference simulations to clarify the effect of using simplified water level series in the model we analysed the outcomes of the mc simulations through statistical assessment of the distribution of vegetation cover and soil elevation maps with the frequency of mangrove and saltmarsh occurrence were created for different years allowing an analysis of the spatial variability changes over time see supplementary information for the soil elevation analysis we split the domain into near channel and tidal flat regions the first represents the average conditions in the cells located near the inner channel inside the domain more precisely all cells within 50 m of the inner channel the latter represents the area of the domain barely affected by the inner channel and it was comprised by all cells distant from the inner channel at least 150 m 3 results as previously discussed this work was divided into two sets of experiments the first experiment tests the ability of the egm to represent the effect of stormy years in the simulated wetland platform for this we simulated the period from 2002 to 2011 using full length time series of water levels and sediment concentration the second experiment is a monte carlo analysis that reproduces the potential variability of water levels and the effects on long term predictions of coastal wetland vegetation and soil elevation over the current century 3 1 first experiment simulation of past years we analysed the dynamics of simulated vegetation in the domain through yearly vegetation maps the composition presented in fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of wetland vegetation given the establishment conditions based on rodriguez et al 2017 for the hunter estuary se australia between 2002 and 2011 see supplementary information mangrove occurrence in the wetland showed small changes over the entire ten year interval mangrove occupied the lower portion of the tidal flat usually presenting an extension of approximately 400 m on the other hand saltmarsh varied significantly as it showed extensions from 500 m in 2004 2005 to near 1000 m in 2007 and 2011 these results show that the region defined by frequent tidal inundation where mangrove development is optimal is not very sensitive to severe events however the maximum length where saltwater depths provide the conditions for saltmarsh establishment is highly dependent on the occurrence of severe events with the largest saltmarsh extents occurring in years with severe storms 2007 and 2011 see also fig 6 such behaviour agrees with evidence from miller 2020 showing that saltmarsh transgression is much higher during stormy years however the level of variation in the saltmarsh area over the simulated years is probably excessive when compared with a natural migration pattern the thresholds used in the vegetation model to identify the saltmarsh area are associated with conditions where mature well developed marsh species are found and processes related to the colonisation of new regions by saltmarsh are not explicitly included therefore the transgression over freshwater vegetation should be understood as a potential area for saltmarsh establishment rogers et al 2013 collected average elevation changes during this period in both mangrove and saltmarsh areas to compare the elevation change produced by the egm simulations with in situ measurements we identify areas comparable with those where the samples were collected by analysing the dynamics of the simulated vegetation fig 8 the areas designated as mangrove and saltmarsh in fig 9 are those where the simulated vegetation did not change over the simulated period and were used for the comparison with rogers et al 2013 data the transition zone represents areas that change from saltmarsh to mangrove at some point in the simulations while the transgression zone represents freshwater vegetation cells that have been replaced by saltmarsh at some point in the simulations an additional factor to take into account is that elevation change is larger at the margins of the inner channel and decreases with distance as ssc decreases due to settling and sediment entrapment because of this we separate the results for two specific zones the near channel zone consisting of cells within 50 m of the inner channel and the tidal flat zone which corresponds to cells more than 150 m away from the inner channel the plots in fig 10 show the range of elevation change values within each zone for mangrove and saltmarsh areas respectively over the simulated period the mangrove area fig 10a showed an elevation increase between 3 and 41 mm according to the egm model and about 22 mm according to point measurements in the saltmarsh fig 10b the results from the model showed an increase of between 0 and 33 mm while the point measurements showed approximately 14 mm in the same period in both cases the in situ measurements from rogers et al 2013 are within the range of the model results about halfway between maximum and minimum predicted values therefore confirming the model s ability to reproduce accretional processes in the study area one characteristic of the results of this experiment was the increase in the range of elevation change values over time indicating a high spatial variability of elevation change over the domain this is caused by the quick decay of ssc as the flow transitions from the channel to the tidal flat which promotes higher deposition rates at those cells that are closer to the creek this spatial variability is observed in natural wetlands belliard et al 2016 temmerman et al 2004 and other simulations in saltmarsh geng et al 2021 but cannot be captured by the field measurements at a point the severe event of 2007 the pasha bulker storm promoted a noticeable elevation change rate increase in both the mangrove and saltmarsh according to the measurements our modelling results also produce an increase in elevation change rate in both vegetation areas particularly in the near channel zone this is evident by the steep rise after the first storm of the upper boundary of the blue zone in fig 10 in the tidal flat zone the elevation change rate yellow zone is less affected by the severe events with a minor increase in mangroves and almost no change in saltmarsh the same pattern can be observed after the second severe event in 2011 although there is not the same detail of field data to corroborate model results 3 2 second experiment monte carlo simulation of future years in the analysis of mc results we adopted a similar domain division to that used in the past storms experiment given the nature of the mc simulations we refer to the mangrove and saltmarsh areas as those cells where at least 67 of simulations predict mangrove and saltmarsh occurrence respectively the area with cells between 67 and 33 of mangrove occurrence is a transition zone which can be unvegetated mangrove at the seaward end and mangrove saltmarsh at the interface with saltmarsh saltmarsh also has transition zones where cells have 67 to 33 of saltmarsh occurrence which are the mangrove saltmarsh zone at the mangrove interface and the saltmarsh freshwater zone at the interface with freshwater vegetation areas with less than 33 occurrence of mangrove or saltmarsh are considered unvegetated or freshwater vegetation we also considered near channel and tidal flat zones in some of the analysis of the results 3 2 1 mangrove and saltmarsh evolution our first examination of the mc outcomes is related to vegetation dynamics more specifically the features that are more impacted by the randomised input series fig 11 shows maps of vegetation class derived from the mc simulations at four different years 2000 2040 2070 and 2100 additionally the vegetation area for each simulation was computed and summarised every 20 years table 1 the vegetation map for the year 2000 fig 11a does not include sea level rise effects and represents the variability obtained by randomly combining the 13 years of available data most of the 100 mc simulations present mangrove in the first 400 m of the domain and saltmarsh from approximately 500 m to 900 m from the tidal creek table 1 shows a very similar area for these two vegetation types in the year 2000 the transition zone i e where mangrove and saltmarsh frequencies are almost even is no longer than 70 m while the saltmarsh freshwater transition zone is about 20 m long over most of the first half of the century slr drives vegetation expansion upslope in both mangrove and saltmarsh but does not cause significant losses in the lower areas as we can see in fig 11b by 2040 the upstream mangrove margin moves to 500 m from the tidal creek in the near channel zone and a little bit further in the tidal flat zone the transition zone mangrove saltmarsh is narrower than in year 2000 the transgression of the wetland towards the freshwater area occurs at about 1000 m from the tidal creek over a strip 60 m long according to table 1 the mangrove and saltmarsh area increased 29 and 15 respectively compared to the values of the year 2000 in the second half of the century the wetland vegetation initially close to the msl starts to drown as observed for the year 2070 in fig 11c the lower areas 100 to 200 m from the tidal creek are converted to unvegetated areas a transition zone at the unvegetated mangrove interface varies from 50 m in the near channel zone to 200 m at the tidal flat zone mangrove areas are found between 100 and 700 m in the near channel zone and between 350 and 750 m in the tidal flat zone which corresponds to a 4 loss compared to the values of year 2040 table 1 transition mangrove saltmarsh has a near constant extent of 50 m occurring around 750 m from the tidal creek by the year 2070 saltmarsh moved further inland but maintained almost the same extension approximately 450 m and consequently the same area as in the year 2040 the extension of the saltmarsh freshwater vegetation transition strip remains at approximately the same value as in the year 2040 by the end of the simulated period all of the area initially occupied by mangroves in the year 2000 is gone fig 11d the unvegetated mangrove transition area extends from 400 to 450 m in the near channel zone and from 600 to 700 m in the tidal flat zone mangrove extent remains roughly the same as in previous years but saltmarsh extent is reduced due to the presence of the upstream edge of the domain 1500 m from the tidal creek which is probably reached by saltmarsh around the year 2080 table 1 by the year 2100 both mangrove and saltmarsh occur only in areas initially occupied by other vegetation in the year 2000 3 2 2 vegetation using simplified water level inputs due to limitations in computational capability many long term simulations use a simplified input condition therefore we compare the mc results based on samples from high resolution data series with two reference simulations using simplified water level series as explained in previous sections these reference simulations use different compositions of sinusoidal waves the first one repeating a single wave with the mean tidal amplitude and the second one including 8 waves with different amplitudes representing neaps and spring tidal cycles in fig 12 we show the vegetation maps for the mc experiment cells with more than 67 occurrence for both mangrove green and saltmarsh yellow in the top chart we overlap this base map with the outcomes from the simulations using the single wave input at the bottom we overlap the mc results with the outcomes from the simulation using the 8 waves composition the years 2060 and 2100 were included in fig 12a and b respectively as they highlight the major differences observed over the entire simulation period in the comparisons for both years we can observe that the one wave approximation tends to better reproduce the seaward limits of the mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation areas while the 8 wave approximation tends to better reproduce the extent and the average position of the mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation areas both approximations considerably underestimate the saltmarsh area also the mc simulations produce a small vegetation gap which is not captured by the single wave and is overestimated by the 8 wave approximation this gap represents areas that are not consistently occupied by mangrove or saltmarsh so they can be transitional or unvegetated i e tidal pools which are common features in estuarine wetlands and are associated with local topography rodriguez et al 2017 the model produces accretion values that are not uniform throughout the domain see next section and in some situations the local topography may lead to inundation conditions that are not suitable for mangrove or saltmarsh due to sea level rise and vegetation migration over time those areas are eventually colonised by mangroves as shown by fig 12 comparing the results using simplified inputs with the mc simulations fig 12 it is clear that the main differences occur in the saltmarsh areas this is because mangrove preference conditions depend on hydroperiod h whereas saltmarsh preference is related to depth below mean high tide d and simplifying the tidal conditions has a greater effect on d than in h 3 2 3 elevation change coastal wetland survival under sea level rise depends on the capacity of the wetland to produce an elevation increase that could mitigate the rising water levels an assessment of how the wetland builds up soil elevation over time is carried out based on the domain average of elevation change within the first 900 m of the domain this distance represents the vegetated wetland area by 2020 which is very close to the average extent of wetland vegetation over the entire simulation period new wetland areas due to migration after 2020 are not considered the results are presented in fig 13 and are classified into near channel zone and the tidal flat zone the results from the reference simulations with simplified tidal inputs are also included in the figure the full range of mean elevation changes in all mc simulations is relatively narrow within 20 of the median value for the near channel zone and 12 for the tidal flat zone the elevation gain in the near channel almost doubles the elevation gain in the tidal flat zone however given that slr reaches 74 cm by 2100 a considerable elevation deficit is expected in all simulations regarding the simplified wave simulations the 8 wave composition shows elevation change values that are very similar to the mc values for almost the entire simulation however the simple one wave input produces only 80 of the mc s median elevation change in the near channel zone and less than 70 of the median in the tidal flat zone to look in more detail at the differences in elevation change in fig 14 we present the elevation change profiles in the near channel and tidal flat zones for the year 2060 the near channel fig 14a and tidal flat fig 14b elevation change profiles differ in shape and magnitude in the near channel zone sediment input is higher and so is the sedimentation amount in the tidal flat zone mangrove accretes more than saltmarsh but in the near channel zone that difference is not as marked the range of values in the mc simulations is wider in the near channel zone than in the tidal flat zone both zones present a characteristic exponential decay in elevation change due to the preferential deposition close to the tidal input creek they also present a localised elevation increase at around 600 m which corresponds to areas previously occupied by saltmarsh with high biomass and thus high accretion capability the 8 wave simulation overestimates mangrove elevation change and underestimates saltmarsh elevation change both in the near channel and the tidal flat zones whereas the single wave underestimates elevation change over the entire wetland except for the lower mangrove areas in the near channel zone for this reason the domain average presented in fig 13 is substantially lower for the single wave simulation than for the other two simulations 4 discussion the experiments carried on in this work used information collected over 13 years in the hunter estuary area to replicate past events and to reproduce its variability while predicting the evolution of coastal wetlands our modelling framework reproduced the temporal trend of soil elevation rates measured in situ between 2002 and 2011 by rogers et al 2013 in agreement with their findings our simulation results indicate that stormy years produce a higher soil elevation rate but over a short time however from the model s perspective the height of settled material added to the wetland soil over a stormy year has little effect on the elevation rates observed in the following years comparisons between sediment deposition and years with high floods in the la plata river estuary schuerch et al 2016 also corroborate this correlation in the same experiment we observed that mangrove is more resilient to storms our results showed little displacement in the mangrove area during the simulated period fig 8 the same was observed by lymburner et al 2020 who accounted for a 2 change in australian mangrove forests using landsat images over the last two decades moreover the largest changes were restricted to the mangroves in tropical zones in the assessment made by eslami andargoli et al 2009 for the mangrove area in moreton bay approximately 600 km north of the hunter estuary a positive correlation between annual rainfall volumes and mangrove inland expansion was found that is also true in our experiment as mangrove moved upslope although by just a few metres in the stormy years simulating the effect of storms on coastal wetlands is a complex task many studies have addressed the impacts of extreme events on mangrove or saltmarsh areas cahoon 2006 leonardi et al 2018 however techniques to model how their magnitude and frequency affect wetland evolution are at an incipient stage one of the main constraints is computational power because storms affect hydrodynamic and sediment transport mechanisms over short time scales whereas changes in the coastal wetland morphology and flora can take years our attempt has been to extend the short time scale effects over many years using mc simulations on a simplified domain with inputs from a re sampling high frequency tidal and sediment inputs we implemented our approach on a high performance computer in order to keep the simulation times within reasonable values by randomising the inter annual variability in water levels and sediment supply through an mc simulation we were able to estimate the uncertainty in model results of wetland vegetation coverage we classified the predictions of the model by areas with a defined vegetation cover more than 67 occurrence and transition areas where more than one vegetation type can occur less than 67 occurrence transition areas have high uncertainty but comprise only 10 of the total wetland area with a slight bias towards the saltmarsh transitions the percentage of those uncertain areas increased when we simulated wetland evolution due to the effects of slr using the median value of the rcp8 5 pathway in this century the percentage increased to about 15 20 towards the second half of the century when the mangrove seaward margin started retreating in terms of overall results the model predicts an even split of wetland area between mangrove and saltmarsh at the beginning of the century during the first half of the century mangrove areas increase by 29 and saltmarsh areas by 15 associated with inland migration after that period more rapid retreat at the seaward end of mangroves and limited capacity for saltmarsh to migrate upstream produces reductions of wetland areas to values close to the initial year 2000 values the literature about wetland vulnerability assessment usually takes different rates of slr to include some degree of uncertainty in the outcomes khojasteh et al 2021 lovelock et al 2015b schuerch et al 2018b but uncertainty due to natural variability is seldom considered using a large wetland vulnerability assessment model schuerch et al 2018b estimated coastal wetland gain loss worldwide considering different slr and scenarios for space to accommodate migration among all different conditions most of the predictions presented a change of about 20 in the coastal wetland area by the year 2100 however for the highest slr scenario this range was from 30 to 60 our simulation shows that the mean wetland area in the hunter estuary would increase by 20 until 2070 and then decline to values close to the initial condition by 2100 table 1 although of course at a different position and vegetation composition lovelock et al 2015b also projected the submergence for mangroves in the indo pacific region using contemporaneous surface elevation rates in conditions similar to those adopted in this study their model predicts total submergence by 2100 or later in our case total wetland submergence does not occur as the wetland is able to continue migrating however if we reduce the size of our wetland to 900 m and stop migration we find that the wetland submerges by the end of the century which is in agreement with rodriguez et al 2017 for vegetation loss in the hunter estuary upslope migration of both wetland vegetation types showed a clear correlation with the rate of slr on average we observed 2 5 m year 1 over the first four decades slr 5 mm year 1 and nearly 10 m year 1 in the last three decades when the slr rate was around 10 mm year 1 kirwan et al 2016b used a non linear model to predict marsh extension or contraction as a function of slr ssc and terrain slope for conditions of mean ssc and bottom slope similar to those found in our simulated domain they also obtained 2 5 m year 1 for a slr of 5 mm year 1 however under a slr of 10 mm year 1 the vegetation loss at the seaward edge was faster than the transgression upstream resulting in marsh reduction of about of 2 5 m year 1 reed et al 2020 used a large scale regional ecogeomorphological model to investigate the most probable causes of marsh loss on louisiana s coast usa they tiled up a 6 year long series of observed inputs to build a 50 year long series and use it as input along with three different trajectories of slr for a medium rate of slr excessive inundation and marsh edge erosion equate to 70 of saltmarsh loss for our case saltmarsh loss was exclusively due to mangrove encroachment if we had considered a domain 900 m long to avoid migration the saltmarsh loss in the first 50 years would be approximately a third of the initial area which is similar to the saltmarsh loss estimated by reed et al 2020 our mc simulation introduced the uncertainty due to natural variations in the water levels and sediment concentration which are the product of tides as well as storm events other studies also assessed the variability in their model outputs due to uncertainty in some inputs or in the model s parameters chu agor et al 2011 used an mc simulation to verify which factors inputs and parameters had more impact on the variability of wetland areas predicted by the slamm model at the beginning of the simulation while slr is low the error in the bottom elevation dominated the output variability up to 99 of the model s dispersion however with the increase of msl and consequent reduction of wetland elevation the number of factors controlling variations in the output increased they found that accretion sedimentation rates and the rate of slr produced most of the wetland area variability later in the simulation clough et al 2016 also assessed slamm s prediction uncertainty for marshes in new york state regarding marsh area the 90 confidence limit was within 3 of the mean value in the first year 2010 by 2040 this interval grew to 6 of the mean value increasing even more over the following years until it reached 48 by 2100 the authors also recognized the rate of slr as the primary driver of variability in the output and availability of space to accommodate migration as the principal marsh loss reduction factor in sum compared with our findings natural variability in the water levels and sediment introduces a level of uncertainty that is less than the uncertainty introduced by the rate of slr but it is of a comparable magnitude in terms of the ability of simplified wave simulations to reproduce results that include the natural variability of water levels and sediment supply an 8 wave simplification including neap tidal range mean tidal range and spring tidal range performs notably better than a single wave with mean tidal range including the different tidal ranges incorporates some of the variability in the inputs however it does not incorporate the variability due to storms the 8 wave results capture the mean position and migration of mangrove and saltmarsh areas and the overall wetland surface elevation change the single wave model commonly used in many predictions of wetland evolution underestimates saltmarsh migration as well as overall wetland elevation change capacity in this study we focused on how the natural variability in water levels and sediment concentration inside the estuary affect the outcomes of the wetland s predicting model the impacts of climate change are primarily assessed by including an slr scenario rcp 8 5 church et al 2013 in the simulation sea level rise is by far the most cited phenomenon when addressing the fate of coastal wetlands cahoon and guntenspergen 2010 day et al 2008 michener et al 1997 a resilient coastal wetland is that one capable to sustain vertical growth thus tolerating disturbances with minor deterioration cahoon and guntenspergen 2010 throughout our results analyses slr will force the vegetation to migrate upslope as the rate of slr will surpass the wetland s capability of building up soil elevation it is quite uncertain when this breakpoint will be reached i e rate of slr accretion rate although they are likely to occur at the beginning of the second half of the current century nevertheless climate change will also modify the intensity and frequency of severe storms and the fluxes in the nutrient cycle day et al 2008 that is likely to alter the vegetation health and its composition which in turn can impact the wetland s accretional capacity 5 conclusions two simulation experiments were conducted to highlight how modelled vegetation evolution and soil elevation change are affected by the short term variability in observed input series of water levels and sediment concentration data that account for short term variability in the first experiment the framework reproduced in situ measurements of wetland elevation for a site on the se australian coast over the ten year long simulated period the outcomes produced the same variations as the observed data including the effects of extreme storms in the second experiment an mc simulation was conducted to reproduce the variability observed in estuarine water level and sediment concentration into the model s inputs and to analyse how such variability affects long term predictions from the observational data we generated 100 realisations of 100 years and performed simulations between 2000 and 2100 on each of them considering a slr of 74 cm rcp 8 5 at the end of the century a significant variation was found in the model results for the wetland vegetation area especially for saltmarsh while mean soil elevation change showed a moderate variability however the uncertainty ranges due to water levels and ssc variability found in this study are lower than those found in the literature regarding the rate of slr nevertheless their effects are far from being negligible we did not include in our predictions any increase in storm intensity and or frequency due to climate change which most likely increase the levels of uncertainty some coastal wetland assessments use a sinusoidal wave or a short period of a real observed series to represent the year average tidal regime we carried out two simulations using repetition of simple sinusoidal waves and constant ssc inputs to address the difference between these approaches to the mc outcomes one with the single mean tidal range and one that included neap mean and spring tidal ranges changes in the vegetation area showed similar patterns for all the simulations although each case presented a particular feature for example sinusoidal waves could not reproduce the entire length of the saltmarsh extension but successfully reproduced the extent of mangroves the surface elevation change in the simulation using a single wave with the mean tidal amplitude showed considerable underestimation while minor discrepancies were observed using the composition of multiple tidal ranges therefore this last representation can be considered a viable alternative to conducting a more general analysis of wetland vulnerability credit

2956,assessments of coastal wetland vulnerability to sea level rise slr frequently use simplified representations of tidal levels and sediment input i e average or representative values disregarding short and long term variations the expensive computational cost of using high resolution time series is one of the main reasons for such simplification however observed series contain short term variations such as severe storms and interannual variability induced by climate and ocean phenomena in this study we used a previously developed ecogeomorphological model and high performance computing to carry out simulations with observed and synthetic high resolution datasets to account for both types of variations we performed two experiments in the first experiment we used observed water levels and satellite derived sediment concentrations from 2002 to 2011 to assess the capability of the model to reproduce in situ measurements of soil elevation change in a mangrove saltmarsh wetland in se australia results showed increased wetland extent particularly in saltmarsh and soil elevation change in years with important storms but little effect on the long term trends of soil elevation and wetland evolution in the second experiment we implemented a monte carlo mc approach comprising 100 realizations of 100 year duration using synthetically generated input data based on 13 years of high resolution values of water levels and sediment load each simulation covered the period between 2000 and 2100 and included increases in slr following the rcp 8 5 scenario the mc results show that the variability of inputs generate uncertainties in wetland evolution with up to 20 of wetland area extent classified as highly uncertain during the second half of the century in agreement with the first experiment uncertainty was higher in saltmarsh in addition uncertainty in elevation change was lower than in wetland extent mc results were compared with simulations using representative sinusoidal waves and constant sediment concentration one using the mean tidal range and the other using a combination of neap mean and spring tidal ranges both simplified formulations underestimated wetland extent particularly in saltmarsh but the simulations with the combination of tidal ranges were able to match the soil elevation change results from the mc approach keywords coastal wetland ecogeomorphological model sea level rise sediment variability storms data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the long term evolution of coastal wetlands has been extensively studied in recent years due to their potential vulnerability to the impacts of climate change kirwan et al 2016a lovelock et al 2015b rodriguez et al 2017 rogers et al 2019 saintilan et al 2021 saintilan et al 2020 sandi et al 2021 schuerch et al 2018b coastal wetlands are depositional environments which are continuously trapping sediments and building up their soil elevation to adapt to long term changes in sea levels cahoon et al 2021 howe et al 2009 morris et al 2012 predictions of wetland evolution are challenging due to the complexity of vegetation and geomorphological processes which vary considerably from place to place due to local conditions such as tidal amplitude morphology latitude and rainfall regime the timescale for physical and ecological processes in these wetlands is also highly variable ranging from hourly or daily scales i e tidal cycles controlling sediment transport to seasonal and intra annual scales i e rainy season and enso periods effects on sediment availability to geological scales i e soil processes leading to the formation of peatlands allen 2000 larsen 2019 however due to the limitations of data availability and computational capabilities the variability of these processes is typically oversimplified in assessment studies of coastal wetland vulnerability chu agor et al 2011 spencer et al 2016 wiberg et al 2020 resulting in predictions with unknown uncertainty for instance while the literature relating to the impact of storm surges in coastal wetlands is abundant bilskie et al 2016 cahoon 2006 leonardi et al 2018 michener et al 1997 rogers et al 2013 schuerch et al 2018a storm patterns and their potential modifications due to climate change are seldom included in such assessments the current work focuses on this particular issue taking advantage of the university of newcastle s high performance computer cluster a large set of simulations using long series of observed water levels and sediment concentration as input were carried out the results bring light to the distribution of predicted wetland vegetation and soil elevation change with important implications for coastal wetland management practices barua et al 2020 storms have a number of effects on coastal areas depending on their strength rainfall volume and wind gusts and the local characteristics of the site cahoon 2006 michener et al 1997 many studies show that suspended solids concentration ssc rapidly increases during storm surges due to elevated loads and resuspension lacy et al 2020 schuerch et al 2018a and consequently a larger amount of material is deposited over the wetland soil schuerch et al 2016 however other processes may affect the thickness of the deposited sediment such as soil compaction variation in groundwater storage localised erosion or root decomposition where mass vegetation mortality has occurred cahoon 2006 cahoon et al 2021 whelan et al 2005 severe events can result in more sediment delivery but also on increased erosion to the wetland soils in some cases sand spits adjacent to the wetland areas may be breached during severe events significantly improving sediment delivery in the following years schuerch et al 2018a in other cases severe events can wash away the sand spits reducing natural protection and favouring coastal erosion valdemoro et al 2007 and saltmarsh degradation leonardi et al 2016 in the absence of sand spits or large mudflat areas severe events may cause no modifications to the long term elevation change in a wetland rogers et al 2013 in addition to severe storms oscillations between neap and spring tides can affect sediment delivery amoudry and souza 2011 chanson et al 2008 especially where ssc is naturally high as observed in the san francisco bay lacy et al 2020 sediment is imported from adjacent water bodies during high tide if the overflow is calm and allows gravitational settling or if vegetation is dense enough to trap much of the ssc in degraded wetlands areas with bare soil lose sediment due to wave erosion and if this material is carried away through the tidal creeks the wetland may face a decrease in elevation leonardi et al 2018 at river estuaries ssc in tidal creeks is also affected by flood events in the river catchment as they enhance sediment transport from upstream land over the days following the event ganju et al 2013 martini et al 2004 at larger time scales i e seasonal to decadal the frequency of severe events may play an important role in the coastal wetland dynamics schuerch et al 2016 found correlations between records of sedimentation peaks and stormy years due to el niño events in multiple marshes over the rio de la plata estuary but the rates of soil elevation change in those marshes varied considerably such variability reflects the importance of local characteristics in sedimentation processes accretion rates and water turbidity may remain high over months after a big storm as observed in the hunter estuary rogers et al 2013 nevertheless even though sediment supply is highly variable over time this variability is frequently neglected in wetland vulnerability studies leonardi et al 2018 commonly coastal eco geomorphological models egm are developed to evaluate soil accretion and vegetation growth on a yearly or decadal basis variations in sediment concentration and water levels are acknowledged in the literature as important drivers of coastal wetland morphology however the majority of studies related to forecasting wetland evolution use simplified inputs that do not include such variations therefore many eco geomorphic processes are not fully accounted for wiberg et al 2020 different models address specific drivers that are considered dominating for specific study areas such as tidal constituents alizad et al 2016 dynamic shear stress carniello et al 2014 rainfall regime eslami andargoli et al 2009 effects of vegetation colonisation in soil stability schwarz et al 2018 and attenuation of water levels due to surface roughness and man made structures rodriguez et al 2017 sandi et al 2018 this variety of models with different mathematical complexity also represent a trade off between the computational times their spatial and temporal resolution and the number of modelled variables due to the long time scale of eco geomorphic simulations average input values for water depths and sediment concentration are used to reduce the complexity by assuming that processes will average over time thus ignoring the effects of severe events and variability at short time scales gao et al 2019 ran simulations on deltaic coastal wetlands using both average and high frequency time series as inputs to predict deltaic morphological evolution though overall trends in sedimentation and erosion were similar the use of unsteady input discharges gave more realistic results and allowed a tipping point for delta progradation decline to be detected in this study we explored how use of high frequency time series and short term variability in water levels and ssc from storms and extraordinary events affects wetland vegetation evolution and soil elevation change in a tidal flat we explore a series of scenarios using a previously developed eco geomorphological egm framework breda et al 2021 rodriguez et al 2017 for this purpose we conducted two separate numerical experiments in the first one we compared the results of this simulation of the tidal flat domain against with soil elevation measurements in mangrove saltmarsh and encroachment zones from a site with similar vegetation and tidal conditions rogers et al 2013 in the second experiment we implemented a monte carlo approach to reproduce the variability of water levels and sediment concentration in future years to forecast changes in the vegetation and elevation of the wetland platform over the current century for comparison with the monte carlo approach we ran two extra simulations over the same period using simplified representations of sinusoidal waves and constant ssc as inputs these type of simplified representations of the tidal regime are used commonly in coastal wetland vulnerability assessments breda et al 2021 d alpaos et al 2007 yousefi lalimi et al 2020 to reduce the computational cost the experiments were carried on a hypothetical tidal flat that is representative of the main physical features found in many of south eastern australian coastal wetlands the model parameters and the input data used for the egm correspond to the hunter river estuary this site has been the study area of previous works breda et al 2021 rodriguez et al 2017 rogers et al 2013 sandi et al 2018 some of which have also employed the same egm framework 2 material and methods in the egm framework adopted in this study originally introduced by rodriguez et al 2017 and later modified by breda et al 2021 a hydrodynamic model is used to simulate the tidal regime in the wetlands which is then linked to vegetation characteristics and accretion processes to simulate vegetation establishment or collapse and surface elevation change in this way feedback effects between hydrodynamics vegetation and soil surface elevation change are taken into account for all formulations please refer to supplementary information the hydrodynamic component is a fast 2d inundation model that has been extensively calibrated and validated in different types of wetlands saco et al 2020 sandi et al 2018 2019 sandi et al 2021 while the vegetation sediment transport and accretion components are based on state of the art formulations validated in the hunter river wetlands breda et al 2021 the simulation domain shown in fig 1 represents a hypothetical wetland with the average terrain characteristics found in the hunter river estuary se australia where the hydrodynamic and egm models were calibrated rodriguez et al 2017 the model domain was 250 m wide and 1500 m long discretised into 10x10mcells with a total of 3000 cells the time step used for the solution of the hydrodynamic model was 1 s to ensure numerical stability inputs and outputs for this model are in a 5 min discrete interval which is the same time step used in the sediment transport model the vegetation and soil elevation change models are on a yearly scale and both require the yearly averaged hydroperiod h and depth below mean high tide d as inputs 2 1 water level data the water level time series for the period 2002 to 2020 at the hunter estuary were obtained from waternsw https realtimedata waternsw com au for the stream gauge at hexham bridge id 210448 this station is close to the study area of rodriguez et al 2017 and sandi et al 2018 where the current modelling framework was calibrated the station provides water levels recorded every 15 min periods with gaps or inconsistent data were completed using a harmonic tide model grinsted 2020 fitted to the data 2 2 sediment concentration data series of suspended solids concentrations ssc were retrieved from two satellite products between 2002 and 2011 we adopted the total suspended matter tsm data provided by globcolour http globcolour info which is derived from meris satellite imagery the same method was used to provide average ssc values in a global modelling approach schuerch et al 2018b such datasets have also been implemented in other studies with different levels of accuracy for example ramakrishnan and rajawat 2012 used landsat derived ssc as the initial condition for a hydrodynamic and sediment transport model in the gulf of kachchh india even though the satellite product provided a reasonable concentration map throughout the studied site ssc was consistently underestimated teodoro et al 2007 compared different methods to estimate tsm for three different satellite products but did not find any significant difference between them in general all methods underestimated the in situ data for the hunter estuary meris case 2 derived data turbid waters in estuaries and lagoons near the shore underestimated local ssc rodriguez et al 2017 measurements at the site indicated that values of tsm were unreasonably low for the hunter estuary in the period 2002 to 2011 fig 2 a so we multiplied the meris tsm series by the ratio between in situ ssc measurements 37 g m 3 as reported in rodriguez et al 2017 and the average of 2002 2011 meris data 10 08 g m 3 see fig 2b the second tsm data period between 2018 and 2020 was retrieved from sentinel 2 images using the case 2 regional coastcolour c2rcc brockmann et al 2016 algorithm available in the snap toolbox https step esa int main snap is a desktop application freely distributed by the european space agency esa to manipulate satellite images the sentinel 2 product provides tsm data with a high spatial resolution and a 3 day average revisiting time c2rcc data does not underestimate sediment concentration brockmann et al 2016 besides removing days with high cloud cover no other post processing such as the rescaling was applied to the sentinel 2 tsm data series as this product is well suited for case 2 both series the rescaled meris and the sentinel 2 were aggregated into monthly averages as single measures might be affected by atmospheric conditions and tidal phase raag et al 2013 to verify if the different sources of ssc data are compatible we applied a few statistical tests the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to compare the cumulative distributions of both datasets the probability density functions described by both datasets are not inconsistent p 0 34 a visual comparison fig 3 also shows that both monthly datasets produce similar frequency histograms we also applied a t test and a kruskal wallis test for the mean and median of both samples both tests indicate the mean and median are consistent in both samples p 0 5 2 3 re sampled water level series long term simulations such as continuously simulating a domain with 3000 cells in time steps of 1 s over a period of 100 years are extremely demanding in terms of computational power and storage to avoid such a constraint some studies adopt a simple sinusoidal wave with a given amplitude and frequency that mimics the local average tidal phase best et al 2018 breda et al 2021 marani et al 2010 others take a short period of the year to represent the whole interval dissanayake et al 2012 kirwan and murray 2007 however these approaches remove the effects of short bursts in the water levels from storms and oscillations of the msl due to climate phenomena and ocean currents to verify the importance of including high frequency and short term variability in coastal wetland modelling we adopted a different approach to reduce the simulation time our approach consisted of re sampling the complete time series every four days effectively reducing the series length to one fourth of the original length fig 4 the resampling interval was selected after verifying that the frequency of high water level values was not substantially affected by the procedure we tested different resampling intervals from two to four days obtaining similar results fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a year long time series of water level can be replaced with every four days 75 reduction without losing the variability of the entire year we also compared monthly statistics between full and resampled series for mean tidal range hydroperiod and depth averaged ssc the difference was never higher than 2 while for monthly maximum levels it remains below 4 except for a few cases in which it reached 7 the reduced sampling was successful because the 4 day re sampling interval was substantially shorter than the typical severe storm duration which are the result of complex atmospheric phenomena oeh 2016 and last for longer despite the series reduction the computational time for mc simulations took up to 400 h 2 4 simulation of past storms the first experiment carried out in this work was the simulation of past events series of water levels and ssc between january 2002 and december 2011 were used as input for the egm framework this is the same period monitored in rogers et al 2013 and fortunately the only period with meris s satellite ssc derived data for the hunter river estuary fig 6 shows the monthly average maximum water levels and average sediment concentration during this period severe storms occurred during 2007 and 2011 the surface elevation and vegetation cover in the domain are updated at the end of every year please see the model description in the supplementary information the first is done by adding the accreted amount over the soil elevation followed by a smoothing procedure using a diffusive hillslope model kirkby 1971 to account for the natural redistribution of the sediment lovelock et al 2015a vegetation is updated based on establishment rules given the maximum water depth and the inundated period which also alters the surface roughness we compared the results of this simulation with soil elevation measurements presented in rogers et al 2013 for mangrove saltmarsh and encroachment zones a severe event occurred during this period more precisely in june of 2007 known as the pasha bulker storm oeh 2016 therefore the egm framework s performance in this period indicates its ability to address the effects of such events using the morphological parameters of the wetland as our simulation domain represents a simple wetland platform with the same average conditions as rogers et al 2013 we had to identify regions of the domain that are representative of the soil elevation measurements we divided our wetland into mangrove saltmarsh and transition zones as well as near channel close to inner channel and tidal flat away from inner channel zones 2 5 monte carlo simulation of future wetland conditions the second round of experiments was conducted to assess the effect of intra annual variability in the forecasts provided by the modelling framework using the monte carlo mc method we built 100 synthetic series of 100 year duration each to represent the period between 2000 and 2100 the time series for each year was composed by binding together hourly series for each month that were randomly drawn from the sample of 13 years for that particular month the hourly series for the 13 years of data were re sampled as explained in section 2 3 before applying the procedure in order to reduce computational time this procedure reproduces the seasonal behaviour of the tidal regime parameters and the variations due to severe events in the sediment load additionally mean water levels were increased for each year of the simulation according to slr projections from the rcp8 5 scenario church et al 2013 to represent the effects of a rising sea level two extra simulations using simplified sinusoidal waves were also implemented for comparison against the mc simulations a sinusoidal wave is created with the following equation 01 z w t sin t 2 π λ a 2 m s l where z w is the water level m at time t s λ is the wavelength s a is the wave amplitude m and msl is the local mean sea level m the first simplified series consists of a 12 hour long tidal wave with 1 3 m amplitude which is the average value found in the hunter estuary hexham bridge station as implemented by breda et al 2021 this wave is repeated for a total period of 96 h to ensure that flood and ebb effects are accurately represented over the entire domain the second simplified series consists of a composition of 8 sinusoidal waves as shown in fig 7 a where the wave amplitudes are given by the following sequence of tidal ranges neap 0 5 neap mean mean 0 5 mean spring spring 0 5 spring mean mean 0 5 mean neap both simplified series used a constant sediment input of 37 g m 3 as the local long term average rodriguez et al 2017 the outcomes of the mc simulations were compared with these two reference simulations to clarify the effect of using simplified water level series in the model we analysed the outcomes of the mc simulations through statistical assessment of the distribution of vegetation cover and soil elevation maps with the frequency of mangrove and saltmarsh occurrence were created for different years allowing an analysis of the spatial variability changes over time see supplementary information for the soil elevation analysis we split the domain into near channel and tidal flat regions the first represents the average conditions in the cells located near the inner channel inside the domain more precisely all cells within 50 m of the inner channel the latter represents the area of the domain barely affected by the inner channel and it was comprised by all cells distant from the inner channel at least 150 m 3 results as previously discussed this work was divided into two sets of experiments the first experiment tests the ability of the egm to represent the effect of stormy years in the simulated wetland platform for this we simulated the period from 2002 to 2011 using full length time series of water levels and sediment concentration the second experiment is a monte carlo analysis that reproduces the potential variability of water levels and the effects on long term predictions of coastal wetland vegetation and soil elevation over the current century 3 1 first experiment simulation of past years we analysed the dynamics of simulated vegetation in the domain through yearly vegetation maps the composition presented in fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of wetland vegetation given the establishment conditions based on rodriguez et al 2017 for the hunter estuary se australia between 2002 and 2011 see supplementary information mangrove occurrence in the wetland showed small changes over the entire ten year interval mangrove occupied the lower portion of the tidal flat usually presenting an extension of approximately 400 m on the other hand saltmarsh varied significantly as it showed extensions from 500 m in 2004 2005 to near 1000 m in 2007 and 2011 these results show that the region defined by frequent tidal inundation where mangrove development is optimal is not very sensitive to severe events however the maximum length where saltwater depths provide the conditions for saltmarsh establishment is highly dependent on the occurrence of severe events with the largest saltmarsh extents occurring in years with severe storms 2007 and 2011 see also fig 6 such behaviour agrees with evidence from miller 2020 showing that saltmarsh transgression is much higher during stormy years however the level of variation in the saltmarsh area over the simulated years is probably excessive when compared with a natural migration pattern the thresholds used in the vegetation model to identify the saltmarsh area are associated with conditions where mature well developed marsh species are found and processes related to the colonisation of new regions by saltmarsh are not explicitly included therefore the transgression over freshwater vegetation should be understood as a potential area for saltmarsh establishment rogers et al 2013 collected average elevation changes during this period in both mangrove and saltmarsh areas to compare the elevation change produced by the egm simulations with in situ measurements we identify areas comparable with those where the samples were collected by analysing the dynamics of the simulated vegetation fig 8 the areas designated as mangrove and saltmarsh in fig 9 are those where the simulated vegetation did not change over the simulated period and were used for the comparison with rogers et al 2013 data the transition zone represents areas that change from saltmarsh to mangrove at some point in the simulations while the transgression zone represents freshwater vegetation cells that have been replaced by saltmarsh at some point in the simulations an additional factor to take into account is that elevation change is larger at the margins of the inner channel and decreases with distance as ssc decreases due to settling and sediment entrapment because of this we separate the results for two specific zones the near channel zone consisting of cells within 50 m of the inner channel and the tidal flat zone which corresponds to cells more than 150 m away from the inner channel the plots in fig 10 show the range of elevation change values within each zone for mangrove and saltmarsh areas respectively over the simulated period the mangrove area fig 10a showed an elevation increase between 3 and 41 mm according to the egm model and about 22 mm according to point measurements in the saltmarsh fig 10b the results from the model showed an increase of between 0 and 33 mm while the point measurements showed approximately 14 mm in the same period in both cases the in situ measurements from rogers et al 2013 are within the range of the model results about halfway between maximum and minimum predicted values therefore confirming the model s ability to reproduce accretional processes in the study area one characteristic of the results of this experiment was the increase in the range of elevation change values over time indicating a high spatial variability of elevation change over the domain this is caused by the quick decay of ssc as the flow transitions from the channel to the tidal flat which promotes higher deposition rates at those cells that are closer to the creek this spatial variability is observed in natural wetlands belliard et al 2016 temmerman et al 2004 and other simulations in saltmarsh geng et al 2021 but cannot be captured by the field measurements at a point the severe event of 2007 the pasha bulker storm promoted a noticeable elevation change rate increase in both the mangrove and saltmarsh according to the measurements our modelling results also produce an increase in elevation change rate in both vegetation areas particularly in the near channel zone this is evident by the steep rise after the first storm of the upper boundary of the blue zone in fig 10 in the tidal flat zone the elevation change rate yellow zone is less affected by the severe events with a minor increase in mangroves and almost no change in saltmarsh the same pattern can be observed after the second severe event in 2011 although there is not the same detail of field data to corroborate model results 3 2 second experiment monte carlo simulation of future years in the analysis of mc results we adopted a similar domain division to that used in the past storms experiment given the nature of the mc simulations we refer to the mangrove and saltmarsh areas as those cells where at least 67 of simulations predict mangrove and saltmarsh occurrence respectively the area with cells between 67 and 33 of mangrove occurrence is a transition zone which can be unvegetated mangrove at the seaward end and mangrove saltmarsh at the interface with saltmarsh saltmarsh also has transition zones where cells have 67 to 33 of saltmarsh occurrence which are the mangrove saltmarsh zone at the mangrove interface and the saltmarsh freshwater zone at the interface with freshwater vegetation areas with less than 33 occurrence of mangrove or saltmarsh are considered unvegetated or freshwater vegetation we also considered near channel and tidal flat zones in some of the analysis of the results 3 2 1 mangrove and saltmarsh evolution our first examination of the mc outcomes is related to vegetation dynamics more specifically the features that are more impacted by the randomised input series fig 11 shows maps of vegetation class derived from the mc simulations at four different years 2000 2040 2070 and 2100 additionally the vegetation area for each simulation was computed and summarised every 20 years table 1 the vegetation map for the year 2000 fig 11a does not include sea level rise effects and represents the variability obtained by randomly combining the 13 years of available data most of the 100 mc simulations present mangrove in the first 400 m of the domain and saltmarsh from approximately 500 m to 900 m from the tidal creek table 1 shows a very similar area for these two vegetation types in the year 2000 the transition zone i e where mangrove and saltmarsh frequencies are almost even is no longer than 70 m while the saltmarsh freshwater transition zone is about 20 m long over most of the first half of the century slr drives vegetation expansion upslope in both mangrove and saltmarsh but does not cause significant losses in the lower areas as we can see in fig 11b by 2040 the upstream mangrove margin moves to 500 m from the tidal creek in the near channel zone and a little bit further in the tidal flat zone the transition zone mangrove saltmarsh is narrower than in year 2000 the transgression of the wetland towards the freshwater area occurs at about 1000 m from the tidal creek over a strip 60 m long according to table 1 the mangrove and saltmarsh area increased 29 and 15 respectively compared to the values of the year 2000 in the second half of the century the wetland vegetation initially close to the msl starts to drown as observed for the year 2070 in fig 11c the lower areas 100 to 200 m from the tidal creek are converted to unvegetated areas a transition zone at the unvegetated mangrove interface varies from 50 m in the near channel zone to 200 m at the tidal flat zone mangrove areas are found between 100 and 700 m in the near channel zone and between 350 and 750 m in the tidal flat zone which corresponds to a 4 loss compared to the values of year 2040 table 1 transition mangrove saltmarsh has a near constant extent of 50 m occurring around 750 m from the tidal creek by the year 2070 saltmarsh moved further inland but maintained almost the same extension approximately 450 m and consequently the same area as in the year 2040 the extension of the saltmarsh freshwater vegetation transition strip remains at approximately the same value as in the year 2040 by the end of the simulated period all of the area initially occupied by mangroves in the year 2000 is gone fig 11d the unvegetated mangrove transition area extends from 400 to 450 m in the near channel zone and from 600 to 700 m in the tidal flat zone mangrove extent remains roughly the same as in previous years but saltmarsh extent is reduced due to the presence of the upstream edge of the domain 1500 m from the tidal creek which is probably reached by saltmarsh around the year 2080 table 1 by the year 2100 both mangrove and saltmarsh occur only in areas initially occupied by other vegetation in the year 2000 3 2 2 vegetation using simplified water level inputs due to limitations in computational capability many long term simulations use a simplified input condition therefore we compare the mc results based on samples from high resolution data series with two reference simulations using simplified water level series as explained in previous sections these reference simulations use different compositions of sinusoidal waves the first one repeating a single wave with the mean tidal amplitude and the second one including 8 waves with different amplitudes representing neaps and spring tidal cycles in fig 12 we show the vegetation maps for the mc experiment cells with more than 67 occurrence for both mangrove green and saltmarsh yellow in the top chart we overlap this base map with the outcomes from the simulations using the single wave input at the bottom we overlap the mc results with the outcomes from the simulation using the 8 waves composition the years 2060 and 2100 were included in fig 12a and b respectively as they highlight the major differences observed over the entire simulation period in the comparisons for both years we can observe that the one wave approximation tends to better reproduce the seaward limits of the mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation areas while the 8 wave approximation tends to better reproduce the extent and the average position of the mangrove and saltmarsh vegetation areas both approximations considerably underestimate the saltmarsh area also the mc simulations produce a small vegetation gap which is not captured by the single wave and is overestimated by the 8 wave approximation this gap represents areas that are not consistently occupied by mangrove or saltmarsh so they can be transitional or unvegetated i e tidal pools which are common features in estuarine wetlands and are associated with local topography rodriguez et al 2017 the model produces accretion values that are not uniform throughout the domain see next section and in some situations the local topography may lead to inundation conditions that are not suitable for mangrove or saltmarsh due to sea level rise and vegetation migration over time those areas are eventually colonised by mangroves as shown by fig 12 comparing the results using simplified inputs with the mc simulations fig 12 it is clear that the main differences occur in the saltmarsh areas this is because mangrove preference conditions depend on hydroperiod h whereas saltmarsh preference is related to depth below mean high tide d and simplifying the tidal conditions has a greater effect on d than in h 3 2 3 elevation change coastal wetland survival under sea level rise depends on the capacity of the wetland to produce an elevation increase that could mitigate the rising water levels an assessment of how the wetland builds up soil elevation over time is carried out based on the domain average of elevation change within the first 900 m of the domain this distance represents the vegetated wetland area by 2020 which is very close to the average extent of wetland vegetation over the entire simulation period new wetland areas due to migration after 2020 are not considered the results are presented in fig 13 and are classified into near channel zone and the tidal flat zone the results from the reference simulations with simplified tidal inputs are also included in the figure the full range of mean elevation changes in all mc simulations is relatively narrow within 20 of the median value for the near channel zone and 12 for the tidal flat zone the elevation gain in the near channel almost doubles the elevation gain in the tidal flat zone however given that slr reaches 74 cm by 2100 a considerable elevation deficit is expected in all simulations regarding the simplified wave simulations the 8 wave composition shows elevation change values that are very similar to the mc values for almost the entire simulation however the simple one wave input produces only 80 of the mc s median elevation change in the near channel zone and less than 70 of the median in the tidal flat zone to look in more detail at the differences in elevation change in fig 14 we present the elevation change profiles in the near channel and tidal flat zones for the year 2060 the near channel fig 14a and tidal flat fig 14b elevation change profiles differ in shape and magnitude in the near channel zone sediment input is higher and so is the sedimentation amount in the tidal flat zone mangrove accretes more than saltmarsh but in the near channel zone that difference is not as marked the range of values in the mc simulations is wider in the near channel zone than in the tidal flat zone both zones present a characteristic exponential decay in elevation change due to the preferential deposition close to the tidal input creek they also present a localised elevation increase at around 600 m which corresponds to areas previously occupied by saltmarsh with high biomass and thus high accretion capability the 8 wave simulation overestimates mangrove elevation change and underestimates saltmarsh elevation change both in the near channel and the tidal flat zones whereas the single wave underestimates elevation change over the entire wetland except for the lower mangrove areas in the near channel zone for this reason the domain average presented in fig 13 is substantially lower for the single wave simulation than for the other two simulations 4 discussion the experiments carried on in this work used information collected over 13 years in the hunter estuary area to replicate past events and to reproduce its variability while predicting the evolution of coastal wetlands our modelling framework reproduced the temporal trend of soil elevation rates measured in situ between 2002 and 2011 by rogers et al 2013 in agreement with their findings our simulation results indicate that stormy years produce a higher soil elevation rate but over a short time however from the model s perspective the height of settled material added to the wetland soil over a stormy year has little effect on the elevation rates observed in the following years comparisons between sediment deposition and years with high floods in the la plata river estuary schuerch et al 2016 also corroborate this correlation in the same experiment we observed that mangrove is more resilient to storms our results showed little displacement in the mangrove area during the simulated period fig 8 the same was observed by lymburner et al 2020 who accounted for a 2 change in australian mangrove forests using landsat images over the last two decades moreover the largest changes were restricted to the mangroves in tropical zones in the assessment made by eslami andargoli et al 2009 for the mangrove area in moreton bay approximately 600 km north of the hunter estuary a positive correlation between annual rainfall volumes and mangrove inland expansion was found that is also true in our experiment as mangrove moved upslope although by just a few metres in the stormy years simulating the effect of storms on coastal wetlands is a complex task many studies have addressed the impacts of extreme events on mangrove or saltmarsh areas cahoon 2006 leonardi et al 2018 however techniques to model how their magnitude and frequency affect wetland evolution are at an incipient stage one of the main constraints is computational power because storms affect hydrodynamic and sediment transport mechanisms over short time scales whereas changes in the coastal wetland morphology and flora can take years our attempt has been to extend the short time scale effects over many years using mc simulations on a simplified domain with inputs from a re sampling high frequency tidal and sediment inputs we implemented our approach on a high performance computer in order to keep the simulation times within reasonable values by randomising the inter annual variability in water levels and sediment supply through an mc simulation we were able to estimate the uncertainty in model results of wetland vegetation coverage we classified the predictions of the model by areas with a defined vegetation cover more than 67 occurrence and transition areas where more than one vegetation type can occur less than 67 occurrence transition areas have high uncertainty but comprise only 10 of the total wetland area with a slight bias towards the saltmarsh transitions the percentage of those uncertain areas increased when we simulated wetland evolution due to the effects of slr using the median value of the rcp8 5 pathway in this century the percentage increased to about 15 20 towards the second half of the century when the mangrove seaward margin started retreating in terms of overall results the model predicts an even split of wetland area between mangrove and saltmarsh at the beginning of the century during the first half of the century mangrove areas increase by 29 and saltmarsh areas by 15 associated with inland migration after that period more rapid retreat at the seaward end of mangroves and limited capacity for saltmarsh to migrate upstream produces reductions of wetland areas to values close to the initial year 2000 values the literature about wetland vulnerability assessment usually takes different rates of slr to include some degree of uncertainty in the outcomes khojasteh et al 2021 lovelock et al 2015b schuerch et al 2018b but uncertainty due to natural variability is seldom considered using a large wetland vulnerability assessment model schuerch et al 2018b estimated coastal wetland gain loss worldwide considering different slr and scenarios for space to accommodate migration among all different conditions most of the predictions presented a change of about 20 in the coastal wetland area by the year 2100 however for the highest slr scenario this range was from 30 to 60 our simulation shows that the mean wetland area in the hunter estuary would increase by 20 until 2070 and then decline to values close to the initial condition by 2100 table 1 although of course at a different position and vegetation composition lovelock et al 2015b also projected the submergence for mangroves in the indo pacific region using contemporaneous surface elevation rates in conditions similar to those adopted in this study their model predicts total submergence by 2100 or later in our case total wetland submergence does not occur as the wetland is able to continue migrating however if we reduce the size of our wetland to 900 m and stop migration we find that the wetland submerges by the end of the century which is in agreement with rodriguez et al 2017 for vegetation loss in the hunter estuary upslope migration of both wetland vegetation types showed a clear correlation with the rate of slr on average we observed 2 5 m year 1 over the first four decades slr 5 mm year 1 and nearly 10 m year 1 in the last three decades when the slr rate was around 10 mm year 1 kirwan et al 2016b used a non linear model to predict marsh extension or contraction as a function of slr ssc and terrain slope for conditions of mean ssc and bottom slope similar to those found in our simulated domain they also obtained 2 5 m year 1 for a slr of 5 mm year 1 however under a slr of 10 mm year 1 the vegetation loss at the seaward edge was faster than the transgression upstream resulting in marsh reduction of about of 2 5 m year 1 reed et al 2020 used a large scale regional ecogeomorphological model to investigate the most probable causes of marsh loss on louisiana s coast usa they tiled up a 6 year long series of observed inputs to build a 50 year long series and use it as input along with three different trajectories of slr for a medium rate of slr excessive inundation and marsh edge erosion equate to 70 of saltmarsh loss for our case saltmarsh loss was exclusively due to mangrove encroachment if we had considered a domain 900 m long to avoid migration the saltmarsh loss in the first 50 years would be approximately a third of the initial area which is similar to the saltmarsh loss estimated by reed et al 2020 our mc simulation introduced the uncertainty due to natural variations in the water levels and sediment concentration which are the product of tides as well as storm events other studies also assessed the variability in their model outputs due to uncertainty in some inputs or in the model s parameters chu agor et al 2011 used an mc simulation to verify which factors inputs and parameters had more impact on the variability of wetland areas predicted by the slamm model at the beginning of the simulation while slr is low the error in the bottom elevation dominated the output variability up to 99 of the model s dispersion however with the increase of msl and consequent reduction of wetland elevation the number of factors controlling variations in the output increased they found that accretion sedimentation rates and the rate of slr produced most of the wetland area variability later in the simulation clough et al 2016 also assessed slamm s prediction uncertainty for marshes in new york state regarding marsh area the 90 confidence limit was within 3 of the mean value in the first year 2010 by 2040 this interval grew to 6 of the mean value increasing even more over the following years until it reached 48 by 2100 the authors also recognized the rate of slr as the primary driver of variability in the output and availability of space to accommodate migration as the principal marsh loss reduction factor in sum compared with our findings natural variability in the water levels and sediment introduces a level of uncertainty that is less than the uncertainty introduced by the rate of slr but it is of a comparable magnitude in terms of the ability of simplified wave simulations to reproduce results that include the natural variability of water levels and sediment supply an 8 wave simplification including neap tidal range mean tidal range and spring tidal range performs notably better than a single wave with mean tidal range including the different tidal ranges incorporates some of the variability in the inputs however it does not incorporate the variability due to storms the 8 wave results capture the mean position and migration of mangrove and saltmarsh areas and the overall wetland surface elevation change the single wave model commonly used in many predictions of wetland evolution underestimates saltmarsh migration as well as overall wetland elevation change capacity in this study we focused on how the natural variability in water levels and sediment concentration inside the estuary affect the outcomes of the wetland s predicting model the impacts of climate change are primarily assessed by including an slr scenario rcp 8 5 church et al 2013 in the simulation sea level rise is by far the most cited phenomenon when addressing the fate of coastal wetlands cahoon and guntenspergen 2010 day et al 2008 michener et al 1997 a resilient coastal wetland is that one capable to sustain vertical growth thus tolerating disturbances with minor deterioration cahoon and guntenspergen 2010 throughout our results analyses slr will force the vegetation to migrate upslope as the rate of slr will surpass the wetland s capability of building up soil elevation it is quite uncertain when this breakpoint will be reached i e rate of slr accretion rate although they are likely to occur at the beginning of the second half of the current century nevertheless climate change will also modify the intensity and frequency of severe storms and the fluxes in the nutrient cycle day et al 2008 that is likely to alter the vegetation health and its composition which in turn can impact the wetland s accretional capacity 5 conclusions two simulation experiments were conducted to highlight how modelled vegetation evolution and soil elevation change are affected by the short term variability in observed input series of water levels and sediment concentration data that account for short term variability in the first experiment the framework reproduced in situ measurements of wetland elevation for a site on the se australian coast over the ten year long simulated period the outcomes produced the same variations as the observed data including the effects of extreme storms in the second experiment an mc simulation was conducted to reproduce the variability observed in estuarine water level and sediment concentration into the model s inputs and to analyse how such variability affects long term predictions from the observational data we generated 100 realisations of 100 years and performed simulations between 2000 and 2100 on each of them considering a slr of 74 cm rcp 8 5 at the end of the century a significant variation was found in the model results for the wetland vegetation area especially for saltmarsh while mean soil elevation change showed a moderate variability however the uncertainty ranges due to water levels and ssc variability found in this study are lower than those found in the literature regarding the rate of slr nevertheless their effects are far from being negligible we did not include in our predictions any increase in storm intensity and or frequency due to climate change which most likely increase the levels of uncertainty some coastal wetland assessments use a sinusoidal wave or a short period of a real observed series to represent the year average tidal regime we carried out two simulations using repetition of simple sinusoidal waves and constant ssc inputs to address the difference between these approaches to the mc outcomes one with the single mean tidal range and one that included neap mean and spring tidal ranges changes in the vegetation area showed similar patterns for all the simulations although each case presented a particular feature for example sinusoidal waves could not reproduce the entire length of the saltmarsh extension but successfully reproduced the extent of mangroves the surface elevation change in the simulation using a single wave with the mean tidal amplitude showed considerable underestimation while minor discrepancies were observed using the composition of multiple tidal ranges therefore this last representation can be considered a viable alternative to conducting a more general analysis of wetland vulnerability credit

2957,standardized drought indices such as the standardized precipitation index spi or the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei are frequently used around the world to assess drought severity across a continent or a larger region covering different meteorological regimes but how standard are these standardized indices in this paper we quantify the uncertainty of spi and spei based on an austrian dataset to shed light on what are the main sources of uncertainty in the study area five factors that either defy the control of the analyst record length observation period or need to be subjectively decided during the steps of the calculation choice of the distribution parameter estimation method and gof test of the fitted distribution are considered we use the root mean squared error e r m s for estimating the typical error for different calculation algorithm of spi and spei the total and relative uncertainty components for each factor are analysed by a linear mixed model lmm and significance of each model parameter are tested by the akaike information criterion aic and the restricted likelihood ratio test the e r m s indicates that computational variations of standardized drought indices lead to highly variable results from the lmm the choice of the distribution and the observational window are the most important sources of uncertainty they on average control between 19 and 63 choice of distribution and 24 to 70 observation period of the total variance of the spi across all stations and month of the year with similar values observed for the spei the parameter estimation method and the gof tests however have almost no effect on the standardized indices total errors and observation period uncertainty are typically decreasing with the record length as one would expect while the distribution uncertainty is almost independent from the record length an additional assessment shows that the uncertainties are similar at the pan european scale leading to uncertain characterizations of major events such as the drought of 2015 overall the uncertainty of standardized drought indices is substantial alternative approaches as nonparametric methods ensemble approaches or probability based indices based on established methods of extreme value statistics should be considered to make the indices more accurate keywords drought uncertainty assessment linear mixed model spi spei data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is a creeping natural phenomenon with highly destructive power which unfolds their impacts on different temporal and spatial scales several studies showed the enormous financial costs droughts are causing this is because drought events have a wide range of impacts such as food shortages loss of hydropower production and wildfires mishra and singh 2010 spinoni et al 2016 thus affecting many water related sectors there is no single definition of drought but four types of drought are often distinguished meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic drought droughts are basically triggered by a lack of precipitation but are also dependent on e g soil moisture physiogeographic characteristics evapotranspiration snow accumulation or human activities wilhite and glantz 1985 to inform monitoring and forecasting systems over a hundred drought indices have been developed which differ in the variables used for drought characterization and in the level of complexity mishra and singh 2010 one frequently used index is the spi invented by mckee et al 1993 proposed as the standardized drought index by the wmo 2006 and recommended as universal meteorological drought index by the lincoln declaration hayes et al 2011 the popularity of the spi is founded in the simplicity of the calculation procedure and the perceived spatial comparability of index values cheval 2015 therefore the spi is used for drought detection and projection spinoni et al 2016 bachmair et al 2015 lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 hannaford et al 2011 and is part of monitoring systems like the european drought centre edc stahl et al 2016 the national drought mitigation centre ndmc svoboda et al 2002 or the european drought observatory edo an extension to the spi is the spei which accounts for evapotranspiration deficits by using the climatic water balance as data input vicente serrano et al 2010 spi and spei are based on the same modelling framework which can also be found in e g the standardized streamflow index ssi shukla and wood 2008 or the reconnaissance drought index rdi tsakiris et al 2007 so that these indices are often referred to as standardized drought indices sdis the basic idea of sdis is to accumulate monthly data e g precipitation climatic water balance runoff to different aggregation periods of m months m 1 2 3 fit a parametric distribution and transform the resulting probabilities to the quantiles of the standardized normal distribution with x n 0 1 however there is no overall agreement on the calculation steps for these sdi and results are strongly affected by different modelling setups a basic modelling framework for the spi is given by guttman 1999 or vicente serrano et al 2010 for the spei these approaches inherit several uncertainties e g choice of distribution method of parameter estimation sample size observation period different goodness of fit tests gof tests or sampling uncertainty comparisons of parametric distributions for sdis have been performed in a number of studies including e g stagge et al 2015 angelidis et al 2012 lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 sienz et al 2012 wang et al 2019 svensson et al 2017 pieper et al 2020 where for europe the gamma distribution was found to be most adequate for the spi but with the restriction to higher accumulation periods j 6 in contrast sienz et al 2012 or pieper et al 2020 suggested using weibull type distributions whereas svensson et al 2017 found that for the uk the 3 and 4 parameter kappa distributions were most appropriate apart from such parametric approaches the sdi methodology was extended to nonparametric approaches e g farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 soľáková et al 2014 vidal et al 2010 tijdeman et al 2020 with the intention to minimize the sensitivity of the sdi regarding the choice of the distribution selection of the best distribution is often done by goodness of fit tests gof tests and their rejection rate i e the count of time series rejected by the specific gof test examples include the anderson darling ad kolmogorov smirnov ks cramer von mises cm chi square cs and shapiro wilk test blain and meschiatti 2015 stagge et al 2015 hu et al 2015 sienz et al 2012 blain et al 2018 stedinger 1993 underlined that such tests are not capable to identify the true or best distribution among several alternatives as their purpose is to reject a theoretical distribution when deviations of the sample are large compared to sampling uncertainty furthermore vlček and huth 2009 showed the inappropriate use of the ks test for daily precipitation by applying a gamma distribution compared to the more suitable lilliefors test lilliefors 1967 and angelidis et al 2012 showed that most distributions are rejected at a 99 significance level another approach of evaluation is performed by blain et al 2018 who is using the mean absolute error mae for comparing maximum likelihood and l moments to estimate distribution parameters or by use of l moments ratio diagrams vicente serrano et al 2010 vergni et al 2017a parameter estimation for sdi is mostly performed by maximum likelihood methods of moments or l moments approaches studies indicate that the parameter uncertainty of the distribution can be reduced by using time series with 40 60 years of records for obtaining stable estimates at the centre of the distribution and 70 80 years for stability at the tails of the distribution e g guttman 1999 wang et al 2021 zhang and li 2020 mahmoudi et al 2019 for comparison mckee et al 1993 had proposed a sample size of at least 30 years for approximately correct parameter estimation sampling uncertainty was also examined using nonparametric bootstrapping methods to generate confidence intervals for the spi e g vergni et al 2017b hu et al 2015 a similar approach was adopted by carbone et al 2018 to study the combined effect of the observation period and outliers on the spi they found that shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution are stable for a sample size greater than 60 years whereas the errors are substantially increasing for shorter observation periods recently more studies focused on the effect of the observation period on the uncertainty of sdi values paulo et al 2016 described changes in the gamma distribution in respect to changing observation period and wu et al 2005 found that the spi is sensitive to observation periods if precipitation pattern changes other approaches considered varying data input for calculation of sdi as an uncertainty hoffmann et al 2020 borona et al 2021 and in respect to climate change the effect of non stationarity becomes increasingly important kwon and sung 2019 cammalleri et al 2022 stagge et al 2017 reported a divergence of drought frequency and intensity for spi and spei due to increasing temperature additionally also the calculation of the potential evapotranspiration can be seen as a source of uncertainty beguería et al 2014 most studies focusing on an uncertainty analysis of standardized drought indices either considered only one single uncertainty or did not quantify all uncertainties of sdi computation simultaneously in one framework e g tijdeman et al 2020 hoffmann et al 2020 zhang and li 2020 hence this paper aims to fill in this research gap by performing a consistent analysis of uncertainty components related to each calculation step of a sdi using a linear mixed model lmm the results shall be indicative of the influence of modelling decisions for drought detection based on the sdi the paper addresses three major research questions what are the typical errors of spi and spei do different choices of the modeller significantly alter spi spei values what are the main sources of uncertainty 2 methodology 2 1 spi and spei calculation 2 1 1 standardized precipitation index spi the spi was introduced by mckee et al 1993 for a simplistic categorization of drought and wet spells several studies showed the usefulness of the spi to detect droughts and its straightforward and simplistic approach made it popular in various fields the spi is calculated by first summing up monthly precipitation data over i monthly accumulation periods with i typically taking values of 1 to 12 the accumulated precipitation data are split in 12 annual time series one for each month and each time series is fitted by a univariate parametric distribution finally the probabilities of the fitted data are then transformed into quantiles of a standard normal distribution with mean 0 μ 0 and variance 1 σ 1 these standardized anomalies are often used for drought categorization such as using thresholds as introduced by mckee et al see table 1 whereas it is less common to use wet anomalies to categorize floods the reference spi of this study is based on an approach by guttman 1999 precipitation data is summed up for accumulation periods of 1 3 6 and 12 months afterwards a gamma distribution is fitted to the accumulated precipitation series of the same month or season using an l moments estimator hosking 1990 l moments are a robust method for parameter estimation which is preferred to more outlier sensitive estimation methods such as methods of moments or maximum likelihood estimation if zero precipitation is present in the data this is handled by the approach of stagge et al 2015 using the averaged probabilities of the weibull plotting position for estimating the probability of zero precipitation defining the probability distribution by 1 p x p 0 1 p 0 f x p 0 α β x 0 n p 0 1 2 n 1 x 0 with f being f x p 0 α β the gamma distribution with α as shape parameter and β as scale parameter p 0 is the probability of zero precipitation by p 0 n p 0 n 1 and n p 0 is the number of zero precipitation events in the observation period in this study zero precipitation is only occurring for an accumulation period of one month in our study the basic approach for the spi is reversed to calculate a reference precipitation corresponding to a given spi this reference precipitation is used as input for an ensemble of spi estimates based on a range of model choices and parameter settings the workflow of the calculation approach is exemplified in fig 1 in a first step the reference spi value is transformed to a probability score by using the standard normal cumulative distribution function shown in fig 1a for example this yields a probability of 0 16 for a reference spi of 1 in the second step the probability score is entered into the quantile function of the fitted gamma distribution to calculate the associated reference precipitation event to assess the full range of spi values a set of reference precipitation values corresponding to a reference spi from 3 to 3 in increments of 0 2 are processed and converted into spi estimates this procedure is performed for every station every month and four different accumulation periods the main focus of the analyses will be on a reference spi value of 2 which is often regarded a threshold for extreme drought events mckee et al 1993 and is therefore an important parameter for drought detection and drought management decisions a similar approach will be used for the spei as explained below 2 1 2 standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei the spei uses the advantages of the spi e g different time scales better comparability in time and space but vicente serrano et al 2010 added evapotranspiration as additional information to account for the sensitivity of droughts to evaporation and temperature the spei is calculated as the spi but uses not only precipitation but the climatic water balance which is the difference between precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet on i month accumulation periods pet can be modelled in various ways the suggested method is penman monteith allen et al 1998 which needs several variables as humidity or water vapour pressure that are not available for this study as only mean temperature is provided by sufficient stations of the histalp network auer et al 2007 we choose the simple thornthwaite 1948 method to calculate pet which was also suggested by vicente serrano et al 2010 it has to be mentioned that different methodological approaches for pet calculations would be an additional uncertainty of the spei beguería et al 2014 stagge et al 2014 but as this is not a matter of the underlying statistical procedure this uncertainty component was excluded in the analysis after the computation of the climatic water balance on different aggregation periods the data is fitted to a parametric distribution and the probabilities are transformed into a quantile of the standard normal distribution to obtain the spei value similar to the spi we are defining a basic spei approach by computing reference climatic water balance values as inputs for each time series we are using the three parametric log logistic distribution as reference distribution parameters are estimated by l moments following the approach proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 furthermore the uncertainty components for the spei are also focusing on a reference spei value of 2 as for the spi 2 2 uncertainty assessment the uncertainty assessment of this study consists of several steps which are summarized in fig 2 our study design includes 43 stations for the calculation of the spi n s p i 43 and 25 stations for the computation of the spei n s p e i 25 an initial decision to be made when calculating a standardized drought index is the choice of the aggregation period in this study we consider four different accumulation periods for this purpose each of the single time series is aggregated within a moving window of 1 3 6 and 12 months m 4 number of different accumulation periods leading to four aggregated time series at each station finally these time series are split up to derive annual series for each calendar month the dataset consists now of 2064 n s p i m 12 time series for the spi and 1200 n s p e i m 12 for the spei the uncertainties are calculated individually for each time series and will be further analysed by a linear mixed model in the following sections we describe the different sources of uncertainty analysed in this study and the method for their estimation 2 2 1 sources of uncertainty the spi and spei values are not exact as they depend on a number of choices made by the user five different uncertainties are considered to contribute to the variation of the drought indices sample size observation period choice of distribution parameter estimation and gof the first source of uncertainty is the sample size and the second is the observation period both are statistically dependent from each other hence we used three different model setups to incorporate both effects analysing the three setups is tantamount with performing our analyses over three concurrent models whose results are either contrasted with each other or summarized to yield an overall assessment of all sources of uncertainty the first model setup includes four observational windows with 30 years each as this is usually considered to be sufficient for calculation of the spi hayes et al 2011 mckee et al 1993 proposed 50 to 60 years for the observation period for a more robust estimation therefore the second setup is using two 60 year windows the last model setup analyses the effect of reduced sample size to the uncertainty of the spi by differentiating between 6 20 year windows meschiatti and blain 2016 the chosen time windows are not overlapping to avoid linear dependencies and their total length corresponds to the observation period 1897 to 2016 the number of levels for the observation period are either 2 4 or 6 i 2 4 6 the third uncertainty component is defined by the selection of the distribution used to fit the precipitation or climatic water balance data this issue is presented in many studies regarding the best suited distribution mainly quantified by the rejection rate of distributions due to various tests for model evaluation in this study eight different distributions were tested for the spi that were used in literature gamma normal log normal logistic log logistic weibull generalized extreme value gev and pearson iii distribution e g stagge et al 2015 svensson et al 2017 for the spei five distributions were analysed normal generalized logistic gev pearson iii generalized log normal e g stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2010 only two three parameter distributions are tested for the spi gev and pearson iii because two parameter distributions have shown sufficient results in previous studies the number of levels j for the choice of distribution is 8 for the spi and respectively 5 for the spei each of these distributions are fitted to every time window of our initial model setup the last two sources of uncertainty are the parameter estimation method and the use of a gof test three different approaches k 3 for estimating the parameters of the distributions are considered maximum likelihood estimation mle methods of moments mom and l moment lm finally the suitability of each distribution was tested by checking final spi spei values for normality by application of the shapiro wilk test sw shapiro and wilk 1965 as this is used in most spi studies the sw test is performed on a 5 significance level and was chosen because of its higher power razali et al 2011 when the test statistic was in the critical region p value lower than 0 05 the respective distribution was rejected the resulting model ensemble of well fitted distributions was finally compared to the full model ensemble to assess the uncertainty component of using gof tests or not l 2 if spi spei values outside the range of 6 to 6 were estimated for a reference precipitation we excluded the specific model outcome for the analysis testing the fit of the specific distribution was not considered in this study as tests like anderson darling or kolmogorov smirnov need extensive simulation of their critical values for non normal distributions if parameters are estimated of the data each possible calculation path given by the combination of calculation varieties described above returns a spi spei value calculated for a reference value of 2 all possible variations t for each model setup can be calculated by 2 t j k l m this results in 192 final spi values for model setup 1 96 for model setup 2 and 288 for model setup 3 the respective numbers for the spei are 120 60 and 180 all three models setups are calculated for all 2064 and 1200 time series of spi and spei 2 2 2 uncertainty estimation and attribution this study estimates the uncertainty of spi and spei values by three different approaches these uncertainty assessments are based on a vector y which is defined by all possible variations of spi spei values for a given reference precipitation climatic water balance value of a specific time series and one of the three model setups calculated by the approach described in section 2 1 1 in a first step we want to calculate the typical error of spi and spei for each individual time series considering that we calculate the deviations of y to the reference value y r e f which is the spi spei value of the given reference precipitation or climate water balance by 3 y e r r y y r e f the typical error is then quantified by a root mean squared error e r m s 4 e r m s t t y e r r t 2 t in a next step we aim to quantify the contribution of the sources of uncertainty section 2 2 1 to the individual uncertainties across the study area the uncertainty contributions are quantified by two additional metrics relative uncertainty and total uncertainty that are calculated by a linear mixed model lmm fisher 1919 henderson 1973 in this approach each source of uncertainty is modelled as a random effect while only the overall mean of the model is assumed to be a fixed effect therefore we can use a formulation of the lmm for random effects only which can be written as 5 y e r r b 0 z 1 b 1 z s b s ϵ where b 0 is the model intercept ϵ is the error term with zero mean and residual variance σ ϵ 2 z 1 z s are the design matrices of each random effect with the random effect parameters b 1 b s each of them normally distributed with zero mean and variance σ s 2 in our study the random effects correspond to our five sources of uncertainty s 5 the variance of the random effect is determined as the between variance of the effects and the residual variance σ ϵ 2 is the within variance model estimation is performed by restricted maximum likelihood reml patterson and thompson 1971 harville 1977 reml separates fixed and random effects and gives an unbiased estimate of the random effects by avoiding negative variance components significance of each random parameter is tested by an exact restricted likelihood ratio test rlrt greven et al 2008 and a stepwise regression approach where each parameter is dropped and then compared to the full model ordinary likelihood ratio tests are not sufficient in this case as the models are tested for zero variance which should be asymptotically approached by a 0 5 x 0 2 0 5 x 1 2 x 0 means a point mass in 0 distribution but studies show large deviations from this assumption scheipl et al 2008 therefore we apply a method where the null distribution is approached by simulations crainiceanu and ruppert 2004 scheipl et al 2008 greven et al 2008 the test is implemented in r by the software package rlrsim rlrt significance is reached for a p value below 0 01 additionally models are compared by the akaike information criterion a i c akaike 1974 to analyse the significance of individual parameters at different stations the aic can be written as 6 a i c 2 k 2 l n l ˆ where k is the number of model parameters and l ˆ is the estimated reml loglikelihood of the model a model parameter is denoted significant if the aic value without the specific model parameter is higher or equal than the full model each source of uncertainty is quantified by the variance components σ s 2 of the s th random effect estimation of variance components is often based on an analysis of variance anova framework e g parajka et al 2016 von storch and zwiers 2001 which is not possible in the context of a linear mixed model as only the fixed effects would be evaluated our variance components σ s 2 are estimated in r by the lme4 package bates et al 2015 calculation of relative variance components is based on an approach by nakagawa and schielzeth 2013 johnson 2014 and nakagawa et al 2017 for the s th effect the individual relative uncertainty components η s can then be obtained by 7 η s σ s 2 s 1 s σ s 2 σ e 2 σ d 2 η s is the explained variance of the s th effect and in this study termed the relative variance components σ s 2 are the variance components of the s th effect σ ϵ 2 is the residual variance which can be further expressed as the sum of additive dispersion σ e 2 and distribution specific variance σ d 2 the residual variance component η ϵ is finally estimated by 8 η ϵ σ ϵ 2 s 1 s σ s 2 σ e 2 σ d 2 finally we can denote the total variance σ 2 and respectively the standard deviation σ of each model by 9 σ 2 s 1 s σ s 2 σ e 2 σ d 2 in our ensemble approach the total and relative variance components σ s 2 η s corresponding to the five sources of uncertainty observation period parameter estimation selection of distribution gof test interaction of parameter estimation and selection of distribution and the residual terms σ ϵ 2 and η ϵ are calculated at each station separately for each month of the year for four different accumulation periods m 1 3 6 12 and all three model setups 3 data the uncertainty of standardized drought indices is analysed based on precipitation data of 43 stations spread over austria of which 25 exhibit temperature records as well the stations correspond to the full set of long term stations provided by the zentralanstalt für meteorologie und geodynamik zamg in their histalp network auer et al 2007 these stations have at least a minimum observation period of 120 years and have been in operational use until 2018 all time series were pre processed auer et al 2007 and have no missing values for the dataset annual precipitation ranges from 493 mm to a maximum of 1793 mm at bad ischl fig 3 for each station and each year the seasonal precipitation peak is mostly in july with some exceptions in august and one in june and october respectively for monthly precipitation aggregates zero values occur at all but one station and the maximum number of months with zero precipitation per station is 16 accumulation periods greater than one month do not exhibit any zero precipitation values within the study area austria appears an ideal test because it is climatically diverse and the long precipitation time series allow us to analyse the relative effects of observation periods and sample sizes nevertheless we will discuss the relevance of the results for a broader range of climates in an additional pan european assessment focusing on the drought event of 2015 ionita et al 2017 where the analyses are based on the e obs dataset haylock et al 2008 4 results 4 1 expected error we were first interested in the expected uncertainty of the standardized drought indices spi and spei we therefore calculated the e r m s of each variation of spi spei values obtained by the various calculation approaches using eq 4 this resulted in 6192 e r m s s for the spi and 3600 e r m s s for the spei fig 4 shows the overall distributions of these e r m s values the corresponding average yielded expected errors of 0 38 for the spi and 0 55 for the spei these values were used to calculate approximate 95 tolerance intervals of the standardized drought indices arising from the various calculation methods the tolerance interval reflects the spread of calculated vales around the true value of the standardized drought index as a consequence all values within the tolerance interval cannot be distinguished from each other as their difference may arise from calculation errors only in case of an spi value of 2 the 95 tolerance interval ranged from 2 76 to 1 24 which is quite large compared to the categories used for classifying the severity of a drought event table 1 an even larger spread could be observed for the spei where the 95 tolerance interval ranged from 3 1 to 0 9 comparing these confidence bounds to the drought classes of table 1 we noticed that an event with a true spi of 2 could be either classified as extreme severe or only moderate drought depending on the calculation method chosen in the case of the spei the spread of possible drought classification was even larger as it included even the mild drought case clearly the expected error of the spi and spei calculations is substantial and the various calculation methods may result in different drought management decisions breaking down the results to single uncertainties the e r m s declined for greater sample sizes as one would expect furthermore the difference between the e r m s of the spi and spei was getting narrower for sample sizes of 60 years however the e r m s could give us only a first impression of the expected error in the next section we employed a linear mixed model to assess individual uncertainty contributions in more detail 4 2 significance of model parameters a lmm according to eq 5 was fitted for each drought index a first indication of the importance of each effect was obtained by examining their significances based on the rlrt and the aic a useful measure of the regional significance level is the percentage of stations where a considered model parameter is significant the results are presented in tables 2 and 3 in general the aic yielded a higher percentage of significant stations than the rlrt this holds for both drought indices spi and spei in both cases the distribution selection and the observation period were highly significant whereas the parameter estimation and the gof test had low significance rates we identified three main differences in the significance rates between spi and spei first of all the distribution was significant in almost every model of the spi but only in 45 to 86 of the spei models second the significance rates for the observation period were increasing with larger observational windows for the spei but decreasing for the spi finally the interaction term between the distribution and parameter estimation was more significant for the spi than for the spei 4 3 relative uncertainty contributions next we were interested to quantify the variance contributions of the five sources of uncertainty considered in this study a measure of their relative effect size is the η s eq 7 recalling the low significance rates for gof tests these were also reflected in the relative variance components η s figs 5 and 6 as they were near zero for both drought indices similar patterns were shown by the η s of the parameter estimation method which were on average below 1 the interaction term between selection of the distribution and parameter estimation method was small in most lmms of spi and spei but was slightly higher in case of a one month accumulation period this effect additionally increased with larger observational windows and reached values of 5 79 spi and 6 85 spei for 60 years records the main sources of uncertainty were the observation period and the choice of the distribution the selection of the distribution for spi and spei showed a decreasing η s for larger accumulation periods and an increasing η s for longer observational windows overall the η s of the distribution selection was on average higher for all variations of the spi than of the spei the relative uncertainty of the observation period was increasing with larger accumulation periods and decreasing with increasing sample size considering the spi the observation period was the dominant source of uncertainty for a 20 year observational window but for 60 years the selection of the distribution was the main source of uncertainty although the main pattern of the two relevant sources of uncertainty were similar for spi and spei the observational window was the dominant source of uncertainty for the spei over the selection of the distribution in all but one variation 60 years of observation and 1 month accumulation period additionally the residual variance component η ϵ diverged for spi and spei on average η ϵ was between 8 and 10 for the spi but significantly higher for spei models which had a η ϵ of about 24 for 20 years of observation decreasing to 18 for a 60 year observational window for a better understanding of the differences in the uncertainty of spi and spei we had to take a closer look to the total uncertainty components 4 4 absolute uncertainty contributions so far we have seen that different estimation methods lead to a large variability in final drought values parameter tests and relative uncertainty components have indicated that there are two main sources of uncertainty selection of the distribution and the length of the observation period in a next step we quantified the variance components σ s 2 and the residual variance σ ϵ 2 in absolute terms to obtain a quantitative estimate of the errors attributed to individual choices to be made when calculating the standardized drought index results were additionally specified by the standard deviation σ s as this metric is better comparable to our initial e r m s and the scale of the drought index figs 7 and 8 show the variance components for each station bar averaged over all months the model parameters gof test parameter estimation method and the interaction between distribution and parameter estimation method were very small and therefore not considered in the further analysis we first looked at total variance σ 2 of our models to analyse the overall trend for different accumulation periods and different sample sizes averaged over all models σ 2 was 0 19 for the spi and 0 39 for the spei the corresponding averaged standard deviation σ was 0 44 for the spi and 0 62 for the spei which was similar to the expected value of the e r m s section 4 1 spi 0 38 spei 0 55 by analysing the e r m s we had already seen that the expected error decreased with longer observational windows the lmm allowed us to analyse this effect in quantitative terms based on the variance components for this purpose we averaged σ 2 and σ s 2 over all stations months and all four accumulation periods fig 9 shows these average total variance σ 2 and average variance components σ s 2 in respect to different sample sizes when increasing the observation period from 20 to 60 years the standard deviation σ dropped significantly from 0 51 σ 2 0 26 to 0 34 σ 2 0 12 for the spi and from 0 72 σ 2 0 52 to 0 47 σ 2 0 22 for the spei however with regard to choice of the distribution longer observational windows had no effect spi or only a marginal effect spei on the respective variance components this means that the choice of the distribution is a source of uncertainty that is inherent in the drought index and not an effect of sampling uncertainty and this uncertainty is somewhat higher for the spi than for the spei but in any case the results suggest that using 60 years of observation and more can significantly reduce the uncertainty of the drought index the gained accuracy when using such long observation periods can again be illustrated by the reduced tolerance interval of the drought index in case of a true drought index value of 2 the 95 tolerance interval ranged from 2 68 to 1 32 observation period of 20 years 3 03 to 0 97 for the spi and 2 94 to 1 06 3 44 to 0 56 for the spei which were significant reductions compared to an observation period of 20 years however the uncertainty was still large compared to the categories used for drought severity classification table 1 and the resulting drought classifications were still inaccurate focusing on the effect of different accumulation periods results showed decreasing uncertainties for the spi with larger aggregation periods and no such trend for the spei in more detail the σ 2 decreased by 0 06 from 0 24 σ 0 49 for 1 month to 0 18 σ 0 42 for 12 months for the spi most of the gained accuracy was obtained by increasing the aggregation period from 1 to 3 month whereas longer aggregation periods did not further reduce the uncertainties for the spei the total variance varied randomly between 0 37 σ 0 61 and 0 41 σ 0 64 and showed no systematic trend along the accumulation periods this can be explained by the decreasing uncertainty of the distribution being outweighed by the increasing uncertainty of the observation period in contrast different accumulation periods did not influence σ s 2 of the observation period for the spi resulting in the net reduction of the uncertainty described above the variance components of the distribution were thereby reduced by 0 06 for the spi and 0 05 for the spei along the increasing aggregation period 5 discussion 5 1 sources of uncertainty in the context of literature in this study we proposed a new framework on quantifying the uncertainty of standardized drought indices so far studies only analysed individual uncertainties of standardized drought indices but did not investigate the variability of drought indices by using one consistent model we considered five factors some of them which are not in under full control of the analyst as the sample size and the observational window and three aspects which can be decided during the calculation procedure the method of parameter estimation selection of the distribution and the use of a goodness of fit test as the uncertainties and possible errors of standardized drought indices are substantial it is worth reasoning how they can be reduced 5 1 1 observation period the two main sources of uncertainty are the observation period and the choice of the distribution they account for 49 and 39 for the spi and 53 and 17 for the spei with the absolute uncertainty variance being twice as high for the spei than for the spi nevertheless an increase of the record length leads to a significant reduction in total variance for both indices 56 for the spi and 58 for the spei when changing the sample size from 20 to 60 years similar results were found for the spi by carbone et al 2018 who stated that 60 years of observation period will be optimal since the stability in parameter estimation drops sharply for smaller observational windows this is underpinned by the findings of wang et al 2021 that the parameters of the gamma distribution remain stable with a sample size of 70 80 years both studies carbone et al 2018 wang et al 2021 indicate that longer observation periods than 60 or 70 80 years did not improve the results significantly our decomposition of variance can add an additional finding the gained accuracy for longer reference periods can be directly attributed to a reduction in observation uncertainty e g 73 for the spi but only 11 spi and 23 spei of reduction can be attributed to the choice of distribution this means that longer records do not allow for a safer choice of the distribution but can significantly increase the climate stability of the index overall the uncertainty is strongly depending on the record length due to climate change an increase in record length may decrease the overall uncertainty but results in fitting a non stationarity time series stagge et al 2017 cammalleri et al 2022 kwon and sung 2019 which was not considered as an uncertainty in this study 5 1 2 effect of distribution from our analysis the choice of distribution is the second most important source of uncertainty as this finding confirms with a general assumption of extreme value statistics the aspect of distribution uncertainty was assessed in a number of studies some studies analysed the performance of individual distributions and gave evidence which distributions performed better and which ones worse for the respective dataset e g angelidis et al 2012 blain et al 2018 guttman 1999 sienz et al 2012 soľáková et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 svensson et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2010 typically gof tests such as the shapiro wilk or anderson darling tests are employed and recommendations are given based on the lowest rejection rate among all distributions one of the most comprehensive assessments was performed by stagge et al 2015 who recommended using the gamma distribution for the spi and the gev distribution for the spei as a standard approach this should reduce the uncertainty of the index in absence of a theoretical justification of one single distribution however the study could not generally exclude a number of other candidate distributions as the rejection rates were only low to moderate and all distributions were still valid in a number of cases our study adds to these findings that whether to use or not use gof tests has only a marginal effect on the standardized drought index e g gained accuracy of 2 on average for the spi case and 1 for the spei case this may be due to the conservative nature of the employed hypothesis tests especially at typically low significance levels here alpha 0 05 which does not allow for a sharp exclusion of ill fitted distributions another reason may be that tests are rather sensitive to outliers corresponding to more extreme events than those which are actually used as thresholds for drought severity classification so do not assess the performance at the right part of the distribution for this purpose conditional performance measures have been proposed schlögl and laaha 2017 albeit at the cost of a lower data support and hence lower robustness in the light of a low performance of hypothesis tests and their marginal effect on the drought index we see only limited evidence that using a standard distribution can significantly reduce the uncertainty of the drought index 5 1 3 parameter estimation method an often discussed aspect in drought hydrology is the use of a specific parameter estimation method which is often seen to be depending on the distribution to be fitted to the data tallaksen and van lanen 2004 this is also an issue of standardized drought index calculations while beguería et al 2014 found only marginal difference in using maximum likelihood mle or unbiased probability weighted moments pwm for final spei values but preferred pwm due to the computational burden of mle blain et al 2018 suggested to use pwm as it outperformed mle our study did not reveal significant effects of the parameter estimation method per se but some significant interactions between parameter estimation and distribution the assessment of uncertainty components however shows that these effects are rather small compared to the other sources of uncertainty apart from the spei for longer observational windows where the sum of the main effect and the interaction term reaches the same order of magnitude as the distribution uncertainty this finding is in line with tijdeman et al 2020 but altogether the parameter estimation method plays a sub ordinate role compared to the other sources of uncertainty at least for the stations covered in our dataset 5 1 4 aggregation period in most cases the accumulation period is determined by physical considerations or linked to the purposes of the study and cannot be freely chosen for the sake of accuracy however it is still interesting to analyse how variance components change when changing the aggregation period in relative terms the effect of the distribution is decreasing with larger accumulation periods and increasing with larger observational windows the observation period shows the opposite effect these two tendencies are similar for spi and spei but the selection of the distribution is more dominant for the former than to the latter in absolute terms the uncertainty decreases with larger accumulation periods for the spi an aspect also observed by meschiatti and blain 2016 according to fig 9 of our study this decline can be fully attributed to the reduced uncertainty of the distribution whereas the uncertainty of the observation period does not change with the accumulation period most of the decrease can indeed be observed between one and three month aggregation this finding corresponds well with the higher rejection rates of candidate distributions for the one month aggregates found by stagge et al 2015 indicating a particular high effect of distribution uncertainty at the lowest aggregation levels as already pointed out by stagge et al 2015 one month precipitation sums may contain a substantial number of zero values which are not well modelled by most candidate distributions except from the weibull distribution in case of the spei the accumulation period shows no trend in terms of absolute uncertainty because the spei does not suffer from zero values at low aggregation levels altogether the uncertainty of standard drought indices does not change much with the aggregation period apart from the spei at the shortest one month aggregation level whose errors are about 37 higher than for longer aggregation levels 5 2 relevance for the pan european scale our analyses were performed for the austrian study area and it is now interesting to assess the relevance of our results in a broader climatic context studies that apply sdis are often not limited to a single country but rather address large scale phenomena e g stagge et al 2017 spinoni et al 2017 liu et al 2021 such studies are often based on reanalysis data or climate projections which inherit further sources of uncertainty e g borona et al 2021 hoffmann et al 2020 that are not covered in our study however our study design allows us to assess the typical errors committed when assessing droughts at the pan european scale based on the observation based e obs dataset haylock et al 2008 which is widely used for monitoring extreme events across europe since the e obs dataset is only available from 1950 to present we only assess 20 and 30 year observation periods for a time frame from 1961 to 2020 the results show that the uncertainty on the european scale is very similar to the results for the austrian dataset the expected errors for the reference event sdi value of 2 are 0 43 for spi and 0 53 for spei for europe which agrees well with the expected errors for austria 0 47 for spi and 0 61 for spei when errors are calculated for the 20 and 30 years observation period only also the frequency distribution fig a 14 and the error components figs a 15 and a 16 in the appendix are very similar to the austrian results this suggests that the results of our study are not restricted to the austrian study area but are directly relevant for a broad range of climates the errors we found are quite substantial and can lead to inaccurate classifications of drought events fig 10 illustrates the uncertainty of drought monitoring using the example of the european drought event of 2015 ionita et al 2017 found the peak of the event occurring in august and characterized the magnitude of the event by the august spei3 spei with three month aggregation period fig 10 upper panels show the reference estimation of the august spei3 centre together with its lower and upper 95 confidence bounds according to our uncertainty assessment the error bounds are quite large and allow for a wide range of interpretations to make this spatial uncertainty explicit we performed a simulation study where the spatial structure of the e r m s patterns was modelled by a spatial covariance function we then simulated 10 000 realization of the error structure using a spatial gaussian process which were finally added to the reference estimation to obtain possible realizations of the 2015 drought event across europe three selected realizations are shown in the lower panels of fig 10 the examples illustrate that not only severe overestimation or equally underestimation of the magnitude of the event is possible what is striking is that the centre of the event is also interchangeable with possible realizations showing the most drought prone area in either central europe left northern italy centre or spain right panel the results suggest that the sdis are prone to substantial local and spatial uncertainty that hampers accurate assessments of droughts at the regional scale 5 3 recommendations overall in absence of a theoretical justification in the sense of the fisher tippett gnedenko theorem for extreme values there is no unique distribution and the effect of the choice of the distribution is substantial in this light distribution free approaches such as empirical probabilities could offer a useful alternative in this study using empirical probabilities would lead to an uncertainty reduction of 31 for the spi and 12 for the spei case however the disadvantage of empirical probabilities is that they are less robust to biases especially at the tails of the distribution as these biases could generally outweigh or exceed the gains from eliminating the distribution uncertainty from spi calculation no general recommendation can be given at this point nonparametric solutions were also suggested by ghamghami et al 2017 who employed a kernel density estimator soľáková et al 2014 and farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 who used various plotting positions weibull and gringorton or tijdeman et al 2020 for the ssi another approach to reduce distribution uncertainty would be to calculate the standardized drought index with several distributions and using the ensemble mean m s d i as an estimate in the context of ensemble approaches hu et al 2015 applied bootstrapping to get a robust estimate of the spi and sienz et al 2012 used the aic to determine the most suitable distribution however using the m s d i would to our knowledge be a new approach to drought index calculation but has been considered for other applications such as climate model ensembles several approaches to reduce the predictive uncertainty have been proposed e g by deleting non behaving distributions of the ensemble but they are discussed controversy as their theoretical justification is difficult in absence of biases using the m s d i reduces the standard error of the index to the standard error of the ensemble mean this would yield a reduction of the e r m s from 0 38 to 0 11 for the spi and 0 55 to 0 26 for the spei in practice the uncertainty can be much higher as possible biases are not included in the assessment and would add to the calculated uncertainty a third option to reduce the uncertainty of standardized drought indices would be using theoretical probabilities or similarly return periods of the distribution as an index similar to extreme value statistics in hydrology this cannot avoid distribution errors but will reduce the additional errors committed by the z score transformation of the standardized drought index the main problem of the z score transformation is that it stretches the quantile values and also their uncertainty at the tails of the distributions which should increase the errors of extreme drought indices this effect is illustrated by one station in fig 11 where the sensitivity index representing the unit change in the drought index as response to a unit change in precipitation shows an exponential increase for low precipitation values this means on average for the study area that 1 mm additional precipitation would change the z score by 0 05 for an spi of 1 but by 0 22 for an spi of 3 clearly this may lead to an overestimation of drought severity as it was noted in the european 2015 drought study of ionita et al 2017 for extreme spi values in southern europe in this study spi values of 6 corresponded to only 1 mm less of precipitation 0 instead of 1 mm than in average years indeed a minor effect that is more of statistical than practical relevance for comparison the probability score of the empirical probability estimator and the gamma distribution shows a higher sensitivity at moderate precipitation values and a decreasing sensitivity towards the lowest values 6 conclusions spi and spei are widely used drought indices and there are manifold approaches for their calculation we proposed a new one model framework for decomposing the estimation variance of standardized drought indices in order to shed light on what are the most dominant sources of uncertainty we found an averaged expected error of 0 38 for a spi value of 2 and 0 55 in case of the spei which would yield a 95 tolerance interval of 2 76 to 1 24 spi and 3 1 to 0 9 spei this uncertainty is mainly driven by two factors the choice of the distribution and the observation period the observation period was detected as the primary source of uncertainty but can be significantly reduced by using sample sizes of at least 60 years the second major uncertainty the choice of distribution is only slightly affected by an increase of the observational window and appears to be inherent in the standardized drought index our analysis revealed no significant uncertainty contribution by the application of a gof test for our study area furthermore we also found that the method of parameter estimation has no significant influence on final drought index values apart from some interaction effect of parameter estimation and distribution for the spei at longer observational windows additionally if not predetermined by the science question the choice of a longer accumulation period can reduce the uncertainty for the spi but not for the spei as there is a trade off between increasing uncertainty for the observation period and decreasing uncertainty for the selection of the distribution overall the uncertainty of standardized drought indices is substantial and may yield to subjective drought classifications depending on the calculation method chosen alternative approaches as nonparametric methods ensemble approaches or probability based indices could offer a useful

2957,standardized drought indices such as the standardized precipitation index spi or the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei are frequently used around the world to assess drought severity across a continent or a larger region covering different meteorological regimes but how standard are these standardized indices in this paper we quantify the uncertainty of spi and spei based on an austrian dataset to shed light on what are the main sources of uncertainty in the study area five factors that either defy the control of the analyst record length observation period or need to be subjectively decided during the steps of the calculation choice of the distribution parameter estimation method and gof test of the fitted distribution are considered we use the root mean squared error e r m s for estimating the typical error for different calculation algorithm of spi and spei the total and relative uncertainty components for each factor are analysed by a linear mixed model lmm and significance of each model parameter are tested by the akaike information criterion aic and the restricted likelihood ratio test the e r m s indicates that computational variations of standardized drought indices lead to highly variable results from the lmm the choice of the distribution and the observational window are the most important sources of uncertainty they on average control between 19 and 63 choice of distribution and 24 to 70 observation period of the total variance of the spi across all stations and month of the year with similar values observed for the spei the parameter estimation method and the gof tests however have almost no effect on the standardized indices total errors and observation period uncertainty are typically decreasing with the record length as one would expect while the distribution uncertainty is almost independent from the record length an additional assessment shows that the uncertainties are similar at the pan european scale leading to uncertain characterizations of major events such as the drought of 2015 overall the uncertainty of standardized drought indices is substantial alternative approaches as nonparametric methods ensemble approaches or probability based indices based on established methods of extreme value statistics should be considered to make the indices more accurate keywords drought uncertainty assessment linear mixed model spi spei data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is a creeping natural phenomenon with highly destructive power which unfolds their impacts on different temporal and spatial scales several studies showed the enormous financial costs droughts are causing this is because drought events have a wide range of impacts such as food shortages loss of hydropower production and wildfires mishra and singh 2010 spinoni et al 2016 thus affecting many water related sectors there is no single definition of drought but four types of drought are often distinguished meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic drought droughts are basically triggered by a lack of precipitation but are also dependent on e g soil moisture physiogeographic characteristics evapotranspiration snow accumulation or human activities wilhite and glantz 1985 to inform monitoring and forecasting systems over a hundred drought indices have been developed which differ in the variables used for drought characterization and in the level of complexity mishra and singh 2010 one frequently used index is the spi invented by mckee et al 1993 proposed as the standardized drought index by the wmo 2006 and recommended as universal meteorological drought index by the lincoln declaration hayes et al 2011 the popularity of the spi is founded in the simplicity of the calculation procedure and the perceived spatial comparability of index values cheval 2015 therefore the spi is used for drought detection and projection spinoni et al 2016 bachmair et al 2015 lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 hannaford et al 2011 and is part of monitoring systems like the european drought centre edc stahl et al 2016 the national drought mitigation centre ndmc svoboda et al 2002 or the european drought observatory edo an extension to the spi is the spei which accounts for evapotranspiration deficits by using the climatic water balance as data input vicente serrano et al 2010 spi and spei are based on the same modelling framework which can also be found in e g the standardized streamflow index ssi shukla and wood 2008 or the reconnaissance drought index rdi tsakiris et al 2007 so that these indices are often referred to as standardized drought indices sdis the basic idea of sdis is to accumulate monthly data e g precipitation climatic water balance runoff to different aggregation periods of m months m 1 2 3 fit a parametric distribution and transform the resulting probabilities to the quantiles of the standardized normal distribution with x n 0 1 however there is no overall agreement on the calculation steps for these sdi and results are strongly affected by different modelling setups a basic modelling framework for the spi is given by guttman 1999 or vicente serrano et al 2010 for the spei these approaches inherit several uncertainties e g choice of distribution method of parameter estimation sample size observation period different goodness of fit tests gof tests or sampling uncertainty comparisons of parametric distributions for sdis have been performed in a number of studies including e g stagge et al 2015 angelidis et al 2012 lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 sienz et al 2012 wang et al 2019 svensson et al 2017 pieper et al 2020 where for europe the gamma distribution was found to be most adequate for the spi but with the restriction to higher accumulation periods j 6 in contrast sienz et al 2012 or pieper et al 2020 suggested using weibull type distributions whereas svensson et al 2017 found that for the uk the 3 and 4 parameter kappa distributions were most appropriate apart from such parametric approaches the sdi methodology was extended to nonparametric approaches e g farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 soľáková et al 2014 vidal et al 2010 tijdeman et al 2020 with the intention to minimize the sensitivity of the sdi regarding the choice of the distribution selection of the best distribution is often done by goodness of fit tests gof tests and their rejection rate i e the count of time series rejected by the specific gof test examples include the anderson darling ad kolmogorov smirnov ks cramer von mises cm chi square cs and shapiro wilk test blain and meschiatti 2015 stagge et al 2015 hu et al 2015 sienz et al 2012 blain et al 2018 stedinger 1993 underlined that such tests are not capable to identify the true or best distribution among several alternatives as their purpose is to reject a theoretical distribution when deviations of the sample are large compared to sampling uncertainty furthermore vlček and huth 2009 showed the inappropriate use of the ks test for daily precipitation by applying a gamma distribution compared to the more suitable lilliefors test lilliefors 1967 and angelidis et al 2012 showed that most distributions are rejected at a 99 significance level another approach of evaluation is performed by blain et al 2018 who is using the mean absolute error mae for comparing maximum likelihood and l moments to estimate distribution parameters or by use of l moments ratio diagrams vicente serrano et al 2010 vergni et al 2017a parameter estimation for sdi is mostly performed by maximum likelihood methods of moments or l moments approaches studies indicate that the parameter uncertainty of the distribution can be reduced by using time series with 40 60 years of records for obtaining stable estimates at the centre of the distribution and 70 80 years for stability at the tails of the distribution e g guttman 1999 wang et al 2021 zhang and li 2020 mahmoudi et al 2019 for comparison mckee et al 1993 had proposed a sample size of at least 30 years for approximately correct parameter estimation sampling uncertainty was also examined using nonparametric bootstrapping methods to generate confidence intervals for the spi e g vergni et al 2017b hu et al 2015 a similar approach was adopted by carbone et al 2018 to study the combined effect of the observation period and outliers on the spi they found that shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution are stable for a sample size greater than 60 years whereas the errors are substantially increasing for shorter observation periods recently more studies focused on the effect of the observation period on the uncertainty of sdi values paulo et al 2016 described changes in the gamma distribution in respect to changing observation period and wu et al 2005 found that the spi is sensitive to observation periods if precipitation pattern changes other approaches considered varying data input for calculation of sdi as an uncertainty hoffmann et al 2020 borona et al 2021 and in respect to climate change the effect of non stationarity becomes increasingly important kwon and sung 2019 cammalleri et al 2022 stagge et al 2017 reported a divergence of drought frequency and intensity for spi and spei due to increasing temperature additionally also the calculation of the potential evapotranspiration can be seen as a source of uncertainty beguería et al 2014 most studies focusing on an uncertainty analysis of standardized drought indices either considered only one single uncertainty or did not quantify all uncertainties of sdi computation simultaneously in one framework e g tijdeman et al 2020 hoffmann et al 2020 zhang and li 2020 hence this paper aims to fill in this research gap by performing a consistent analysis of uncertainty components related to each calculation step of a sdi using a linear mixed model lmm the results shall be indicative of the influence of modelling decisions for drought detection based on the sdi the paper addresses three major research questions what are the typical errors of spi and spei do different choices of the modeller significantly alter spi spei values what are the main sources of uncertainty 2 methodology 2 1 spi and spei calculation 2 1 1 standardized precipitation index spi the spi was introduced by mckee et al 1993 for a simplistic categorization of drought and wet spells several studies showed the usefulness of the spi to detect droughts and its straightforward and simplistic approach made it popular in various fields the spi is calculated by first summing up monthly precipitation data over i monthly accumulation periods with i typically taking values of 1 to 12 the accumulated precipitation data are split in 12 annual time series one for each month and each time series is fitted by a univariate parametric distribution finally the probabilities of the fitted data are then transformed into quantiles of a standard normal distribution with mean 0 μ 0 and variance 1 σ 1 these standardized anomalies are often used for drought categorization such as using thresholds as introduced by mckee et al see table 1 whereas it is less common to use wet anomalies to categorize floods the reference spi of this study is based on an approach by guttman 1999 precipitation data is summed up for accumulation periods of 1 3 6 and 12 months afterwards a gamma distribution is fitted to the accumulated precipitation series of the same month or season using an l moments estimator hosking 1990 l moments are a robust method for parameter estimation which is preferred to more outlier sensitive estimation methods such as methods of moments or maximum likelihood estimation if zero precipitation is present in the data this is handled by the approach of stagge et al 2015 using the averaged probabilities of the weibull plotting position for estimating the probability of zero precipitation defining the probability distribution by 1 p x p 0 1 p 0 f x p 0 α β x 0 n p 0 1 2 n 1 x 0 with f being f x p 0 α β the gamma distribution with α as shape parameter and β as scale parameter p 0 is the probability of zero precipitation by p 0 n p 0 n 1 and n p 0 is the number of zero precipitation events in the observation period in this study zero precipitation is only occurring for an accumulation period of one month in our study the basic approach for the spi is reversed to calculate a reference precipitation corresponding to a given spi this reference precipitation is used as input for an ensemble of spi estimates based on a range of model choices and parameter settings the workflow of the calculation approach is exemplified in fig 1 in a first step the reference spi value is transformed to a probability score by using the standard normal cumulative distribution function shown in fig 1a for example this yields a probability of 0 16 for a reference spi of 1 in the second step the probability score is entered into the quantile function of the fitted gamma distribution to calculate the associated reference precipitation event to assess the full range of spi values a set of reference precipitation values corresponding to a reference spi from 3 to 3 in increments of 0 2 are processed and converted into spi estimates this procedure is performed for every station every month and four different accumulation periods the main focus of the analyses will be on a reference spi value of 2 which is often regarded a threshold for extreme drought events mckee et al 1993 and is therefore an important parameter for drought detection and drought management decisions a similar approach will be used for the spei as explained below 2 1 2 standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei the spei uses the advantages of the spi e g different time scales better comparability in time and space but vicente serrano et al 2010 added evapotranspiration as additional information to account for the sensitivity of droughts to evaporation and temperature the spei is calculated as the spi but uses not only precipitation but the climatic water balance which is the difference between precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet on i month accumulation periods pet can be modelled in various ways the suggested method is penman monteith allen et al 1998 which needs several variables as humidity or water vapour pressure that are not available for this study as only mean temperature is provided by sufficient stations of the histalp network auer et al 2007 we choose the simple thornthwaite 1948 method to calculate pet which was also suggested by vicente serrano et al 2010 it has to be mentioned that different methodological approaches for pet calculations would be an additional uncertainty of the spei beguería et al 2014 stagge et al 2014 but as this is not a matter of the underlying statistical procedure this uncertainty component was excluded in the analysis after the computation of the climatic water balance on different aggregation periods the data is fitted to a parametric distribution and the probabilities are transformed into a quantile of the standard normal distribution to obtain the spei value similar to the spi we are defining a basic spei approach by computing reference climatic water balance values as inputs for each time series we are using the three parametric log logistic distribution as reference distribution parameters are estimated by l moments following the approach proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 furthermore the uncertainty components for the spei are also focusing on a reference spei value of 2 as for the spi 2 2 uncertainty assessment the uncertainty assessment of this study consists of several steps which are summarized in fig 2 our study design includes 43 stations for the calculation of the spi n s p i 43 and 25 stations for the computation of the spei n s p e i 25 an initial decision to be made when calculating a standardized drought index is the choice of the aggregation period in this study we consider four different accumulation periods for this purpose each of the single time series is aggregated within a moving window of 1 3 6 and 12 months m 4 number of different accumulation periods leading to four aggregated time series at each station finally these time series are split up to derive annual series for each calendar month the dataset consists now of 2064 n s p i m 12 time series for the spi and 1200 n s p e i m 12 for the spei the uncertainties are calculated individually for each time series and will be further analysed by a linear mixed model in the following sections we describe the different sources of uncertainty analysed in this study and the method for their estimation 2 2 1 sources of uncertainty the spi and spei values are not exact as they depend on a number of choices made by the user five different uncertainties are considered to contribute to the variation of the drought indices sample size observation period choice of distribution parameter estimation and gof the first source of uncertainty is the sample size and the second is the observation period both are statistically dependent from each other hence we used three different model setups to incorporate both effects analysing the three setups is tantamount with performing our analyses over three concurrent models whose results are either contrasted with each other or summarized to yield an overall assessment of all sources of uncertainty the first model setup includes four observational windows with 30 years each as this is usually considered to be sufficient for calculation of the spi hayes et al 2011 mckee et al 1993 proposed 50 to 60 years for the observation period for a more robust estimation therefore the second setup is using two 60 year windows the last model setup analyses the effect of reduced sample size to the uncertainty of the spi by differentiating between 6 20 year windows meschiatti and blain 2016 the chosen time windows are not overlapping to avoid linear dependencies and their total length corresponds to the observation period 1897 to 2016 the number of levels for the observation period are either 2 4 or 6 i 2 4 6 the third uncertainty component is defined by the selection of the distribution used to fit the precipitation or climatic water balance data this issue is presented in many studies regarding the best suited distribution mainly quantified by the rejection rate of distributions due to various tests for model evaluation in this study eight different distributions were tested for the spi that were used in literature gamma normal log normal logistic log logistic weibull generalized extreme value gev and pearson iii distribution e g stagge et al 2015 svensson et al 2017 for the spei five distributions were analysed normal generalized logistic gev pearson iii generalized log normal e g stagge et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2010 only two three parameter distributions are tested for the spi gev and pearson iii because two parameter distributions have shown sufficient results in previous studies the number of levels j for the choice of distribution is 8 for the spi and respectively 5 for the spei each of these distributions are fitted to every time window of our initial model setup the last two sources of uncertainty are the parameter estimation method and the use of a gof test three different approaches k 3 for estimating the parameters of the distributions are considered maximum likelihood estimation mle methods of moments mom and l moment lm finally the suitability of each distribution was tested by checking final spi spei values for normality by application of the shapiro wilk test sw shapiro and wilk 1965 as this is used in most spi studies the sw test is performed on a 5 significance level and was chosen because of its higher power razali et al 2011 when the test statistic was in the critical region p value lower than 0 05 the respective distribution was rejected the resulting model ensemble of well fitted distributions was finally compared to the full model ensemble to assess the uncertainty component of using gof tests or not l 2 if spi spei values outside the range of 6 to 6 were estimated for a reference precipitation we excluded the specific model outcome for the analysis testing the fit of the specific distribution was not considered in this study as tests like anderson darling or kolmogorov smirnov need extensive simulation of their critical values for non normal distributions if parameters are estimated of the data each possible calculation path given by the combination of calculation varieties described above returns a spi spei value calculated for a reference value of 2 all possible variations t for each model setup can be calculated by 2 t j k l m this results in 192 final spi values for model setup 1 96 for model setup 2 and 288 for model setup 3 the respective numbers for the spei are 120 60 and 180 all three models setups are calculated for all 2064 and 1200 time series of spi and spei 2 2 2 uncertainty estimation and attribution this study estimates the uncertainty of spi and spei values by three different approaches these uncertainty assessments are based on a vector y which is defined by all possible variations of spi spei values for a given reference precipitation climatic water balance value of a specific time series and one of the three model setups calculated by the approach described in section 2 1 1 in a first step we want to calculate the typical error of spi and spei for each individual time series considering that we calculate the deviations of y to the reference value y r e f which is the spi spei value of the given reference precipitation or climate water balance by 3 y e r r y y r e f the typical error is then quantified by a root mean squared error e r m s 4 e r m s t t y e r r t 2 t in a next step we aim to quantify the contribution of the sources of uncertainty section 2 2 1 to the individual uncertainties across the study area the uncertainty contributions are quantified by two additional metrics relative uncertainty and total uncertainty that are calculated by a linear mixed model lmm fisher 1919 henderson 1973 in this approach each source of uncertainty is modelled as a random effect while only the overall mean of the model is assumed to be a fixed effect therefore we can use a formulation of the lmm for random effects only which can be written as 5 y e r r b 0 z 1 b 1 z s b s ϵ where b 0 is the model intercept ϵ is the error term with zero mean and residual variance σ ϵ 2 z 1 z s are the design matrices of each random effect with the random effect parameters b 1 b s each of them normally distributed with zero mean and variance σ s 2 in our study the random effects correspond to our five sources of uncertainty s 5 the variance of the random effect is determined as the between variance of the effects and the residual variance σ ϵ 2 is the within variance model estimation is performed by restricted maximum likelihood reml patterson and thompson 1971 harville 1977 reml separates fixed and random effects and gives an unbiased estimate of the random effects by avoiding negative variance components significance of each random parameter is tested by an exact restricted likelihood ratio test rlrt greven et al 2008 and a stepwise regression approach where each parameter is dropped and then compared to the full model ordinary likelihood ratio tests are not sufficient in this case as the models are tested for zero variance which should be asymptotically approached by a 0 5 x 0 2 0 5 x 1 2 x 0 means a point mass in 0 distribution but studies show large deviations from this assumption scheipl et al 2008 therefore we apply a method where the null distribution is approached by simulations crainiceanu and ruppert 2004 scheipl et al 2008 greven et al 2008 the test is implemented in r by the software package rlrsim rlrt significance is reached for a p value below 0 01 additionally models are compared by the akaike information criterion a i c akaike 1974 to analyse the significance of individual parameters at different stations the aic can be written as 6 a i c 2 k 2 l n l ˆ where k is the number of model parameters and l ˆ is the estimated reml loglikelihood of the model a model parameter is denoted significant if the aic value without the specific model parameter is higher or equal than the full model each source of uncertainty is quantified by the variance components σ s 2 of the s th random effect estimation of variance components is often based on an analysis of variance anova framework e g parajka et al 2016 von storch and zwiers 2001 which is not possible in the context of a linear mixed model as only the fixed effects would be evaluated our variance components σ s 2 are estimated in r by the lme4 package bates et al 2015 calculation of relative variance components is based on an approach by nakagawa and schielzeth 2013 johnson 2014 and nakagawa et al 2017 for the s th effect the individual relative uncertainty components η s can then be obtained by 7 η s σ s 2 s 1 s σ s 2 σ e 2 σ d 2 η s is the explained variance of the s th effect and in this study termed the relative variance components σ s 2 are the variance components of the s th effect σ ϵ 2 is the residual variance which can be further expressed as the sum of additive dispersion σ e 2 and distribution specific variance σ d 2 the residual variance component η ϵ is finally estimated by 8 η ϵ σ ϵ 2 s 1 s σ s 2 σ e 2 σ d 2 finally we can denote the total variance σ 2 and respectively the standard deviation σ of each model by 9 σ 2 s 1 s σ s 2 σ e 2 σ d 2 in our ensemble approach the total and relative variance components σ s 2 η s corresponding to the five sources of uncertainty observation period parameter estimation selection of distribution gof test interaction of parameter estimation and selection of distribution and the residual terms σ ϵ 2 and η ϵ are calculated at each station separately for each month of the year for four different accumulation periods m 1 3 6 12 and all three model setups 3 data the uncertainty of standardized drought indices is analysed based on precipitation data of 43 stations spread over austria of which 25 exhibit temperature records as well the stations correspond to the full set of long term stations provided by the zentralanstalt für meteorologie und geodynamik zamg in their histalp network auer et al 2007 these stations have at least a minimum observation period of 120 years and have been in operational use until 2018 all time series were pre processed auer et al 2007 and have no missing values for the dataset annual precipitation ranges from 493 mm to a maximum of 1793 mm at bad ischl fig 3 for each station and each year the seasonal precipitation peak is mostly in july with some exceptions in august and one in june and october respectively for monthly precipitation aggregates zero values occur at all but one station and the maximum number of months with zero precipitation per station is 16 accumulation periods greater than one month do not exhibit any zero precipitation values within the study area austria appears an ideal test because it is climatically diverse and the long precipitation time series allow us to analyse the relative effects of observation periods and sample sizes nevertheless we will discuss the relevance of the results for a broader range of climates in an additional pan european assessment focusing on the drought event of 2015 ionita et al 2017 where the analyses are based on the e obs dataset haylock et al 2008 4 results 4 1 expected error we were first interested in the expected uncertainty of the standardized drought indices spi and spei we therefore calculated the e r m s of each variation of spi spei values obtained by the various calculation approaches using eq 4 this resulted in 6192 e r m s s for the spi and 3600 e r m s s for the spei fig 4 shows the overall distributions of these e r m s values the corresponding average yielded expected errors of 0 38 for the spi and 0 55 for the spei these values were used to calculate approximate 95 tolerance intervals of the standardized drought indices arising from the various calculation methods the tolerance interval reflects the spread of calculated vales around the true value of the standardized drought index as a consequence all values within the tolerance interval cannot be distinguished from each other as their difference may arise from calculation errors only in case of an spi value of 2 the 95 tolerance interval ranged from 2 76 to 1 24 which is quite large compared to the categories used for classifying the severity of a drought event table 1 an even larger spread could be observed for the spei where the 95 tolerance interval ranged from 3 1 to 0 9 comparing these confidence bounds to the drought classes of table 1 we noticed that an event with a true spi of 2 could be either classified as extreme severe or only moderate drought depending on the calculation method chosen in the case of the spei the spread of possible drought classification was even larger as it included even the mild drought case clearly the expected error of the spi and spei calculations is substantial and the various calculation methods may result in different drought management decisions breaking down the results to single uncertainties the e r m s declined for greater sample sizes as one would expect furthermore the difference between the e r m s of the spi and spei was getting narrower for sample sizes of 60 years however the e r m s could give us only a first impression of the expected error in the next section we employed a linear mixed model to assess individual uncertainty contributions in more detail 4 2 significance of model parameters a lmm according to eq 5 was fitted for each drought index a first indication of the importance of each effect was obtained by examining their significances based on the rlrt and the aic a useful measure of the regional significance level is the percentage of stations where a considered model parameter is significant the results are presented in tables 2 and 3 in general the aic yielded a higher percentage of significant stations than the rlrt this holds for both drought indices spi and spei in both cases the distribution selection and the observation period were highly significant whereas the parameter estimation and the gof test had low significance rates we identified three main differences in the significance rates between spi and spei first of all the distribution was significant in almost every model of the spi but only in 45 to 86 of the spei models second the significance rates for the observation period were increasing with larger observational windows for the spei but decreasing for the spi finally the interaction term between the distribution and parameter estimation was more significant for the spi than for the spei 4 3 relative uncertainty contributions next we were interested to quantify the variance contributions of the five sources of uncertainty considered in this study a measure of their relative effect size is the η s eq 7 recalling the low significance rates for gof tests these were also reflected in the relative variance components η s figs 5 and 6 as they were near zero for both drought indices similar patterns were shown by the η s of the parameter estimation method which were on average below 1 the interaction term between selection of the distribution and parameter estimation method was small in most lmms of spi and spei but was slightly higher in case of a one month accumulation period this effect additionally increased with larger observational windows and reached values of 5 79 spi and 6 85 spei for 60 years records the main sources of uncertainty were the observation period and the choice of the distribution the selection of the distribution for spi and spei showed a decreasing η s for larger accumulation periods and an increasing η s for longer observational windows overall the η s of the distribution selection was on average higher for all variations of the spi than of the spei the relative uncertainty of the observation period was increasing with larger accumulation periods and decreasing with increasing sample size considering the spi the observation period was the dominant source of uncertainty for a 20 year observational window but for 60 years the selection of the distribution was the main source of uncertainty although the main pattern of the two relevant sources of uncertainty were similar for spi and spei the observational window was the dominant source of uncertainty for the spei over the selection of the distribution in all but one variation 60 years of observation and 1 month accumulation period additionally the residual variance component η ϵ diverged for spi and spei on average η ϵ was between 8 and 10 for the spi but significantly higher for spei models which had a η ϵ of about 24 for 20 years of observation decreasing to 18 for a 60 year observational window for a better understanding of the differences in the uncertainty of spi and spei we had to take a closer look to the total uncertainty components 4 4 absolute uncertainty contributions so far we have seen that different estimation methods lead to a large variability in final drought values parameter tests and relative uncertainty components have indicated that there are two main sources of uncertainty selection of the distribution and the length of the observation period in a next step we quantified the variance components σ s 2 and the residual variance σ ϵ 2 in absolute terms to obtain a quantitative estimate of the errors attributed to individual choices to be made when calculating the standardized drought index results were additionally specified by the standard deviation σ s as this metric is better comparable to our initial e r m s and the scale of the drought index figs 7 and 8 show the variance components for each station bar averaged over all months the model parameters gof test parameter estimation method and the interaction between distribution and parameter estimation method were very small and therefore not considered in the further analysis we first looked at total variance σ 2 of our models to analyse the overall trend for different accumulation periods and different sample sizes averaged over all models σ 2 was 0 19 for the spi and 0 39 for the spei the corresponding averaged standard deviation σ was 0 44 for the spi and 0 62 for the spei which was similar to the expected value of the e r m s section 4 1 spi 0 38 spei 0 55 by analysing the e r m s we had already seen that the expected error decreased with longer observational windows the lmm allowed us to analyse this effect in quantitative terms based on the variance components for this purpose we averaged σ 2 and σ s 2 over all stations months and all four accumulation periods fig 9 shows these average total variance σ 2 and average variance components σ s 2 in respect to different sample sizes when increasing the observation period from 20 to 60 years the standard deviation σ dropped significantly from 0 51 σ 2 0 26 to 0 34 σ 2 0 12 for the spi and from 0 72 σ 2 0 52 to 0 47 σ 2 0 22 for the spei however with regard to choice of the distribution longer observational windows had no effect spi or only a marginal effect spei on the respective variance components this means that the choice of the distribution is a source of uncertainty that is inherent in the drought index and not an effect of sampling uncertainty and this uncertainty is somewhat higher for the spi than for the spei but in any case the results suggest that using 60 years of observation and more can significantly reduce the uncertainty of the drought index the gained accuracy when using such long observation periods can again be illustrated by the reduced tolerance interval of the drought index in case of a true drought index value of 2 the 95 tolerance interval ranged from 2 68 to 1 32 observation period of 20 years 3 03 to 0 97 for the spi and 2 94 to 1 06 3 44 to 0 56 for the spei which were significant reductions compared to an observation period of 20 years however the uncertainty was still large compared to the categories used for drought severity classification table 1 and the resulting drought classifications were still inaccurate focusing on the effect of different accumulation periods results showed decreasing uncertainties for the spi with larger aggregation periods and no such trend for the spei in more detail the σ 2 decreased by 0 06 from 0 24 σ 0 49 for 1 month to 0 18 σ 0 42 for 12 months for the spi most of the gained accuracy was obtained by increasing the aggregation period from 1 to 3 month whereas longer aggregation periods did not further reduce the uncertainties for the spei the total variance varied randomly between 0 37 σ 0 61 and 0 41 σ 0 64 and showed no systematic trend along the accumulation periods this can be explained by the decreasing uncertainty of the distribution being outweighed by the increasing uncertainty of the observation period in contrast different accumulation periods did not influence σ s 2 of the observation period for the spi resulting in the net reduction of the uncertainty described above the variance components of the distribution were thereby reduced by 0 06 for the spi and 0 05 for the spei along the increasing aggregation period 5 discussion 5 1 sources of uncertainty in the context of literature in this study we proposed a new framework on quantifying the uncertainty of standardized drought indices so far studies only analysed individual uncertainties of standardized drought indices but did not investigate the variability of drought indices by using one consistent model we considered five factors some of them which are not in under full control of the analyst as the sample size and the observational window and three aspects which can be decided during the calculation procedure the method of parameter estimation selection of the distribution and the use of a goodness of fit test as the uncertainties and possible errors of standardized drought indices are substantial it is worth reasoning how they can be reduced 5 1 1 observation period the two main sources of uncertainty are the observation period and the choice of the distribution they account for 49 and 39 for the spi and 53 and 17 for the spei with the absolute uncertainty variance being twice as high for the spei than for the spi nevertheless an increase of the record length leads to a significant reduction in total variance for both indices 56 for the spi and 58 for the spei when changing the sample size from 20 to 60 years similar results were found for the spi by carbone et al 2018 who stated that 60 years of observation period will be optimal since the stability in parameter estimation drops sharply for smaller observational windows this is underpinned by the findings of wang et al 2021 that the parameters of the gamma distribution remain stable with a sample size of 70 80 years both studies carbone et al 2018 wang et al 2021 indicate that longer observation periods than 60 or 70 80 years did not improve the results significantly our decomposition of variance can add an additional finding the gained accuracy for longer reference periods can be directly attributed to a reduction in observation uncertainty e g 73 for the spi but only 11 spi and 23 spei of reduction can be attributed to the choice of distribution this means that longer records do not allow for a safer choice of the distribution but can significantly increase the climate stability of the index overall the uncertainty is strongly depending on the record length due to climate change an increase in record length may decrease the overall uncertainty but results in fitting a non stationarity time series stagge et al 2017 cammalleri et al 2022 kwon and sung 2019 which was not considered as an uncertainty in this study 5 1 2 effect of distribution from our analysis the choice of distribution is the second most important source of uncertainty as this finding confirms with a general assumption of extreme value statistics the aspect of distribution uncertainty was assessed in a number of studies some studies analysed the performance of individual distributions and gave evidence which distributions performed better and which ones worse for the respective dataset e g angelidis et al 2012 blain et al 2018 guttman 1999 sienz et al 2012 soľáková et al 2014 stagge et al 2015 svensson et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2010 typically gof tests such as the shapiro wilk or anderson darling tests are employed and recommendations are given based on the lowest rejection rate among all distributions one of the most comprehensive assessments was performed by stagge et al 2015 who recommended using the gamma distribution for the spi and the gev distribution for the spei as a standard approach this should reduce the uncertainty of the index in absence of a theoretical justification of one single distribution however the study could not generally exclude a number of other candidate distributions as the rejection rates were only low to moderate and all distributions were still valid in a number of cases our study adds to these findings that whether to use or not use gof tests has only a marginal effect on the standardized drought index e g gained accuracy of 2 on average for the spi case and 1 for the spei case this may be due to the conservative nature of the employed hypothesis tests especially at typically low significance levels here alpha 0 05 which does not allow for a sharp exclusion of ill fitted distributions another reason may be that tests are rather sensitive to outliers corresponding to more extreme events than those which are actually used as thresholds for drought severity classification so do not assess the performance at the right part of the distribution for this purpose conditional performance measures have been proposed schlögl and laaha 2017 albeit at the cost of a lower data support and hence lower robustness in the light of a low performance of hypothesis tests and their marginal effect on the drought index we see only limited evidence that using a standard distribution can significantly reduce the uncertainty of the drought index 5 1 3 parameter estimation method an often discussed aspect in drought hydrology is the use of a specific parameter estimation method which is often seen to be depending on the distribution to be fitted to the data tallaksen and van lanen 2004 this is also an issue of standardized drought index calculations while beguería et al 2014 found only marginal difference in using maximum likelihood mle or unbiased probability weighted moments pwm for final spei values but preferred pwm due to the computational burden of mle blain et al 2018 suggested to use pwm as it outperformed mle our study did not reveal significant effects of the parameter estimation method per se but some significant interactions between parameter estimation and distribution the assessment of uncertainty components however shows that these effects are rather small compared to the other sources of uncertainty apart from the spei for longer observational windows where the sum of the main effect and the interaction term reaches the same order of magnitude as the distribution uncertainty this finding is in line with tijdeman et al 2020 but altogether the parameter estimation method plays a sub ordinate role compared to the other sources of uncertainty at least for the stations covered in our dataset 5 1 4 aggregation period in most cases the accumulation period is determined by physical considerations or linked to the purposes of the study and cannot be freely chosen for the sake of accuracy however it is still interesting to analyse how variance components change when changing the aggregation period in relative terms the effect of the distribution is decreasing with larger accumulation periods and increasing with larger observational windows the observation period shows the opposite effect these two tendencies are similar for spi and spei but the selection of the distribution is more dominant for the former than to the latter in absolute terms the uncertainty decreases with larger accumulation periods for the spi an aspect also observed by meschiatti and blain 2016 according to fig 9 of our study this decline can be fully attributed to the reduced uncertainty of the distribution whereas the uncertainty of the observation period does not change with the accumulation period most of the decrease can indeed be observed between one and three month aggregation this finding corresponds well with the higher rejection rates of candidate distributions for the one month aggregates found by stagge et al 2015 indicating a particular high effect of distribution uncertainty at the lowest aggregation levels as already pointed out by stagge et al 2015 one month precipitation sums may contain a substantial number of zero values which are not well modelled by most candidate distributions except from the weibull distribution in case of the spei the accumulation period shows no trend in terms of absolute uncertainty because the spei does not suffer from zero values at low aggregation levels altogether the uncertainty of standard drought indices does not change much with the aggregation period apart from the spei at the shortest one month aggregation level whose errors are about 37 higher than for longer aggregation levels 5 2 relevance for the pan european scale our analyses were performed for the austrian study area and it is now interesting to assess the relevance of our results in a broader climatic context studies that apply sdis are often not limited to a single country but rather address large scale phenomena e g stagge et al 2017 spinoni et al 2017 liu et al 2021 such studies are often based on reanalysis data or climate projections which inherit further sources of uncertainty e g borona et al 2021 hoffmann et al 2020 that are not covered in our study however our study design allows us to assess the typical errors committed when assessing droughts at the pan european scale based on the observation based e obs dataset haylock et al 2008 which is widely used for monitoring extreme events across europe since the e obs dataset is only available from 1950 to present we only assess 20 and 30 year observation periods for a time frame from 1961 to 2020 the results show that the uncertainty on the european scale is very similar to the results for the austrian dataset the expected errors for the reference event sdi value of 2 are 0 43 for spi and 0 53 for spei for europe which agrees well with the expected errors for austria 0 47 for spi and 0 61 for spei when errors are calculated for the 20 and 30 years observation period only also the frequency distribution fig a 14 and the error components figs a 15 and a 16 in the appendix are very similar to the austrian results this suggests that the results of our study are not restricted to the austrian study area but are directly relevant for a broad range of climates the errors we found are quite substantial and can lead to inaccurate classifications of drought events fig 10 illustrates the uncertainty of drought monitoring using the example of the european drought event of 2015 ionita et al 2017 found the peak of the event occurring in august and characterized the magnitude of the event by the august spei3 spei with three month aggregation period fig 10 upper panels show the reference estimation of the august spei3 centre together with its lower and upper 95 confidence bounds according to our uncertainty assessment the error bounds are quite large and allow for a wide range of interpretations to make this spatial uncertainty explicit we performed a simulation study where the spatial structure of the e r m s patterns was modelled by a spatial covariance function we then simulated 10 000 realization of the error structure using a spatial gaussian process which were finally added to the reference estimation to obtain possible realizations of the 2015 drought event across europe three selected realizations are shown in the lower panels of fig 10 the examples illustrate that not only severe overestimation or equally underestimation of the magnitude of the event is possible what is striking is that the centre of the event is also interchangeable with possible realizations showing the most drought prone area in either central europe left northern italy centre or spain right panel the results suggest that the sdis are prone to substantial local and spatial uncertainty that hampers accurate assessments of droughts at the regional scale 5 3 recommendations overall in absence of a theoretical justification in the sense of the fisher tippett gnedenko theorem for extreme values there is no unique distribution and the effect of the choice of the distribution is substantial in this light distribution free approaches such as empirical probabilities could offer a useful alternative in this study using empirical probabilities would lead to an uncertainty reduction of 31 for the spi and 12 for the spei case however the disadvantage of empirical probabilities is that they are less robust to biases especially at the tails of the distribution as these biases could generally outweigh or exceed the gains from eliminating the distribution uncertainty from spi calculation no general recommendation can be given at this point nonparametric solutions were also suggested by ghamghami et al 2017 who employed a kernel density estimator soľáková et al 2014 and farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 who used various plotting positions weibull and gringorton or tijdeman et al 2020 for the ssi another approach to reduce distribution uncertainty would be to calculate the standardized drought index with several distributions and using the ensemble mean m s d i as an estimate in the context of ensemble approaches hu et al 2015 applied bootstrapping to get a robust estimate of the spi and sienz et al 2012 used the aic to determine the most suitable distribution however using the m s d i would to our knowledge be a new approach to drought index calculation but has been considered for other applications such as climate model ensembles several approaches to reduce the predictive uncertainty have been proposed e g by deleting non behaving distributions of the ensemble but they are discussed controversy as their theoretical justification is difficult in absence of biases using the m s d i reduces the standard error of the index to the standard error of the ensemble mean this would yield a reduction of the e r m s from 0 38 to 0 11 for the spi and 0 55 to 0 26 for the spei in practice the uncertainty can be much higher as possible biases are not included in the assessment and would add to the calculated uncertainty a third option to reduce the uncertainty of standardized drought indices would be using theoretical probabilities or similarly return periods of the distribution as an index similar to extreme value statistics in hydrology this cannot avoid distribution errors but will reduce the additional errors committed by the z score transformation of the standardized drought index the main problem of the z score transformation is that it stretches the quantile values and also their uncertainty at the tails of the distributions which should increase the errors of extreme drought indices this effect is illustrated by one station in fig 11 where the sensitivity index representing the unit change in the drought index as response to a unit change in precipitation shows an exponential increase for low precipitation values this means on average for the study area that 1 mm additional precipitation would change the z score by 0 05 for an spi of 1 but by 0 22 for an spi of 3 clearly this may lead to an overestimation of drought severity as it was noted in the european 2015 drought study of ionita et al 2017 for extreme spi values in southern europe in this study spi values of 6 corresponded to only 1 mm less of precipitation 0 instead of 1 mm than in average years indeed a minor effect that is more of statistical than practical relevance for comparison the probability score of the empirical probability estimator and the gamma distribution shows a higher sensitivity at moderate precipitation values and a decreasing sensitivity towards the lowest values 6 conclusions spi and spei are widely used drought indices and there are manifold approaches for their calculation we proposed a new one model framework for decomposing the estimation variance of standardized drought indices in order to shed light on what are the most dominant sources of uncertainty we found an averaged expected error of 0 38 for a spi value of 2 and 0 55 in case of the spei which would yield a 95 tolerance interval of 2 76 to 1 24 spi and 3 1 to 0 9 spei this uncertainty is mainly driven by two factors the choice of the distribution and the observation period the observation period was detected as the primary source of uncertainty but can be significantly reduced by using sample sizes of at least 60 years the second major uncertainty the choice of distribution is only slightly affected by an increase of the observational window and appears to be inherent in the standardized drought index our analysis revealed no significant uncertainty contribution by the application of a gof test for our study area furthermore we also found that the method of parameter estimation has no significant influence on final drought index values apart from some interaction effect of parameter estimation and distribution for the spei at longer observational windows additionally if not predetermined by the science question the choice of a longer accumulation period can reduce the uncertainty for the spi but not for the spei as there is a trade off between increasing uncertainty for the observation period and decreasing uncertainty for the selection of the distribution overall the uncertainty of standardized drought indices is substantial and may yield to subjective drought classifications depending on the calculation method chosen alternative approaches as nonparametric methods ensemble approaches or probability based indices could offer a useful

figshare 20780389 v1 yan 2022 1 introduction water demand forecasting wdf is essential for the design and optimal management of water distribution systems wds during the past few decades a wide variety of wdf models has been proposed ranging from statistical models such as auto regressive integrated moving average arima and exponential smoothing models e g caiado 2010 arandia et al 2015 to machine learning models such as artificial neural network support vector regression and random forests herrera et al 2010 romano and kapelan 2014 brentan et al 2017 to more recently developed deep learning models such as gated recurrent unit gru long short term memory lstm and 1d convolution gru guo et al 2018 mu et al 2020 salloom et al 2021 chen et al 2022 around the mid 1970s water utilities started automating their wds by installing and operating telemetry and supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems bunn and reynolds 2009 the water demand data produced by the equipment are then used for forecasting such that the operation of wds can be optimized by using the forecasts historical water demand data contribute significantly to wdf and are frequently used as the only input in many forecasting models e g wong et al 2010 arandia et al 2015 guo et al 2018 salloom et al 2021 chen et al 2022 however the obtained water demand data can contain anomalies on occasions due to failures in wds e g pipe bursts or monitoring systems e g power failure machine fault in either case the contaminated water demand data are invalid to describe the actual water demand and can therefore degrade the performance of a forecasting model however the importance of anomaly detection in water demand data is underestimated or at least not explicitly described in many published papers only very little research involves preprocessing of water demand data for example chen et al 2022 employed seasonal hybrid esd hochenbaum et al 2017 to check for anomalies in their water demand data huang et al 2021 pre processed their data by setting a threshold value if the variation of a data point exceeded the threshold the data point was set to the maximum allowed value computed from the threshold anomaly detection has become a field of interest for many researchers and practitioners blázquez garcía et al 2021 and a number of anomaly detection methods have been proposed such as isolation forest liu et al 2008 2012 and local outlier factor breunig et al 2000 however anomaly detection techniques in the context of time series data especially those that can handle trend and seasonality in the data are rare some methods utilize basic statistics such as median or median absolute deviation mad for anomaly detection basu and meckesheimer 2007 mehrang et al 2015 however these methods only pay attention to global outliers extremely high or low observations that depart significantly from the others and ignore seasonal patterns that might exist in the data also some methods intend to identify anomalies by assuming that the data points are generated by a certain model or distribution for instance carter and streilein 2012 model the structure of the data using variants of exponentially weighted moving average ewma method mehrang et al 2015 assume that the data are approximately normal if the outliers are not taken into account reddy et al 2017 use gaussian mixture models gmm to detect outliers in network traffic etc however the target for anomaly detection in this work is water demand data which exhibits strong seasonality and significant non gaussian behavior to advance the anomaly detection technique applied to water demand data and further enrich anomaly detection techniques in the context of time series data we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method based on an asymmetric encoder decoder asyed model different from the symmetric structure of a traditional autoencoder lecun 1987 where a signal is reproduced from itself asyed has an asymmetric structure where a signal is reproduced from the upstream and downstream information of the signal while the signal itself does not participate in the reconstruction apart from dimensionality reduction as in the case of the traditional autoencoder the reconstruction errors by asyed come also from the departure of the input and target to reconstruct due to the additional source of errors asyed is more powerful in identifying anomalies compared to the traditional autoencoder as demonstrated further in section 5 1 four commonly used anomaly detection methods z score thompson 2006 isolation forest liu et al 2008 2012 local outlier factor breunig et al 2000 and seasonal hybrid esd hochenbaum et al 2017 were involved to allow for a comparison study specifically the experiments were conducted in both uncontrolled and controlled manners where in the uncontrolled experiments the anomalies were not explicitly known while in the controlled experiments artificially contaminated datasets were used for testing the superiority of the proposed method has been demonstrated by results from both experiments this paper is divided into five sections after the introduction water demand data used in this work and results from preliminary analysis of the data are described in section 2 section 3 introduces the proposed method the benchmark methods and performance metrics used in this work and also discusses some experimental details section 4 presents the results from both the uncontrolled and controlled experiments and analyzes the sensitivity of the proposed method section 5 discusses three aspects the motivation for proposing the asymmetric encoder decoder instead of using the traditional autoencoder data resolution and the scope of the proposed method section 6 ends this paper with conclusions 2 data description and preliminary analysis 2 1 data description the data used in this work were produced by the scada system of sd water plant in huzhou china sd water plant together with three other plants provides residential industrial and commercial water for an area of about 1570 km 2 and for more than 600 thousand users the dataset was collected from 2016 6 1 to 2019 5 31 with a sampling interval of 15 min as the subsequent water demand forecasting was applied on an hourly basis the collected data were then aggregated to produce hourly water demand resulting in a total of 26 280 data points the anomaly detection methods involved in this work were applied to the hourly water demand data fig 1 depicts the hourly water demand data where the long time series with a time span of 3 years has been split equally into three pieces as shown by the figure the time series is non stationary with increasing variance over time obviously anomalies exist in the data for example two prominent local minima in july 2017 and 2018 also there are anomalies that depart significantly from seasonal patterns and such anomalies are difficult to distinguish with bare eyes all these show the necessity for data cleansing 2 2 preliminary analysis utilizing the stl seasonal trend decomposition using loess technique cleveland et al 1990 a time series x t can be decomposed as 1 x t t t s t r t where t t s t and r t are the trend seasonal and residual components respectively a preliminary analysis has shown that the water demand data exhibit dual seasonality daily and weekly as exemplified in fig 2 where the stl technique is used to decompose a snippet from the overall dataset as shown in the figure the y axes of different stl components are quite different for example the daily seasonal component ranges from about 2700 to 2500 m 3 while the weekly seasonal component ranges from about 1100 to 100 m 3 as a result it is difficult to get a hint on the relative strength of each component thus we have used the following statistic to measure the relative strength of each component in the stl decomposition 2 f i v i j 1 n v j for i 1 n where v i is the variance of the i th component and n is the number of components in the decomposition namely the strength of a component is measured by how much of the total variance can be explained by it with the sum of the variances as the denominator the sum of the strengths of all the components is 1 fig 3 depicts the strength of each stl component in our data specifically a window length of 30 days was used for evaluating the variance and the window moved forward with a step size of 1 day till it reached the end of the time series as shown in the figure a remarkable portion of the total variance can be explained by the daily seasonal component with a maximum strength of 98 5 and a mean strength of 66 the strength of the trend component is unstable varying from 0 06 to 52 92 while the strength of the residual component shows a declining tendency on the whole 3 methodology in this section we first introduce the proposed asymmetric encoder decoder model and model based anomaly detection method then we describe the four benchmark methods z score isolation forest local outlier factor and seasonal hybrid esd finally we introduce the performance metrics used in this work 3 1 asymmetric encoder decoder 3 1 1 model deduction an encoder decoder or autoencoder is a feed forward neural network that works in two phases encoding and decoding lempitsky 2021 where in the encoding phase an input signal x is mapped to a low dimensional latent representation z by eq 3 and in the decoding phase x is reconstructed from z by eq 4 3 z σ w x b 4 x ˆ σ w z b where w or w and b or b are the weight and bias respectively σ or σ is a nonlinear transformation function due to the dimensionality reduction as illustrated in fig 4 left x cannot be reconstructed completely and the autoencoder is trained to minimize the reconstruction error x x ˆ unsupervised anomaly detection based on the encoder decoder network is generally accomplished by reconstructing signals with large reconstruction errors indicating possible anomalies in the data an and cho 2015 considering the target for anomaly detection is hourly water demand data which exhibits strong daily seasonality i e period 24 to extract the daily pattern from the data we construct the following data snippet 5 x l n x l n i for i 24 n 24 n 1 24 n l with the superscript n denoting the index of the day and the subscript l denoting the number of elements in the snippet thus x l n represents a data window with l elements and every increment or decrement in n means to move the window forward or backward by a step of 24 instead of using x l n itself for reconstruction we feed the encoder decoder network with a constructed snippet 6 y l n j x l n j x l n 1 x l n 1 x l n j where the square brackets denote the concatenation operation and the superscript j denotes the number of previous and subsequent days considered in the reconstruction considering the strong daily seasonality inherent in the data y l n j is highly correlated with x l n as it contains 2 j repetitions of x l n from both the upstream and downstream sides of the time axis namely a signal is reconstructed from its upstream and downstream information while the signal itself does not participate in the reconstruction the encoder decoder network is trained to minimize the reconstruction error which is calculated as the sum of squared errors over the l elements 7 sse x l n x l n i 24 n 24 n l x l n i x l n i 2 where x l n is the reconstructed version of x l n different from the symmetric structure of an autoencoder the proposed encoder decoder is asymmetric the output x l n contains l elements while the input y l n j contains 2 j l elements see the difference of the two in model structure in fig 4 3 1 2 model setup the parameter configuration used to build the asymmetric encoder decoder abbr asyed model is summarized in table 1 specifically we have set l 24 i e x 24 n as normally if a failure occurs the resultant anomalies are likely to be continuous yet the failure can rarely last for more than a day hence we have chosen to reconstruct daily data as for the parameter j the number of days before and after the target snippet to consider in the reconstruction a preliminary analysis has shown that j 3 generally produces lower reconstruction errors compared to the other alternatives j 1 or 2 to analyze how this parameter influences the model performance we have conducted a sensitivity analysis in section 4 3 2 with a traditional autoencoder one would expect a remarkable influence from the latent space dimensionality the greater the reduction in dimensionality the more reconstruction errors induced yet the latent space dimensionality plays a less important role in the asyed network due to the separation of the input and target to reconstruct similar reconstruction errors were observed with latent dimensions of 12 8 and 4 for simplicity we have chosen 4 as the latent space dimensionality regarding the number of hidden layers used in the network theoretically the more hidden layers used the more fitting capability of the model but the gain is at the risk of overfitting and a slow convergence rate nonetheless the hidden layer is necessary especially when used in combination with a nonlinear activation function otherwise one would observe a similar dimensionality reduction as observed in principal component analysis pca considering the relatively simple model structure we have used only one hidden layer for both the encoder and decoder the number of nodes in each hidden layer is determined using grid search taking into account that a simple neural network is preferred the activation function rectified linear unit relu is employed as it is simple and effective as for the other hyperparameters optimizer learning rate and batch size they mainly influence the convergence rate hence we do not discuss them here in specific 3 1 3 data preparation due to the non stationarity of the water demand data we have partitioned the long time series into overlapping windows with a window length of 30 days and an overlapping length of 20 days between every two windows this results in 108 overlapping windows each consists of 24 30 720 data points the relatively long overlapping length is for safety reasons such that the same data point appears in three consecutive windows and only those points that have been identified as anomalies more than once in different windows are considered anomalous in the end note that the same segmentation strategy is applied to all the anomaly detection methods involved in this work by assuming relative stationarity exists in each window the asymmetric encoder decoder asyed model is trained by data from the window let x denote an arbitrary window i e x x i for i 1 m m 720 in our setting and scale x between 0 and 1 to ensure a rapid convergence rate in the training process we economize on the data by reconstructing every possible snippet x l n in x this means a new snippet is obtained by moving the last snippet one step forward along time the resultant target snippets can be written as 8 x l 1 x j l 1 x j l l 9 x l 2 x j l 2 x j l l 1 10 x l n x m j l l 1 x m j l then construct the corresponding y l n j for every x l n where n 1 n note that the reconstruction can only begin from the j l 1 th element and end at the m j l th element in x because the upstream and downstream information are required in the reconstruction to also have reconstruction results on both ends we have lengthened the data window by j 1 days on both sides such that every data point in x has l reconstructed values 3 1 4 algorithm for anomaly detection having obtained the data from x i e y l n j x l n for n 1 n we separate the data into training and testing sets and apply the following algorithm to detect anomalies in x 1 let f ϕ g θ denote the encoder and decoder of the asyed model respectively where ϕ θ are their respective parameters initialize ϕ and θ 2 compute the sum of reconstruction errors on the training set i e 11 e n 1 n sse x l n x l n where x l n g θ f ϕ y l n j and n n is the number of samples in the training set see eq 7 for the definition sse update ϕ θ using the gradients of e 3 check the convergence of the parameters on the testing set if converged stop training and go to the next step otherwise go back to step 2 and continue with the training 4 having obtained the optimized parameters ϕ and θ compute for every y l n j the corresponding x l n 12 x l n g θ f ϕ y l n j for n 1 n then at each point in x there are l reconstructed values and compute the mean this results in a reconstructed x ˆ and compute the corresponding reconstruction errors 13 e i x ˆ i x i for i 1 m 5 the obtained e i follows a gaussian distribution by analogy with the z score as defined in eqn 16 e i is scaled by its standard deviation 14 e sc i e i σ e note that we do not correct the mean of e i as it is an error term generally the mean of e i is not exactly at zero tiny bias exists in the reconstruction results for each window 6 a threshold value α is used to identify anomalies if e sc k α then the corresponding x k is identified as a suspected anomaly the above results in a list of suspected anomalies x k 7 preliminary analysis has shown that large reconstruction errors might exist at places with sharp changes dramatic increase or decrease these errors could be induced by a advance or lag of changes in the signal compared to its upstream and downstream neighbors as illustrated by point b in fig 5 b or by extremely high or low values nearby as illustrated by point a in fig 5 where the anomalous minimum at downstream results in a large reconstruction error at point a in either case the resultant large reconstruction errors should not be considered for anomaly detection purposes since these errors will drop significantly if reconstruction results at adjacent points are used we have applied an additional filtering for each element in the suspected list if 15 min x ˆ k 1 x k σ e x ˆ k 1 x k σ e α 1 then x k is considered normal and eliminated from the list otherwise it is identified as an anomaly specifically we have tightened the rule by using a threshold value α 1 α 3 1 5 model training for training the asyed model i e steps 1 to 3 in the algorithm described in section 3 1 4 one cannot use all the samples as obtained in section 3 1 3 otherwise apart from extracting effective information the model would also catch useless details in the data i e overfitting thus we separate the data into training and testing sets train the model only on the training set and determine the convergence of model parameters on the testing data if the reconstruction error on the testing set ceases to decrease we stop training and consider having obtained the optimized parameters previous analysis has shown that how to split the training and testing sets was not significantly important in our case we have tried train test ratios of 80 versus 20 90 versus 10 and 95 versus 5 and the results were similar benefiting from the relatively simple network structure we were far from the risk of overfitting and highly similar learning curves were observed from reconstruction errors evaluated from the training and testing sets 3 2 benchmark methods since in the literature there is still no consensus on the terms used to refer to anomalies e g outliers peculiarities contaminants etc we have used the two most frequently seen terms anomaly and outlier interchangeably in the following description carrera et al 2019 3 2 1 z score method z score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean as formulated by 16 z x μ ˆ σ ˆ where μ ˆ and σ ˆ are mean and standard deviation evaluated from the samples respectively commonly seen cut off values for identifying anomalies are 3 i e the so called 3 σ rule thompson 2006 in a population that follows a gaussian distribution z score values more extreme than 3 have a probability of 0 0027 this method assumes that the underlying data distribution is normal yet water demand data frequently exhibit a multi modal distribution as exemplified in fig 6 the presence of multiple modes yields a higher value of standard deviation which in turn can lead to masking of detection of some true anomalies hochenbaum et al 2017 nonetheless the z score method has the potential to capture large global outliers extremely high or low observations and we have adopted it as a baseline model 3 2 2 isolation forest isolation forest liu et al 2008 2012 isolates samples by randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values this partitioning goes on recursively till each sample in the dataset has been isolated since recursive partitioning can be represented by a tree structure i e isolation tree the number of splittings required to isolate a sample is equivalent to the path length from the root node to the terminating node in the tree as anomalies generally need fewer partitions to be isolated random partitioning produces shorter paths for the anomalies in the isolation tree thus distinguishing them from the rest of the data given a dataset with n samples m subsets are generated by randomly drawing ψ samples ψ n from the dataset then m isolation trees are built by recursively generating partitions on each of the subsets let h x 0 ψ 1 denote the path length of a data point x the anomaly score of x is computed by 17 s x ψ 2 e h x c ψ where e h x is the expected path length of x evaluated from the m isolation trees and c ψ is the average path length as computed by 18 c ψ 2 h ψ 1 2 ψ 1 n for ψ 2 where h is the harmonic number as estimated by l n 0 5772156649 euler s constant the anomaly score s ranges from 0 to 1 if e h x equals the average path length c ψ then s 0 5 samples that have s much smaller than 0 5 are quite safe to be regarded as normal because these samples need more partitions to be isolated contrarily an s close to 1 indicates a data point that has a high suspicion of being an outlier specifically we have employed m 100 ψ 256 as recommended by liu et al 2008 3 2 3 local outlier factor local outlier factor is a density based method which detects anomalies by computing the local density deviation of a data point with respect to its neighbors and considers as anomalies the samples that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors breunig et al 2000 this method introduces a measure termed local outlier factor lof to quantify how anomalous a data point is to compute the lof of a data point x three quantities should be pre computed first the k distance of x which is defined as the distance between x and its k t h nearest neighbor x k as denoted by x x k based on this quantity the reachability distance of x w r t any other point x is computed as 19 rd k x x max x x k x x the rd can be regarded as a stabilized variant of the actual distance x x as it reduces the statistical fluctuation for all the points close to x such that the value of rd is no less than the k distance of x then the local reachability density of x is computed as 20 lrd k x 1 k i 1 k rd k x i x 1 which is the inverse of the average rd s of the k nearest neighbors of x finally the local outlier factor of x is computed as 21 lof k x 1 k i 1 k lrd k x i lrd k x intuitively the lof is the ratio of the average lrd of the neighbors of x and that of itself x is regarded as an anomaly if its neighbors are in high density region and itself in low density region i e a large lof value and vice versa as this method is applied to 1d time series data the distance in this context is the absolute value of the subtract of two data points specifically in our case this method is not sensitive to the parameter k when 10 k 50 where relatively good performance can be obtained hence we have employed k 20 in the experiment 3 2 4 seasonal hybrid esd this is a technique specifically designed for time series data that exhibit seasonality as suggested by the name it has experienced the evolution from esd extreme studentized deviate test to seasonal esd and finally to seasonal hybrid esd most fundamentally the esd rosner 1983 is a statistical test for detecting multiple anomalies in a univariate dataset the test explicitly requires an upper bound for the suspected number of anomalies given this upper bound k the test statistic is computed as 22 r i max i x i x s with x s denoting sample mean and standard deviation respective specifically the above statistic is computed by removing the most extreme observation repeatedly until k most extreme observations have been removed which results in k test statistics r 1 r k then correspondingly k critical values are computed as 23 λ i n i t p n i 1 n i 1 t p n i 1 2 n i 1 for i 1 k where n is the number of samples t p ν is the 100 p percentage point from the t distribution with ν degrees of freedom and p is related to the significance level α viz p 1 α 2 n i 1 finally the number of anomalies is determined by finding the largest i such that r i λ i the esd assumes a normal data distribution which limits its applicability for time series data that usually exhibit seasonality and non gaussian behavior to solve this problem the seasonal esd utilizes a modified stl to extract the residual component r x from the raw time series x 24 r x x s x x where s x is the seasonal component as determined by stl and x is the median of the raw time series the esd test is then applied to r x instead of to the raw time series specifically in the above equation the trend component has been replaced by the robust median because the trend is sensitive to anomalies and can thus result in high fluctuations in the residual component finally the seasonal hybrid esd has advanced seasonal esd by replacing the mean and standard deviation used in eq 22 with more robust median and mad mean absolute deviation respectively such that it is more capable of dealing with datasets with a high percentage of anomalies 3 3 performance metrics f 1 score lever et al 2016 is normally used to evaluate binary classification systems it is calculated as the harmonic mean of the precision and recall i e 25 recall r tp tp fn 26 precision p tp tp fp 27 f 1 r p 2 r p r p where tp fn and fp are numbers of true positives false negatives and false positives respectively specifically the true positive tp false negative fn and false positive fp indicate that a true anomaly is identified a true anomaly is ignored and a false anomaly is identified respectively f 1 score has been used in the literature to assess the performance of an anomaly detection method e g taormina and galelli 2018 daniel et al 2022 however we find this metric problematic when used to assess model performance in identifying anomalies in water demand data as it ignores the continuity mechanism of anomalies found in the data which we explain in the following example in fig 7 we use a series of balls to represent water demand data where the anomaly detection results are also shown to calculate the recall the 3 red balls tp and 1 black ball fn weigh equally in eq 25 hence the recall is 0 75 however in the context of water demand data where the anomalies are often found to be continuous the scenario is that there are two anomaly clusters the recognized one contains 3 elements while the unrecognized one contains only 1 compared to the recall defined in eq 25 we pay more attention to the ratio of the number of true anomaly clusters identified to the total number of true anomaly clusters hence we propose to use the cluster based recall r c defined in eq 28 and the resultant recall is 0 5 likewise to calculate the precision 3 tp s and 3 fp s result in a precision value of 0 5 by eq 26 yet the scenario is that among the three anomaly clusters identified only one is correct compared to the precision defined in eq 26 we pay more attention to the ratio of the number of correctly identified anomaly clusters to the total number of anomaly clusters identified hence we propose to use the cluster based precision p c as defined in eqn 29 and the resultant precision is 0 333 28 r c tp c tp c fn c 29 p c tp c tp c fp c 30 f 1 r c p c 2 r c p c r c p c where tp c fn c and fp c are numbers of true anomaly clusters identified true anomaly clusters ignored and false anomaly clusters identified respectively instead of using the original f 1 score we have used the cluster based f 1 score computed from r c and p c as defined in eq 30 this cluster based metric considers the continuity mechanism of anomalies found in water demand data because it evaluates the performance of a method in identifying anomaly clusters and the anomaly cluster can contain a single or several continuous anomalies 3 4 experiment 3 4 1 experimental procedure the five anomaly detection methods asymmetric encoder decoder asyed z score isolation forest iforest local outlier factor lof and seasonal hybrid esd shesd were applied to the hourly water demand data i e 108 overlapping windows generated from the overall dataset specifically the experimental procedure went as follows a first we applied these methods to original datasets where anomalies were not explicitly known i e uncontrolled experiments b then we observed dynamics from detected anomalies and simulated anomalies according to the observed dynamics c and then we contaminated those clean datasets where none of these methods had found any anomalies d and finally we applied these methods to the artificially contaminated datasets i e controlled experiments 3 4 2 anomaly generation randomly generated anomalies were used to contaminate clean datasets the anomalies were generated according to the rules that were summarized in uncontrolled experiments specifically these rules are as follows the number of anomaly clusters introduced is limited to 3 namely the occurrence of abnormal events is no more than 3 times within 30 days the number of elements in a cluster is limited to 4 namely the system is allowed to remain abnormal for less than 5 hours three kinds of anomalies are considered 20 25 increases 25 50 decreases and random fluctuations to model the random fluctuations we first scale the data between 0 and 1 and then replace values at randomly selected locations with values that are randomly drawn from 0 1 0 9 and finally transform the perturbed data back to the original scale 3 4 3 critical values the critical values used to identify anomalies by each method were roughly adjusted in uncontrolled experiments at first and then fine tuned in controlled experiments table 2 shows the critical values that were finally determined in the controlled experiments 4 results 4 1 results from uncontrolled experiments among the results from the 108 windows we focus on those from window 77 whose location in the overall dataset is marked in fig 1 this window was chosen not only because of the presence of anomalies but also because of the remarkable descending trend in the subsequent window window 78 which could be used further to test the robustness of each method in handling trends the results from window 77 are shown in fig 8 as shown in the figure both iforest and lof detect the global outliers at points 194 and 195 but have different opinions at points 177 192 and 579 the asyed method also considers points 194 and 195 anomalous yet it considers the other 3 points normal as their reconstruction errors are within the critical range the shesd method identifies as anomalies several continuous points which depart significantly from the seasonal pattern but fails to detect the global anomalies the z score method fails to detect any anomalies in this case due to the highly non gaussian data distribution as shown in fig 9 a where the presence of dual modes in the distribution leads to the masking of detection while the near gaussian distribution of reconstruction errors from asyed as shown on panel b justifies the application of the z score analogous test on the reconstruction errors as a brief summary iforest and lof are effective for detecting global outliers shesd is effective for detecting seasonal outliers while asyed is effective for both to test the robustness of these methods in handling trends we have applied them to an extended dataset window 77 extended by window 78 without repetition the results are shown in fig 10 as shown in the figure iforest and lof miss the global outliers at points 194 and 195 given the descending trend brought in by window 78 iforest and lof consider these two points are not exceptionally small the shesd method in this case detects completely different anomalies from those detected in figs 8 a the reason for the unsteady behavior of shesd is that it uses median to replace the trend component see eq 24 and this simple approach can lead to errors when encountering data with nonlinear trends the asyed method in contrast is more robust to trends its framework of using upstream and downstream information to reconstruct signals in the middle enables it to deal with linear or nonlinear trends in the data as shown in fig 10 in the middle asyed in this case still considers points 194 and 195 anomalous yet given the additional information downstream it lowers the suspicions on those seasonal anomalies as identified before marked in green in the figure and considers them normal this time this also explains why a relatively long overlapping length between windows is employed in this way every data point has a chance to be placed in a relatively central position in a window such that the model gets adequate information upstream and downstream to decide how anomalous the point is only those points that have been identified twice as anomalies in different windows are considered anomalous in the end 4 2 results from controlled experiments from the 108 windows we have selected 19 where none of these methods had detected any anomalies and contaminated these windows with randomly generated anomalies see section 3 4 2 for the rules applied when generating anomalies the contaminated windows were then used for testing fig 11 shows one of the results from window 106 where the upper panel shows the three anomaly clusters introduced specifically values at indices 150 153 were increased by 25 random fluctuations were introduced at indices 301 304 and values at indices 339 340 were decreased by 50 as shown in fig 11 the z score method fails to detect any anomalies iforest detects 1 among a total of 3 anomaly clusters introduced lof detects 2 among the 3 shesd also detects 2 but it detects a false alarm at index 534 asyed detects all of the 3 anomaly clusters introduced considering it is difficult to identify every element of a cluster once a member of a cluster is identified the cluster is considered identified using the performance metrics introduced in section 3 3 the cluster based f 1 scores of z score iforest lof shesd and asyed are 0 0 5 0 8 0 667 and 1 respectively for each of these 19 windows we have conducted 50 times the procedure contaminate the window detect anomalies using different methods and compute the score of each method the mean scores over 50 repeated tests of each method are summarized in table 3 with the highest score in each window printed in bold it can be seen from the table that 18 best performances are from asyed versus 1 from shesd which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over the others the performance of the z score method is most unsatisfactory the performances of iforest and lof are a little bit better than that of the z score method with mean scores of 0 272 and 0 296 respectively the performance of shesd is unstable ranging from the lowest score of 0 138 to the highest score of 0 893 with a mean score of 0 482 apart from its unsteady performance when encountering nonlinear trends shesd cannot handle tiny temporal shifts advance or lag in the seasonal pattern especially at places with sharp changes yet these tiny shifts are commonly seen in water demand data as a result shesd often detects false anomalies for example the one detected at index 534 in fig 11 b different from shesd asyed explicitly handles the tiny shifts mentioned above by applying an additional filtering step 7 in its algorithm described in section 3 1 4 hence the performance of asyed is relatively stable with the lowest score of 0 731 highest score of 0 984 and a mean score of 0 871 4 3 sensitivity analysis 4 3 1 effects of critical values to analyze the effect of critical values α α 1 on the performance of the asymmetric encoder decoder asyed model the same controlled experiments were conducted but the anomalies were identified using different critical values α 2 5 2 6 3 2 and α 1 1 5 1 6 2 5 the results show that the effect of critical values varies from window to window as exemplified in fig 12 where the mean scores over 50 repeated tests of asyed in windows 32 79 and 99 are shown specifically in each sub figure the combinations of α α 1 that produce the highest scores i e the optimal critical values are marked by the red triangles as shown in the figure the optimal critical values are different in each window likewise the sensitivity of asyed to critical values varies from window to window for example the model is more sensitive in window 32 than in window 99 for simplicity we have used α 3 0 α 1 2 0 uniformly in this work because scores obtained by using this combination are generally high as marked by the squares in each sub figure in fig 12 4 3 2 effects of parameter j parameter j is the number of days before and after the target snippet to consider in the reconstruction to analyze its effect on the performance of the asymmetric encoder decoder asyed model the same controlled experiments were conducted by using the asyed model parameterized by different j 1 2 and 3 see table 1 for model configurations used with different j values the results are shown in fig 13 with the x axis denoting the ids of the 19 selected windows like in the case of critical values effects of parameter j also exhibit an event based distinction as shown in the figure there is no single j that produces the highest score for every window but the scores obtained by using j 3 are generally high in this case the mean scores over the 19 windows for j 1 2 and 3 are 0 796 0 829 and 0 871 respectively we did not consider a higher j value because previous analysis has shown that benefits of increasing j were limited at about j 3 due to these reasons we have chosen j 3 in this work 5 discussion 5 1 asymmetric encoder decoder versus traditional autoencoder in this work we have proposed an asymmetric encoder decoder asyed model different from the traditional autoencoder abbr ae where a signal is reproduced from itself asyed reproduces a signal by using the upstream and downstream information of the signal while the signal itself does not participate in the reconstruction due to this difference asyed is more powerful in anomaly detection task as an illustrative example we use ae and asyed to detect anomalies in an artificially contaminated dataset and the results are shown in fig 14 specifically ae has employed the same algorithm and critical values as asyed both ae and asyed reconstruct daily data x 24 n the difference is that the former uses daily data itself while the latter uses 3 days data before and after day n in the reconstruction thus the reconstruction errors by ae come solely from dimensionality reduction 24 to 4 latent space dimension and then back to 24 while apart from dimensionality reduction the reconstruction errors by asyed come also from the departure of input and target to reconstruct due to the additional source of errors asyed is more sensitive to anomalies in this example ae only detects 1 anomaly cluster among a total of 3 while asyed detects all of the 3 anomaly clusters introduced similar as the case shown in fig 14 previous analysis also shows that ae based models are generally insensitive to anomalous decreases and seasonal anomalies data points that depart significantly from the seasonal pattern due to these reasons we have proposed this asymmetric encoder decoder model for anomaly detection instead of using the traditional autoencoder 5 2 on data resolution in this work we have aggregated the raw sub hourly data with 15 min resolution to hourly frequency and employed the proposed method to detect anomalies in hourly water demand data the motivations for doing so are as follows 1 the subsequent water demand forecasting is applied on an hourly basis and further hourly predictions of water demand are frequently used by water managers to determine optimal regulation and pumping schemes hence water demand forecasting on an hourly basis continues to be the research hotspot of many scholars e g herrera et al 2010 chen and boccelli 2018 ambrosio et al 2019 hu et al 2021 huang et al 2021 2 like many quantities in nature or industry e g rainfall power consumption etc temporal aggregation is an effective tool to smooth out fluctuations in data for example rainfall accumulated on an hourly basis is smoother than that accumulated every 15 min from this perspective and back to water demand data if anomalies were detected on data aggregated on an hourly basis then one would be more convinced of the authenticity of the detected anomalies compared to those detected on the raw data with 15 min resolution considering the reasons above we have used the proposed method to detect anomalies in hourly water demand data however the effectiveness of the proposed method on different data resolutions e g 15 min 30 min should be further explored 5 3 the scope of the proposed method the framework of the proposed asymmetric encoder decoder asyed model to reconstruct a signal given its upstream and downstream information has already confined its scope it is suitable for time series data that exhibit relatively strong seasonality apart from considering the seasonality the proposed method can also handle linear or nonlinear trends in the data however when the strength of the residual component aka the unpredictable part in time series data is too strong the reconstruction is problematic hence the performance of the proposed method cannot be guaranteed as the proposed method detects anomalies in an unsupervised manner there should not be too many anomalies in the dataset otherwise it would be problematic when training the asyed model i e a considerable portion of the training data would be contaminated according to the results from the controlled experiments the proposed method works satisfactorily on datasets with an anomaly ratio up to 1 67 12 anomalies in a total of 720 data points yet we have not tried a higher ratio as this ability is adequate for anomaly detection in hourly water demand data 6 conclusions in this paper we have proposed a method for anomaly detection in hourly water demand data based on an asymmetric encoder decoder asyed model different from the traditional autoencoder where a signal is reproduced from itself asyed reproduces a signal by using the information upstream and downstream of the signal while the signal itself does not participate in the reconstruction in light of this feature asyed is more powerful in identifying anomalies than the traditional autoencoder to assess model performance in identifying anomalies we did not employ the commonly used f 1 score as this metric ignores the continuity mechanism of anomalies found in water demand data to solve the problem of the conventional f 1 score we have proposed its cluster based variant which uses cluster based true positives false negatives and false positives for performance evaluation we have employed the proposed method to detect anomalies in hourly water demand data and the performance of the proposed method was compared with those of four commonly used anomaly detection methods z score isolation forest local outlier factor and seasonal hybrid esd in specific the experiments were conducted in uncontrolled and controlled manners in the former case anomalies were not explicitly known while in the latter case artificially contaminated datasets were used for testing the results from the uncontrolled experiments show that compared to the other alternatives asyed is effective for detecting both global and seasonal anomalies and is more robust to trends in the data the results from the controlled experiments demonstrate the superiority of asyed quantitatively where it wins with scores way ahead of the others sensitivity analyses were also made to analyze the effects of two factors critical values used to identify anomalies and model parameter j the amount of upstream and downstream information considered in signal reconstruction the results show that the effects of the two factors are different from case to case and it is impossible to obtain a uniform setting that is optimal for every case however there exist settings that lead to good performance in general credit authorship contribution statement jieru yan

figshare 20780389 v1 yan 2022 1 introduction water demand forecasting wdf is essential for the design and optimal management of water distribution systems wds during the past few decades a wide variety of wdf models has been proposed ranging from statistical models such as auto regressive integrated moving average arima and exponential smoothing models e g caiado 2010 arandia et al 2015 to machine learning models such as artificial neural network support vector regression and random forests herrera et al 2010 romano and kapelan 2014 brentan et al 2017 to more recently developed deep learning models such as gated recurrent unit gru long short term memory lstm and 1d convolution gru guo et al 2018 mu et al 2020 salloom et al 2021 chen et al 2022 around the mid 1970s water utilities started automating their wds by installing and operating telemetry and supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems bunn and reynolds 2009 the water demand data produced by the equipment are then used for forecasting such that the operation of wds can be optimized by using the forecasts historical water demand data contribute significantly to wdf and are frequently used as the only input in many forecasting models e g wong et al 2010 arandia et al 2015 guo et al 2018 salloom et al 2021 chen et al 2022 however the obtained water demand data can contain anomalies on occasions due to failures in wds e g pipe bursts or monitoring systems e g power failure machine fault in either case the contaminated water demand data are invalid to describe the actual water demand and can therefore degrade the performance of a forecasting model however the importance of anomaly detection in water demand data is underestimated or at least not explicitly described in many published papers only very little research involves preprocessing of water demand data for example chen et al 2022 employed seasonal hybrid esd hochenbaum et al 2017 to check for anomalies in their water demand data huang et al 2021 pre processed their data by setting a threshold value if the variation of a data point exceeded the threshold the data point was set to the maximum allowed value computed from the threshold anomaly detection has become a field of interest for many researchers and practitioners blázquez garcía et al 2021 and a number of anomaly detection methods have been proposed such as isolation forest liu et al 2008 2012 and local outlier factor breunig et al 2000 however anomaly detection techniques in the context of time series data especially those that can handle trend and seasonality in the data are rare some methods utilize basic statistics such as median or median absolute deviation mad for anomaly detection basu and meckesheimer 2007 mehrang et al 2015 however these methods only pay attention to global outliers extremely high or low observations that depart significantly from the others and ignore seasonal patterns that might exist in the data also some methods intend to identify anomalies by assuming that the data points are generated by a certain model or distribution for instance carter and streilein 2012 model the structure of the data using variants of exponentially weighted moving average ewma method mehrang et al 2015 assume that the data are approximately normal if the outliers are not taken into account reddy et al 2017 use gaussian mixture models gmm to detect outliers in network traffic etc however the target for anomaly detection in this work is water demand data which exhibits strong seasonality and significant non gaussian behavior to advance the anomaly detection technique applied to water demand data and further enrich anomaly detection techniques in the context of time series data we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method based on an asymmetric encoder decoder asyed model different from the symmetric structure of a traditional autoencoder lecun 1987 where a signal is reproduced from itself asyed has an asymmetric structure where a signal is reproduced from the upstream and downstream information of the signal while the signal itself does not participate in the reconstruction apart from dimensionality reduction as in the case of the traditional autoencoder the reconstruction errors by asyed come also from the departure of the input and target to reconstruct due to the additional source of errors asyed is more powerful in identifying anomalies compared to the traditional autoencoder as demonstrated further in section 5 1 four commonly used anomaly detection methods z score thompson 2006 isolation forest liu et al 2008 2012 local outlier factor breunig et al 2000 and seasonal hybrid esd hochenbaum et al 2017 were involved to allow for a comparison study specifically the experiments were conducted in both uncontrolled and controlled manners where in the uncontrolled experiments the anomalies were not explicitly known while in the controlled experiments artificially contaminated datasets were used for testing the superiority of the proposed method has been demonstrated by results from both experiments this paper is divided into five sections after the introduction water demand data used in this work and results from preliminary analysis of the data are described in section 2 section 3 introduces the proposed method the benchmark methods and performance metrics used in this work and also discusses some experimental details section 4 presents the results from both the uncontrolled and controlled experiments and analyzes the sensitivity of the proposed method section 5 discusses three aspects the motivation for proposing the asymmetric encoder decoder instead of using the traditional autoencoder data resolution and the scope of the proposed method section 6 ends this paper with conclusions 2 data description and preliminary analysis 2 1 data description the data used in this work were produced by the scada system of sd water plant in huzhou china sd water plant together with three other plants provides residential industrial and commercial water for an area of about 1570 km 2 and for more than 600 thousand users the dataset was collected from 2016 6 1 to 2019 5 31 with a sampling interval of 15 min as the subsequent water demand forecasting was applied on an hourly basis the collected data were then aggregated to produce hourly water demand resulting in a total of 26 280 data points the anomaly detection methods involved in this work were applied to the hourly water demand data fig 1 depicts the hourly water demand data where the long time series with a time span of 3 years has been split equally into three pieces as shown by the figure the time series is non stationary with increasing variance over time obviously anomalies exist in the data for example two prominent local minima in july 2017 and 2018 also there are anomalies that depart significantly from seasonal patterns and such anomalies are difficult to distinguish with bare eyes all these show the necessity for data cleansing 2 2 preliminary analysis utilizing the stl seasonal trend decomposition using loess technique cleveland et al 1990 a time series x t can be decomposed as 1 x t t t s t r t where t t s t and r t are the trend seasonal and residual components respectively a preliminary analysis has shown that the water demand data exhibit dual seasonality daily and weekly as exemplified in fig 2 where the stl technique is used to decompose a snippet from the overall dataset as shown in the figure the y axes of different stl components are quite different for example the daily seasonal component ranges from about 2700 to 2500 m 3 while the weekly seasonal component ranges from about 1100 to 100 m 3 as a result it is difficult to get a hint on the relative strength of each component thus we have used the following statistic to measure the relative strength of each component in the stl decomposition 2 f i v i j 1 n v j for i 1 n where v i is the variance of the i th component and n is the number of components in the decomposition namely the strength of a component is measured by how much of the total variance can be explained by it with the sum of the variances as the denominator the sum of the strengths of all the components is 1 fig 3 depicts the strength of each stl component in our data specifically a window length of 30 days was used for evaluating the variance and the window moved forward with a step size of 1 day till it reached the end of the time series as shown in the figure a remarkable portion of the total variance can be explained by the daily seasonal component with a maximum strength of 98 5 and a mean strength of 66 the strength of the trend component is unstable varying from 0 06 to 52 92 while the strength of the residual component shows a declining tendency on the whole 3 methodology in this section we first introduce the proposed asymmetric encoder decoder model and model based anomaly detection method then we describe the four benchmark methods z score isolation forest local outlier factor and seasonal hybrid esd finally we introduce the performance metrics used in this work 3 1 asymmetric encoder decoder 3 1 1 model deduction an encoder decoder or autoencoder is a feed forward neural network that works in two phases encoding and decoding lempitsky 2021 where in the encoding phase an input signal x is mapped to a low dimensional latent representation z by eq 3 and in the decoding phase x is reconstructed from z by eq 4 3 z σ w x b 4 x ˆ σ w z b where w or w and b or b are the weight and bias respectively σ or σ is a nonlinear transformation function due to the dimensionality reduction as illustrated in fig 4 left x cannot be reconstructed completely and the autoencoder is trained to minimize the reconstruction error x x ˆ unsupervised anomaly detection based on the encoder decoder network is generally accomplished by reconstructing signals with large reconstruction errors indicating possible anomalies in the data an and cho 2015 considering the target for anomaly detection is hourly water demand data which exhibits strong daily seasonality i e period 24 to extract the daily pattern from the data we construct the following data snippet 5 x l n x l n i for i 24 n 24 n 1 24 n l with the superscript n denoting the index of the day and the subscript l denoting the number of elements in the snippet thus x l n represents a data window with l elements and every increment or decrement in n means to move the window forward or backward by a step of 24 instead of using x l n itself for reconstruction we feed the encoder decoder network with a constructed snippet 6 y l n j x l n j x l n 1 x l n 1 x l n j where the square brackets denote the concatenation operation and the superscript j denotes the number of previous and subsequent days considered in the reconstruction considering the strong daily seasonality inherent in the data y l n j is highly correlated with x l n as it contains 2 j repetitions of x l n from both the upstream and downstream sides of the time axis namely a signal is reconstructed from its upstream and downstream information while the signal itself does not participate in the reconstruction the encoder decoder network is trained to minimize the reconstruction error which is calculated as the sum of squared errors over the l elements 7 sse x l n x l n i 24 n 24 n l x l n i x l n i 2 where x l n is the reconstructed version of x l n different from the symmetric structure of an autoencoder the proposed encoder decoder is asymmetric the output x l n contains l elements while the input y l n j contains 2 j l elements see the difference of the two in model structure in fig 4 3 1 2 model setup the parameter configuration used to build the asymmetric encoder decoder abbr asyed model is summarized in table 1 specifically we have set l 24 i e x 24 n as normally if a failure occurs the resultant anomalies are likely to be continuous yet the failure can rarely last for more than a day hence we have chosen to reconstruct daily data as for the parameter j the number of days before and after the target snippet to consider in the reconstruction a preliminary analysis has shown that j 3 generally produces lower reconstruction errors compared to the other alternatives j 1 or 2 to analyze how this parameter influences the model performance we have conducted a sensitivity analysis in section 4 3 2 with a traditional autoencoder one would expect a remarkable influence from the latent space dimensionality the greater the reduction in dimensionality the more reconstruction errors induced yet the latent space dimensionality plays a less important role in the asyed network due to the separation of the input and target to reconstruct similar reconstruction errors were observed with latent dimensions of 12 8 and 4 for simplicity we have chosen 4 as the latent space dimensionality regarding the number of hidden layers used in the network theoretically the more hidden layers used the more fitting capability of the model but the gain is at the risk of overfitting and a slow convergence rate nonetheless the hidden layer is necessary especially when used in combination with a nonlinear activation function otherwise one would observe a similar dimensionality reduction as observed in principal component analysis pca considering the relatively simple model structure we have used only one hidden layer for both the encoder and decoder the number of nodes in each hidden layer is determined using grid search taking into account that a simple neural network is preferred the activation function rectified linear unit relu is employed as it is simple and effective as for the other hyperparameters optimizer learning rate and batch size they mainly influence the convergence rate hence we do not discuss them here in specific 3 1 3 data preparation due to the non stationarity of the water demand data we have partitioned the long time series into overlapping windows with a window length of 30 days and an overlapping length of 20 days between every two windows this results in 108 overlapping windows each consists of 24 30 720 data points the relatively long overlapping length is for safety reasons such that the same data point appears in three consecutive windows and only those points that have been identified as anomalies more than once in different windows are considered anomalous in the end note that the same segmentation strategy is applied to all the anomaly detection methods involved in this work by assuming relative stationarity exists in each window the asymmetric encoder decoder asyed model is trained by data from the window let x denote an arbitrary window i e x x i for i 1 m m 720 in our setting and scale x between 0 and 1 to ensure a rapid convergence rate in the training process we economize on the data by reconstructing every possible snippet x l n in x this means a new snippet is obtained by moving the last snippet one step forward along time the resultant target snippets can be written as 8 x l 1 x j l 1 x j l l 9 x l 2 x j l 2 x j l l 1 10 x l n x m j l l 1 x m j l then construct the corresponding y l n j for every x l n where n 1 n note that the reconstruction can only begin from the j l 1 th element and end at the m j l th element in x because the upstream and downstream information are required in the reconstruction to also have reconstruction results on both ends we have lengthened the data window by j 1 days on both sides such that every data point in x has l reconstructed values 3 1 4 algorithm for anomaly detection having obtained the data from x i e y l n j x l n for n 1 n we separate the data into training and testing sets and apply the following algorithm to detect anomalies in x 1 let f ϕ g θ denote the encoder and decoder of the asyed model respectively where ϕ θ are their respective parameters initialize ϕ and θ 2 compute the sum of reconstruction errors on the training set i e 11 e n 1 n sse x l n x l n where x l n g θ f ϕ y l n j and n n is the number of samples in the training set see eq 7 for the definition sse update ϕ θ using the gradients of e 3 check the convergence of the parameters on the testing set if converged stop training and go to the next step otherwise go back to step 2 and continue with the training 4 having obtained the optimized parameters ϕ and θ compute for every y l n j the corresponding x l n 12 x l n g θ f ϕ y l n j for n 1 n then at each point in x there are l reconstructed values and compute the mean this results in a reconstructed x ˆ and compute the corresponding reconstruction errors 13 e i x ˆ i x i for i 1 m 5 the obtained e i follows a gaussian distribution by analogy with the z score as defined in eqn 16 e i is scaled by its standard deviation 14 e sc i e i σ e note that we do not correct the mean of e i as it is an error term generally the mean of e i is not exactly at zero tiny bias exists in the reconstruction results for each window 6 a threshold value α is used to identify anomalies if e sc k α then the corresponding x k is identified as a suspected anomaly the above results in a list of suspected anomalies x k 7 preliminary analysis has shown that large reconstruction errors might exist at places with sharp changes dramatic increase or decrease these errors could be induced by a advance or lag of changes in the signal compared to its upstream and downstream neighbors as illustrated by point b in fig 5 b or by extremely high or low values nearby as illustrated by point a in fig 5 where the anomalous minimum at downstream results in a large reconstruction error at point a in either case the resultant large reconstruction errors should not be considered for anomaly detection purposes since these errors will drop significantly if reconstruction results at adjacent points are used we have applied an additional filtering for each element in the suspected list if 15 min x ˆ k 1 x k σ e x ˆ k 1 x k σ e α 1 then x k is considered normal and eliminated from the list otherwise it is identified as an anomaly specifically we have tightened the rule by using a threshold value α 1 α 3 1 5 model training for training the asyed model i e steps 1 to 3 in the algorithm described in section 3 1 4 one cannot use all the samples as obtained in section 3 1 3 otherwise apart from extracting effective information the model would also catch useless details in the data i e overfitting thus we separate the data into training and testing sets train the model only on the training set and determine the convergence of model parameters on the testing data if the reconstruction error on the testing set ceases to decrease we stop training and consider having obtained the optimized parameters previous analysis has shown that how to split the training and testing sets was not significantly important in our case we have tried train test ratios of 80 versus 20 90 versus 10 and 95 versus 5 and the results were similar benefiting from the relatively simple network structure we were far from the risk of overfitting and highly similar learning curves were observed from reconstruction errors evaluated from the training and testing sets 3 2 benchmark methods since in the literature there is still no consensus on the terms used to refer to anomalies e g outliers peculiarities contaminants etc we have used the two most frequently seen terms anomaly and outlier interchangeably in the following description carrera et al 2019 3 2 1 z score method z score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean as formulated by 16 z x μ ˆ σ ˆ where μ ˆ and σ ˆ are mean and standard deviation evaluated from the samples respectively commonly seen cut off values for identifying anomalies are 3 i e the so called 3 σ rule thompson 2006 in a population that follows a gaussian distribution z score values more extreme than 3 have a probability of 0 0027 this method assumes that the underlying data distribution is normal yet water demand data frequently exhibit a multi modal distribution as exemplified in fig 6 the presence of multiple modes yields a higher value of standard deviation which in turn can lead to masking of detection of some true anomalies hochenbaum et al 2017 nonetheless the z score method has the potential to capture large global outliers extremely high or low observations and we have adopted it as a baseline model 3 2 2 isolation forest isolation forest liu et al 2008 2012 isolates samples by randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values this partitioning goes on recursively till each sample in the dataset has been isolated since recursive partitioning can be represented by a tree structure i e isolation tree the number of splittings required to isolate a sample is equivalent to the path length from the root node to the terminating node in the tree as anomalies generally need fewer partitions to be isolated random partitioning produces shorter paths for the anomalies in the isolation tree thus distinguishing them from the rest of the data given a dataset with n samples m subsets are generated by randomly drawing ψ samples ψ n from the dataset then m isolation trees are built by recursively generating partitions on each of the subsets let h x 0 ψ 1 denote the path length of a data point x the anomaly score of x is computed by 17 s x ψ 2 e h x c ψ where e h x is the expected path length of x evaluated from the m isolation trees and c ψ is the average path length as computed by 18 c ψ 2 h ψ 1 2 ψ 1 n for ψ 2 where h is the harmonic number as estimated by l n 0 5772156649 euler s constant the anomaly score s ranges from 0 to 1 if e h x equals the average path length c ψ then s 0 5 samples that have s much smaller than 0 5 are quite safe to be regarded as normal because these samples need more partitions to be isolated contrarily an s close to 1 indicates a data point that has a high suspicion of being an outlier specifically we have employed m 100 ψ 256 as recommended by liu et al 2008 3 2 3 local outlier factor local outlier factor is a density based method which detects anomalies by computing the local density deviation of a data point with respect to its neighbors and considers as anomalies the samples that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors breunig et al 2000 this method introduces a measure termed local outlier factor lof to quantify how anomalous a data point is to compute the lof of a data point x three quantities should be pre computed first the k distance of x which is defined as the distance between x and its k t h nearest neighbor x k as denoted by x x k based on this quantity the reachability distance of x w r t any other point x is computed as 19 rd k x x max x x k x x the rd can be regarded as a stabilized variant of the actual distance x x as it reduces the statistical fluctuation for all the points close to x such that the value of rd is no less than the k distance of x then the local reachability density of x is computed as 20 lrd k x 1 k i 1 k rd k x i x 1 which is the inverse of the average rd s of the k nearest neighbors of x finally the local outlier factor of x is computed as 21 lof k x 1 k i 1 k lrd k x i lrd k x intuitively the lof is the ratio of the average lrd of the neighbors of x and that of itself x is regarded as an anomaly if its neighbors are in high density region and itself in low density region i e a large lof value and vice versa as this method is applied to 1d time series data the distance in this context is the absolute value of the subtract of two data points specifically in our case this method is not sensitive to the parameter k when 10 k 50 where relatively good performance can be obtained hence we have employed k 20 in the experiment 3 2 4 seasonal hybrid esd this is a technique specifically designed for time series data that exhibit seasonality as suggested by the name it has experienced the evolution from esd extreme studentized deviate test to seasonal esd and finally to seasonal hybrid esd most fundamentally the esd rosner 1983 is a statistical test for detecting multiple anomalies in a univariate dataset the test explicitly requires an upper bound for the suspected number of anomalies given this upper bound k the test statistic is computed as 22 r i max i x i x s with x s denoting sample mean and standard deviation respective specifically the above statistic is computed by removing the most extreme observation repeatedly until k most extreme observations have been removed which results in k test statistics r 1 r k then correspondingly k critical values are computed as 23 λ i n i t p n i 1 n i 1 t p n i 1 2 n i 1 for i 1 k where n is the number of samples t p ν is the 100 p percentage point from the t distribution with ν degrees of freedom and p is related to the significance level α viz p 1 α 2 n i 1 finally the number of anomalies is determined by finding the largest i such that r i λ i the esd assumes a normal data distribution which limits its applicability for time series data that usually exhibit seasonality and non gaussian behavior to solve this problem the seasonal esd utilizes a modified stl to extract the residual component r x from the raw time series x 24 r x x s x x where s x is the seasonal component as determined by stl and x is the median of the raw time series the esd test is then applied to r x instead of to the raw time series specifically in the above equation the trend component has been replaced by the robust median because the trend is sensitive to anomalies and can thus result in high fluctuations in the residual component finally the seasonal hybrid esd has advanced seasonal esd by replacing the mean and standard deviation used in eq 22 with more robust median and mad mean absolute deviation respectively such that it is more capable of dealing with datasets with a high percentage of anomalies 3 3 performance metrics f 1 score lever et al 2016 is normally used to evaluate binary classification systems it is calculated as the harmonic mean of the precision and recall i e 25 recall r tp tp fn 26 precision p tp tp fp 27 f 1 r p 2 r p r p where tp fn and fp are numbers of true positives false negatives and false positives respectively specifically the true positive tp false negative fn and false positive fp indicate that a true anomaly is identified a true anomaly is ignored and a false anomaly is identified respectively f 1 score has been used in the literature to assess the performance of an anomaly detection method e g taormina and galelli 2018 daniel et al 2022 however we find this metric problematic when used to assess model performance in identifying anomalies in water demand data as it ignores the continuity mechanism of anomalies found in the data which we explain in the following example in fig 7 we use a series of balls to represent water demand data where the anomaly detection results are also shown to calculate the recall the 3 red balls tp and 1 black ball fn weigh equally in eq 25 hence the recall is 0 75 however in the context of water demand data where the anomalies are often found to be continuous the scenario is that there are two anomaly clusters the recognized one contains 3 elements while the unrecognized one contains only 1 compared to the recall defined in eq 25 we pay more attention to the ratio of the number of true anomaly clusters identified to the total number of true anomaly clusters hence we propose to use the cluster based recall r c defined in eq 28 and the resultant recall is 0 5 likewise to calculate the precision 3 tp s and 3 fp s result in a precision value of 0 5 by eq 26 yet the scenario is that among the three anomaly clusters identified only one is correct compared to the precision defined in eq 26 we pay more attention to the ratio of the number of correctly identified anomaly clusters to the total number of anomaly clusters identified hence we propose to use the cluster based precision p c as defined in eqn 29 and the resultant precision is 0 333 28 r c tp c tp c fn c 29 p c tp c tp c fp c 30 f 1 r c p c 2 r c p c r c p c where tp c fn c and fp c are numbers of true anomaly clusters identified true anomaly clusters ignored and false anomaly clusters identified respectively instead of using the original f 1 score we have used the cluster based f 1 score computed from r c and p c as defined in eq 30 this cluster based metric considers the continuity mechanism of anomalies found in water demand data because it evaluates the performance of a method in identifying anomaly clusters and the anomaly cluster can contain a single or several continuous anomalies 3 4 experiment 3 4 1 experimental procedure the five anomaly detection methods asymmetric encoder decoder asyed z score isolation forest iforest local outlier factor lof and seasonal hybrid esd shesd were applied to the hourly water demand data i e 108 overlapping windows generated from the overall dataset specifically the experimental procedure went as follows a first we applied these methods to original datasets where anomalies were not explicitly known i e uncontrolled experiments b then we observed dynamics from detected anomalies and simulated anomalies according to the observed dynamics c and then we contaminated those clean datasets where none of these methods had found any anomalies d and finally we applied these methods to the artificially contaminated datasets i e controlled experiments 3 4 2 anomaly generation randomly generated anomalies were used to contaminate clean datasets the anomalies were generated according to the rules that were summarized in uncontrolled experiments specifically these rules are as follows the number of anomaly clusters introduced is limited to 3 namely the occurrence of abnormal events is no more than 3 times within 30 days the number of elements in a cluster is limited to 4 namely the system is allowed to remain abnormal for less than 5 hours three kinds of anomalies are considered 20 25 increases 25 50 decreases and random fluctuations to model the random fluctuations we first scale the data between 0 and 1 and then replace values at randomly selected locations with values that are randomly drawn from 0 1 0 9 and finally transform the perturbed data back to the original scale 3 4 3 critical values the critical values used to identify anomalies by each method were roughly adjusted in uncontrolled experiments at first and then fine tuned in controlled experiments table 2 shows the critical values that were finally determined in the controlled experiments 4 results 4 1 results from uncontrolled experiments among the results from the 108 windows we focus on those from window 77 whose location in the overall dataset is marked in fig 1 this window was chosen not only because of the presence of anomalies but also because of the remarkable descending trend in the subsequent window window 78 which could be used further to test the robustness of each method in handling trends the results from window 77 are shown in fig 8 as shown in the figure both iforest and lof detect the global outliers at points 194 and 195 but have different opinions at points 177 192 and 579 the asyed method also considers points 194 and 195 anomalous yet it considers the other 3 points normal as their reconstruction errors are within the critical range the shesd method identifies as anomalies several continuous points which depart significantly from the seasonal pattern but fails to detect the global anomalies the z score method fails to detect any anomalies in this case due to the highly non gaussian data distribution as shown in fig 9 a where the presence of dual modes in the distribution leads to the masking of detection while the near gaussian distribution of reconstruction errors from asyed as shown on panel b justifies the application of the z score analogous test on the reconstruction errors as a brief summary iforest and lof are effective for detecting global outliers shesd is effective for detecting seasonal outliers while asyed is effective for both to test the robustness of these methods in handling trends we have applied them to an extended dataset window 77 extended by window 78 without repetition the results are shown in fig 10 as shown in the figure iforest and lof miss the global outliers at points 194 and 195 given the descending trend brought in by window 78 iforest and lof consider these two points are not exceptionally small the shesd method in this case detects completely different anomalies from those detected in figs 8 a the reason for the unsteady behavior of shesd is that it uses median to replace the trend component see eq 24 and this simple approach can lead to errors when encountering data with nonlinear trends the asyed method in contrast is more robust to trends its framework of using upstream and downstream information to reconstruct signals in the middle enables it to deal with linear or nonlinear trends in the data as shown in fig 10 in the middle asyed in this case still considers points 194 and 195 anomalous yet given the additional information downstream it lowers the suspicions on those seasonal anomalies as identified before marked in green in the figure and considers them normal this time this also explains why a relatively long overlapping length between windows is employed in this way every data point has a chance to be placed in a relatively central position in a window such that the model gets adequate information upstream and downstream to decide how anomalous the point is only those points that have been identified twice as anomalies in different windows are considered anomalous in the end 4 2 results from controlled experiments from the 108 windows we have selected 19 where none of these methods had detected any anomalies and contaminated these windows with randomly generated anomalies see section 3 4 2 for the rules applied when generating anomalies the contaminated windows were then used for testing fig 11 shows one of the results from window 106 where the upper panel shows the three anomaly clusters introduced specifically values at indices 150 153 were increased by 25 random fluctuations were introduced at indices 301 304 and values at indices 339 340 were decreased by 50 as shown in fig 11 the z score method fails to detect any anomalies iforest detects 1 among a total of 3 anomaly clusters introduced lof detects 2 among the 3 shesd also detects 2 but it detects a false alarm at index 534 asyed detects all of the 3 anomaly clusters introduced considering it is difficult to identify every element of a cluster once a member of a cluster is identified the cluster is considered identified using the performance metrics introduced in section 3 3 the cluster based f 1 scores of z score iforest lof shesd and asyed are 0 0 5 0 8 0 667 and 1 respectively for each of these 19 windows we have conducted 50 times the procedure contaminate the window detect anomalies using different methods and compute the score of each method the mean scores over 50 repeated tests of each method are summarized in table 3 with the highest score in each window printed in bold it can be seen from the table that 18 best performances are from asyed versus 1 from shesd which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over the others the performance of the z score method is most unsatisfactory the performances of iforest and lof are a little bit better than that of the z score method with mean scores of 0 272 and 0 296 respectively the performance of shesd is unstable ranging from the lowest score of 0 138 to the highest score of 0 893 with a mean score of 0 482 apart from its unsteady performance when encountering nonlinear trends shesd cannot handle tiny temporal shifts advance or lag in the seasonal pattern especially at places with sharp changes yet these tiny shifts are commonly seen in water demand data as a result shesd often detects false anomalies for example the one detected at index 534 in fig 11 b different from shesd asyed explicitly handles the tiny shifts mentioned above by applying an additional filtering step 7 in its algorithm described in section 3 1 4 hence the performance of asyed is relatively stable with the lowest score of 0 731 highest score of 0 984 and a mean score of 0 871 4 3 sensitivity analysis 4 3 1 effects of critical values to analyze the effect of critical values α α 1 on the performance of the asymmetric encoder decoder asyed model the same controlled experiments were conducted but the anomalies were identified using different critical values α 2 5 2 6 3 2 and α 1 1 5 1 6 2 5 the results show that the effect of critical values varies from window to window as exemplified in fig 12 where the mean scores over 50 repeated tests of asyed in windows 32 79 and 99 are shown specifically in each sub figure the combinations of α α 1 that produce the highest scores i e the optimal critical values are marked by the red triangles as shown in the figure the optimal critical values are different in each window likewise the sensitivity of asyed to critical values varies from window to window for example the model is more sensitive in window 32 than in window 99 for simplicity we have used α 3 0 α 1 2 0 uniformly in this work because scores obtained by using this combination are generally high as marked by the squares in each sub figure in fig 12 4 3 2 effects of parameter j parameter j is the number of days before and after the target snippet to consider in the reconstruction to analyze its effect on the performance of the asymmetric encoder decoder asyed model the same controlled experiments were conducted by using the asyed model parameterized by different j 1 2 and 3 see table 1 for model configurations used with different j values the results are shown in fig 13 with the x axis denoting the ids of the 19 selected windows like in the case of critical values effects of parameter j also exhibit an event based distinction as shown in the figure there is no single j that produces the highest score for every window but the scores obtained by using j 3 are generally high in this case the mean scores over the 19 windows for j 1 2 and 3 are 0 796 0 829 and 0 871 respectively we did not consider a higher j value because previous analysis has shown that benefits of increasing j were limited at about j 3 due to these reasons we have chosen j 3 in this work 5 discussion 5 1 asymmetric encoder decoder versus traditional autoencoder in this work we have proposed an asymmetric encoder decoder asyed model different from the traditional autoencoder abbr ae where a signal is reproduced from itself asyed reproduces a signal by using the upstream and downstream information of the signal while the signal itself does not participate in the reconstruction due to this difference asyed is more powerful in anomaly detection task as an illustrative example we use ae and asyed to detect anomalies in an artificially contaminated dataset and the results are shown in fig 14 specifically ae has employed the same algorithm and critical values as asyed both ae and asyed reconstruct daily data x 24 n the difference is that the former uses daily data itself while the latter uses 3 days data before and after day n in the reconstruction thus the reconstruction errors by ae come solely from dimensionality reduction 24 to 4 latent space dimension and then back to 24 while apart from dimensionality reduction the reconstruction errors by asyed come also from the departure of input and target to reconstruct due to the additional source of errors asyed is more sensitive to anomalies in this example ae only detects 1 anomaly cluster among a total of 3 while asyed detects all of the 3 anomaly clusters introduced similar as the case shown in fig 14 previous analysis also shows that ae based models are generally insensitive to anomalous decreases and seasonal anomalies data points that depart significantly from the seasonal pattern due to these reasons we have proposed this asymmetric encoder decoder model for anomaly detection instead of using the traditional autoencoder 5 2 on data resolution in this work we have aggregated the raw sub hourly data with 15 min resolution to hourly frequency and employed the proposed method to detect anomalies in hourly water demand data the motivations for doing so are as follows 1 the subsequent water demand forecasting is applied on an hourly basis and further hourly predictions of water demand are frequently used by water managers to determine optimal regulation and pumping schemes hence water demand forecasting on an hourly basis continues to be the research hotspot of many scholars e g herrera et al 2010 chen and boccelli 2018 ambrosio et al 2019 hu et al 2021 huang et al 2021 2 like many quantities in nature or industry e g rainfall power consumption etc temporal aggregation is an effective tool to smooth out fluctuations in data for example rainfall accumulated on an hourly basis is smoother than that accumulated every 15 min from this perspective and back to water demand data if anomalies were detected on data aggregated on an hourly basis then one would be more convinced of the authenticity of the detected anomalies compared to those detected on the raw data with 15 min resolution considering the reasons above we have used the proposed method to detect anomalies in hourly water demand data however the effectiveness of the proposed method on different data resolutions e g 15 min 30 min should be further explored 5 3 the scope of the proposed method the framework of the proposed asymmetric encoder decoder asyed model to reconstruct a signal given its upstream and downstream information has already confined its scope it is suitable for time series data that exhibit relatively strong seasonality apart from considering the seasonality the proposed method can also handle linear or nonlinear trends in the data however when the strength of the residual component aka the unpredictable part in time series data is too strong the reconstruction is problematic hence the performance of the proposed method cannot be guaranteed as the proposed method detects anomalies in an unsupervised manner there should not be too many anomalies in the dataset otherwise it would be problematic when training the asyed model i e a considerable portion of the training data would be contaminated according to the results from the controlled experiments the proposed method works satisfactorily on datasets with an anomaly ratio up to 1 67 12 anomalies in a total of 720 data points yet we have not tried a higher ratio as this ability is adequate for anomaly detection in hourly water demand data 6 conclusions in this paper we have proposed a method for anomaly detection in hourly water demand data based on an asymmetric encoder decoder asyed model different from the traditional autoencoder where a signal is reproduced from itself asyed reproduces a signal by using the information upstream and downstream of the signal while the signal itself does not participate in the reconstruction in light of this feature asyed is more powerful in identifying anomalies than the traditional autoencoder to assess model performance in identifying anomalies we did not employ the commonly used f 1 score as this metric ignores the continuity mechanism of anomalies found in water demand data to solve the problem of the conventional f 1 score we have proposed its cluster based variant which uses cluster based true positives false negatives and false positives for performance evaluation we have employed the proposed method to detect anomalies in hourly water demand data and the performance of the proposed method was compared with those of four commonly used anomaly detection methods z score isolation forest local outlier factor and seasonal hybrid esd in specific the experiments were conducted in uncontrolled and controlled manners in the former case anomalies were not explicitly known while in the latter case artificially contaminated datasets were used for testing the results from the uncontrolled experiments show that compared to the other alternatives asyed is effective for detecting both global and seasonal anomalies and is more robust to trends in the data the results from the controlled experiments demonstrate the superiority of asyed quantitatively where it wins with scores way ahead of the others sensitivity analyses were also made to analyze the effects of two factors critical values used to identify anomalies and model parameter j the amount of upstream and downstream information considered in signal reconstruction the results show that the effects of the two factors are different from case to case and it is impossible to obtain a uniform setting that is optimal for every case however there exist settings that lead to good performance in general credit authorship contribution statement jieru yan

2959,sustainably meeting the growing water demand of cities during a changing climate will be a major challenge in the near future adjusting water management strategies towards preserving urban water resources while best utilizing urban blue and green infrastructure will require precise knowledge of urban water cycling storage and losses across large built up areas to gain this understanding using stable isotopes of water as tracers in the hydrological cycle can provide valuable insights but their application remains challenging in complex and heterogeneous metropolitan areas this study used stable isotopes combined with hydrometric and climatic data to assess the imprint of the urban area and climate warming on a large urbanised river system the river spree in berlin germany during the exceptionally warm and dry 2018 2020 period isotope dynamics in the spree reflected gradually varying seasonal patterns with more enriched values in summer and more depleted values in winter large scale climate variability and evaporative losses in the upstream catchment along with anthropogenic activities impacted isotope and discharge dynamics in the spree especially during warm and dry summer and autumn periods in local urban sub catchments variability of isotope dynamics and subsequent water ages and transit times were largely affected by engineered system components i e catchment imperviousness connectivity to storm drains and effluent discharge berlin s green spaces were largely disconnected from surface waters urban trees in particular had high water demands during dry periods that may be hard to sustain as trees showed slower replenishment of soil moisture during winter resulting in shorter recharge periods under trees more research will be needed on a how planting design with alternations of urban grassland shrub and trees can enhance infiltration and maintain water demands for trees during drought and b on better quantifying open water evaporation in the upstream catchment to fully account for catchment water losses to sustainably manage and preserve not just berlin s but also similar cities water resources in the future our results indicate that both

2020 schuldt et al 2020 senatsverwaltung für umwelt verkehr und klimaschutz senuvk 2021a senuvk 2020 therefore the response of urban catchments to changing precipitation patterns with more frequent droughts and heavy rainfall events needs to be better understood fletcher et al 2013 mcgrane 2016 to account for water losses during warm and dry periods that can potentially limit urban water

other urban water sources and which can not clearly be defined as new or old water have proven challenging in urban environments e g follstad shah et al 2019 kuhlemann et al 2021b therefore more work is needed to better adapt isotope based water age assessments and source determination from natural to urban environments in berlin germany recent isotope based studies have significantly improved understanding of urban water cycling water partitioning in urban green spaces has been studied at the plot scale showing that evapotranspiration et was high under urban trees because of high interception losses and transpiration demands leading to a depletion of deep soil storage et was also high under grassland because of high evaporation rates from the shallow soil but lower under shrub vegetation gillefalk et al 2021 kuhlemann et al 2021a at the catchment scale tracer studies have shown a dominant influence of wastewater effluents throughout the year particularly in summer kuhlemann et al 2021b marx et al 2021 however the isotopic similarity of effluents and local groundwater made the assessment of stream water sources and ages uncertain at the city scale monitoring across berlin showed that timing and magnitude of isotope and discharge dynamics in response to drought were different between berlin s local streams and its major water inflows kuhlemann et al 2020 while these studies individually provided first insights into berlin s water cycling and isotope dynamics a comprehensive perspective that upscales this understanding and shows the connectivity between the natural green spaces forests etc and engineered system components storm drains sewers etc is still missing for example it is still unclear how representative the results of the plot scale study in a small botanic garden in a restricted residential area gillefalk et al 2021 kuhlemann et al 2021a are for more open publically accessible parks and smaller green spaces in the city centre for both local streams across berlin and the large spree system it is still unclear how isotope and discharge dynamics develop over longer time periods extending the monitoring period and integrating data sets is essential for assessing the role of large scale climate dynamics and urban influences on long term stream flow generation and to better understand the role of engineered water cycle components and local tributaries in diluting the spree as it flows through the urban area with previous studies indicating an important role of evaporation in upstream areas of the spree kuhlemann et al 2020 continuous isotope monitoring may contribute to a better quantification of the impact and timing of evaporative losses the overarching aim of this study is to determine how hydroclimate dynamics and the imprint of the urban area affect the river spree one of berlin s major water inflows and an important water resource for the city by combining new isotope monitoring data with isotope data from previous studies and long term climate and hydrometric data across scales more specifically this study seeks to answer the following research questions 1 how are the spree s discharge dynamics affected by short term seasonal and inter annual hydroclimate dynamics at the regional river basin scale 2 how do different local urban runoff sources e g urbanised tributaries wastewater effluents groundwater impact the isotope dynamics of the spree at the city scale of berlin 3 to what extent are urban green spaces connected to surface and subsurface drainage at the plot to city scale this study was conducted during the exceptionally warm and dry 2018 2020 period understanding the controls on the spree s discharge and isotope dynamics during this time period can inform on urban

term mean values from the 1961 1990 period dwd 2021b table 1 from the seasonal values from the study period and converting p to relative to long term values similarly seasonal arithmetic means were

isotope data under grass and trees arithmetic means were calculated from two depths between 0 and 20 cm at and near the sueo and from three depths between 0 and 25 cm sampled in the parks in the city

the warmer summer and autumn periods discharge rates in the spree were often so low that the stream reached a pond like character and water in the eastern parts of the spree in berlin even slightly flowed back towards lake müggelsee at times cf senuvk 2021c to assess the seasonal impact of evaporation in the spree during these times open water evaporation was assessed using seasonal arithmetic means of stream isotopes and seasonal amount weighted p isotope means along with seasonal climatic data in a revised craig gordon model cf craig and gordon 1965 skrzypek et al 2015 because of higher groundwater levels and tributary flow in the winter and spring months potentially violating the unsteady state assumptions of this approach these seasons were excluded from the calculation for the

impacted streams fractions of young water fyw were estimated through sine wave fitting of seasonal cycles kirchner 2016a 2016b von freyberg et al 2018 using the same input data and time period for the spree these calculations were not conducted given that the high evaporative losses in the stream would violate the underlying assumptions of the approaches kirchner 2016a 4 results 4 1 impact of regional hydroclimate dynamics on the spree s discharge dynamics with mean annual tair 11 c the years 2018 2020 were 2 c warmer than the long term mean in berlin at the same time annual p was 60 mm 10 lower than the long term mean in 2019 and 2020 and 170 mm 30 lower in 2018 dwd 2021b table 1 in the upstream spree catchment the mean annual tair of 11 2 c in 2018 and 2020 was up to 2 5 c warmer than the long term mean and annual p of only 400 430 mm was 20 30 lower than the long term mean in both 2018 and 2019 table 1 dwd 2021b 2021a seasonally tair was warmer than average table 1 throughout the entire study period except for spring 2021 in both berlin and the upstream spree catchment table 4 especially the summer and winter seasons were unusually warm with spring and autumn showing more moderate deviations from average except in spring 2018 the most severe warming occurred in summer 2019 3 4 c and winter 2019 2020 4 5 c in berlin warming was more pronounced than in the upstream area from summer to winter 2018 and in autumn and winter 2020 2021 whereas warming in the upstream catchment was more pronounced than 2019 table 4 seasonal p differences were more variable although most seasons during the study period were clearly drier than long term means table 1 table 4 p deficits intensified from the beginning of the study period to 40 60 in autumn 2018 conditions in berlin remained dry over winter 2018 2019 while the situation slightly improved towards a p surplus in the upstream catchment table 4 fig 3 after conditions became dry again in spring 2019 the upstream catchment had the strongest seasonal p deficit in summer 2019 table 4 when most p fell through occasional larger events 10 20 mm day dwd 2021a while berlin remained moderately dry with respect to total p amounts in summer 2019 most of this rain fell through occasional heavy convective events of up to 30 mm day fig 4 a the situation improved with occasional p surplus in autumn and winter 2019 2020 but worsened again afterwards with p deficits 40 50 in the exceptionally dry spring of 2020 table 4 fig 3 in berlin further convective events of 15 mm day occurred in summer and autumn 2020 eventually leading to a slight p surplus fig 4a table 4 in winter and spring 2020 2021 conditions remained drier than normal in berlin while more p decreased deficits in the upper spree catchment table 4 despite the occasional p surplus in autumn and winter storage was never fully recharged throughout the study period fig 3 while p deficits were initially more pronounced in berlin the accumulated p deficits in the upstream catchment surpassed these values in summer 2019 and remained higher until spring 2021 when the accumulated deficits in berlin and the upstream catchment were similar again table 4 fig 3 stream discharge in the spree system consisting of the müggelspree in the east the dahme confluence and the spree along its passage through the city fig 2b was up to 30 m3 s at entry into the city in the east and reached maximum values of 50 m3 s in the west before flowing into the havel fig 4d f average flows were higher in winter and spring in the müggelspree and dahme 5 12 m3 s and the spree in the west 18 28 m3 s and lower in summer and autumn 0 7 m3 s in the müggelspree and dahme and 7 15 m3 s in the spree in the west fig 4d f stream discharge was higher than the long term 2007 2016 means table 1 at the start of the study period in winter 2017 2018 table 4 afterwards as p deficits increased flows were lower than the long term means throughout the entire study period at first qdiff was more moderate in the müggelspree compared to the spree and dahme but rapidly increased to 70 in autumn 2018 over the winter 2018 2019 qdiff remained more negative in the dahme but the observed p surplus in the upstream catchment resulted in higher flows increasing qdiff to 30 to 40 in the müggel spree though it could not recover the flows to the values of the previous winter period consequently negative qdiff were larger in spring 2019 than the previous year during the exceptionally warm and dry summer 2019 especially the müggelspree showed 90 lower discharge than the long term mean while qdiff remained more moderate in the dahme and spree table 4 table 1 despite increased p in autumn and winter 2019 2020 negative qdiff persisted with the dahme showing 60 and the müggel spree 45 lower flow rates while an effect of autumn and winter p was briefly evident in a less negative qdiff in winter and spring 2020 the situation deteriorated afterwards in summer 2020 qdiff in the müggelspree reached 100 as flows came to a halt and the stream reached a lake like state causing reverse flow as water slightly fluctuated back towards lms fig 2b while qdiff in the dahme remained at 60 the spree showed the most pronounced qdiff since autumn 2018 63 with decreasing p deficits and tair discharge rates increased again and qdiff was reduced to 45 dahme 40 müggelspree and 29 spree until spring 2021 unlike the p deficits there were no seasons where q was higher than long term means from spring 2018 throughout the study period 4 2 impact of local runoff sources on the spree s isotope and discharge dynamics at the city scale p isotopes followed a seasonal pattern throughout the study period winter samples were more depleted and summer samples were more enriched especially when they occurred during larger convective events fig 4a following differences in catchment size and urban influences table 2 the isotopic signatures of the sampled streams showed different isotope dynamics fig 4b f the effluent impacted streams erpe and panke were characterised by low isotopic variability δ18o 9 to 6 δ2h 70 to 50 throughout the study period fig 4b e especially the erpe showed very limited response to p inputs except for some larger events in 2019 summer 2020 and winter 2020 2021 when stream isotopes moved towards the isotopic composition of incoming p discharge in the erpe also showed low variability with daily means of 0 7 m3 s and no seasonal changes only a slight decrease in 2019 isotopic signatures of the river panke were similar to the erpe except that the responses to p inputs were more pronounced discharge in the panke was also more variable and showed some seasonality in baseflows with lower flows from 2019 to autumn 2020 before increasing again in winter 2020 2021 despite being heavily regulated by floodgates discharge in the wuhle which received urban storm drainage but no major effluent inflows table 2 was very low 0 2 m3 s with no clear seasonality fig 4c however stream flow showed clear responses to p events and the isotopic signatures of the stream were highly variable moving from values 8 for δ18o and 59 for δ2h in the direction of incoming p during storm events peaks of 11 to 4 for δ18o and 81 to 33 for δ2h unlike the smaller local streams discharge and isotopic composition of the spree showed a clear seasonality during the study period however while negative qdiff in the müggelspree and dahme were usually most pronounced in summer 2019 and 2020 table 4 the isotopic signatures were most enriched 6 for δ18o and 45 for δ2h in the subsequent autumn periods fig 4d f most depleted isotope values 7 for δ18o and 55 were observed towards early spring when flows were higher consequently the response of isotopic signatures in the spree in berlin was several weeks months delayed compared to climate and discharge dynamics evaporative loss fractions from open water evaporation calculated from seasonal isotope data of the spree in eastern berlin table 4 indicate that losses detected in berlin could be as high as 18 and were also higher in autumn than in summer especially in 2019 in the dual isotope space fig 5 p showed the widest value range following the observed seasonality fig 4 the lmwl from the p daily sampling in the east of berlin was very similar to the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 while the lmwl from the sueo had a slightly lower intercept fig 5 table 5 combining both datasets resulted in the berlin lmwl of δ2h 7 88 δ18o 8 46 table 5 groundwater was most depleted and plotted close to the gmwl and lmwls fig 5 samples from the river wuhle were in a similar range but slightly more enriched the sensitivity of this stream to p events fig 4c was reflected in occasional very depleted or enriched samples collected at high flows fig 5 though also in a similar range the median value of the sampled effluent 7 3 for δ18o 54 for δ2h was more enriched than groundwater median 8 5 for δ18o 60 for δ2h and consequently so was the urban and effluent impacted panke the river erpe despite the influence of effluents remained more similar to groundwater and showed the lowest isotopic variability within the sampled waters however isotopic variability could also be detected in the effluents themselves with the more frequently sampled effluent released into the panke being more enriched median 7 2 for δ18o and 53 7 for δ2h than the effluent released into the erpe median 8 3 for δ18o and 60 3 for δ2h the spree was the most enriched stream sampled on a weekly basis samples from the city centre where discharge was impacted by floodgate regulations median 6 4 for δ18o and 49 4 for δ2h were slightly more enriched than samples in the east median 6 5 for δ18o and 50 5 for δ2h a pattern which also persists when only comparing samples from autumn 2019 to spring 2021 when both stream sections were continuously sampled combined the spree showed the most pronounced stream el table 5 the assessment of mtts and fyw from weekly isotope data of local tributaries and precipitation table 6 were consistent with observed temporal isotope patterns mtts for the erpe which is strongly affected by groundwater and effluents and hence showed a remarkably stable isotopic signature fig 4 were estimated as 2 years as the stream barely reflected any impact of p events fyw were 7 the urban and effluent impacted panke which showed slightly more variable isotopic signatures and some response to p inputs fig 4 had slightly shorter mtts of 10 months and fyw of 11 the wuhle which showed clear responses to p events and subsequently had very variable isotope patterns fig 4 fig 5 had the shortest mtts of only 4 5 months and highest fyw of 20 for all streams kge for mtt was 0 3 0 5 and r2 for fyw was 0 2 0 6 4 3 green space connectivity at the city scale at the sueo sap flux increased over the growing season as transpiration rates increased fig 6 b in the warm and dry springs of 2019 and 2020 cf table 4 these increases started in mid end april while the colder and wetter spring of 2021 delayed the increase in sap flux until early mid may fig 6b sap flux was characterised by some daily variability with negative peaks often associated with larger p events fig 6a b of course these data are specific to the steglitz site but likely reflect the broad patterns of transpiration across berlin s green spaces in the shallow soil vwc12 5 was highest in winter up to 28 and lowest in summer down to 5 fig 6b while large p events temporarily increased vwc12 5 in 2019 such intensive events and subsequent re wetting were less frequent in 2020 over most of the monitoring period vwc12 5 was highest under grass intermediate under trees and lowest under shrub the differences between the sites were most pronounced in the autumn and winter seasons at 45 cm depth patterns were similar but slightly damped with lower responsiveness to p events in spring and summer vwc45 was highest under trees in the deeper soil patterns were least responsive to p events and remained rather stable throughout the monitoring period under grass and shrub vwc95 remained constant 20 25 with increases primarily occurring in winter fig 6e these increases were delayed compared to the shallower soil which was wettest in spring fig 6c d under trees vwc95 was much lower remaining between 7 and 14 throughout the monitoring period while values of duplicate sensors were in a similar range at shallower depths the sensors at 95 cm depth showed some deviation especially under trees and shrub fig 6e despite the warmer and drier summer of 2019 table 4 vwc was lower in summer 2020 than in summer 2019 at almost all depths and vegetation plots groundwater levels close to sueo constantly declined throughout the monitoring period with some daily variability fig 6f comparing our measured soil moisture dynamics to the sensors operated by the berlin senate distributed across the city fig 2b revealed that under grassland patterns were relatively uniform at 12 5 cm depth the soil at the sueo was wetter compared to some monitoring locations with no shading and on in small patches such as traffic islands fig 7 at 45 cm the dynamics at the sueo were again very similar to the spatially distributed sensors fig 7 at 95 cm the sueo values were again wetter than the remaining sensors at 85 cm especially in spring 2021 at all depths variability of vwc dynamics had no clear connection to their location within the city under trees the differences in vwc dynamics were greater though the number and spatial variability of sensors to compare our data to were lower fig 2b at 45 95 cm depth the soil at the sueo was wetter than the remaining locations especially in spring 2021 and again less responsive to p events fig 7 despite soils in 2020 being drier than the previous year fig 6 and differences in location and planting design bulk soil water samples obtained under different vegetation types in the upper 25 cm of soil at the sueo in 2019 and in the parks in the city centre in 2020 were isotopically similar fig 8 samples taken at the sueo in the deeper 40 90 cm of soil were more depleted with low variability and similar to groundwater combining all near surface 0 25 cm soil water isotope data from 2019 and 2020 resulted in clear els for both grassland and trees however the grassland el had a lower slope and intercept than the tree el reflecting the greater evaporative fractionation table 7 overall the shallow 0 25 cm soil water isotopes were more variable and more enriched than the weekly surface water samples from the river spree fig 8 with other streams in berlin even more depleted than the spree fig 7 this indicates low connectivity between berlin s shallow soils and the stream network during the study period 5 discussion this study investigated the impact of regional climate dynamics and the urban footprint of a large city on the isotope hydrology and flow variability of the river spree integrating data from across spatio temporal scales allowed for a more comprehensive assessment and integration of results compared to previous studies along with a better understanding of catchment connectivity conducting this work during the warm and dry 2018 2020 period also provided valuable insights into how the spree may be affected by progressing urbanisation and climate change in the future which provides an evidence base for how water management strategies may need to be adapted to mitigate these effects 5 1 impacts of regional hydroclimate dynamics with annual tair 2 1 2 4 c higher than long term 1961 1990 means in 2018 2019 and 2020 dwd 2021c warming in the berlin brandenburg area was already close to the projected increases of 2 5 c expected by 2050 compared to long term 1951 2006 means lotze campen et al 2009 while a more detailed hydroclimatic analysis of the 2018 2020 drought e g kleine et al 2020 went beyond the scope of the study comparing climate descriptors and stream discharge to long term means provided a first assessment of the evolution of stream flow through seasons though more pronounced warming in winter and summer lotze campen et al 2009 and drier spring and summer seasons hänsel et al 2019 have been projected the extent of the warming and p deficits during the study period exceeded previously expected changes differences between berlin i e the downstream spree and the upstream spree catchment were evident for example the heavy convective events in 2019 that were more pronounced in berlin and increased p amounts in the lower catchment during an otherwise very dry summer while relative differences in stream discharge compared to long term means in 2018 after a year of above average p in 2017 dwd 2021c were most pronounced in autumn the severity of relative changes shifted towards the summer season during the second and third consecutive drought year 2019 2020 this was especially the case in the müggelspree where flows could not be maintained as a result of evaporative losses and water abstractions in the lms area fig 2b and effluent discharge from the erpe senuvk 2021a though significant decreases in stream discharge in periods of high tair and et had been projected such reversal of flow direction under extremely dry conditions was initially expected to occur only from 2030 onwards lotze campen et al 2009 seasonal changes in isotope dynamics in the river spree reflect the high dependency on large scale hydroclimatic conditions which is consistent with previous short term isotope based studies in the berlin area kuhlemann et al 2020 although absolute flows were lowest in summer the observed phase shift towards most enriched values in autumn likely reflects evaporative losses in the low gradient upstream catchment taking 3 months to be detected in berlin including passage through an extensive network of lakes like lms which has a turnover time of 60 days senuvk 2020 while the important influence of open water evaporation in the spree precluded the simple application of mtt and fyw concepts cf kirchner 2016a it still offered an opportunity for isotope based quantification of the relatively high evaporative losses these approaches have significant potential and have already been applied in other studies to estimate evaporative water losses in urban distribution networks jameel et al 2016 tipple et al 2017 but more work will be required to adapt these methods to more anthropogenically impacted surface water reservoirs where artificial water abstractions and inflows may violate some of the underlying assumptions cf skrzypek et al 2015 5 2 impacts of local runoff sources at the city scale the 2 5 year weekly isotope data from berlin s local streams showed clear signs of responsiveness to short term climatic variability and urban influences on catchment characteristics and provided more detailed insights into interactions among water sources storage and ages despite the complexity of urban water fluxes and limitations in clearly defining ages of effluent waters our isotope based water age assessments showed that effluent discharge impermeable surfaces and connectivity to storm drains have pronounced impacts on water storage in local urban catchments the relatively short time series and simple nature of the methods used to estimate water ages mean that the results should be treated as preliminary however estimated mtt 2 years and fyw 7 in the erpe reflecting low responsiveness to p were similar to previous estimates for this catchment cf kuhlemann et al 2021b however the longer more continuous time series of both stream and p isotope data utilised here in this study improved model performance for both the erpe and panke kge 0 3 0 5 r2 0 2 0 6 compared to previous studies kge 0 1 0 1 r2 0 0 5 kuhlemann et al 2021b marx et al 2021 this highlights the importance of high resolution long term data for water age assessments in urbanized catchments parajulee et al 2018 in the panke fyw estimates 11 were slightly higher than previous assessments cf marx et al 2021 potentially reflecting the longer monitoring period and higher impact of p events during the colder winter and spring seasons in 2021 the observed isotopic differences between the erpe and panke which were not associated with deviations in length of monitoring period were surprising given that both streams are strongly impacted by treated wastewater effluents though differences in underlying flow generation mechanisms cf kuhlemann et al 2021b marx et al 2021 may contribute to these differences the observed isotopic variability in the effluents themselves i e the panke effluent being more enriched may also contribute to these differences this variability could potentially reflect variable amounts of bank filtrate from more fractionated surface waters möller and burgschweiger 2008 senuvk 2020 a higher influence of isotopically enriched industrial waters in the city centre or differences in distribution networks water infrastructure and treatment processes to clearly determine the role of these technical water cycle components on the isotopic variability in the effluent the complexity in water sources and distribution structures needs to be accounted for through higher resolution spatially and temporally sampling when tracing water fluxes in urbanized catchments with strong effluent influences e g jameel et al 2016 isotope dynamics in the wuhle confirmed a high responsiveness to p with increasing imperviousness and connectivity to storm drains that was already observed over a short observation period in kuhlemann et al 2020 additionally using the isotope data for water age assessments over a longer time period showed that this responsiveness to p subsequently decreased mtt and increased fyw thus our results show that isotope based age assessments can effectively characterise processes in catchments with rapid urban rainfall runoff dynamics and identify areas where implementation of sustainable urban drainage systems is needed to increase catchment storage limit flood risk and mitigate drought effects soulsby et al 2015 overall the local streams across berlin had a limited impact on the isotopic composition of the spree during the study period this was effectively shown by the spree in the city centre being slightly more enriched than in the east rather than being diluted by more depleted groundwater or effluent based tributaries this observation contrasts the lower relative differences in stream discharge in the spree before the confluence with the havel compared to the observations in the east as discharge gauging was conducted west of the isotope sampling in the city centre the recorded discharge values may be impacted by a higher connectivity to storm drains that is not captured by the sampling in an area of combined sewer systems cf senstw 2018 or the modification of flow through weirs locks and side channels leakage of water infrastructure or release of cooling waters from industrialised areas including power stations cf senuvk 2021a 5 3 impact of urban green spaces at the city scale in berlin the large coverage of green spaces 30 of surface cover senuvk 2019 has great potential to provide shading mitigate heat and increase infiltration to regulate flood risk and facilitate groundwater recharge lotze campen et al 2009 senstu 2016 however in recent years berlin s vegetation has been increasingly affected by land use changes drought and the uhi senstu 2016 the two year monitoring in this study allowed for an assessment of how different types of non irrigated urban green spaces react to several consecutive drought years which has not been well studied in the past miller et al 2020 especially in temperate areas where ecosystems are not adapted to drought buras et al 2020 although the sap flux data from steglitz is clearly limited to one site it is likely indicative of the timing of broader transpiration dynamics in the city the observed earlier increase in sap flux rates in spring 2019 and 2020 compared to the colder spring in 2021 reflects the high temperature dependency of ecosystem functioning as the higher tair and associated incoming radiation resulted in an earlier start and longer extent of the growing season that inevitably increased plant water requirements senstu 2016 zipper et al 2017 2016 across the city this effect may be exacerbated by the uhi senstu 2016 zipper et al 2017 zipper et al 2016 as mean annual tair can be up to 1 c higher in more built up areas in berlin s city centre compared to residential areas with many green spaces like the sueo area dwd 2021b at the sueo soil moisture dynamics during the 2020 growing season indicate that water partitioning was likely similar to the patterns observed in 2019 cf kuhlemann et al 2021a gillefalk et al 2021 though some uncertainty arises from the absence of temporary re wetting of the shallow soil through convective p events rapid vwc increases in the upper 50 cm of soil under grassland after more frequent p in autumn 2019 and 2020 revealed fast infiltration despite high evaporative losses in the exposed shallow soil over the summer kuhlemann et al 2021a confirming a faster and therefore longer drought recovery of urban grassland miller et al 2020 over the winter under trees re wetting of the deeper 50 100 cm of the soil over the autumn winter periods was delayed by 3 months compared to grass and shrub in both 2019 and 2020 with the soils starting to dry again in spring the deeper soil under trees had shorter recharge and recovery times this has important implications for management of urban trees as water demands to sustain et during the growing season can be dependent on water from previous recharge periods gómez navarro et al 2019 shorter recharge periods are likely the reason why carry over effects of the 2018 drought were observed in european trees in the following years buras et al 2020 kuhlemann et al 2021a schuldt et al 2020 similarity of bulk soil water isotope patterns in the shallow soil at and near the sueo in 2019 and in the parks in the city centre in 2020 despite differences in park location and planting design indicate that our plot scale results can potentially be extrapolated to larger spatio temporal scales across berlin and other cities in well connected catchments soil water dynamics are connected to surface drainage and as a result the isotopic composition of soil water may to some extent eventually impact the isotopic composition of receiving surface waters good et al 2015 tetzlaff et al 2014 however this does not seem to be the case in berlin during the 2018 2020 period our results reveal differences in isotope data between soils and surface waters while hydrometric measurements detected increasingly dry conditions in the upper 50 cm of soil under grass and shrub and absence of deep recharge under trees along with declining groundwater levels this highlights the dominance of green water fluxes where water is directly re evaporated or transpired back into the atmosphere without interacting with the stream network falkenmark and rockström 2006 this would mean that the shallow soil water sampled at the sueo represents a reservoir where the stored water did not contribute significantly to baseflow or groundwater recharge during the study cf brooks et al 2010 goldsmith et al 2012 this observation complements the previously determined differences in soil water isotope signals in shallow and deeper soils under trees at the sueo during the 2019 growing season kuhlemann et al 2021a indicating a large ecohydrological separation of water in urban soils cf oerter and bowen 2017 given that the sueo soil vwc dynamics were similar but in many cases wetter than at other locations across berlin water scarcity in urban soils and irrigation needs of urban green spaces may be even higher than previously assumed to better understand water partitioning along vertical soil profiles especially the role of mobile and immobile soil waters and their interactions with urban vegetation and the stream network there is great promise in high resolution isotope monitoring of soil plant and surface waters in future research mcdonnell 2014 such studies will be important to determine the role of soil heterogeneity in subsurface mixing sprenger et al 2019 especially in highly managed urban soils oerter and bowen 2017 and to observe if higher antecedent soil moisture increases groundwater recharge and stream connectivity during colder wetter growing seasons cf stieglitz et al 2003 additionally the role of irrigation water during future drought periods which may either contribute to baseflow fillo et al 2021 or remain in the upper soil to sustain green water fluxes during dry periods oerter and bowen 2017 needs to be better investigated 5 4 water management implications across urban scales water availability in the catchment of the river spree one of berlin s major water inflows is strongly impacted by climate dynamics and anthropogenic activities while patterns of warmer temperatures and extended dry periods with heavy convective rainfall have long been projected for the berlin brandenburg area e g gerstengarbe et al 2003 lotze campen et al 2009 the extent of the climatic development in 2018 2020 exceeded these projections in both timing and magnitude pointing towards recent indications of climate warming becoming more severe than earlier projections ipcc 2021 along with progressing land use changes growing water demands and the end of lignite mining activities in the upstream catchment planned in 2038 this development raises the question if previous assessments that berlin will not face major water supply problems in the future are still accurate lotze campen et al 2009 senuvk 2021a 2020 this study offers new insights into quantifying and limiting water losses in the spree catchment that contribute to an evidence base for maintaining water supplies of adequate quantity and quality for the city of berlin which is highly dependent on bank filtration along the spree and its associated water bodies senuvk 2020 the high influence of evaporative losses 10 in the upstream catchment in summer and autumn observed in the isotope data demonstrates that evaporation is an important driver in the reduction of stream discharge and that combining isotope tracers with conventional climatic and hydrometric data can be very useful to better model these evaporative losses cf gibson and edwards 2002 skrzypek et al 2015 though adjustments will have to be made to adapt such approaches to the alternating lake stream sequences that occur along the spree s flow path as well as anthropogenic water abstractions and inflows they have great potential to inform on the exact extent and timing of evaporation in the upstream catchment and separate this from other water losses e g abstractions for mining or limited groundwater inputs that contribute to reductions in stream discharge for development of more advanced modelling approaches implementation of frequent isotope sampling along the spree s downstream flow path would be informative within the urban area green spaces can increase infiltration groundwater recharge and mitigate urban heat effects fletcher et al 2013 gunawardena et al 2017 mcgrane 2016 but maintaining their ecosystem function during dry periods can require substantial irrigation that can contribute to the overuse of limited urban freshwater resources nouri et al 2019 pataki et al 2011b vico et al 2014 understanding the water demands and irrigation needs of urban vegetation will help to implement sustainable planting design and management of green spaces that maintain ecosystem function while keeping water consumption to a minimum nouri et al 2019 pataki et al 2011b vico et al 2014 in berlin such concepts will be needed to sustain increasing plant water requirements zipper et al 2017 that may exacerbate potential water distribution conflicts cf lotze campen et al 2009 our study indicates that species selection grassland shrub trees and planting design can significantly affect water distribution in berlin s green spaces interception losses from the tree canopy cf gillefalk et al 2021 kuhlemann et al 2021a and shorter recharge periods over the winter lead to high water demands of urban trees that are likely to exceed the capacities of natural infiltration in the future besides implementing adequate irrigation strategies moderating tree densities increasing permeability and routing runoff from impervious surfaces towards trees may enhance infiltration gillefalk et al 2021 vico et al 2014 additionally alternating planting of grassland shrub and trees may be beneficial as shading by trees could limit the high near surface evaporation under grass while higher grassland infiltration rates may enhance water availability in the deeper soil however the effect of shading could not be clearly determined by the site comparison of soil moisture under grassland and more research will be needed to assess the effect of planting design on water partitioning shrub vegetation which was characterised by surprisingly low vwc in the shallower soil despite lower et rates during the growing season as calculated in gillefalk et al 2021 kuhlemann et al 2021a and higher vwc in deeper layers may be easier to maintain than larger trees as the irrigation need seems to be limited to the upper 50 cm of the soil 6 conclusions our study showed that combining isotope tracers with hydrometric data across spatio temporal scales provided valuable insights into the impact of hydroclimate dynamics urbanization and catchment connectivity on the river spree in berlin that went beyond the results obtained through previous studies timing and magnitude of the exceptionally warm and dry 2018 2020 period and the subsequent reductions in stream discharge in the spree system exceeded projected changes in the berlin brandenburg area at the regional scale isotope based quantification of evaporation losses can be an important tool to accurately quantify water losses in the upstream spree catchment and adapt water management strategies to maintain adequate flow rates that sustain the water supply for the city of berlin and environmental needs in the future at the city scale urban green spaces are important features to maintain infiltration and evaporative cooling however observations of limited recharge periods under urban trees indicate that they may require irrigation during drought periods connectivity of green spaces to groundwater recharge and surface drainage was absent during warm and dry growing seasons monitored to maintain ecosystem function and increase urban catchment connectivity while limiting the use of urban water resources during future dry periods more research will be needed on the synergetic effects e g enhancing infiltration and limiting soil evaporation of adjacently implementing trees shrub and grasslands in urban green spaces our results provide a first integrated assessment of how berlin s water cycle may respond to future developments towards warmer and drier conditions while future work will aim at further upscaling the results and compare them to other urban areas affected by climate warming in europe and beyond our findings are

2959,sustainably meeting the growing water demand of cities during a changing climate will be a major challenge in the near future adjusting water management strategies towards preserving urban water resources while best utilizing urban blue and green infrastructure will require precise knowledge of urban water cycling storage and losses across large built up areas to gain this understanding using stable isotopes of water as tracers in the hydrological cycle can provide valuable insights but their application remains challenging in complex and heterogeneous metropolitan areas this study used stable isotopes combined with hydrometric and climatic data to assess the imprint of the urban area and climate warming on a large urbanised river system the river spree in berlin germany during the exceptionally warm and dry 2018 2020 period isotope dynamics in the spree reflected gradually varying seasonal patterns with more enriched values in summer and more depleted values in winter large scale climate variability and evaporative losses in the upstream catchment along with anthropogenic activities impacted isotope and discharge dynamics in the spree especially during warm and dry summer and autumn periods in local urban sub catchments variability of isotope dynamics and subsequent water ages and transit times were largely affected by engineered system components i e catchment imperviousness connectivity to storm drains and effluent discharge berlin s green spaces were largely disconnected from surface waters urban trees in particular had high water demands during dry periods that may be hard to sustain as trees showed slower replenishment of soil moisture during winter resulting in shorter recharge periods under trees more research will be needed on a how planting design with alternations of urban grassland shrub and trees can enhance infiltration and maintain water demands for trees during drought and b on better quantifying open water evaporation in the upstream catchment to fully account for catchment water losses to sustainably manage and preserve not just berlin s but also similar cities water resources in the future our results indicate that both

challenges have long been recognized in cities in warmer climates with frequent drought periods e g pataki et al 2011a tipple et al 2017 water resources of cities in more temperate regions like central europe have so far been considered more resilient e g lotze campen et al 2009 however recent multi annual periods of heat and drought in central europe in 2018 2020 world meteorological organization wmo 2021 wmo 2020 wmo 2019 have raised questions about whether urban water resources and linked ecosystems in major cities like berlin will remain sustainable in the future buras et al 2020 schuldt et al 2020 senatsverwaltung für umwelt verkehr und klimaschutz senuvk 2021a senuvk 2020 therefore the response of urban catchments to changing precipitation patterns with more frequent droughts and heavy rainfall events needs to be better understood fletcher et al 2013 mcgrane 2016 to account for water losses during warm and dry periods that can potentially limit urban water availability the role of evaporation in urban water distribution networks and surface reservoirs needs to be well quantified jameel et al 2016 tipple et al 2017 additionally precise knowledge of water storage under urban green spaces e g parks gardens which are usually composed of various species of grass shrub and trees as well as knowledge of their water requirements to sustain their ecosystem

area of research ehleringer et al 2016 in recent years an increasing number of isotope based studies have started to improve our understanding of water partitioning in urban soils and vegetation bijoor et al 2011 gómez navarro et al 2019 oerter and bowen 2017 urban stream flow generation fillo et al 2021 grande et al 2020 jefferson et al 2015 meriano et al 2011 and interactions between

et al 2020 wallace et al 2021 into urbanized catchments however the complexity of urban water fluxes and especially the influence of wastewater effluents whose isotopic signatures often overlap with other urban water sources and which can not clearly be defined as new or old water have proven challenging in urban environments e g follstad shah et al 2019 kuhlemann et al 2021b therefore more work is needed to better adapt isotope based water age assessments and source determination from natural to urban environments in berlin germany recent isotope based studies have significantly improved understanding of urban water cycling water partitioning in urban green spaces has been studied at the plot scale showing that evapotranspiration et was high under urban trees because of high interception losses and transpiration demands leading to a depletion of deep soil storage et was also high under grassland because of high evaporation rates from the shallow soil but lower under shrub vegetation gillefalk et al 2021 kuhlemann et al 2021a at the catchment scale tracer studies have shown a dominant influence of wastewater effluents throughout the year particularly in summer kuhlemann et al 2021b marx et al 2021 however the isotopic similarity of effluents and local groundwater made the assessment of stream water sources and ages uncertain at the city scale monitoring across berlin showed that timing and magnitude of isotope and discharge dynamics in response to drought were different between berlin s local streams and its major water inflows kuhlemann et al 2020 while these studies individually provided first insights into berlin s water cycling and isotope dynamics a comprehensive perspective that upscales this understanding and shows the connectivity between the natural green spaces forests etc and engineered system components storm drains sewers etc is still missing for example it is still unclear how representative the results of the plot scale study in a small botanic garden in a restricted residential area gillefalk et al 2021 kuhlemann et al 2021a are for more open publically accessible parks and smaller green spaces in the city centre for both local streams across berlin and the large spree system it is still unclear how isotope and discharge dynamics develop over longer time periods extending the monitoring period and integrating data sets is essential for assessing the role of large scale climate dynamics and urban influences on long term stream flow generation and to better understand the role of engineered water cycle components and local tributaries in diluting the spree as it flows through the urban area with previous studies indicating an important role of evaporation in upstream areas of the spree kuhlemann et al 2020 continuous isotope monitoring may contribute to a better quantification of the impact and timing of evaporative losses the overarching aim of this study is to determine how hydroclimate dynamics and the imprint of the urban area affect the river spree one of berlin s major water inflows and an important water resource for the city by combining new isotope monitoring data with isotope data from previous studies and long term climate and hydrometric data across scales more specifically this study seeks to answer the following research questions 1 how are the spree s discharge dynamics affected by short term seasonal and inter annual hydroclimate dynamics at the regional river basin scale 2 how do different local urban runoff sources e g urbanised tributaries wastewater effluents groundwater impact the isotope dynamics of the spree at the city scale of berlin 3 to what extent are urban green spaces connected to surface and subsurface drainage at the plot to city scale this study was conducted during the exceptionally warm and dry 2018 2020 period understanding the controls on the spree s discharge and isotope dynamics during this time period can inform on urban catchment connectivity and the effects on and resilience of water quantity and quality of large urban river systems in berlin and other major cities in central europe under a warmer climate 2 study

were calculated the same was done for the daily climate data of the station in the upper spree catchment fig 2a dwd 2021a deviations in tair and p were then assessed by subtracting the seasonal long term mean values from the 1961 1990 period dwd 2021b table 1 from the seasonal values from the study period and converting p to relative to long term values similarly seasonal arithmetic means were calculated from mean daily discharge for the müggelspree dahme and spree senuvk 2021c and deviations from the long term values table 1 were calculated and expressed as qdiff in relative to long term

isotope data under grass and trees arithmetic means were calculated from two depths between 0 and 20 cm at and near the sueo and from three depths between 0 and 25 cm sampled in the parks in the city

the warmer summer and autumn periods discharge rates in the spree were often so low that the stream reached a pond like character and water in the eastern parts of the spree in berlin even slightly flowed back towards lake müggelsee at times cf senuvk 2021c to assess the seasonal impact of evaporation in the spree during these times open water evaporation was assessed using seasonal arithmetic means of stream isotopes and seasonal amount weighted p isotope means along with seasonal climatic data in a revised craig gordon model cf craig and gordon 1965 skrzypek et al 2015 because of higher groundwater levels and tributary flow in the winter and spring months potentially violating the unsteady state assumptions of this approach these seasons were excluded from the calculation for the

kge gupta et al 2009 to better account for spatial heterogeneity of water fluxes in urban catchments the uncertainty of mtt estimates and the complex nature of water age distributions in effluent impacted streams fractions of young water fyw were estimated through sine wave fitting of seasonal cycles kirchner 2016a 2016b von freyberg et al 2018 using the same input data and time period for the spree these calculations were not conducted given that the high evaporative losses in the stream would violate the underlying assumptions of the approaches kirchner 2016a 4 results 4 1 impact of regional hydroclimate dynamics on the spree s discharge dynamics with mean annual tair 11 c the years 2018 2020 were 2 c warmer than the long term mean in berlin at the same time annual p was 60 mm 10 lower than the long term mean in 2019 and 2020 and 170 mm 30 lower in 2018 dwd 2021b table 1 in the upstream spree catchment the mean annual tair of 11 2 c in 2018 and 2020 was up to 2 5 c warmer than the long term mean and annual p of only 400 430 mm was 20 30 lower than the long term mean in both 2018 and 2019 table 1 dwd 2021b 2021a seasonally tair was warmer than average table 1 throughout the entire study period except for spring 2021 in both berlin and the upstream spree catchment table 4 especially the summer and winter seasons were unusually warm with spring and autumn showing more moderate deviations from average except in spring 2018 the most severe warming occurred in summer 2019 3 4 c and winter 2019 2020 4 5 c in berlin warming was more pronounced than in the upstream area from summer to winter 2018 and in autumn and winter 2020 2021 whereas warming in the upstream catchment was more pronounced than 2019 table 4 seasonal p differences were more variable although most seasons during the study period were clearly drier than long term means table 1 table 4 p deficits intensified from the beginning of the study period to 40 60 in autumn 2018 conditions in berlin remained dry over winter 2018 2019 while the situation slightly improved towards a p surplus in the upstream catchment table 4 fig 3 after conditions became dry again in spring 2019 the upstream catchment had the strongest seasonal p deficit in summer 2019 table 4 when most p fell through occasional larger events 10 20 mm day dwd 2021a while berlin remained moderately dry with respect to total p amounts in summer 2019 most of this rain fell through occasional heavy convective events of up to 30 mm day fig 4 a the situation improved with occasional p surplus in autumn and winter 2019 2020 but worsened again afterwards with p deficits 40 50 in the exceptionally dry spring of 2020 table 4 fig 3 in berlin further convective events of 15 mm day occurred in summer and autumn 2020 eventually leading to a slight p surplus fig 4a table 4 in winter and spring 2020 2021 conditions remained drier than normal in berlin while more p decreased deficits in the upper spree catchment table 4 despite the occasional p surplus in autumn and winter storage was never fully recharged throughout the study period fig 3 while p deficits were initially more pronounced in berlin the accumulated p deficits in the upstream catchment surpassed these values in summer 2019 and remained higher until spring 2021 when the accumulated deficits in berlin and the upstream catchment were similar again table 4 fig 3 stream discharge in the spree system consisting of the müggelspree in the east the dahme confluence and the spree along its passage through the city fig 2b was up to 30 m3 s at entry into the city in the east and reached maximum values of 50 m3 s in the west before flowing into the havel fig 4d f average flows were higher in winter and spring in the müggelspree and dahme 5 12 m3 s and the spree in the west 18 28 m3 s and lower in summer and autumn 0 7 m3 s in the müggelspree and dahme and 7 15 m3 s in the spree in the west fig 4d f stream discharge was higher than the long term 2007 2016 means table 1 at the start of the study period in winter 2017 2018 table 4 afterwards as p deficits increased flows were lower than the long term means throughout the entire study period at first qdiff was more moderate in the müggelspree compared to the spree and dahme but rapidly increased to 70 in autumn 2018 over the winter 2018 2019 qdiff remained more negative in the dahme but the observed p surplus in the upstream catchment resulted in higher flows increasing qdiff to 30 to 40 in the müggel spree though it could not recover the flows to the values of the previous winter period consequently negative qdiff were larger in spring 2019 than the previous year during the exceptionally warm and dry summer 2019 especially the müggelspree showed 90 lower discharge than the long term mean while qdiff remained more moderate in the dahme and spree table 4 table 1 despite increased p in autumn and winter 2019 2020 negative qdiff persisted with the dahme showing 60 and the müggel spree 45 lower flow rates while an effect of autumn and winter p was briefly evident in a less negative qdiff in winter and spring 2020 the situation deteriorated afterwards in summer 2020 qdiff in the müggelspree reached 100 as flows came to a halt and the stream reached a lake like state causing reverse flow as water slightly fluctuated back towards lms fig 2b while qdiff in the dahme remained at 60 the spree showed the most pronounced qdiff since autumn 2018 63 with decreasing p deficits and tair discharge rates increased again and qdiff was reduced to 45 dahme 40 müggelspree and 29 spree until spring 2021 unlike the p deficits there were no seasons where q was higher than long term means from spring 2018 throughout the study period 4 2 impact of local runoff sources on the spree s isotope and discharge dynamics at the city scale p isotopes followed a seasonal pattern throughout the study period winter samples were more depleted and summer samples were more enriched especially when they occurred during larger convective events fig 4a following differences in catchment size and urban influences table 2 the isotopic signatures of the sampled streams showed different isotope dynamics fig 4b f the effluent impacted streams erpe and panke were characterised by low isotopic variability δ18o 9 to 6 δ2h 70 to 50 throughout the study period fig 4b e especially the erpe showed very limited response to p inputs except for some larger events in 2019 summer 2020 and winter 2020 2021 when stream isotopes moved towards the isotopic composition of incoming p discharge in the erpe also showed low variability with daily means of 0 7 m3 s and no seasonal changes only a slight decrease in 2019 isotopic signatures of the river panke were similar to the erpe except that the responses to p inputs were more pronounced discharge in the panke was also more variable and showed some seasonality in baseflows with lower flows from 2019 to autumn 2020 before increasing again in winter 2020 2021 despite being heavily regulated by floodgates discharge in the wuhle which received urban storm drainage but no major effluent inflows table 2 was very low 0 2 m3 s with no clear seasonality fig 4c however stream flow showed clear responses to p events and the isotopic signatures of the stream were highly variable moving from values 8 for δ18o and 59 for δ2h in the direction of incoming p during storm events peaks of 11 to 4 for δ18o and 81 to 33 for δ2h unlike the smaller local streams discharge and isotopic composition of the spree showed a clear seasonality during the study period however while negative qdiff in the müggelspree and dahme were usually most pronounced in summer 2019 and 2020 table 4 the isotopic signatures were most enriched 6 for δ18o and 45 for δ2h in the subsequent autumn periods fig 4d f most depleted isotope values 7 for δ18o and 55 were observed towards early spring when flows were higher consequently the response of isotopic signatures in the spree in berlin was several weeks months delayed compared to climate and discharge dynamics evaporative loss fractions from open water evaporation calculated from seasonal isotope data of the spree in eastern berlin table 4 indicate that losses detected in berlin could be as high as 18 and were also higher in autumn than in summer especially in 2019 in the dual isotope space fig 5 p showed the widest value range following the observed seasonality fig 4 the lmwl from the p daily sampling in the east of berlin was very similar to the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 while the lmwl from the sueo had a slightly lower intercept fig 5 table 5 combining both datasets resulted in the berlin lmwl of δ2h 7 88 δ18o 8 46 table 5 groundwater was most depleted and plotted close to the gmwl and lmwls fig 5 samples from the river wuhle were in a similar range but slightly more enriched the sensitivity of this stream to p events fig 4c was reflected in occasional very depleted or enriched samples collected at high flows fig 5 though also in a similar range the median value of the sampled effluent 7 3 for δ18o 54 for δ2h was more enriched than groundwater median 8 5 for δ18o 60 for δ2h and consequently so was the urban and effluent impacted panke the river erpe despite the influence of effluents remained more similar to groundwater and showed the lowest isotopic variability within the sampled waters however isotopic variability could also be detected in the effluents themselves with the more frequently sampled effluent released into the panke being more enriched median 7 2 for δ18o and 53 7 for δ2h than the effluent released into the erpe median 8 3 for δ18o and 60 3 for δ2h the spree was the most enriched stream sampled on a weekly basis samples from the city centre where discharge was impacted by floodgate regulations median 6 4 for δ18o and 49 4 for δ2h were slightly more enriched than samples in the east median 6 5 for δ18o and 50 5 for δ2h a pattern which also persists when only comparing samples from autumn 2019 to spring 2021 when both stream sections were continuously sampled combined the spree showed the most pronounced stream el table 5 the assessment of mtts and fyw from weekly isotope data of local tributaries and precipitation table 6 were consistent with observed temporal isotope patterns mtts for the erpe which is strongly affected by groundwater and effluents and hence showed a remarkably stable isotopic signature fig 4 were estimated as 2 years as the stream barely reflected any impact of p events fyw were 7 the urban and effluent impacted panke which showed slightly more variable isotopic signatures and some response to p inputs fig 4 had slightly shorter mtts of 10 months and fyw of 11 the wuhle which showed clear responses to p events and subsequently had very variable isotope patterns fig 4 fig 5 had the shortest mtts of only 4 5 months and highest fyw of 20 for all streams kge for mtt was 0 3 0 5 and r2 for fyw was 0 2 0 6 4 3 green space connectivity at the city scale at the sueo sap flux increased over the growing season as transpiration rates increased fig 6 b in the warm and dry springs of 2019 and 2020 cf table 4 these increases started in mid end april while the colder and wetter spring of 2021 delayed the increase in sap flux until early mid may fig 6b sap flux was characterised by some daily variability with negative peaks often associated with larger p events fig 6a b of course these data are specific to the steglitz site but likely reflect the broad patterns of transpiration across berlin s green spaces in the shallow soil vwc12 5 was highest in winter up to 28 and lowest in summer down to 5 fig 6b while large p events temporarily increased vwc12 5 in 2019 such intensive events and subsequent re wetting were less frequent in 2020 over most of the monitoring period vwc12 5 was highest under grass intermediate under trees and lowest under shrub the differences between the sites were most pronounced in the autumn and winter seasons at 45 cm depth patterns were similar but slightly damped with lower responsiveness to p events in spring and summer vwc45 was highest under trees in the deeper soil patterns were least responsive to p events and remained rather stable throughout the monitoring period under grass and shrub vwc95 remained constant 20 25 with increases primarily occurring in winter fig 6e these increases were delayed compared to the shallower soil which was wettest in spring fig 6c d under trees vwc95 was much lower remaining between 7 and 14 throughout the monitoring period while values of duplicate sensors were in a similar range at shallower depths the sensors at 95 cm depth showed some deviation especially under trees and shrub fig 6e despite the warmer and drier summer of 2019 table 4 vwc was lower in summer 2020 than in summer 2019 at almost all depths and vegetation plots groundwater levels close to sueo constantly declined throughout the monitoring period with some daily variability fig 6f comparing our measured soil moisture dynamics to the sensors operated by the berlin senate distributed across the city fig 2b revealed that under grassland patterns were relatively uniform at 12 5 cm depth the soil at the sueo was wetter compared to some monitoring locations with no shading and on in small patches such as traffic islands fig 7 at 45 cm the dynamics at the sueo were again very similar to the spatially distributed sensors fig 7 at 95 cm the sueo values were again wetter than the remaining sensors at 85 cm especially in spring 2021 at all depths variability of vwc dynamics had no clear connection to their location within the city under trees the differences in vwc dynamics were greater though the number and spatial variability of sensors to compare our data to were lower fig 2b at 45 95 cm depth the soil at the sueo was wetter than the remaining locations especially in spring 2021 and again less responsive to p events fig 7 despite soils in 2020 being drier than the previous year fig 6 and differences in location and planting design bulk soil water samples obtained under different vegetation types in the upper 25 cm of soil at the sueo in 2019 and in the parks in the city centre in 2020 were isotopically similar fig 8 samples taken at the sueo in the deeper 40 90 cm of soil were more depleted with low variability and similar to groundwater combining all near surface 0 25 cm soil water isotope data from 2019 and 2020 resulted in clear els for both grassland and trees however the grassland el had a lower slope and intercept than the tree el reflecting the greater evaporative fractionation table 7 overall the shallow 0 25 cm soil water isotopes were more variable and more enriched than the weekly surface water samples from the river spree fig 8 with other streams in berlin even more depleted than the spree fig 7 this indicates low connectivity between berlin s shallow soils and the stream network during the study period 5 discussion this study investigated the impact of regional climate dynamics and the urban footprint of a large city on the isotope hydrology and flow variability of the river spree integrating data from across spatio temporal scales allowed for a more comprehensive assessment and integration of results compared to previous studies along with a better understanding of catchment connectivity conducting this work during the warm and dry 2018 2020 period also provided valuable insights into how the spree may be affected by progressing urbanisation and climate change in the future which provides an evidence base for how water management strategies may need to be adapted to mitigate these effects 5 1 impacts of regional hydroclimate dynamics with annual tair 2 1 2 4 c higher than long term 1961 1990 means in 2018 2019 and 2020 dwd 2021c warming in the berlin brandenburg area was already close to the projected increases of 2 5 c expected by 2050 compared to long term 1951 2006 means lotze campen et al 2009 while a more detailed hydroclimatic analysis of the 2018 2020 drought e g kleine et al 2020 went beyond the scope of the study comparing climate descriptors and stream discharge to long term means provided a first assessment of the evolution of stream flow through seasons though more pronounced warming in winter and summer lotze campen et al 2009 and drier spring and summer seasons hänsel et al 2019 have been projected the extent of the warming and p deficits during the study period exceeded previously expected changes differences between berlin i e the downstream spree and the upstream spree catchment were evident for example the heavy convective events in 2019 that were more pronounced in berlin and increased p amounts in the lower catchment during an otherwise very dry summer while relative differences in stream discharge compared to long term means in 2018 after a year of above average p in 2017 dwd 2021c were most pronounced in autumn the severity of relative changes shifted towards the summer season during the second and third consecutive drought year 2019 2020 this was especially the case in the müggelspree where flows could not be maintained as a result of evaporative losses and water abstractions in the lms area fig 2b and effluent discharge from the erpe senuvk 2021a though significant decreases in stream discharge in periods of high tair and et had been projected such reversal of flow direction under extremely dry conditions was initially expected to occur only from 2030 onwards lotze campen et al 2009 seasonal changes in isotope dynamics in the river spree reflect the high dependency on large scale hydroclimatic conditions which is consistent with previous short term isotope based studies in the berlin area kuhlemann et al 2020 although absolute flows were lowest in summer the observed phase shift towards most enriched values in autumn likely reflects evaporative losses in the low gradient upstream catchment taking 3 months to be detected in berlin including passage through an extensive network of lakes like lms which has a turnover time of 60 days senuvk 2020 while the important influence of open water evaporation in the spree precluded the simple application of mtt and fyw concepts cf kirchner 2016a it still offered an opportunity for isotope based quantification of the relatively high evaporative losses these approaches have significant potential and have already been applied in other studies to estimate evaporative water losses in urban distribution networks jameel et al 2016 tipple et al 2017 but more work will be required to adapt these methods to more anthropogenically impacted surface water reservoirs where artificial water abstractions and inflows may violate some of the underlying assumptions cf skrzypek et al 2015 5 2 impacts of local runoff sources at the city scale the 2 5 year weekly isotope data from berlin s local streams showed clear signs of responsiveness to short term climatic variability and urban influences on catchment characteristics and provided more detailed insights into interactions among water sources storage and ages despite the complexity of urban water fluxes and limitations in clearly defining ages of effluent waters our isotope based water age assessments showed that effluent discharge impermeable surfaces and connectivity to storm drains have pronounced impacts on water storage in local urban catchments the relatively short time series and simple nature of the methods used to estimate water ages mean that the results should be treated as preliminary however estimated mtt 2 years and fyw 7 in the erpe reflecting low responsiveness to p were similar to previous estimates for this catchment cf kuhlemann et al 2021b however the longer more continuous time series of both stream and p isotope data utilised here in this study improved model performance for both the erpe and panke kge 0 3 0 5 r2 0 2 0 6 compared to previous studies kge 0 1 0 1 r2 0 0 5 kuhlemann et al 2021b marx et al 2021 this highlights the importance of high resolution long term data for water age assessments in urbanized catchments parajulee et al 2018 in the panke fyw estimates 11 were slightly higher than previous assessments cf marx et al 2021 potentially reflecting the longer monitoring period and higher impact of p events during the colder winter and spring seasons in 2021 the observed isotopic differences between the erpe and panke which were not associated with deviations in length of monitoring period were surprising given that both streams are strongly impacted by treated wastewater effluents though differences in underlying flow generation mechanisms cf kuhlemann et al 2021b marx et al 2021 may contribute to these differences the observed isotopic variability in the effluents themselves i e the panke effluent being more enriched may also contribute to these differences this variability could potentially reflect variable amounts of bank filtrate from more fractionated surface waters möller and burgschweiger 2008 senuvk 2020 a higher influence of isotopically enriched industrial waters in the city centre or differences in distribution networks water infrastructure and treatment processes to clearly determine the role of these technical water cycle components on the isotopic variability in the effluent the complexity in water sources and distribution structures needs to be accounted for through higher resolution spatially and temporally sampling when tracing water fluxes in urbanized catchments with strong effluent influences e g jameel et al 2016 isotope dynamics in the wuhle confirmed a high responsiveness to p with increasing imperviousness and connectivity to storm drains that was already observed over a short observation period in kuhlemann et al 2020 additionally using the isotope data for water age assessments over a longer time period showed that this responsiveness to p subsequently decreased mtt and increased fyw thus our results show that isotope based age assessments can effectively characterise processes in catchments with rapid urban rainfall runoff dynamics and identify areas where implementation of sustainable urban drainage systems is needed to increase catchment storage limit flood risk and mitigate drought effects soulsby et al 2015 overall the local streams across berlin had a limited impact on the isotopic composition of the spree during the study period this was effectively shown by the spree in the city centre being slightly more enriched than in the east rather than being diluted by more depleted groundwater or effluent based tributaries this observation contrasts the lower relative differences in stream discharge in the spree before the confluence with the havel compared to the observations in the east as discharge gauging was conducted west of the isotope sampling in the city centre the recorded discharge values may be impacted by a higher connectivity to storm drains that is not captured by the sampling in an area of combined sewer systems cf senstw 2018 or the modification of flow through weirs locks and side channels leakage of water infrastructure or release of cooling waters from industrialised areas including power stations cf senuvk 2021a 5 3 impact of urban green spaces at the city scale in berlin the large coverage of green spaces 30 of surface cover senuvk 2019 has great potential to provide shading mitigate heat and increase infiltration to regulate flood risk and facilitate groundwater recharge lotze campen et al 2009 senstu 2016 however in recent years berlin s vegetation has been increasingly affected by land use changes drought and the uhi senstu 2016 the two year monitoring in this study allowed for an assessment of how different types of non irrigated urban green spaces react to several consecutive drought years which has not been well studied in the past miller et al 2020 especially in temperate areas where ecosystems are not adapted to drought buras et al 2020 although the sap flux data from steglitz is clearly limited to one site it is likely indicative of the timing of broader transpiration dynamics in the city the observed earlier increase in sap flux rates in spring 2019 and 2020 compared to the colder spring in 2021 reflects the high temperature dependency of ecosystem functioning as the higher tair and associated incoming radiation resulted in an earlier start and longer extent of the growing season that inevitably increased plant water requirements senstu 2016 zipper et al 2017 2016 across the city this effect may be exacerbated by the uhi senstu 2016 zipper et al 2017 zipper et al 2016 as mean annual tair can be up to 1 c higher in more built up areas in berlin s city centre compared to residential areas with many green spaces like the sueo area dwd 2021b at the sueo soil moisture dynamics during the 2020 growing season indicate that water partitioning was likely similar to the patterns observed in 2019 cf kuhlemann et al 2021a gillefalk et al 2021 though some uncertainty arises from the absence of temporary re wetting of the shallow soil through convective p events rapid vwc increases in the upper 50 cm of soil under grassland after more frequent p in autumn 2019 and 2020 revealed fast infiltration despite high evaporative losses in the exposed shallow soil over the summer kuhlemann et al 2021a confirming a faster and therefore longer drought recovery of urban grassland miller et al 2020 over the winter under trees re wetting of the deeper 50 100 cm of the soil over the autumn winter periods was delayed by 3 months compared to grass and shrub in both 2019 and 2020 with the soils starting to dry again in spring the deeper soil under trees had shorter recharge and recovery times this has important implications for management of urban trees as water demands to sustain et during the growing season can be dependent on water from previous recharge periods gómez navarro et al 2019 shorter recharge periods are likely the reason why carry over effects of the 2018 drought were observed in european trees in the following years buras et al 2020 kuhlemann et al 2021a schuldt et al 2020 similarity of bulk soil water isotope patterns in the shallow soil at and near the sueo in 2019 and in the parks in the city centre in 2020 despite differences in park location and planting design indicate that our plot scale results can potentially be extrapolated to larger spatio temporal scales across berlin and other cities in well connected catchments soil water dynamics are connected to surface drainage and as a result the isotopic composition of soil water may to some extent eventually impact the isotopic composition of receiving surface waters good et al 2015 tetzlaff et al 2014 however this does not seem to be the case in berlin during the 2018 2020 period our results reveal differences in isotope data between soils and surface waters while hydrometric measurements detected increasingly dry conditions in the upper 50 cm of soil under grass and shrub and absence of deep recharge under trees along with declining groundwater levels this highlights the dominance of green water fluxes where water is directly re evaporated or transpired back into the atmosphere without interacting with the stream network falkenmark and rockström 2006 this would mean that the shallow soil water sampled at the sueo represents a reservoir where the stored water did not contribute significantly to baseflow or groundwater recharge during the study cf brooks et al 2010 goldsmith et al 2012 this observation complements the previously determined differences in soil water isotope signals in shallow and deeper soils under trees at the sueo during the 2019 growing season kuhlemann et al 2021a indicating a large ecohydrological separation of water in urban soils cf oerter and bowen 2017 given that the sueo soil vwc dynamics were similar but in many cases wetter than at other locations across berlin water scarcity in urban soils and irrigation needs of urban green spaces may be even higher than previously assumed to better understand water partitioning along vertical soil profiles especially the role of mobile and immobile soil waters and their interactions with urban vegetation and the stream network there is great promise in high resolution isotope monitoring of soil plant and surface waters in future research mcdonnell 2014 such studies will be important to determine the role of soil heterogeneity in subsurface mixing sprenger et al 2019 especially in highly managed urban soils oerter and bowen 2017 and to observe if higher antecedent soil moisture increases groundwater recharge and stream connectivity during colder wetter growing seasons cf stieglitz et al 2003 additionally the role of irrigation water during future drought periods which may either contribute to baseflow fillo et al 2021 or remain in the upper soil to sustain green water fluxes during dry periods oerter and bowen 2017 needs to be better investigated 5 4 water management implications across urban scales water availability in the catchment of the river spree one of berlin s major water inflows is strongly impacted by climate dynamics and anthropogenic activities while patterns of warmer temperatures and extended dry periods with heavy convective rainfall have long been projected for the berlin brandenburg area e g gerstengarbe et al 2003 lotze campen et al 2009 the extent of the climatic development in 2018 2020 exceeded these projections in both timing and magnitude pointing towards recent indications of climate warming becoming more severe than earlier projections ipcc 2021 along with progressing land use changes growing water demands and the end of lignite mining activities in the upstream catchment planned in 2038 this development raises the question if previous assessments that berlin will not face major water supply problems in the future are still accurate lotze campen et al 2009 senuvk 2021a 2020 this study offers new insights into quantifying and limiting water losses in the spree catchment that contribute to an evidence base for maintaining water supplies of adequate quantity and quality for the city of berlin which is highly dependent on bank filtration along the spree and its associated water bodies senuvk 2020 the high influence of evaporative losses 10 in the upstream catchment in summer and autumn observed in the isotope data demonstrates that evaporation is an important driver in the reduction of stream discharge and that combining isotope tracers with conventional climatic and hydrometric data can be very useful to better model these evaporative losses cf gibson and edwards 2002 skrzypek et al 2015 though adjustments will have to be made to adapt such approaches to the alternating lake stream sequences that occur along the spree s flow path as well as anthropogenic water abstractions and inflows they have great potential to inform on the exact extent and timing of evaporation in the upstream catchment and separate this from other water losses e g abstractions for mining or limited groundwater inputs that contribute to reductions in stream discharge for development of more advanced modelling approaches implementation of frequent isotope sampling along the spree s downstream flow path would be informative within the urban area green spaces can increase infiltration groundwater recharge and mitigate urban heat effects fletcher et al 2013 gunawardena et al 2017 mcgrane 2016 but maintaining their ecosystem function during dry periods can require substantial irrigation that can contribute to the overuse of limited urban freshwater resources nouri et al 2019 pataki et al 2011b vico et al 2014 understanding the water demands and irrigation needs of urban vegetation will help to implement sustainable planting design and management of green spaces that maintain ecosystem function while keeping water consumption to a minimum nouri et al 2019 pataki et al 2011b vico et al 2014 in berlin such concepts will be needed to sustain increasing plant water requirements zipper et al 2017 that may exacerbate potential water distribution conflicts cf lotze campen et al 2009 our study indicates that species selection grassland shrub trees and planting design can significantly affect water distribution in berlin s green spaces interception losses from the tree canopy cf gillefalk et al 2021 kuhlemann et al 2021a and shorter recharge periods over the winter lead to high water demands of urban trees that are likely to exceed the capacities of natural infiltration in the future besides implementing adequate irrigation strategies moderating tree densities increasing permeability and routing runoff from impervious surfaces towards trees may enhance infiltration gillefalk et al 2021 vico et al 2014 additionally alternating planting of grassland shrub and trees may be beneficial as shading by trees could limit the high near surface evaporation under grass while higher grassland infiltration rates may enhance water availability in the deeper soil however the effect of shading could not be clearly determined by the site comparison of soil moisture under grassland and more research will be needed to assess the effect of planting design on water partitioning shrub vegetation which was characterised by surprisingly low vwc in the shallower soil despite lower et rates during the growing season as calculated in gillefalk et al 2021 kuhlemann et al 2021a and higher vwc in deeper layers may be easier to maintain than larger trees as the irrigation need seems to be limited to the upper 50 cm of the soil 6 conclusions our study showed that combining isotope tracers with hydrometric data across spatio temporal scales provided valuable insights into the impact of hydroclimate dynamics urbanization and catchment connectivity on the river spree in berlin that went beyond the results obtained through previous studies timing and magnitude of the exceptionally warm and dry 2018 2020 period and the subsequent reductions in stream discharge in the spree system exceeded projected changes in the berlin brandenburg area at the regional scale isotope based quantification of evaporation losses can be an important tool to accurately quantify water losses in the upstream spree catchment and adapt water management strategies to maintain adequate flow rates that sustain the water supply for the city of berlin and environmental needs in the future at the city scale urban green spaces are important features to maintain infiltration and evaporative cooling however observations of limited recharge periods under urban trees indicate that they may require irrigation during drought periods connectivity of green spaces to groundwater recharge and surface drainage was absent during warm and dry growing seasons monitored to maintain ecosystem function and increase urban catchment connectivity while limiting the use of urban water resources during future dry periods more research will be needed on the synergetic effects e g enhancing infiltration and limiting soil evaporation of adjacently implementing trees shrub and grasslands in urban green spaces our results provide a first integrated assessment of how berlin s water cycle may respond to future developments towards warmer and drier conditions while future work will aim at further upscaling the results and compare them to other urban areas affected by climate warming in europe and beyond our findings are already an indication for climate change induced responses of urban water resources in cities with similar climate conditions credit authorship contribution statement lena marie kuhlemann
