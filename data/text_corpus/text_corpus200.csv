1000,water sowing and harvesting ws h a term adopted from latin america is an ancestral process that involves gathering and infiltration sowing of rainwater surface runoff and groundwater to recover it harvesting later and or elsewhere the ws h systems follow the approaches of integrated water resource management nature based solutions and the recovery of ancestral knowledge for water management in this paper we present some representative types of ws h in latin america spain and portugal and then we focus on the paltas catacocha ecohydrology demonstration site in southern ecuador as a study case the recovery of such local ecohydrological knowledge in the study case has made enabled the regulation and retention of water in the aquifers through the restoration of artificial wetlands cochas and stream dams tapes or tajamares also this ancestral way of water management has recently supported and reactivated several biological aspects and human activities the experience of the paltas catacocha site shows that there are more appropriate and sustainable alternatives to gray infrastructure projects for water resources management and denotes the need to study ancestral water and soil management systems keywords water sowing and harvesting ancient practices artificial wetlands ecohydrology water management ibero america ecuador andes 1 introduction awareness has grown in the 21st century that water is a scarce resource world economic forum 2015 for instance in the latin american and caribbean region 26 of the population do not have access to drinking water and 69 have no appropriate sanitation systems jmp 2019 paltan et al 2020 therefore to generate low cost and eco friendly alternatives to facilitate the path towards achieving the agenda for sustainable development goals is a must to do task to access clean water and sanitation un 2015 the artificial recharge of aquifers via green infrastructure is an alternative that has many advantages over the construction of water reservoirs aquifers are the main store of fresh and unfrozen water on the planet gleeson et al 2016 reduce water losses due to evaporation and protect water from contamination among others sprenger et al 2017 to recharge aquifers the retention of rainwater and surface runoff in the subsoil through nature based solutions nbs such as the construction of artificial wetlands and simple infrastructures for water infiltration has been used by many cultures throughout history albarracín et al 2019 castro fernández 2007 martos rosillo et al 2020 ochoa tocachi et al 2019 wwap un water 2018 for instance ochoa tocachi et al 2019 mention as examples the qanat systems in northern africa and the middle east the paar in the western rajasthan region of india the careo system in spain and the amunas in peru among others many of these practices have been maintained over time and are currently presented as valid options for adaptation to climate change resilience to desertification processes and for the sustainability of river basins in several latin american countries and in the iberian peninsula ancestral aquifer recharge practices have been grouped into what has been called water sowing and harvesting ws h systems this process involves the catching of rain and or runoff water and its infiltration into the aquifers sowing and then the recovering of that groundwater afterwards harvesting through intakes at springs drainage galleries and wells or simply through the diversion of water from waterways increasing the discharge due to these ancestral water management systems martos rosillo et al 2020 seen as a transdisciplinary approach to support the integrated management of water and natural resources ecohydrology emphasizes the need to understand the close interplay between the abiotic and biotic aspects within a watershed to develop management tools acreman 2001 baird wilby 1999 mcclain et al 2012 rodriguez iturbe 2000 zalewski 2000 2013 zalewski et al 1997 as a scientific discipline ecohydrology is based on a double regulation between hydrology and biota zalewski et al 1997 in turn the principles of the ecohydrological approach are based on the understanding that water is the driver of all biotic and ecosystem structures thus the generation of ecohydrological solutions based on nature are focused on improving the capacity of the watershed to recover from external impacts e g anthropic climatic demographic etc strengthening its potential for sustainability in terms of water biodiversity ecosystem services resilience and cultural heritage wbsr c in management models albarracín et al 2019 zalewski 2013 2018 in this work we aim at presenting and describing some of the most representative types of ws h in ibero america and then focus on the paltas catacocha ecohydrology demonstration site in southern ecuador as a study case we also demonstrate how ws h systems and the ecohydrology approach complement each other as tools for the integrated management of water resources in seasonally dry environments 2 sowing and harvesting of water in ibero america the ws h systems of ibero america are water management models that apply nbs and recover ancestral knowledge martos rosillo et al 2020 ochoa tocachi et al 2019 overall a ws h system is characterized by the management of the rate of flow from rainwater snowmelt and runoff for its subsequent infiltration into the subsoil the infiltrated water ends up reappearing in springs downstream or is caught through infiltration galleries or wells in this manner it is possible to retain water in the aquifers to use it during the dry periods for irrigation domestic uses drinking troughs etc barberá et al 2018 martos rosillo et al 2019 2020 ochoa tocachi et al 2019 yapa 2013 2016 for instance in latin america and in the iberian peninsula there are several sites applying ws h systems with well documented evidence fig 1 ws h systems are commonly used by andean communities and denote the close relationship between pre columbian inhabitants and the yakumama in quechua yaku water and mama mother ochoa tocachi et al 2019 yapa 2013 this ancestral worldview has been maintained over time and contains the indigenous wisdom of water management that has been used in arid and semi arid areas in the andean highlands ochoa tocachi et al 2019 likewise in the sierra nevada of spain such ancestral practices have been continuously used since the arab culture settled in southern spain a territory known to muslims as al andalus martos rosillo et al 2019 in peru and ecuador the most common ws h system is known as qochas or cochas quechua for lake or pond also called albarradas atajados jagüeyes pataquis martos rosillo et al 2020 or high altitude wetlands ramón 2018 which are artificial ponds for infiltration fig 2 a c these infiltration ponds are generally in erosive depressions of glacial and periglacial origin where water tends to be retained naturally the permeability at the bottom of the ponds allows a slow water infiltration and consequently the aquifer recharge on many occasions the storage capacity of the ponds is increased through the construction of low tech dams martos rosillo et al 2020 the size of the ponds is variable but their surface water storage capacity can be considerably large giving them a lake like appearance fig 2c also altogether those ponds can store large amounts of water e g in quispillacta ayacucho peru the community manages 102 artificial ponds that together store around 1 7m m3 of water minagri 2016 there are shallow ponds known as cuchacuchas waterbodies between 2 m and 12 m in diameter with depths ranging from 0 3 m to 0 6 m and a storage capacity significantly lower than cochas they are mainly found above 4 000 m a s l and generally in arid zones of the andean highlands yapa 2016 ws h systems also vary in types which are briefly described below the tajamares or tapes fig 2b very common in arid environments of ecuador consist of small dams disposed along intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams ires to dam water during the rainy season and favor its infiltration to be captured downstream through dug wells or infiltration galleries martos rosillo et al 2020 the same ws h system has been also used ancestrally in countries like kenya lasage et al 2008 acequias de careo in sierra nevada fig 2d and 2f and amunas or mamanteos in peru martos rosillo et al 2020 ochoa tocachi et al 2019 consist of unlined canals dug in the ground irrigation ditches which are designed for water infiltration in the upper parts of the mountain slopes martos rosillo et al 2019 the two types of canals are over a thousand years old amunas were built by pre inca cultures in south america while acequias de careo by muslim settlements in the iberian peninsula in both cases the need to increase the rate of flow during in dry periods led to an understanding of the natural processes necessary to manage water wisely bofedales in the andes fig 2e and borreguiles in the sierra nevada are wetlands with associated hydrophilic vegetation and diffuse groundwater discharge areas that serve to feed camelids sheeps and livestock in many of these wetlands the construction by locals of complex canal networks called camellones or acequias to spread the water promotes the growth of the vegetation simultaneously increasing the water regulation capacity which allows that water flows slowly from springs and waterways downstream martos rosillo et al 2020 as shown above most ws h systems are linked to the existence of ancient cultures with a knowledge of nature and the water cycle in particular also certain circumstances across sites are repeated such as a marked intra annual rainfall seasonality recurrent droughts geological substrates of moderate permeability and sloping aquifers many of the ws h systems are living examples of what is currently known as nbs wwap un water 2018 which are widely recognized as an alternative or a complement to the construction of multipurpose gray infrastructure martos rosillo et al 2020 bridgewater 2018 for instance as an example of the negative impact of gray infrastructure we can mention the dams hydropower dams influence the nutrient balance and biogeochemical cycles in aquatic ecosystems due to factors such as hydraulic retention time variations in the proportions of nitrogen phosphorus and solutes changes in water temperature etc albarracín 2014 they can even affect coastal marine ecosystems by decreasing their ecosystem productivity chícharo 2018 however a combination of gray infrastructure with a well managed catchment using nbs solutions could mitigate the environmental negative impact while simultaneously providing socio economic co benefits bridgewater 2018 as an example the application of improved landscape management and farming practices to reduce the sedimentation in the reservoir of the itaipú hydropower dam in brazil and paraguay has multiplied its economic life expectancy by six fold while improving farm productivity and farmer s incomes kassam et al 2012 in wwap un water 2018 therefore ws h systems could be integrated into the iwrm of a catchment undoubtedly ws h systems show numerous advantages such as the availability of water in dry periods thanks to the infiltration of water into the subsoil during the rainy season ochoa tocachi et al 2019 indicate that through the amunas or mamanteos in huamantanga peru the water is retained for 45 days on average with a transit time of two weeks to eight months in the aquifer likewise infiltration ditches acequias reduce erosion and runoff on slopes locatelli et al 2020 somers et al 2018 also it has been shown that the irrigation ditches in spain allow the recharge of groundwater in the slopes retaining the runoff from the thaw in the watersheds where it is practiced barberá et al 2018 martos rosillo et al 2020 native vegetation as well as biodiversity in general is notably enhanced in areas using ws h systems compared to sites where they had not been implemented albarracín et al 2019 martos rosillo et al 2019 yapa 2013 3 the ecohydrological approach as a transdisciplinary science applied to solving problems related to water nature and society ecohydrology seeks to increase the sustainability of the basins based on the close relationships between hydrological geomorphological and biological processes deeply understanding of such relationships can be used as a systemic framework to identify the ecosystem properties that can be used as tools to strengthen the integrated management of water resources and guarantee the environmental services to apply the ecohydrological approach three sequential principles are proposed i e the hydrological ecological and the ecological engineering ecohydrological principles during the development of the first two principles the possible necessary interventions e g nbs are recognized to address the identified issues additionally the improvement of the watershed sustainability is managed from the point of view of five multidimensional aspects water biodiversity ecosystem services resilience and cultural heritage wbsr c for more details see bridgewater 2018 zalewski 2002 2006 2018 and zalewski et al 1997 2008 ws h systems have goals in common with ecohydrology and the two approaches can be enhanced integrated and complemented all ws h systems emphasize water flow management to address issues that put the water security of human made systems at risk thus the ws h systems do not only improve biodiversity increase ecosystem services such as water supply and enhance resilience and adaptive capacities to climate change but also safeguard or recover the concomitant ancestral knowledge developed through centuries on the other hand ecohydrology has developed innovative solutions to problems such as the contamination of water resources for example sequential biofiltration systems sbs are used as ecohydrological biotechnologies for the mitigation of non point agricultural pollutants bednarek et al 2010 2014 kiedrzyńska et al 2017 while molecular tools can contribute to the assessment of water quality mankiewicz boczek 2012 and tracers help to evaluate the efficiency of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment headley kadlec 2007 in summary both ws h systems and ecohydrology propose nbs ancestral knowledge and scientific development to achieve water security in the long term 4 the paltas catacocha ecohydrology demonstration site in 2018 unesco s intergovernmental hydrological program ihp recognized the paltas catacocha ws h system as an ecohydrology demonstration site hereafter demosite as indicated above an artificial pond or qocha such as pisaca in the paltas catacocha demosite is an example of a ws h system since rainwater and runoff are derived towards the pond to recharge the aquifer after the rehabilitation of this site locals have perceived that biodiversity has increased as well as some environmental services especially the availability of drinking and irrigation water gad paltas 2017 however scientific evidence is needed to quantify the real benefits of this ws h system which in turn poses the demosite as a hotspot for research development in addition the site highlights the rescue of ancient knowledge for water management below we describe the paltas catacocha demosite focusing on hydrological and ecological aspects as well as the integration of ancestral practices and cultural heritage to find ecohydrological nbs 4 1 demosite description the paltas catacocha demosite is located at coordinates 4 04 05 s 79 37 11 w in the san pedro mártir catchment spmc in the paltas cantón municipality of the province of loja in southern ecuador fig 3 within the spmc at 1 876 m a s l is located the city of catacocha the main settlement of paltas with approximately 7 000 inhabitants the spmc is the main source of water for the zone supplying more than 80 of the water used in domestic and agricultural activities the spmc is part of the catamayo river basin which is part of the catamayo chira binational basin shared between ecuador and peru the smpc covers an area of 31 5 km2 and the main stream extends along 3 25 km from the pisaca pond the catchment is composed by a dendritic fluvial network conformed by several intermittent and ephemeral streams commonly found in the seasonally dry environments of the ecuadorian pacific elevation of the spmc ranges from 1 320 to 2 413 m a s l the average slope is around 12 and the flooding risk is low on the eastern slopes of the pisaca mountain at 2 075 m a s l an artificial pond of the same name is located which is fed by a canal built around the mountain to divert the superficial runoff the bottom of the pond is permeable because it is on a superficial weathered zone that influences the soil formed by andesitic rocks allowing the recharge of superficial aquifers and the increase of the base flow for streams and springs the pisaca pond was restored between 2005 and 2008 in the site that shows evidence of the presence of an ancient artificial wetland attributed to the pre inca culture known as paltas the pond was dried out between 1948 and 1958 by a private owner in order to use the land for agriculture and livestock this pond would not be the only one existing in the area there is evidence that the city of catacocha cata large and cocha pond in quechua was built on a terrain where the largest pond in the area used to be albarracín et al 2019 therefore the drying out of these water bodies would be one of the main causes of the depletion of aquifers in the area leading to restricting the water supply in the city to only half or one hour per day in 2001 gad paltas 2017 4 2 the hydrological principle the paltas catacocha demosite is located in an area with a shortage of water precipitation is influenced by cold ocean currents and orographic conditions the cold ocean currents coming from the pacific ocean produce a process of desertification that advances from the south to the east of the andes in chile and peru reaching the southwestern ecuador garreaud 2009 ochoa tocachi et al 2019 on the other hand topographically in the province of loja the andes present an altitudinal depression this condition has produced a convergence micro zone perpendicular to the inter tropical convergence zone itcz oea 1994 these conditions are the main causes for water to be a scarce resource in the area the spmc lacks a weather monitoring system but we used data from the nearest weather station 2 km approx catacocha station cod m 515 inamhi to understand both precipitation and discharge in the area during the period 1990 2015 the rainfall regime was unimodal with precipitation occurring from december to may with the maximum peak occurring in march 261 66 mm and the minimum in august 2 43 mm fig 4 rainfall can occur during short periods and in only a few days can accumulate most of the annual precipitation also there have been registered severe drought periods that have lasted for years for example according to can 2009 between 1967 and 1969 there was an extreme case of water scarcity that caused one of the largest emigrations in the province of loja the current flow of the san pedro mártir stream depends mainly on the rainfall and the water derived from the pisaca s qocha see fig 5 as far as we know there are no gauging stations or discharge data for the san pedro mártir stream therefore using the precipitation data between 1990 and 2015 from the nearest weather station we estimated discharge applying the rational method this method calculates the estimated peak rate of storm runoff as the product of the catchment area a peak rate of rainfall and a runoff coefficient the maximum average discharge occurs in march while the minimum in august fig 4 we predict that the discharge of the san pedro mártir stream is actually higher during the dry months due to the contribution of the water derived from the ws h system in the area however having an in situ field monitoring system and hydrogeological research are crucial to provide better information for decision making in terms of water security the main problem in the area is related to the extended dry period may december thus considering that water supports ecosystems and human activities appropriate water management practices in the site can help to face the dry season this was a very clear permanent concern for the ancient paltas culture settled in the area that managed their water resources by retaining water in artificial wetlands ramón 2018 however such ancestral knowledge was lost in the process of westernization that started in the spanish colonial period 4 3 the ecological principle from an evolutionary point of view terrestrial ecosystems have adapted to variable environmental conditions such as the availability of water changes in temperature and the availability of nutrients baird wilby 1999 zalewski 2002 in addition hydrology has had an effect on the distribution structure and functions of ecosystems but also the biological processes of the ecosystem have an effect on the hydrological cycle nuttle 2002 zalewski et al 1997 the ecosystems in the spmc are adapted to a seasonally dry environment leading to unique relationships between all their biological and hydrological elements in the spmc there are two terrestrial ecosystems according to mae 2013 the lower montane semi deciduous forest widely dominates the landscape followed by the foothill semi deciduous forest however the anthropic activities have largely transformed the ecosystems of the spmc the land use and land cover fig 5 indicate that the predominant native vegetation is forest 32 followed by scrublands 27 herbaceous 19 pasture 15 urban 5 and agriculture 2 the landscape of the spmc displays a high anthropic intervention where the ecosystems have undergone transformations that could be affecting the structure of the biological communities and their close relationship with the ecosystems processes mag 2015 4 4 the ecohydrological principle the construction of the albarradas or qochas in the spmc is aimed at recharging aquifers via storing rainfall and retaining the runoff from the mountaintop these nature based infrastructures are mainly found on sites that have been established for conservation the areas adjacent to the albarradas have been reforested with native plants and the ponds have hydrophilic vegetation even if water fluxes have not been studied yet locals suggest that the plants are helping to maintain humidity and promote water infiltration currently there are several albarradas and tajamares built within the spmc fig 6 also to enhance the influence of the ws h system and thanks to private and public initiatives two natural areas green infrastructure have been designated to protect water resources and biodiversity since the beginning of the recovery of the wetlands from 2005 to 2013 a total of 28 albarradas have been built in the spmc fig 6 the total water storage capacity of the ponds is 182 482 m3 with an average of 6 517 m3 per pond the largest albarrada is an artificial pond called by the locals as laguna pisaca and can store about 78 422 m3 while the smallest one 143 m3 seventeen out of 28 albarradas including the largest one are in the pisaca reserve owned by a ngo called nature and culture international nci these 17 albarradas have a storage capacity of 149 794 m3 which is 82 of the total water storage capacity the other albarradas are located on private properties of local farmers for more details see albarracín et al 2019 chapter 14th according to the inhabitants of catacocha in 2000 the municipal supply of water decreased to one hour per day but after the restoration of the pisaca pond and the implementation of new albarradas the water supply in households has increased up to six hours per day gad paltas 2017 this fact fostered the construction of more albarradas and tajamares and at the same time generated environmental awareness in the authorities who decided to protect new lands deemed important as water sources also the community is committed with the management of the spmc associations of students and farmers are responsible for its maintenance reforestation protection etc they coordinate efforts with local authorities and civil organizations such as ngos also the national government through the green prize of the development bank of ecuador recognized the value of these initiative and funded the construction of new infrastructure and other activities in the spmc these new albarradas are distributed in new sites within the spmc including the northern part at high and medium altitudes additionally 150 new tajamares were constructed and 136 were maintained finally the authorities are officially protecting and conserving 1 401 ha in water supplying areas reforestation with native species protection and maintenance of the streams and other ecohydrological initiatives have been also implemented for the management of the catchment 4 5 cultural heritage and ecohydrology intercultural dialogue around the environment modern environmental discourses based on sustainability of natural resources are not always accepted by poor communities that survive from its daily use also the scientific indicators of causality are not well understood by non western communities in many cases magical mythical cyclical or religious explanations have much more force because they are an essential part of their culture and their identity for instance in the paltas territory the peasants explained the disappearance of water sources the continuous droughts the variability of rainfall and the progressive loss of soil fertility are because of the theft of the torito cango a mythical bull son of the mountain goddess pisaca that made the rain start when it mooed albalá 1995 ramón 2018 this explanation led the peasants to an attitude of resignation and longing and scientists to an arrogant disregard for popular beliefs in such conditions there was a dialogue of the deaf or rather a paralyzing isolation one of the possible solutions of this enormous gap is the intercultural approach because it values the knowledge of the other seeks communication bridges is open to different points of view and is willing to build new things from a respectful interaction pérez argueta 2011 this new approach has allowed discovering that behind those supposedly simple myths a sophisticated ancestral system of water management developed by the paltas culture was hidden unfortunately such heritage was persecuted despised and destroyed by the long colonial process and afterwards ramón 2008 2015 myths in the andes do not constitute a mechanism to disguise or distort reality they are rather supra historic and often historical constructions that communicate knowledge which must be decoded to be understood in the study area we proceeded to collect myths stories legends and traditions in multiple meetings called mingas in these meetings storytellers of all ages men and women shared their stories taking as a general reference the themes of water rains fertility and droughts on several occasions we found that the same story had different versions it was set in different locations evoked various mythical beings changed over time incorporating new elements or discarding others thus the myth itself had a historical evolution this finding gave rise to extensive documentary research to search aspects of ancient water management displayed in wills land disputes property titles and interviews in the documents appeared drawings of extinct artificial wetlands qochas the existence of small dams to control runoff tajamares or tapes water reservoirs pilancones among others this information generated meticulous fieldwork to observe and evaluate the vestiges and those systems that still survived the linguistic work was also enlightening for instance the name of the mountain goddess herself pisaca means partridge a highly valued bird in the area but also a mythical goddess related to the rain cycle and even a dark constellation called lluthu salazar 2009 little by little the ancient water management system described in myths vestiges tutelary gods petroglyphs tacines stone carvings beliefs and evidence was aligned in a coherent whole as a result of this intercultural dialogue it was possible to understand that the management system included both understanding of and predictions for the hydrological system also we came to know the appropriate ways of management and adaptation the development of different techniques and the organization of work and society the paltas people created a climate prediction system managed by shamans who supported by the consumption of entheogenic plants tried to anticipate the events rains droughts frosts hailstorms winds floods and mass movements that influence agricultural activity and human life they also developed a set of measures of social and spatial organization risk dispersion adaptation mitigation exploitation and even mediation with the deities ramón 2008 the climate prediction system demanded from them an enormous knowledge of hydrological cycles dialogue and the interpretation of complex and diverse signs of cosmic meteorological and biological elements they also considered dreams and rituals to predict their possible variations in order to guide actions that could influence singular and collective changes from individual secrets to collective actions meanwhile the development of measures to face or take advantage of variability demanded a complex societal organization and the development of creative technologies that shared by all were appropriate to the various challenges the myth tells that the mountain goddess pisaca challenged her two suitors the hills cango to the west and guanchuro to the east of the mountain that she would give her love to the one who would provide the most water cango won because he brought rain for four or five moons while guanchuro only provided a few downpours then she had a son with cango who being located to the west brought the waters from the sea in the events of el niño but she never stopped flirting with guanchuro who brought her a few rains from the amazon right in the middle of summer key showers to let the fruit trees flourish the myth codified the cycle of rains and the influence of the great currents that regulate them they built ponds to collect rainwater in the months of high rainfall after understanding that the rainfall system was highly variable that in the region have no high mountains with glaciers that irrigation is difficult because the rivers and streams are located in gullies that in the terrain there is a rapid runoff and high erosion they also realized that because soils are not very permeable there is a low infiltration and that waterways tend to dry out they determined that there are many months with high solar radiation and strong winds and that the combination of both increases notably evapotranspiration reducing soil moisture they were located in the upper section of the spmc in the sites with the greatest infiltration capacity altered and fractured rocks in order to be sure that the infiltrated water fed the target areas they carefully observed in the driest month the green line of certain plants keeping their leaves because of soil moisture this made it possible to follow the direction of the subsurface flow in this shallow aquifer the myth of the torito cango indicates that the bull only consumed herbs from the qochas thus those who stole it also had to take the hydrophilic plants from the wetlands to maintain moisture in the soil they took care of the headwater forests and protected the slopes with abundant vegetation reducing erosion and surface runoff and creating a wet microsystem ramón 2008 also these forests capture moisture by intercepting the mist to retain water in their fields they created an agroforestry garden that combined tall shrubby and creeping plants that imitated the forest up to 56 associated species were combined in those gardens for e g food forage medicines and wood to protect the soil from wind erosion and solar radiation ramón 2015 they built those small dams in the streams called tajamares to control runoff creating small ponds that retain sediments moisten the bank shores and favor the growth of protective plants for biodiversity fish snails edible and medicinal plants in the driest areas they built sunken terraces to keep moisture allowing farming in the dry season they built water reservoirs called pilancones at the top of the orchards and irrigation systems for dry periods and intensive production ramón 2019 finally they integrated the water management system with the sacred territorial ordering ritual calendars power management and relationship with the cosmos and supernatural beings they organized the ayllus the basic andean social nucleus into two groups that emphasized complementarity community arrangements that were respected collective sanctions for transgressions of the norms and recognition of those who maintained harmony they created a ritual of all the space with sacred alignments that united deities ponds springs and ritual sites they created an agricultural and ritual calendar that organized the activities of the society and the regulations of respect and harmony there was a cultural discourse that supported practices and technologies that were appropriate for the environment and that could be managed by the community the ritual exchanged the carved figure of the goddess pisaca with the carved figure of the mountain god cango following the ritual line marked with the rock carvings the system was complete and obvious only eyes were missing to appreciate it 5 final remarks since the middle of the last century the solutions to water management problems have been searched exclusively through the use of concrete and so called gray infrastructure in all that time the ancestral knowledge of the local indigenous and peasant communities has been belittled in some of the examples of ws h systems described in this work a period of continuous operation of more than a thousand years has been found these systems have enabled the surmounting of drastic climatic and social changes that occurred during that time they are therefore resilient water management systems that can serve as a proven example of adaptation to climate change they are also tools to minimize the effects of droughts and have an indisputable cultural social and economic interest all of the above highlights the importance of the research done on them the benefits provided by these systems and their tangible and intangible values have deserved special attention and protection from different international institutions such as unesco however these ancient water management systems are at risk the aging and reduction of the local population migration the abandonment of local water management systems and mining among other causes are contributing to drastically reduce the existence of these ancient water and soil management systems we must prevent the interruption of the intergenerational transmission of knowledge and the implantation of new forms of unsustainable development these systems of sowing and harvesting water require a greater effort for their preservation this will be a contribution to the sustainable development of disadvantaged populations with minimal energy and environmental costs the case of the paltas catacocha ecohydrology demonstration site is an example to follow it is a ws h system that improves the sustainability of the catchment in terms of wbsr c the understanding of the hydrology of the area determined that the long dry period may december is the main problem to be solved by managing the runoff in albarradas and tajamares the aquifers are recharged allowing a greater availability of water in the dry season in this way the ecosystem services that depend on the water resource are increased while the resilience of the system is enhanced and the effects of climate change mitigated in addition the demonstration site is recognized for its important inclusion of ancestral knowledge that agrees with the principles and foundations of ecohydrology however it is necessary to conduct more scientific research that hand in hand with ancestral knowledge will contribute through this dialogue to a better and necessary harmony between human beings and nature declaration of competing interest none declared ethical statement the research was done according to

it harvesting later and or elsewhere the ws h systems follow the approaches of integrated water resource management nature based solutions and the recovery of ancestral knowledge for water management

the amunas in peru among others many of these practices have been maintained over time and are currently presented as valid options for adaptation to climate change resilience to desertification processes and for the sustainability of river basins in several latin american countries and in the iberian peninsula ancestral aquifer recharge practices have been grouped into what has been called water sowing and harvesting ws h systems this process involves the catching of rain and or runoff water and its infiltration into the aquifers sowing and then the recovering of that groundwater afterwards harvesting through intakes at springs drainage galleries and wells or simply through the diversion of water from waterways increasing the discharge due to these ancestral water management systems martos rosillo et al 2020 seen as a transdisciplinary approach to support the integrated management of water and natural resources ecohydrology emphasizes the need to understand the close interplay between the abiotic and biotic aspects within a watershed to develop management tools acreman 2001 baird wilby 1999 mcclain et al 2012 rodriguez iturbe 2000 zalewski 2000 2013 zalewski et al 1997 as a scientific discipline ecohydrology is based on a double regulation between hydrology and biota zalewski et al 1997 in turn the principles of the ecohydrological approach are based on the understanding that water is the driver of all biotic and ecosystem structures thus the generation of ecohydrological solutions based on nature are focused on improving the capacity of the watershed to recover from external impacts e g anthropic climatic demographic etc strengthening its potential for sustainability in terms of water biodiversity ecosystem services resilience and cultural heritage wbsr c in management models albarracín et al 2019 zalewski 2013 2018 in this work we aim at presenting and describing some of the most representative types of ws h in ibero america and then focus on the paltas catacocha ecohydrology demonstration site in southern ecuador as a study case we also demonstrate how ws h systems and the ecohydrology approach complement each other as tools for the integrated management of water resources in seasonally dry environments 2 sowing and harvesting of water in ibero america the ws h systems of ibero america are water management models that apply nbs and recover ancestral knowledge martos rosillo et al 2020 ochoa tocachi et al 2019 overall a ws h system is characterized by the management of the rate of flow from rainwater snowmelt and runoff for its subsequent infiltration into the subsoil the infiltrated water ends up reappearing in springs downstream or is caught through infiltration galleries or wells in this manner it is possible to retain water in the aquifers to use it during the dry periods for irrigation domestic uses drinking troughs etc barberá et al 2018 martos rosillo et al 2019 2020 ochoa tocachi et al 2019 yapa 2013 2016 for instance in latin america and in the iberian peninsula there are several sites applying ws h systems with well documented evidence fig 1 ws h systems are commonly used by andean communities and denote the close relationship between pre columbian inhabitants and the yakumama in quechua yaku water and mama mother ochoa tocachi et al 2019 yapa 2013 this ancestral worldview has been maintained over time and contains the indigenous wisdom of water management that has been used in arid and semi arid areas in the andean highlands ochoa tocachi et al 2019 likewise in the sierra nevada of spain such ancestral practices have been continuously used since the arab culture settled in southern spain a territory known to muslims as al andalus martos rosillo et al 2019 in peru and ecuador the most common ws h system is known as qochas or cochas quechua for lake or pond also called albarradas atajados jagüeyes pataquis martos rosillo et al 2020 or high altitude wetlands ramón 2018 which are artificial ponds for infiltration fig 2 a c these infiltration ponds are generally in erosive depressions of glacial and periglacial origin where water tends to be retained naturally the permeability at the bottom of the ponds allows a slow water infiltration and consequently the aquifer recharge on many occasions the storage capacity of the ponds is increased through the construction of low tech dams martos rosillo et al 2020 the size of the ponds is variable but their surface water storage capacity can be considerably large giving them a lake like appearance fig 2c also altogether those ponds can store large amounts of water e g in quispillacta ayacucho peru the community manages 102 artificial ponds that together store around 1 7m m3 of water minagri 2016 there are shallow ponds known as cuchacuchas waterbodies between 2 m and 12 m in diameter with depths ranging from 0 3 m to 0 6 m and a storage capacity significantly lower than cochas they are mainly found above 4 000 m a s l and generally in arid zones of the andean highlands yapa 2016 ws h systems also vary in types which are briefly described below the tajamares or tapes fig 2b very common in arid environments of ecuador consist of small dams disposed along intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams ires to dam water during the rainy season and favor its infiltration to be captured downstream through dug wells or infiltration galleries martos rosillo et al 2020 the same ws h system has been also used ancestrally in countries like kenya lasage et al 2008 acequias de careo in sierra nevada fig 2d and 2f and amunas or mamanteos in peru martos rosillo et al 2020 ochoa tocachi et al 2019 consist of unlined canals dug in the ground irrigation ditches which are designed for water infiltration in the upper parts of the mountain slopes martos rosillo et al 2019 the two types of canals are over a thousand years old amunas were built by pre inca cultures in south america while acequias de careo by muslim settlements in the iberian peninsula in both cases the need to increase the rate of flow during in dry periods led to an understanding of the natural processes necessary to manage water wisely bofedales in the andes fig 2e and borreguiles in the sierra nevada are wetlands with associated hydrophilic vegetation and diffuse groundwater discharge areas that serve to feed camelids sheeps and livestock in many of these wetlands the construction by locals of complex canal networks called camellones or acequias to spread the water promotes the growth of the vegetation simultaneously increasing the water regulation capacity which allows that water flows slowly from springs and waterways downstream martos rosillo et al 2020 as shown above most ws h systems are linked to the existence of ancient cultures with a knowledge of nature and the water cycle in particular also certain circumstances across sites are repeated such as a marked intra annual rainfall seasonality recurrent droughts geological substrates of moderate permeability and sloping aquifers many of the ws h systems are living examples of what is currently known as nbs wwap un water 2018 which are widely recognized as an alternative or a complement to the construction of multipurpose gray infrastructure martos rosillo et al 2020 bridgewater 2018 for instance as an example of the negative impact of gray infrastructure we can mention the dams hydropower dams influence the nutrient balance and biogeochemical cycles in aquatic ecosystems due to factors such as hydraulic retention time variations in the proportions of nitrogen phosphorus and solutes changes in water temperature etc albarracín 2014 they can even affect coastal marine ecosystems by decreasing their ecosystem productivity chícharo 2018 however a combination of gray infrastructure with a well managed catchment using nbs solutions could mitigate the environmental negative impact while simultaneously providing socio economic co benefits bridgewater 2018 as an example the application of improved landscape management and farming practices to reduce the sedimentation in the reservoir of the itaipú hydropower dam in brazil and paraguay has multiplied its economic life expectancy by six fold while improving farm productivity and farmer s incomes kassam et al 2012 in wwap un water 2018 therefore ws h systems could be integrated into the iwrm of a catchment undoubtedly ws h systems show numerous advantages such as the availability of water in dry periods thanks to the infiltration of water into the subsoil during the rainy season ochoa tocachi et al 2019 indicate that through the amunas or mamanteos in huamantanga peru the water is retained for 45 days on average with a transit time of two weeks to eight months in the aquifer likewise infiltration ditches acequias reduce erosion and runoff on slopes locatelli et al 2020 somers et al 2018 also it has been shown that the irrigation ditches in spain allow the recharge of groundwater in the slopes retaining the runoff from the thaw in the watersheds where it is practiced barberá et al 2018 martos rosillo et al 2020 native vegetation as well as biodiversity in general is notably enhanced in areas using ws h systems compared to sites where they had not been implemented albarracín et al 2019 martos rosillo et al 2019 yapa 2013 3 the ecohydrological approach as a transdisciplinary science applied to solving problems related to water nature and society ecohydrology seeks to increase the sustainability of the basins based on the close relationships between hydrological geomorphological and biological processes deeply understanding of such relationships can be used as a systemic framework to identify the ecosystem properties that can be used as tools to strengthen the integrated management of water resources and guarantee the environmental services to apply the ecohydrological approach three sequential principles are proposed i e the hydrological ecological and the ecological engineering ecohydrological principles during the development of the first two principles the possible necessary interventions e g nbs are recognized to address the identified issues additionally the improvement of the watershed sustainability is managed from the point of view of five multidimensional aspects water biodiversity ecosystem services resilience and cultural heritage wbsr c for more details see bridgewater 2018 zalewski 2002 2006 2018 and zalewski et al 1997 2008 ws h systems have goals in common with ecohydrology and the two approaches can be enhanced integrated and complemented all ws h systems emphasize water flow management to address issues that put the water security of human made systems at risk thus the ws h systems do not only improve biodiversity increase ecosystem services such as water supply and enhance resilience and adaptive capacities to climate change but also safeguard or recover the concomitant ancestral knowledge developed through centuries on the other hand ecohydrology has developed innovative solutions to problems such as the contamination of water resources for example sequential biofiltration systems sbs are used as ecohydrological biotechnologies for the mitigation of non point agricultural pollutants bednarek et al 2010 2014 kiedrzyńska et al 2017 while molecular tools can contribute to the assessment of water quality mankiewicz boczek 2012 and tracers help to evaluate the efficiency of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment headley kadlec 2007 in summary both ws h systems and ecohydrology propose nbs ancestral knowledge and scientific development to achieve water security in the long term 4 the paltas catacocha ecohydrology demonstration site in 2018 unesco s intergovernmental hydrological program ihp recognized the paltas catacocha ws h system as an ecohydrology demonstration site hereafter demosite as indicated above an artificial pond or qocha such as pisaca in the paltas catacocha demosite is an example of a ws h system since rainwater and runoff are derived towards the pond to recharge the aquifer after the rehabilitation of this site locals have perceived that biodiversity has increased as well as some environmental services especially the availability of drinking and irrigation water gad paltas 2017 however scientific evidence is needed to quantify the real benefits of this ws h system which in turn poses the demosite as a hotspot for research development in addition the site highlights the rescue of ancient knowledge for water management below we describe the paltas catacocha demosite focusing on hydrological and ecological aspects as well as the integration of ancestral practices and cultural heritage to find ecohydrological nbs 4 1 demosite description the paltas catacocha demosite is located at coordinates 4 04 05 s 79 37 11 w in the san pedro mártir catchment spmc in the paltas cantón municipality of the province of loja in southern ecuador fig 3 within the spmc at 1 876 m a s l is located the city of catacocha the main settlement of paltas with approximately 7 000 inhabitants the spmc is the main source of water for the zone supplying more than 80 of the water used in domestic and agricultural activities the spmc is part of the catamayo river basin which is part of the catamayo chira binational basin shared between ecuador and peru the smpc covers an area of 31 5 km2 and the main stream extends along 3 25 km from the pisaca pond the catchment is composed by a dendritic fluvial network conformed by several intermittent and ephemeral streams commonly found in the seasonally dry environments of the ecuadorian pacific elevation of the spmc ranges from 1 320 to 2 413 m a s l the average slope is around 12 and the flooding risk is low on the eastern slopes of the pisaca mountain at 2 075 m a s l an artificial pond of the same name is located which is fed by a canal built around the mountain to divert the superficial runoff the bottom of the pond is permeable because it is on a superficial weathered zone that influences the soil formed by andesitic rocks allowing the recharge of superficial aquifers and the increase of the base flow for streams and springs the pisaca pond was restored between 2005 and 2008 in the site that shows evidence of the presence of an ancient artificial wetland attributed to the pre inca culture known as paltas the pond was dried out between 1948 and 1958 by a private owner in order to use the land for agriculture and livestock this pond would not be the only one existing in the area there is evidence that the city of catacocha cata large and cocha pond in quechua was built on a terrain where the largest pond in the area used to be albarracín et al 2019 therefore the drying out of these water bodies would be one of the main causes of the depletion of aquifers in the area leading to restricting the water supply in the city to only half or one hour per day in 2001 gad paltas 2017 4 2 the hydrological principle the paltas catacocha demosite is located in an area with a shortage of water precipitation is influenced by cold ocean currents and orographic conditions the cold ocean currents coming from the pacific ocean produce a process of desertification that advances from the south to the east of the andes in chile and peru reaching the southwestern ecuador garreaud 2009 ochoa tocachi et al 2019 on the other hand topographically in the province of loja the andes present an altitudinal depression this condition has produced a convergence micro zone perpendicular to the inter tropical convergence zone itcz oea 1994 these conditions are the main causes for water to be a scarce resource in the area the spmc lacks a weather monitoring system but we used data from the nearest weather station 2 km approx catacocha station cod m 515 inamhi to understand both precipitation and discharge in the area during the period 1990 2015 the rainfall regime was unimodal with precipitation occurring from december to may with the maximum peak occurring in march 261 66 mm and the minimum in august 2 43 mm fig 4 rainfall can occur during short periods and in only a few days can accumulate most of the annual precipitation also there have been registered severe drought periods that have lasted for years for example according to can 2009 between 1967 and 1969 there was an extreme case of water scarcity that caused one of the largest emigrations in the province of loja the current flow of the san pedro mártir stream depends mainly on the rainfall and the water derived from the pisaca s qocha see fig 5 as far as we know there are no gauging stations or discharge data for the san pedro mártir stream therefore using the precipitation data between 1990 and 2015 from the nearest weather station we estimated discharge applying the rational method this method calculates the estimated peak rate of storm runoff as the product of the catchment area a peak rate of rainfall and a runoff coefficient the maximum average discharge occurs in march while the minimum in august fig 4 we predict that the discharge of the san pedro mártir stream is actually higher during the dry months due to the contribution of the water derived from the ws h system in the area however having an in situ field monitoring system and hydrogeological research are crucial to provide better information for decision making in terms of water security the main problem in the area is related to the extended dry period may december thus considering that water supports ecosystems and human activities appropriate water management practices in the site can help to face the dry season this was a very clear permanent concern for the ancient paltas culture settled in the area that managed their water resources by retaining water in artificial wetlands ramón 2018 however such ancestral knowledge was lost in the process of westernization that started in the spanish colonial period 4 3 the ecological principle from an evolutionary point of view terrestrial ecosystems have adapted to variable environmental conditions such as the availability of water changes in temperature and the availability of nutrients baird wilby 1999 zalewski 2002 in addition hydrology has had an effect on the distribution structure and functions of ecosystems but also the biological processes of the ecosystem have an effect on the hydrological cycle nuttle 2002 zalewski et al 1997 the ecosystems in the spmc are adapted to a seasonally dry environment leading to unique relationships between all their biological and hydrological elements in the spmc there are two terrestrial ecosystems according to mae 2013 the lower montane semi deciduous forest widely dominates the landscape followed by the foothill semi deciduous forest however the anthropic activities have largely transformed the ecosystems of the spmc the land use and land cover fig 5 indicate that the predominant native vegetation is forest 32 followed by scrublands 27 herbaceous 19 pasture 15 urban 5 and agriculture 2 the landscape of the spmc displays a high anthropic intervention where the ecosystems have undergone transformations that could be affecting the structure of the biological communities and their close relationship with the ecosystems processes mag 2015 4 4 the ecohydrological principle the construction of the albarradas or qochas in the spmc is aimed at recharging aquifers via storing rainfall and retaining the runoff from the mountaintop these nature based infrastructures are mainly found on sites that have been established for conservation the areas adjacent to the albarradas have been reforested with native plants and the ponds have hydrophilic vegetation even if water fluxes have not been studied yet locals suggest that the plants are helping to maintain humidity and promote water infiltration currently there are several albarradas and tajamares built within the spmc fig 6 also to enhance the influence of the ws h system and thanks to private and public initiatives two natural areas green infrastructure have been designated to protect water resources and biodiversity since the beginning of the recovery of the wetlands from 2005 to 2013 a total of 28 albarradas have been built in the spmc fig 6 the total water storage capacity of the ponds is 182 482 m3 with an average of 6 517 m3 per pond the largest albarrada is an artificial pond called by the locals as laguna pisaca and can store about 78 422 m3 while the smallest one 143 m3 seventeen out of 28 albarradas including the largest one are in the pisaca reserve owned by a ngo called nature and culture international nci these 17 albarradas have a storage capacity of 149 794 m3 which is 82 of the total water storage capacity the other albarradas are located on private properties of local farmers for more details see albarracín et al 2019 chapter 14th according to the inhabitants of catacocha in 2000 the municipal supply of water decreased to one hour per day but after the restoration of the pisaca pond and the implementation of new albarradas the water supply in households has increased up to six hours per day gad paltas 2017 this fact fostered the construction of more albarradas and tajamares and at the same time generated environmental awareness in the authorities who decided to protect new lands deemed important as water sources also the community is committed with the management of the spmc associations of students and farmers are responsible for its maintenance reforestation protection etc they coordinate efforts with local authorities and civil organizations such as ngos also the national government through the green prize of the development bank of ecuador recognized the value of these initiative and funded the construction of new infrastructure and other activities in the spmc these new albarradas are distributed in new sites within the spmc including the northern part at high and medium altitudes additionally 150 new tajamares were constructed and 136 were maintained finally the authorities are officially protecting and conserving 1 401 ha in water supplying areas reforestation with native species protection and maintenance of the streams and other ecohydrological initiatives have been also implemented for the management of the catchment 4 5 cultural heritage and ecohydrology intercultural dialogue around the environment modern environmental discourses based on sustainability of natural resources are not always accepted by poor communities that survive from its daily use also the scientific indicators of causality are not well understood by non western communities in many cases magical mythical cyclical or religious explanations have much more force because they are an essential part of their culture and their identity for instance in the paltas territory the peasants explained the disappearance of water sources the continuous droughts the variability of rainfall and the progressive loss of soil fertility are because of the theft of the torito cango a mythical bull son of the mountain goddess pisaca that made the rain start when it mooed albalá 1995 ramón 2018 this explanation led the peasants to an attitude of resignation and longing and scientists to an arrogant disregard for popular beliefs in such conditions there was a dialogue of the deaf or rather a paralyzing isolation one of the possible solutions of this enormous gap is the intercultural approach because it values the knowledge of the other seeks communication bridges is open to different points of view and is willing to build new things from a respectful interaction pérez argueta 2011 this new approach has allowed discovering that behind those supposedly simple myths a sophisticated ancestral system of water management developed by the paltas culture was hidden unfortunately such heritage was persecuted despised and destroyed by the long colonial process and afterwards ramón 2008 2015 myths in the andes do not constitute a mechanism to disguise or distort reality they are rather supra historic and often historical constructions that communicate knowledge which must be decoded to be understood in the study area we proceeded to collect myths stories legends and traditions in multiple meetings called mingas in these meetings storytellers of all ages men and women shared their stories taking as a general reference the themes of water rains fertility and droughts on several occasions we found that the same story had different versions it was set in different locations evoked various mythical beings changed over time incorporating new elements or discarding others thus the myth itself had a historical evolution this finding gave rise to extensive documentary research to search aspects of ancient water management displayed in wills land disputes property titles and interviews in the documents appeared drawings of extinct artificial wetlands qochas the existence of small dams to control runoff tajamares or tapes water reservoirs pilancones among others this information generated meticulous fieldwork to observe and evaluate the vestiges and those systems that still survived the linguistic work was also enlightening for instance the name of the mountain goddess herself pisaca means partridge a highly valued bird in the area but also a mythical goddess related to the rain cycle and even a dark constellation called lluthu salazar 2009 little by little the ancient water management system described in myths vestiges tutelary gods petroglyphs tacines stone carvings beliefs and evidence was aligned in a coherent whole as a result of this intercultural dialogue it was possible to understand that the management system included both understanding of and predictions for the hydrological system also we came to know the appropriate ways of management and adaptation the development of different techniques and the organization of work and society the paltas people created a climate prediction system managed by shamans who supported by the consumption of entheogenic plants tried to anticipate the events rains droughts frosts hailstorms winds floods and mass movements that influence agricultural activity and human life they also developed a set of measures of social and spatial organization risk dispersion adaptation mitigation exploitation and even mediation with the deities ramón 2008 the climate prediction system demanded from them an enormous knowledge of hydrological cycles dialogue and the interpretation of complex and diverse signs of cosmic meteorological and biological elements they also considered dreams and rituals to predict their possible variations in order to guide actions that could influence singular and collective changes from individual secrets to collective actions meanwhile the development of measures to face or take advantage of variability demanded a complex societal organization and the development of creative technologies that shared by all were appropriate to the various challenges the myth tells that the mountain goddess pisaca challenged her two suitors the hills cango to the west and guanchuro to the east of the mountain that she would give her love to the one who would provide the most water cango won because he brought rain for four or five moons while guanchuro only provided a few downpours then she had a son with cango who being located to the west brought the waters from the sea in the events of el niño but she never stopped flirting with guanchuro who brought her a few rains from the amazon right in the middle of summer key showers to let the fruit trees flourish the myth codified the cycle of rains and the influence of the great currents that regulate them they built ponds to collect rainwater in the months of high rainfall after understanding that the rainfall system was highly variable that in the region have no high mountains with glaciers that irrigation is difficult because the rivers and streams are located in gullies that in the terrain there is a rapid runoff and high erosion they also realized that because soils are not very permeable there is a low infiltration and that waterways tend to dry out they determined that there are many months with high solar radiation and strong winds and that the combination of both increases notably evapotranspiration reducing soil moisture they were located in the upper section of the spmc in the sites with the greatest infiltration capacity altered and fractured rocks in order to be sure that the infiltrated water fed the target areas they carefully observed in the driest month the green line of certain plants keeping their leaves because of soil moisture this made it possible to follow the direction of the subsurface flow in this shallow aquifer the myth of the torito cango indicates that the bull only consumed herbs from the qochas thus those who stole it also had to take the hydrophilic plants from the wetlands to maintain moisture in the soil they took care of the headwater forests and protected the slopes with abundant vegetation reducing erosion and surface runoff and creating a wet microsystem ramón 2008 also these forests capture moisture by intercepting the mist to retain water in their fields they created an agroforestry garden that combined tall shrubby and creeping plants that imitated the forest up to 56 associated species were combined in those gardens for e g food forage medicines and wood to protect the soil from wind erosion and solar radiation ramón 2015 they built those small dams in the streams called tajamares to control runoff creating small ponds that retain sediments moisten the bank shores and favor the growth of protective plants for biodiversity fish snails edible and medicinal plants in the driest areas they built sunken terraces to keep moisture allowing farming in the dry season they built water reservoirs called pilancones at the top of the orchards and irrigation systems for dry periods and intensive production ramón 2019 finally they integrated the water management system with the sacred territorial ordering ritual calendars power management and relationship with the cosmos and supernatural beings they organized the ayllus the basic andean social nucleus into two groups that emphasized complementarity community arrangements that were respected collective sanctions for transgressions of the norms and recognition of those who maintained harmony they created a ritual of all the space with sacred alignments that united deities ponds springs and ritual sites they created an agricultural and ritual calendar that organized the activities of the society and the regulations of respect and harmony there was a cultural discourse that supported practices and technologies that were appropriate for the environment and that could be managed by the community the ritual exchanged the carved figure of the goddess pisaca with the carved figure of the mountain god cango following the ritual line marked with the rock carvings the system was complete and obvious only eyes were missing to appreciate it 5 final remarks since the middle of the last century the solutions to water management problems have been searched exclusively through the use of concrete and so called gray infrastructure in all that time the ancestral knowledge of the local indigenous and peasant communities has been belittled in some of the examples of ws h systems described in this work a period of continuous operation of more than a thousand years has been found these systems have enabled the surmounting of drastic climatic and social changes that occurred during that time they are therefore resilient water management systems that can serve as a proven example of adaptation to climate change they are also tools to minimize the effects of droughts and have an indisputable cultural social and economic interest all of the above highlights the importance of the research done on them the benefits provided by these systems and their tangible and intangible values have deserved special attention and protection from different international institutions such as unesco however these ancient water management systems are at risk the aging and reduction of the local population migration the abandonment of local water management systems and mining among other causes are contributing to drastically reduce the existence of these ancient water and soil management systems we must prevent the interruption of the intergenerational transmission of knowledge and the implantation of new forms of unsustainable development these systems of sowing and harvesting water require a greater effort for their preservation this will be a contribution to the sustainable development of disadvantaged populations with minimal energy and environmental costs the case of the paltas catacocha ecohydrology demonstration site is an example to follow it is a ws h system that improves the sustainability of the catchment in terms of wbsr c the understanding of the hydrology of the area determined that the long dry period may december is the main problem to be solved by managing the runoff in albarradas and tajamares the aquifers are recharged allowing a greater availability of water in the dry season in this way the ecosystem services that depend on the water resource are increased while the resilience of the system is enhanced and the effects of climate change mitigated in addition the demonstration site is recognized for its important inclusion of ancestral knowledge that agrees with the principles and foundations of ecohydrology however it is necessary to conduct more scientific research that hand in hand with ancestral knowledge will

1001, novel ecosystem is a concept which was introduced in the 21st century to describe ecosystems heavily modified by humans about 15 years after ecohydrology had been introduced as concept within unesco ihp to facilitate the sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems by humans and about 5 years after the concept of ihp demonstration sites had been introduced to promote ecohydrological principles globally the tropical african lake naivasha became a ds initially to demonstrate the importance of papyrus dominated wetland edges for nutrient and climate control in an aquatic ecosystem driven by regional hydrological instability but it already represented a novel ecosystem this paper critically examines the consequences of the aquatic food web restructuring by the major alien species common carp cyprinus carpio l whose arrival is directly an ecological consequence of hydrological instability carp were first recorded in lake naivasha in 2001 and reached dominance in the commercial fishery by 2003 the costs and benefits of its dominance are shown by comparing aspects of the ecosystem state before and after arrival these were hypothesized and tested by comparing data in 2012 4 with data gathered in the 1990s using the same methodologies carp have filled a previously vacant benthivorous niche the species achieved moderate density but has not caused ecological disruption overall carp has been a positive contributor to the local community more intensive management strategies better post harvest processing and new marketing techniques need to be developed to enhance financial gain keywords keystone species cyprinus carpio food chain ecosystem services 1 introduction the successive decade long unesco international hydrological programmes have had many objectives since their incorporation over 70 years ago a consistent theme running through many of them has been improved documentation and understanding of hydrological processes and more recently ecohydrological eh processes to this end the eh programme initiated ecohydrology demonstration sites ds around the world at the turn of this century lake naivasha in kenya was declared a ds initially because of the observed beneficial interactions between hydrology also hydro chemistry with ecological processes in fringing swamps of cyperus papyrus l gaudet 1979 and the use which could be made of this understanding to design restoration programmes harper and mavuti 2004 restoration had become necessary because an original extensive estuarine swamp at the mouth of the main river the malewa with almost continuous fringing swamps around the lake shoreline up to 1970 had been largely destroyed leading to lake eutrophication within 40 years kitaka harper mavuti 2002 harper 2006 independently of its declaration as a ds naivasha s lake ecosystem had undergone dramatic change because of the impact of alien species most particularly since 1970 the degree and effect of these was documented in gherardi et al 2011 and it has continued since that time the ecosystem of lake naivasha is now so dominated at every trophic level by alien species such that it matches the definition of novel ecosystem hobbs higgs harris 2009 novel ecosystems also termed emerging ecosystems result when species occur in combinations and relative abundances that have not occurred previously within a given biome quotation from hobbs et al 2006 this paper analyzes the impact of the common carp cyprinus carpio l which has become a keystone predator of smaller fish and invertebrates as a demonstration of the benefits as well as the drawbacks of novel ecosystems this is necessary because reversing the changes is impossible to all intents and purposes thus critically examining the impacts of novel aquatic ecosystems upon human societies has become a necessary component of ecohydrology hobbs et al 2006 it represents the first case study of a novel tropical aquatic lentic ecosystem cf kwik et al 2020 thus highly appropriate for a unesco ihp ecohydrology demonstration site c carpio has been a highly prized species in eastern europe and asia for hundreds of years produced mainly by aquaculture for human consumption and introduced into many lakes and rivers for sport fishing the first known introduction of c carpio to the african continent is attributed to c a fairbridge of cape town who introduced six fishes from england for ornamental and angling purposes in september 1859 moreau and costa pierce 1997 it proved to be a highly adaptable and successful alien invader in the afrotropics as well as in australia able to dominate fish communities in lentic waters and to negatively affect internal ecological processes globally it is considered to be a highly damaging invasive lowe browne boudjelas de poorter 2000 c carpio invaded lake naivasha in 1998 9 during the high rains which frequently follow the el niño event in the pacific floods must have brought juveniles washed out from the gwakiongo dam at the headwaters of the gilgil river where they had been stocked alongside rainbow trout earlier in that decade by the kenya fisheries department nyandarua office harper et al 2012 carp was first observed in the lake in 2001 and has dominated the commercial fishery that used to be based upon two tilapias and the large mouthed bass since 2003 britton et al 2007 carp very rapidly became keystone species within the lake ecosystem by acting as competitor of the alien crayfish procambarus clarkii girard jackson et al 2012 itself previously regarded as the dominant keystone species in the lake smart et al 2002 food of young c carpio from lake naivasha was found to be similar to that in europe consisting mostly of zooplankton cladocera and copepoda in all size classes with chironomid larvae and oligochaete worms in guts of larger fish individuals over 100 mm in naivasha also contained crayfish and occasionally small fish in 45 of cases britton et al 2007 there is no knowledge of the impact of c carpio upon the naivasha ecosystem however despite this partial knowledge of its ecology and position in the food web this paper predicts its impact from a review of empirical and published studies and tests the hypotheses using original data one might have predicted that c carpio would have a devastating effect on the aquatic ecosystem of lake naivasha such statements were made by ojuok et al 2007 and aloo et al 2013 but had not been tested until now nine linked hypotheses were proposed based upon a review of the literature of lake naivasha limnology and of c carpio impacts on other aquatic systems that c carpio would cause 1 lower water transparency 2 increased soluble nutrients 3 a cyanobacterial soup with higher primary productivity 4 small size of zooplankton 5 depletion of benthos 6 loss of macrophytes 7 reduction of numbers of herbivorous birds but an increase in numbers of piscivorous birds 8 dominance of the food web by carp diminishing other species in the fishery 9 no net benefits to the human lakeside communities this paper tests the hypotheses by comparing data collected in two different time periods called pre carp the 1990s and post carp by members of the same team supported by such published knowledge as exists the discussion section includes other published studies and evaluates the future of this novel ecosystem 2 site description lake naivasha kenya is an endorheic freshwater lake conductivity between 250 and 400 µs cm 1 situated in the eastern rift valley just south of the equator fig 1 the climate is characterised by the alternation of two wet warm rainy periods and two relatively cold dry spells but superimposed upon fluctuating lake levels and areas between 100 150 km2 as a result of annual rainfall influenced by the inter tropical convergence zone the shallow lake average depth usually 3 3 5 m was created by the infilling of 1 major and 3 minor volcanic craters its deepest point is situated at ca 1873 m a s l in crescent island lagoon where water is usually over 10 m deep its approx 4 000 km2 catchment rises to a maximum of just over 4 000 m in the north east aberdare or nyandarua mountain range during the last 1 000 years the lake dried completely out at least three times most recently in the 19th century just before european settlement verschuren et al 2001 in the 20th century water levels have fluctuated by 10 m i e the maximum main lake depth ranged from 4 to 14 m becht and harper 2002 the depth fluctuation in just the past three decades has been half that but with 5 vertical metres in just 5 years between the end of 2009 and 2016 fig 2 representing both the highest and the lowest levels since 1945 lnra unpublished data the lake has a low volume surface ratio typical of ecosystems responsive to the hydrological forcing caused by seasonal rains and floods the impact of floods is further enhanced by its muted seasonality melack 1979 due to a modest seasonal variation in temperature and in solar radiation a riparian papyrus swamp gaudet 1979 used to attenuate the river pulse by buffering allochthonous nutrients and by releasing moderate and continuous internal nutrient fluxes that stabilised primary production litterick et al 1979 but its influence has been decreasing for the past 20 years due to significant riparian degradation harper and mavuti 2004 water column mixing occurs daily in the main lake caused by frequent afternoon winds and by night time cooling melack 1979 crescent island lagoon ca 1 2 km2 at the eastern side of the lake is the only portion that is deep in 2012 16 m and that tends to remain stratified for several weeks months the main lake shoreline length was 117 km and the surface area was 132 km2 on 31 05 2013 fig 3 the lake s ecology was first described by early 20th century uk expeditions beadle 1932 and studied in greater detail during the late 20th century role of c papyrus in the ecotone by gaudet 1979 primary productivity by melack 1979 causes of freshness by gaudet and melack 1981 nutrient chemistry and phytoplankton melack 1976 and by kalff 1983 1986 1993 then by kitaka harper mavuti 2002 and kitaka et al 2002b aquatic macrophyte dynamics by harper 1984 gouder de beauregard et al 2002 crayfish impacts by smart et al 2002 fish by litterick et al 1979 hickley et al 1994 2004 and by britton et al 2007 its ecosystem has been extensively modified by alien species since the 1970s gherardi et al 2011 and by the greatly increased number of people dwelling around its shores and in its catchment harper et al 2012 these latter changes in population density as well as intensification in land use have occurred steadily throughout the two periods under consideration their effects upon the conclusions are considered in the discussion 3 methods the same methods were used in two different time periods called pre carp and post carp on all sample occasions water transparency hypothesis 1 was measured by 25 cm diameter secchi disc submerged and floating leaved macrophytes were collected by double headed rake and identified using agnew and agnew 1974 hypothesis 6 3 1 times of study four separate studies were undertaken at naivasha in the late 1990s pre carp they were 1 surface water chemistry august 1995 2 phytoplankton diversity biomass and productivity december 1994 3 zooplankton diversity and biomass may 1995 april 1996 and 4 benthic diversity and biomass july 1996 august 1998 september 1999 and march 2001 the collection laboratory and analytical methods were the same as those subsequently used between 2012 13 to study the post carp ecosystem and to test the hypotheses stated above samples were not collected in exactly the same locations but in all cases the depth of the sample was recorded which because of the fluctuations of lake level is more important than position pre carp studies of the macrophyte community dynamics population dynamics of procambarus clarkii lousiana crayfish fish community and commercial fish catch have been studied and published by various authors these are considered in the discussion samples of water chemistry plankton benthos and fish were taken on four separate occasions in 2012 2014 post carp all sampling sought to distinguish the littoral zone the area covered by floating plants measured as 3 m maximum which at this time was dominated by scattered e crassipes from the open water zone samples were compared in the same way between littoral and pelagic for both periods using depth comparison samples for the food web for stable isotope analysis were collected in 2003 5 as described in jackson et al 2012 3 2 hypothesis 2 soluble nutrients surface water samples were collected at 50 cm depth along transects running across the shallows of the lake into the deepest point see fig 3 all used a remote messenger closed 1 litre water sampler the samples were analysed upon return to the laboratory after immediate filtration 0 45 µ cellulose nitrate filters hach kits were employed to analyse nitrate ammonia and silicate and the standard manual methylene blue method for phosphate mackereth et al 1989 total filtered and total unfiltered phosphorus and nitrogen were mineralised by persulphate digestion in a pressure cooker and then determined using standard techniques for phosphate mackereth et al 1989 and nitrate kalff and bentzen 1984 a sub set of filtered and unfiltered sample aliquots in 2013 and again in 2015 were carried frozen in a cool box with freezer bags to the enki o p s třebon iso certified laboratory in czech republic www enki cz to confirm the range of values for both soluble and total forms of n and p that had been measured on site the latter analysis was performed through flow injection analysis using automatic analysers fiastartm 5000 and fiastartm 5012 3 3 hypothesis 3 phytoplankton abundance and primary production a plankton net fba type now nhbs totnes uk of 20 µm mesh size was used up to 2 m depth to collect samples for identification unfiltered water samples were taken from depths of 0 and 1 m for quantitative counting both sample types were preserved with formaldehyde some samples were collected and preserved in lugol s iodine the main groups of algae and cyanobacteria were distinguished and the dominant species determined komárek and anagnostidis 1998 komárek and anagnostidis 2005 komárek et al 2013 chlorophyll a was assessed spectrophotometrically at 665 nm after overnight cold 90 acetone extraction of the ground plankton retained on a whatman gfc glass fibre filter obtained by filtering 300 500 ml from a water sample collected as above for chemical sampling stored between lake and lab in a portable cool box calculations were carried out according to talling and driver 1961 planktonic primary production was estimated by determining differences in oxygen concentration measured in light and dark bottles incubated under water as described by schwoerbel 1970 and analysed within 24 hours by winkler titration following mackereth et al 1989 gross primary production was calculated as the difference between the oxygen concentration measured before and after incubation and then integrated throughout the photosynthetic depth profile conversion into g c m 2 day 1 was carried out assuming 12 hours day of effective production and considering that 6 moles of o2 are released for every mole of c6h12o6 assimilated therefore 0 375 g c are fixed into biomass for every 1 g of o2 released 3 4 hypothesis 4 zooplankton species occurrence and abundance the same type and manufacturer s plankton net mesh size 80 µm fba type now nhbs totnes uk was used for sampling zooplankton on both occasions from the upper layer of the water column 2 m each sample corresponded to 69 litres filtered zooplankton samples were preserved in 20 ml bottles in a final concentration of formaldehyde of 4 genus and species of zooplankton were determined later in the laboratory according to fernando 2002 biomass of zooplankton in individual samples was estimated according to the volume of its fresh mass 1 ml volume of fresh biomass 0 5 gm fresh biomass as estimated from length weight relationships in prikryl 1980 zooplankton dry weight was estimated as 10 fresh weight 3 5 hypothesis 5 macrozoobenthos species and density lake sediment was collected quantitatively by the same ekman grab 25 cm x 25 cm in size also on transects from shallow to deep open water sediment samples were washed at collection by sieving through a 1 mm mesh held over the side of the boat in the laboratory live benthic organisms were identified and counted weighed for total fresh biomass and the sample was preserved in 4 formaldehyde three grabs were taken for each sample and results converted to m2 3 6 hypothesis 7 water bird species and density annual water bird censuses have been carried out by the national museums of kenya with the kenya wildlife services since 1990 under the auspices of wetlands international part of the international waterbird census used to indicate wetland health wetlands international 2012 the methods are observation using binoculars and telescopes by several trained observers in groups covering sections of the lake in the same day they are always conducted on a day in january and sometimes also in july the census data were used during this study after confirming they remained accurate in the appropriate sections to calculate the species richness and density of herbivorous piscivorous birds and from the latter data the probable offtake of fish in kg daily consumption of fish by common piscivorous birds was estimated from cooper winkler lenz 1984 glahn et al 1999 crocker et al 2002 and gremillet et al 2003 the total annual consumption of fish by birds in the two decades 1991 2000 pre carp 2001 10 post carp as well as 2011 15 was calculated 3 7 hypothesis 8 fish community and food web pre carp fish community and densities were taken from published papers and commercial fisheries reports no new research is described here during the post carp period random samples were taken in november 2012 and in april 2013 casting nets mesh size 10 mm and 50 mm gill nets mesh size 20 100 mm and basket traps were used freshly caught fish were also purchased from fishermen about 1000 tilapiines and 100 carp were analysed and recorded gut contents of 25 carp were extracted from live fishes using a syringe and immediately fixed digestible food tends to disappear rapidly after fish is caught the samples were preserved in formaldehyde later sorted and identified in the laboratory under a binocular microscope each carp was weighed ballast material parts of macrophytes detritus mineral soil was recorded as indicator of where carp had been feeding the density of the tilapiines present mainly in the littoral and of barbus pelagic were estimated on the basis of a calculation of the total area of the littoral zone and of the amount of fish caught from gillnets and from the cast net fish density in the pelagic zone was estimated using official catch statistics provided by the kenyan ministry of fisheries naivasha office stable carbon and nitrogen biplots were used to determine trophic position and relationships within the lake based upon data collected in november 2003 after the carp had established for methodological details see britton et al 2007 no similar data was available for pre carp although muchiri et al 1994 and hickley et al 1994 had suggested food web relationships based on gut analysis of the then common fish species 3 8 hypothesis 9 benefits to human communities around the lake the approximate market price in 2013 of freshly caught carp was established at kamere landing beach during several visits at the times of the fieldwork described above by observing daily market negotiation between fishmongers and customers official catch statistics were kindly provided by the naivasha district fishery office at karagita the data indicate the number and weight of fish by species caught each month whilst fieldwork was being undertaken it became clear that shoreline fishermen who are un licenced and use fine mesh beach seines and cast nets were taking a considerable quantity of small fish so we made an estimate of this harvest the numbers of people engaged on each day of fieldwork in 2012 and 2013 were counted and a questionnaire was distributed to riparian owners covering other parts of the lake not visited the weight of fish taken was estimated as 50 kg per sack and average catch was taken to be 1 sack every two people each day it is not known how much un licenced shoreline fishing occurred during the pre carp period but personal observations during research suggested it was small up to the turn of the century because the fisheries department operated anti poaching teams the data are used to show the weight of fish that is likely taken from the lake unrecorded compared with the licenced catch in addition the calculated offtake by birds was also considered because birds are essential for the tourist value of the lake the nutritional and health related quality of carp flesh was established by evaluating the composition of unsaturated organic acids and the presence of agricultural pesticides the content of unsaturated organic acids was analysed at the faculty of fisheries and water protection university of south bohemia in české budějovice czech republic lipid analysis was performed as described by mráz and pickova 2009 after being extracted by hexane isopropanol hara and radin 1978 fish organoleptic quality was assessed by means of a blind test involving 15 people carp fillet was served at the same time as commercial tilapia from lake victoria oreochromis niloticus l and kenyan red snapper lutjanidae each simmered in lightly salted water with a little olive oil samples of carp hepatopancreas carp fillet and tilapia 4 individuals taken in 2013 were tested for some 1400 synthetic compounds in the czech republic 1000 of which are common agro industrial pesticides including triazines organchlorines and pyrethroids organic compounds in the water column were assessed at the same time by means of 5 passive samplers polar organic chemical integrative sampler columbia environmental research center usa kept for one week suspended in the water column no pre carp work had been undertaken on any fish species 4 results 4 1 hypothesis 1 lower water transparency water transparency throughout the late 1980s and 1990s was between 45 cm secchi disc extinction and 100 cm it was higher for shorter periods in 1982 mean 140 cm and 1999 mean 150 cm both periods which coincided with high lake levels it ranged between 64 93 cm at most times between 2012 4 with a single clear water phase in december 2014 of 2 65 m there is no evidence that transparency has been reduced by carp 4 2 hypothesis 2 increased soluble nutrients conductivity was 345 368 µs cm 1 and ph between 6 9 and 8 2 of the 9 samples taken at different depths in 1995 no significant concentration differences were detected between sites in chemistry with moderate nitrogen concentrations 40 160 µg nh4 n l 1 30 130 µg no3 n l 1 and low phosphorus 3 8 µg srp p l 1 40 120 µg tp p l 1 soluble reactive silicate concentrations were between 5 and 5 3 mg si l 1 during the 2012 2014 post carp period conductivity was between 221 and 265 µs cm 1 and ph between 7 1 and 8 7 but with occasional peaks up to 9 3 within the littoral during the central part of the day soluble reactive forms of phosphate were undetectable in surface water while ammonia and nitrate were present at low concentrations tables 1 and 2 soluble nitrogen was lowest in the littoral zone increasing slightly moving towards mid lake soluble reactive phosphate was always undetectable at mid lake stations while moderate srp concentrations 8 10 µg p l 1 occurred within the shallow littoral in particular close to river inlets and under e crassipes mats digested samples revealed low concentrations of total nutrients there was a higher tn tp ratio than the redfield ratio and the presence of a detectable concentration of nitrate and ammonia which suggest p limitation of phytoplankton growth higher values of nitrate and ammonia up to 536 µg nh4 n l 1 and 552 µg no3 n l 1 but not of phosphate were recorded in early december 2014 at that time a clear water event transparency 2 65 m with a dense daphniid population dominated by daphnia pulex leydig was recorded there is no evidence that carp have increased soluble nutrients 4 3 hypothesis 3 phytoplankton species change increased density and primary production in 1995 96 green algae chlorophyta made the greatest contribution to overall cell numbers with a diverse assemblage consisting of the genera scenedesmus 12 cosmarium 4 botryococcus 4 dictyosphaerium 5 and tetraëdron 6 botryococcus dominated the phytoplankton during april and may 1995 giving a brown coloration to the water cyanobacteria represented on average less than 30 of the total cell count and diatoms just above 20 these included the genera aulacoseira navicula nitzchia and synedra flagellates comprised of the genera euglenophyta chrysophyta cryptophyta and dinophyta were at low abundance 9 and at low diversity chlorophyll a measurements in the late 1990s averaged 31 µg l 1 with a few surface outliers between 140 145 35 primary production in the top 3 m of the water column averaged of 1 06 g m 2 d 1 between january and may 1998 n 6 phytoplankton in the post carp period was dominated by cyanobacteria in terms of cell numbers mainly the genera cylindrospermopsis aphanocapsa coelosphaerium planktolyngbya microcystis but with a variable proportion in terms of biomass 13 90 dinophytes mostly forms non palatable to zooplankton were high in the november 2012 samples while diatoms colonies of aulacoseira cells of achnanthes and small centric diatoms appeared more consistently in may 2013 fig 4 desmids included mainly staurastrum and in particular closterium aciculare t west a large and unpalatable species which contributed significantly to biomass in 2013 small chlorophytes were relatively common next to large unpalatable pediastrum duplex meyen and p simplex meyen no clear difference could be detected between samples collected in littoral and in pelagic zones the range of chlorophyll a was between 19 and 71 µg l 1 n 30 primary production was 3 5 0 5 g c m 2 d 1 n 5 a full species list for lake naivasha is provided at https data mendeley com there is no evidence from these results that carp have caused change in phytoplankton composition or biomass 4 4 hypothesis 4 zooplankton abundance and size during may 1995 april 1996 rotifers made up the largest proportion of the zooplankton community together with copepoda nauplii species of the genus brachionus dominated the rotifera population in all stations with brachionus calyciflorus pallas being commonest and showing little variability in its density copepoda dominated the crustacean population with thermocyclops oblongatus sars the commonest cladocerans were diaphanosoma excisum et mongolianum sars d pulex simocephalus vetulus mueller daphnia laevis birge ceriodaphnia cornuta sars and moina micrura kurz they dominated the biomass in one month december when higher densities of all zooplankton were observed following prolonged rains samples taken in 2012 and 2013 showed a similar composition to 18 years earlier but with greater prevalence of small bodied taxa the zooplankton community was dominated by rotifera and by juvenile copepoda nauplii and copepodites collectively small sized forms represented 60 90 of the zooplankton larger bodied zooplankton were scarce and dominated by the cladocerans c cornuta d excisum d mongolianum and by the copepod t oblongatus zooplankton biomass was distinctly different between littoral samples with an average of 60 mg dry biomass m 3 and pelagic ones closer to 200 mg m 3 diaphanosoma excisum et mongolianum represented a sizeable portion of the zooplankton biomass followed by cyclopoid copepodites fig 5 december 2013 and again 2014 showed significant changes from the earlier two years yet a similarity to december 1995 on both occasions there was a strong predominance of cladocerans in 2013 it was s vetulus d excisum d mongolianum and d volzi stingelin in 2014 it was d pulex with d laevis at lower densities other cladocerans such as m micrura d excisum and s vetulus were in very low numbers as were other zooplankters such as copepods and rotifers generally littoral zooplankton were larger than pelagial zooplankton thus whilst there is no strong evidence that carp have caused a decrease in size of zooplankton there is evidence for the first time of differences between littoral and pelagial which is discussed below a full species list for zooplankton of lake naivasha is provided at https data mendeley com 4 5 hypothesis 5 density of macrozoobenthos mean benthic invertebrate biomass in 1996 was 24 8 g m 2 as fresh weight chironomid biomass accounted for 70 of this the majority represented by a species of chironomus the remaining 30 oligochaetes were dominated by branchiura sowerbyi beddard there had been a distinct change by 1998 and 1999 however with the near disappearance of chironomids 6 3 and 7 7 of fresh weight and dominance of oligochaetes this dominance was still apparent in 2012 and 2013 with pelagic areas containing fresh weights similar to 98 99 consisting mainly of b sowerbyi and other tubificids including limnodrilus hoffmeisteri claparède with few chironomids fresh weight biomass in littoral areas in 2012 3 was about 5 of pelagic dominated by chironomids with tubificids far smaller in size than b sowerbyi which dominated the oligochaetes table 3 the evidence available suggests that changes in the macrozoobenthos occurred in the five years before carp arrived in the lake and not subsequent to their arrival this is discussed further below 4 6 hypothesis 6 loss of macrophytes there were very dense mats of plants in the shallow littoral zone overwhelmingly dominated by water hyacinth eichhornia crassipes mart solms with occasional floating water fern salvinia molesta mitchell throughout the second half of the 1990s but no submerged plants this changed for a brief period in 2002 3 when submerged plants were found in the northern part of the lake potamogeton octandrus poir potamogeton pectinatus l najas horrida magn potamogeton schweinfurthii a ceratophyllum demersum l with occasional nymphaea caerulea sav no submerged plants were found between 2012 and 2014 the littoral zone contained scattered plants of e crassipes and s molesta never enough to form mats and few small c papyrus islands it is possible that carp abundance by 2003 might have caused the loss of submerged plants and breakup of floating plants after that time 4 7 hypothesis 7 reduction in the numbers of herbivorous birds increase in piscivorous twenty five years continuous water bird census have yielded a total of 110 species the actual number seen in any one year is about three quarters of this between 61 lowest in 1998 and 82 highest 2002 the decade average was 74 in the 1990s 71 in the 2000s and 70 in the first half of the 2110s the difference too small to be attributed to any one cause using the two commonest herbivorous birds yellow billed duck anas undulata and red knobbed coot fulica cristata as indicators of the group the average density in the 1990s was 3870 coot and 293 duck coot had dropped to 2740 in the 2000s whilst numbers of duck were similar 304 coot showed a further decline in the first half of this decade 1150 whilst duck remained similar 293 coot numbers exceeded 4000 only in the years 1991 95 2001 2 and 2006 mean numbers of piscivorous birds eagles herons egrets kingfishers pelicans and cormorants were more abundant in the decade post carp than pre carp table 4 primarily because of a 4 fold increase in the number of pelicans as well as lesser increases in smaller piscivores total intake by piscivorous birds was approximately 588 tonnes of fish biomass annually in the last decade of the 20th century pre carp this was more than doubled in the first decade of this post carp to an estimated 1 316 tonnes per annum table 4 the actual years of our study were mid way between these two figures 867 tonnes 4 8 hypothesis 8 dominance of the fish community and the lake food web all studies of the naivasha fish community in the 1990s have been published all sample dates in 2012 4 showed a clear separation between the littoral zone dominated by tilapiines and the pelagic zone dominated by cyprinids not previously observed fish density in the littoral was relatively high 20 50 individuals m 2 of small tilapia 1 5 cm size but no carp the riparian edges i e the biotope between the riparian rooted c papyrus and floating aquatic grasses and the outer floating vegetation were entirely dominated by young tilapia fry 3 5 cm barbus paludinosus peters locally known as adel was caught in the pelagic zone and in the littoral close to river inlets fish density there was moderate carp density was 12 kg ha 1 with the two cyprinids c carpio and b paludinosus representing over 80 of the fish biomass table 5 gut content analysis indicated that adult carp fed prevalently on benthic invertebrates and in particular on chironomids and oligochaetes mainly b sowerbyi secondary food items included ciliates copepods and vegetable matter planktonic algae and ballast tilapiine gut contents were very different primarily rotifers brachionus keratella algae and ciliates overall the analysis revealed very little overlap between tilapiines and carp table 6 no stable isotope analysis was carried out pre carp although food web on the basis of fish gut analysis was suggested by hickley north muchiri harper 1994 the predatory dominance of c carpio in the pelagic zone food web was clear fig 6 but there was a lack of a top predator in the food web of the littoral fig 7 where the highest δ15n values i e the highest position within the trophic web were attributed to odonata and to p clarkii piscivorous birds not analysed during this survey likely assumed the top predator role in the shallows as well as sharing the pelagial with carp this hypothesis was supported carp dominate the lake food web 4 9 hypothesis 9 benefits to humans from fish harvesting nutritional quality and value of carp the catches from the commercial boat and gill net fishery are recorded have been published and are discussed in the next section the catches by unlicensed fishermen operating from the shore in the littoral zone as deep as a man s armpits and using seine nets to encircle fish have not previously been recorded in 2012 14 groups of 2 3 people operated every day along the entire shoreline of the lake each holding a segment territory of about 500 metres we observed several local groups fishing catching not less than 50 kg of tilapia each per day the main lake shoreline length was 117 km thus we estimated that lake naivasha holds about 500 unlicensed fishermen catching no less than 11 7 tonnes of fish day i e around 4 270 tonnes per year this is more than 10x the annual catch of licensed fishermen in a good year the total estimated consumption of fish from lake naivasha from 2014 figures when the commercial catch 400 tonnes was highest was approximately 5 537 tonnes of which 77 was by shoreline illegal fishermen 16 by piscivorous birds with the commercial fishery 8 of the total table 4 we can conclude that poachers with nets of small mesh size well as birds minimise crossing of small fish particularly young tilapias from littoral to pelagial potential food in the pelagial is not used and the catch of bigger fish is low both birds and shoreline fishermen take smaller adult and juvenile fish which the commercial catch does not this is discussed further below the carp fillet fatty acid composition revealed a high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids ufa their concentration levels confirm high nutritional value table 7 the blind tasting event conducted in september 2014 with 15 people none of whom had eaten carp before resulted in tilapia scoring 1st carp 2nd above red snapper despite this all 15 had positive comments about their first carp experience and declared that if they had a chance they would have liked to consume carp regularly fish muscle samples contained synthetic compounds such as triazines organochlorines and pyrethroids far below tolerance limits and in most cases close to the detection limit of the instruments an exception was dde a metabolite of ddt that was found in measurable amounts 1 2 µg dde kg in carp 3 5 µg dde kg in tilapia one of the 5 passive samplers in the lake showed metalaxyl m an agrochemical known to be commonly used again concentrations were far below recommended tolerance limits carp do not thus appear to be negative to the human community this hypothesis is further evaluated below 5 discussion the results show some substantial differences between the pre carp and the post carp sampling periods but many other factors have changed over these 20 years in addition to the fish composition the water level fluctuations which were described in the introduction are potentially a very influential factor considering that water level rises are intimately linked with increased nutrients from the catchment kitaka et al 2002a human impact is another potentially highly relevant driver since the growth of naivasha town and of settlements around the lake has been very rapid over the past 30 years concurrent with the growth of the horticultural industry harper et al 2012 the nine hypotheses are discussed below with all potential factors causing the changes considered we recognise that small sets of samples and analyses particularly for water chemistry are inadequate when considered alone in almost any ecosystem but particularly so for a dynamic ecosystem such as naivasha where considerable hydrological variation occurs over time directly influencing the biota nevertheless such a comparison has never previously been made 5 1 hypothesis 1 lower water transparency transparency was in the same range in both measurement periods with occasional exceptions the ratio between mean depth ca 3 3 5 m and transparency was between 3 2 and 5 5 indicating conditions that were favourable to high photosynthetic rates wetzel 1983 although it has never been intensely compared it is highly likely that transparency is significantly related to water level high at high water level as depth is increased by river water that drops its silt in the lake when uni directional current ceases low at low water level because of sediment stirring by wind and by phytoplankton growth the indications of the highest transparency in 1982 and 1999 suggest this together with anecdotal observations from high lake levels in 2010 and 2016 pers obs dmh the 1st hypothesis that carp cause a turbid lake water cannot thus be supported 5 2 hypothesis 2 increased nutrients considered for p n and si separately higher p concentrations have always been associated with higher river discharges while much of the n present in the lake is considered the product of n fixation within the littoral swamp gaudet 1979 there has been a progressive increase in p and n over the past 40 years the ranges of phosphorus and nitrogen levels reported in 1995 and then in 2012 2013 are broader characterised by higher maxima than the range of concentrations reported up to the 1980s total p concentrations measured by gaudet in 1975 6 in the open water ranged between 5 58 µg p l 1 extrapolated from graphs gaudet 1979 while peters and maclntyre 1976 reported 3 µg po4 p l 1 in the open lake water kalff in 1979 80 measured 28 79 µg p l 1 kalff 1983 and njuguna between 1979 80 found an average of 56 µg p l 1 njuguna 1982 kalff also 1983 demonstrated strong p limitation of phytoplankton growth in the lake water through 33po4 fertilisation experiments and by studying the relationship between tp and chlorophyll a the undetectable srp with low tdp and tp concentrations measured by us in 2012 2013 and a high n p ratio confirm a sustained long term p limitation of phytoplankton with a seasonal increase in p availability triggered by rain and river runoff cycles as suggested by kitaka et al 2002a thus we have no evidence that carp may have increased phosphorus concentrations in the lake over concentration increases likely to have occurred due to increased catchment land use and erosion the second hypothesis that carp cause nutrient enrichment is not supported by the pattern of change in phosphorus levels nitrate increased in the open water station in gaudet s 1975 6 study from the onset of the rains reaching up to 49 µg no3 n l 1 a peak that is higher than concentrations measured by us in 2012 2013 our observations that there are inverse phosphate and nitrate gradients p decreasing from shore to mid lake while n increases are coherent with gaudet s studies gaudet 1979 gaudet and muthuri 1981 and reflect concurrent processes of p uptake by the lake phytoplankton but lack of n uptake because they are p limited within the erstwhile north swamp concentrations of phosphate and ammonia were relatively high due to localised anaerobic conditions favouring nutrient release gaudet 1979 gaudet and muthuri 1981 muthuri and jones 1997 there is periodic appearance of appreciable concentrations of phosphate and ammonia in shallow littoral zones under dense water hyacinth mats that now persist along the entire lake edge absent during gaudet s times water hyacinth invaded the lake from 1989 at the same time as a notable reduction of c papyrus was occurring due to water level decreases which allowed anthropogenic degradation e g cutting and grazing morrison and harper 2009 total nitrogen concentrations have a range of values comparable to those measured during the pre carp period 0 3 1 mg n l 1 for organic nitrogen tn not including ammonia were measured by gaudet 1979 1 3 2 5 tn by kalff in 1979 80 kalff 1983 a mean of 1 4 tn by njuguna in 1979 1981 njuguna 1982 and 0 6 1 1 mg tn l 1 by us in 2012 2013 ammonia is hard to compare due to its very high variability observed both during gaudet s times as well as during our surveys only on one occasion was there unusually high concentrations of nitrate and ammonia which coincided with the highest secchi depth of 2 65 m 2 6 m was the top of the range measured by kalff in 1979 80 during this clearwater event the lake surface was visibly covered in d pulex ephippia these high dissolved nitrogen values can thus be ascribed to zooplankton grazing this is more likely than eutrophication caused by carp excretion nuttall and richardson 1991 bioturbation braband et al 1990 breukelaar et al 1994 or nutrient release due to macrophyte damage by carp and low uptake by phytoplankton qin threkeld 1990 chakrabarty das das 2007 thus nutrient dynamics moderated by seasonal rains are more likely to be under the control of littoral and planktonic vegetation no significant nutrient increase that could be ascribed to carp has not been obvious and our second hypothesis is not supported for nitrogen soluble reactive silicate the diatom available form of dissolved sio2 has undergone a progressive reduction in lake waters since early measurements taken by beadle in 1930 11 7 mg si l 1 beadle 1932 by talling in 1960 1961 14 15 7 mg si l 1 talling and talling 1965 and by gaudet in 1975 6 10 3 mg si l 1 cited by litterick et al 1979 page 22 the malewa river delivered 7 mg si l 1 during baseflow in 1975 and 24 mg si l 1 during an increase in discharge in early 1976 values that are representative of a tropical river basin characterised by an alkaline volcanic substrate gaudet and melack 1981 intermediate values were measured by gaudet within the littoral swamp in 1976 3 3 7 1 mg si l 1 gaudet 1979 and at an open water site in 1995 5 5 3 mg si l 1 recently measured silicate values were however only around 1 mg si l 1 when measured at mid lake sites closer to 2 mg si l 1 at river inlet and above 3 mg si l 1 inside the river the progressive silicate depletion at lake naivasha can be interpreted as a sign of increasing diatom uptake linked to eutrophication as forecasted by kilham 1971 further discussed by conley et al 1993 for the north american great lakes and by ngupula et al 2014 for lake victoria thus we cannot associate the impact of carp with silica changes 5 3 hypothesis 3 phytoplankton species change increased density and primary production assessments of the lake s phytoplankton assemblage have been made since the 1930s changes during the pre carp period have been summarised by hubble and harper 2002 while ballot et al 2009 described phytoplankton dynamics during the early post carp period talling 1986 placed lake naivasha in a large group of african lakes and reservoirs where aulacoseira tends to be dominant at times of river inflow induced water column turbulence while cyanobacteria such as microcystis generally predominate at times and in portions of the lake where there is greater water column stability other taxa such as botryococcus occasionally form intense blooms but for relatively short periods hubble and harper 2002 showed that the water column tends to be daily mixed at lake naivasha with an even distribution of chlorophyll a also reported in litterick et al 1979 with the exception of the deeper crescent island lagoon the aulacoseira dominated phytoplankton community is controlled by p limitation and favoured by the occurrence of strong winds and by river flood pulses cyanobacteria are able to impose themselves by creating particularly stable populations during prolonged dry seasons in the absence of allochthonous inputs these periods are typically characterised by strong p deficiency the alternation between an aulacoseira and a cyanobacteria dominated assemblage has been documented several times at lake naivasha by lind in the 1960s aulacoseira by kallqvist in 1976 77 cyanobacteria kallqvist 1987 by kalff in 1979 80 aulacoseira then microcystis and botryococcus kalff and watson 1986 and by hubble in 1997 98 aulacoseira hubble and harper 2002 during 1979 80 microcystis reached over 50 of the overall phytoplankton biomass 22 mg l 1 kalff and watson 1986 and was later partly replaced by botryococcus since the turn of the century blooms have become more intense in september 2002 56 6 mg l 1 of botryococcus terribilis komarek and marvan diatom diversity decreased and periods of sustained cyanobacteria dominance seem to have become more common ballot et al 2009 a dense microcystis bloom was recorded in the littoral south west portion of the lake in 2006 possibly concentrated by wind ballot et al 2009 cyanobacterial dominance was also strong during 2005 9 harper et al 2012 similar conditions were apparent in 2012 2013 cyanobacteria up to 50 of the phytoplankton biomass in the pelagic region dominated by microcystis while n2 fixing cyanobacteria belonging to the nostocales were far less abundant the composition abundance and the decreasing diversity of the naivasha phytoplankton during 2001 2004 were interpreted as signs of increasing eutrophic conditions giving a rising risk of cyanobacterial toxin release ballot et al 2005 after this period however the effects of cultural eutrophication that then seemed so clear have become blurred due to a severe drawdown that saw the lake reaching its lowest water levels in 56 years 1884 12 m a s l on 24th december 2009 followed by a relatively rapid recovery during the period 2010 2014 see fig 2 an increase in the proportion of small cyanobacterial species and a noticeable increase in streptophytes desmids occurred concurrently these characteristics indicate a moderation of the eutrophication trend that could be ascribed to the relative dilution 2011 2013 the proportion of palatable phytoplankton taxa observed in pelagic samples now indicate a relatively good potential for zooplankton grazing chlorophyll a concentrations had ranged between 26 74 µg l 1 in the early 1970s melack 1976 9 48 µg l 1 in 1979 80 kalff 1983 21 37 in 1979 1981 njuguna 1982 occasional higher values 100 µg l 1 were recorded during drawdown periods in 1997 98 pre carp period hubble 2000 and by us when the lake was temporarily lower the primary production is high in relation to other freshwater lakes and it has increased considerably over recent years as can be seen by comparing gross primary production measurements carried out by melack in 1973 74 with data obtained by hubble in 1997 1998 and then in 2012 2013 table 8 overall it is more likely that periodical cyanobacterial prominence and higher chlorophyll levels have developed and still do as a consequence of physical conditions accentuated by drawdown events rather than because of the effects of carp so the 3rd hypothesis cannot be supported 5 4 hypothesis 4 zooplankton abundance and size the low body size of the dominant zooplankters on one hand and the fact that palatable phytoplankton were available on the other indicate that the zooplankton community of lake naivasha is shaped by a relatively intense fish predation pressure both in the pre carp and in the post carp period rotifera and copepoda too small to be retained by filtering fish predominated cladocera due to their larger size tend to be caught in the gills of planktivorous fish and retained as food and their density was consistently low the proportion of cladocera has been steadily decreasing between surveys illustrated by comparing mavuti 1983 with surveys pre carp in 1995 1996 and those post carp in 2012 2013 the low abundance of zooplankton and in particular of cladocera in the littoral in 2012 2013 was most likely due to predation by tilapia fry as no young carp or b paludinosus was found in littoral fish catches higher zooplankton densities were present in the pelagic but still contained no large daphniids this is believed to be an effect of predation by b paludinosus which is able to prey selectively on large cladocerans the only time when abundant large cladocerans were found in the lake coincident with clear water was between late 2013 and november 2014 at times of lower river discharge cyprinids in general and b paludinosus in particular are strongly attracted by water movements and thus tend to congregate towards river mouths in lakes when there is little in lake water movements at lower lake levels we believe that the presence of daphniids in november 2014 was due to low fish activity in the open water at a time of low river discharge the role of carp in relation to naivasha s zooplankton remains ambiguous adult carp is an obligatory benthivore due to the large size of its gill rakers sibbing 1988 and it does not prey extensively on zooplankton however carp fingerlings can be pelagic planktivores khan et al 2003 britton et al 2007 weber and brown 2013 howell et al 2014 in a way that could be similar to b paludinosus the short term reappearance of d laevis a cool and clearwater loving species mergeay et al 2006 that had not been recorded in naivasha since 1995 6 suggests that species characterising the former mesotrophic stable state are still present but kept at check by cyprinid predation any action taken to reduce the predation pressure caused by b paludinosus would probably result in higher zooplankton densities with the presence of cladocerans similarly reducing adult carp by intensifying selective fishing practices would also tend to reduce any negative impacts due to bioturbation sediment resuspension and the related hindrance to zooplankton grazing bonneau and scarnecchia 2014 that are localised as we found no evidence of decreased transparency the recent clearwater period of november 2014 indicates that at times in naivasha phytoplankton control by zooplankton grazing is possible we thus cannot support this 4th hypothesis either that carp alone have had a negative impact upon zooplankton 5 5 hypothesis 5 density of macrozoobenthos the first comprehensive review of the benthos of lake naivasha was published by clark et al 1989 they compared observations made in 1982 3 and in mid 1984 with earlier accounts cox 1977 millbrink 1977 carried out at a time when the lake was dominated by native submerged macrophyte and extensive water lily beds with a more diverse population of naidid oligochetes samples collected at the lake edge as well as from the littoral and the profundal by clark et al 1989 reported a predominance of l hoffmeisteri over b sowerbyi in biomass they also noted the presence of a third oligochete potamothrix heuscheri bretscher the large glossoscolecid alma emini michaelsen and of at least 6 different chironomid genera chironomus cladotanytarsus procladius tanypus dicrotendypes nilodorum the molluscan fauna was very poor comprising ferrisia sp and physa acuta draparnaud b sowerbyi accounted for 58 of a total benthic invertebrate biomass of 4 07 g dw m 2 in 1989 90 raburu et al 2002 with l hoffmeisteri 27 chironomids 8 and other oligochaetes and microturbellarian worms respectively 4 and 3 our benthos in 1998 and 1999 was about half this total dry weight but with similar proportions similar benthos occured in the pelagic zone in 2012 2013 but the littoral was considerably depleted by comparison this indicates the greater intensity of fish predation mainly by juveniles in littoral areas that resulted in small sized invertebrate species similarly as was found in the zooplankton two differences appear between all the quantitative grab based studies the change in relative abundance of chironomids and the absolute biomass change it is tempting to attribute the high proportion of chironomids in 1996 but neither before or after to the release from crayfish predation that occurred after submerged macrophyte collapse in the early 1990s but before crayfish recovery made possible by the dense hyacinth beds in the late 1990s four five years later after this century began hyacinth mats had collapsed through weevil introduction and have never regained their density or cover oligochaetes now dominate the benthic fauna harper et al 2012 the persistence of this moderately high benthos biomass in the post carp period is a strong indication of the low impact of carp on the lake s pelagic food web we thus can see a probable effect of juvenile fish predation but not necessarily of carp alone on the benthos and thus our 5th hypothesis is not supported 5 6 hypothesis 6 loss of macrophytes in the decades before c carpio arrival in the early years of this century there was a moderately turbid ecosystem strongly modified by the presence of the red louisiana crayfish p clarkii which arrived in 1975 and had wiped out all rooted aquatic macrophytes by 1982 harper 1984 smart et al 2002 crayfish then declined through predation made possible by the absence of shelter hickley et al 2002 showed a distinct negative correlation between the occurrence of crayfish in micropterus salmoides large mouthed bass stomachs and submerged plant density this was followed by the arrival and spread through the 1990s of e crassipes mats whose roots provided shelter to crayfish from predation by day allowing them to drop out and feed on detritus by night adams et al 2002 harper et al 2012 by 2003 the lake s macrophytes had partially recovered believed to be due to heavy avian and fish predation on p clarkii following breakup of the e crassipes mats which had previously sheltered them itself a result of the introduction of neo tropical weevils neochetina eichhorniae warner for biological control by the kenya agricultural research institute harper et al 2012 this scenario is unlikely to allow the reappearance of rooted macrophytes kept in check by the presence of crayfish harper et al 2002 unless in particular years of low crayfish recruitment as happened again in 2006 when 5 species of rooted macrophytes genera najas nitella potamogeton reappeared covering 2000 ha britton et al 2007 harper et al 2012 our sixth hypothesis that c carpio has destroyed the macrophytes cannot thus be supported since macrophyte health and abundance is much more closely related to the abundance of crayfish it is possible but not proven that carp reduce macrophyte germination through benthos feeding when conditions low crayfish densities are favourable the future scenario is that lake naivasha s littoral will probably remain macrophyte free dominated by floating alien plants almost independently of the impact of carp the lake now has clarias gariepinus which first appeared in 2012 keyombe waithaka obegi 2015 and is a predominantly carnivorous feeder with juveniles taking a substantial proportion of crayfish meri 2016 careful monitoring of the ecosystem which now appears to be undertaken by the kenya marine fisheries institute kmfri waithaka et al 2020 will confirm this scenario or document its change thus there is no evidence that carp have to date caused macrophyte decline 5 7 hypothesis 7 reduction in the numbers of herbivorous birds increase in piscivorous the abundance of f cristata in the first five years of the 1990s can be explained by the abundance of submerged plants at this time before the arrival of any water hyacinth gouder de beauregard harper malaise symoens 1998 the decline after that occurred at the same time as e crassipes appearance and dominance with the revival of the herbivorous crayfish p clarkii populations smart et al 2002 the individual year highs of coot populations coincide with water level increases which are followed by submerged plant germination for a few months before crayfish populations respond to the increased water area and food provided grey jackson 2012 thus it is highly unlikely that the presence of carp had any direct effect upon herbivorous birds although an indirect effect via crayfish cannot be ruled out piscivorous birds showed distinct increase in the post carp period over the decade before most piscivorous birds feed on juvenile carp and smaller species prior to the arrival of carp fishery yields had always dropped with water level decline and increased after water level rise oyugi et al 2011 the annual catch of tilapiines had increased by over an order of magnitude for two years following a lake level rise caused by heavy el nino rains in 1998 njiru et al 2008 the fishery was maintained closed for june august each year throughout the first decade of this century with no noticeable improvement on catches of tilapiine fish once it re opened njiru et al 2008 this is most likely due to the overwhelming dominance of c carpio post 2003 britton et al 2007 which had not been predicted at the time of the over fishing that caused the annual closure annual carp catches continued to increase steadily thereafter up to a maximum in 2009 when the lake reached its lowest level since 1954 and carp were easy to catch harper et al 2012 several authors have noted that predation can be a factor significantly affecting carp populations paukert et al 2003 bajer and sorensen 2010 young of the year carp are considered a vulnerable prey especially when the shelter provided by rooted macrophyte is absent weber and brown 2012 the fisheries department introduced over 400 000 fingerlings of o niloticus between 2010 and 2012 in an effort to re establish the tilapia fishery keyombe et al 2015 with the subsequent appearance of this species in fish catches a small quantity of o niloticus appeared in the commercial catch in 2012 for the first time just 279 individuals at 145 kg from the almost half a million fingerlings introduced over the previous 2 years together with a similar quantity 139 kg of c gariepinus the governor of nakuru county fisheries management had devolved to counties following adoption of the new kenya constitution in august 2010 announced in july 2014 that he would abolish the closed season and that further stocking would soon be carried out with a half a million tilapia fingerlings http kenyanewsagency go ke p 27653 despite this relatively low stocking rate in central europe restocking is carried out at a density of 1 million fingerlings ha 1 considering a survival rate of 5 as success it did have some effect waithaka et al 2019 report that the fisheries showed a steady increase in annual catches after 2014 until it exceeded 1 000 tons for the first time in the history of the fishery keyombe et al 2018 with almost 1 3 o nilotica and a little over 2 3 c carpio today the lake hosts the cichlids o leucostictus o niloticus and t zillii the centrarchid m salmoides the cyprinids c carpio and b paludinosus synonymous of b amphigramma which migrates from the rivers the poecilid poecilia reticulata w peters introduced in the 1960s for supposed mosquito control and c gariepinus it is thus highly likely that the increase in piscivorous birds has not been caused directly by the carp but indirectly by a fishery closure at the beginning of this decade which allowed tilapiines populations to recover b growth of the carp fishery which led the legal gill net fishermen to maintain the legal net size to prevent adult carp damaging the nets so under sized fish were not taken and c the large introductions of tilapiine fingerlings to support this fishery since 2010 the hypothesis that carp have caused an increase in piscivorous birds is not supported 5 8 hypothesis 8 dominance of the food web by carp at the beginning of the 20th century the fish community comprised only one native species which had survived a 19th century dry period an endemic poecilidae aplocheilichthys antinorii vinc this was last recorded in 1962 and believed to have been driven to extinction by the first deliberate introduction the predatory micropterus salmoides lacepède large mouthed bass from north america elder garrod and whitehead 1971 a commercial gill net fishery opened in the 1950s on tilapiines introduced to feed the bass and extensive further introductions were made thereafter gherardi et al 2011 of new fish species the commercial fishery used to be based mainly on the oreochromis tilapia and the bass muchiri et al 1995 but it was in long term decline with only small interruptions caused by water level rise and increased lake area until 2001 when it dramatically crashed and was closed for a year otiang a owiti and oswe 2007 since that time up to 2015 it has been re opened with a closed season to seek to protect spawning but more significantly c carpio has become completely dominant in numbers and biomass in the catch hickley et al 2004 aloo et al 2013 reducing the need for such management the activities of licensed fishermen have been limited to 9 months annually for the past decade in order to give tilapiines chance to recover since the overfishing of the late 20th century licensed fishermen use seine nets of 4 cm mesh size to prevent catch of small fish the commercial catch was increasing during the period of our study with the annual yield of tilapias rising from just under 5 tonnes in 2012 to almost 400 tonnes in 2016 keyombe et al 2018 the carp catch over this time rose from 142 tonnes to 325 tonnes the catch of other species m salmoides and a newly recorded alien species catfish clarias gariepinus burchell was low only between 3 to 9 tonnes hickley et al 2002 discussed the theoretical maximum sustainable yield msy for the naivasha fishery calculated on the basis of a range of models selected from scientific literature and suitable for tropical lakes showing that it was far greater than the yield calculated from fish landing statistics provided by the kenyan fisheries office similarly trophic cascade arguments linking primary and secondary production would predict that primary production rates measured here should result in a far greater fish biomass in the lake a positive logarithmic relationship between primary production and fish yield was proposed by melack 1976 for a set of tropical lakes log y 0 113 gpp 1 1 gpp gross primary production g o2 m 2 d 1 0 91 this function implies that the energy conversion efficiency increases with increasing primary production on the other hand in highly eutrophic czech fish ponds hrbáček 1969 modelled carp production according to y 3 48 gpp 0 563 postulating a progressive decrease in energy transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and fish as primary production increased due to fish habitat degradation and to the progressive selection of less palatable phytoplankton species calculations based on our gpp measurements 9 3 g o m 2 d 1 give quite different predicted annual fish yields melack s formula 91 4 kg ha 1 year 1 equivalent to 1370 2 2 the calculation implies that the lake surface is 150 km2 t year 1 hrbacek s formula 12 2 kg ha 1 year 1 equivalent to 183 t year 1 hrbacek s formula gives an estimate that is very close to the open water carp density found during our experimental catches using a multimesh gillnet but melack s estimate as well as other secondary production indices calculated and discussed by hickley et al 2002 give figures that are far higher than the fish yields that have been achieved from official catch statistics catch statistics tend to naturally underestimate annual yields as saturday and sunday catches usually go unrecorded oyugi et al 2011a these authors also suggested that data collection has not been always continuous which could lead to some underestimation the data shown here on potential fish predation and illegal catch effort indicate that fish production at lake naivasha is far higher in real terms than the official fishery yield suggests estimates thus support calculations which show that birds and illegal fishermen extract more fish from the lake than the legal fishery during rising water levels carp will tend to migrate towards newly inundated littoral areas conversely during stable or receding water levels carp will tend to concentrate in deeper waters as discussed above carp impacts would tend to exacerbate due to more intensive sediment probing and bioturbation if protracted periods of low water levels were to occur the concentration of large numbers of carp into a small water volume is likely to lead to benthos exhaustion and rapid ecosystem degradation the highest ever recorded turbidity in lake naivasha was observed in 2009 when water levels reached their lowest value in recent years however it could not be decided whether this was due to bioturbation or to enhanced sediment stirring caused by wind action the presence of carp in lake naivasha is likely to have increased its ecosystem vulnerability to low water level conditions the significant correlation between fish catch and water transparency shown at lake baringo hickley et al 2004b illustrates the extent of fishery degradation that could occur if carp bioturbation as well as other sources of high turbidity were to permanently affect the water column carp growth rates were analysed by oyugi et al 2011b who concluded that by 2009 naivasha carp achieved very high growth rates and that its rising annual yields appeared to be independent of catch effort reducing carp density could have a positive effect in moderating the lake s eutrophic status because fishes can be storing a large portion of a lake s nutrients kitchell et al 1975 nakashima and leggett 1980 andersson et al 1988 weber and brown 2013 this would become exported from the lake and provide revenue at the same time a win win situation reducing the average individual size of carp through intensive fishing will additionally make the carp population more vulnerable to predation by birds and this may partially reduce the high predation exerted by birds on smaller tilapia it remains highly unlikely that implementing biomanipulation in lake naivasha by specifically targeting a strong reduction in cyprinids and by adding a stock of predatory fish would be able to reverse the on going progressive eutrophication despite to the benefits that might be obtained by reducing carp density this is due to the difficulty of bringing back rooted macrophytes destroyed by louisiana crayfish which represent an essential step towards the stabilisation of mesotrophy in shallow lakes jackson et al 2010 and ultimately to the constantly rising pressure represented by increasing human population within the basin and rising development impacts 5 9 hypothesis 9 benefits to human lakeside communities carp is mainly consumed locally much of it literally at the lakeshore by the low income portion of the resident community the ecosystem services value depends on the fish market value there is currently a deeply rooted negative perception of carp flesh organoleptic and health related properties which prevents its wider distribution and its sale in local restaurants and hotels a factor that strongly reduces carp s potential value a similar situation has been recorded elsewhere in kenya the annual yield of the masinga dam tana river kenya fishery apparently decreased in value following carp invasion as the local luo fishing community attributed greater value to tilapia whose proportion in the catch had decreased following carp appearance allela 1986 on the other hand the czech carp production industry over the years has improved carp based products thus enhancing the provisional service value represented by carp through better marketing zelený plzáková hán kašparc 2020 in 2013 1 kg of fresh tilapia was sold for 400 ksh 3 60 euro while 1 kg of carp sold for 250 ksh 2 30 euro local authorities and ngos now support the fishing community by equipping fish landing sites with deep freeze storage facilities by 2011 and proper weight balances for recording the catch beach management units established in 2005 manage daily operations at official fish landing sites carp will remain the predominant species in the commercial fishery more intensive fishing pressure as recommended together with better management and marketing should combine to keep it as an inexpensive protein source the high proportion of ω 3 compared to ω 6 levels found in the fatty acids of carp fillet confirm the excellent nutritional value of the lake fish the overall value of the fish catch in the lake had increased significantly following the arrival of carp which filled a pelagic benthivorous niche that had remained virtually entirely vacant as postulated by muchiri et al 1994 higher carp yields can thus potentially provide local communities with affordable nutritious protein with an ideal ratio of ω 3 ω 6 a large variety of xenobiotic compounds as well as means of integrated pest control are employed in the naivasha basin by small farmers as well as by large scale horticultural industry producing cut flowers for export mburu et al 2013 measurable levels of dieldrin organchlorine insecticide of documented carcinogenicity and dde ddt metabolite were reported in pelicans and in raptors from the naivasha area in the 1970s see gitahi et al 2002 commonly used pesticides excluding herbicides in the lake basin such as organophosphates carbamates pyrethroids and few organochlorines were listed by gitahi et al 2002 who were able to detect traces of lindane and dieldrin and β endosulfan in bass and in crayfish collected in 1997 8 they found no traces of organic contaminants in water or sediment neither did kaoga et al 2013 recent evidence of sediment and partly also water contamination however were found by gudka 2012 total endosulfan p p ddt and methoxychlor onyango et al 2015 found 4 4 ddt 2 4 dde 4 4 ddd γ hch α hch aldrin and otieno et al 2015 found chlorpyrifos and diazinon the concentration of polar pesticides detected in lake naivasha fish muscle were low significantly lower than average values monitored in central europe r grabic personal communication carp and tilapia samples showed no trace of the chemicals detected in the environment apart from dde that was detected at lower concentrations than those found by gitahi et al 2002 in bass in 1997 8 thus contrary to alarmist views that are often published in the kenyan as well as in the international press e g garric 2015 there was no evidence of dangerous levels of pesticide residues in naivasha carp and tilapia fillet analysed in 2008 2009 by njogu et al 2010 njogu 2011 by gudka in late 2010 gudka 2012 by us in 2012 13 or in tilapia by otieno et al 2015 samples of fish eagle serum and clotted blood revealed the presence of low amounts of organochlorine pesticides but no greater than levels that were found by research conducted in the 1970s gudka 2012 all were below levels that may induce eggshell thinning or any acute effects gudka 2012 despite alarmist reports and claims never substantiated with evidence of severe pollution by agro industrial activities around the lake we found no evidence that levels of agrochemical pesticides in fish fillet are increasing the occasional presence of daphniids in the lake a microcrustacean family known to be highly susceptible to pesticide pollution supports the view that the lake does not suffer from chronic chemical pollution impacts the management of the lake naivasha fishery may require increased fishing effort to reduce direct and indirect impacts of carp increasing fishing licences from 50 to 100 and removing the annual 3 month fishing ban but maintaining a 4 cm mesh prescription is likely to increase the uptake of adult carp this goes in the direction of relaxing bottom up controls linked to potential sediment re suspension and enhanced internal loading this scenario could result in the benefit of lower turbidity and a stronger phosphorus limitation of phytoplankton growth that would control phytoplankton biomass despite the removal of adults carp recruitment is unlikely to be affected due to its high reproductive potential reducing adult carp will possibly further reduce impacts on the benthos but it will not affect zooplankton predation by the young of the year weber and brown 2011 britton et al 2010 the fish yield to the shoreline fishermen remains a management problem ideally they should be the individuals offered licences to fish from boat by gill nets increasing the fishing pressure on carp and decreasing it on juveniles and smaller species the offtake of smaller fish to piscivorous birds is shown in this paper for the first time it should be regarded as an essential benefit to the tourist industry and in future can be quantified annually as another ecosystem service that the fishery provides to the community the final hypothesis that there are no net benefits to the human population around the lake is not supported carp offer several real and potential benefits without showing any of the negative impacts recorded from other tropical and semi tropical lake ecosystems management should recognise this positive benefit 6 concluding remarks and management recommendations 1 the lake naivasha ecosystem has been characterised by higher primary production rates higher maximum tp concentrations and lower soluble reactive silicate concentrations all indicating a general tendency towards increasing eutrophication despite this no appreciable difference in water transparency phytoplankton biomass or nutrient dominance has been observed between the pre carp and the post carp period changes in nutrient n p si concentrations started at least a decade before the appearance of carp indicating that catchment degradation and increased external loading are the cause rather than enhanced internal loading due to carp activities 2 no decrease in key ecosystem parameters that could be ascribed to the presence of carp were found on the basis of 9 working hypotheses initially defined from a literature review carp impact upon tilapia in naivasha is unlikely to be occurring through predation or through direct food competition it is possible sediment disturbance and bioturbation by carp may destroy brood structures and hinder young tilapia recruitment young carp is also likely to cause a worsening of zooplankton community biomass and composition which are important for tilapia development 3 naivasha carp are fast growing and seem to cope well with increasing exploitation rates therefore carp numbers should be kept low through intensive fishing management especially during low water level periods when the lake ecosystem is more vulnerable to degradation 4 reducing carp density will have additional beneficial effects on the tilapia fishery which yields a provisional service of potentially greater value given the higher price per fish biomass 5 lake naivasha s potential fish productivity is likely to be far greater than the official fish catches also because of a significant uptake by birds and by illegal fishermen 6 the overall value of the naivasha commercial fish catch has significantly improved since carp appearance the situation would greatly benefit from the marketing of added value products such as carp fillet that could be offered fresh in tourist hotels 7 carp flesh did not contain dangerous levels of pesticides it proved to be of appreciable taste and of excellent nutritional quality however given the high intensity of industrial exploitation of the lake basin it is recommended that regular monitoring should continue product transformation and marketing initiatives are warranted to improve the benefits delivered by this successful invasive species 8 management of carp indeed the entire fishery should be considered as a lake or even an area management issue rather than just a fisheries management issue for two reasons firstly the supply of food to piscivorous birds is the most important aspect of the lake s tourist industry and the many local people who depend upon tourism secondly the unregistered bankside fishermen have largely come from the ranks of unemployed youth drawn to or living in naivasha and its settlements because of the horticultural industry there are many more of them than licenced fishermen 9 lake naivasha has already demonstrated the ecohydrological impacts caused by loss of moderating papyrus swamps methods of restoring papyrus were formulated next to other ecohydrological

1001, novel ecosystem is a concept which was introduced in the 21st century to describe ecosystems heavily modified by humans about 15 years after ecohydrology had been introduced as concept within unesco ihp to facilitate the sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems by humans and about 5 years after the concept of ihp demonstration sites had been introduced to promote ecohydrological principles globally the tropical african lake naivasha became a ds initially to demonstrate the importance of papyrus dominated wetland edges for nutrient and climate control in an aquatic ecosystem driven by regional hydrological instability but it already represented a novel ecosystem this paper critically examines the consequences of the aquatic food web restructuring by the major alien species common carp cyprinus carpio l whose arrival is directly an ecological consequence of hydrological instability carp were first recorded in lake naivasha in 2001 and reached dominance in the commercial fishery by 2003 the costs and benefits of its dominance are shown by comparing aspects of the ecosystem state before and after arrival these were hypothesized and tested by comparing data in 2012 4 with data gathered in the 1990s using the same methodologies carp have filled a previously vacant benthivorous niche the species achieved moderate density but has not caused ecological disruption overall carp has been a positive contributor to the local community more intensive management strategies better post harvest processing and new marketing techniques need to be developed to enhance financial gain keywords keystone species cyprinus carpio food chain ecosystem services 1 introduction the successive decade long unesco international hydrological programmes have had many objectives since their incorporation over 70 years ago a consistent theme running through many of them has been improved documentation and understanding of hydrological processes and more recently ecohydrological eh processes to this end the eh programme initiated ecohydrology demonstration sites ds around the world at the turn of this century lake naivasha in kenya was declared a ds initially because of the observed beneficial interactions between hydrology also hydro chemistry with ecological processes in fringing swamps of cyperus papyrus l gaudet 1979 and the use which could be made of this understanding to design restoration programmes harper and mavuti 2004 restoration had become necessary because an original extensive estuarine swamp at the mouth of the main river the malewa with almost continuous fringing swamps around the lake shoreline up to 1970 had been largely destroyed leading to lake eutrophication within 40 years kitaka harper mavuti 2002 harper 2006 independently of its declaration as a ds naivasha s lake ecosystem had undergone dramatic change because of the impact of alien species most particularly since 1970 the degree and effect of these was documented in gherardi et al 2011 and it has continued since that time the ecosystem of lake naivasha is now so dominated at every trophic level by alien species such that it matches the definition of novel ecosystem hobbs higgs harris 2009 novel ecosystems also termed emerging ecosystems result when species occur in combinations and relative abundances that have not occurred previously within a given biome quotation from hobbs et al 2006 this paper analyzes the impact of the common carp cyprinus carpio l which has become a keystone predator of smaller fish and invertebrates as a demonstration of the benefits as well as the drawbacks of novel ecosystems this is necessary because reversing the changes is impossible to all intents and purposes thus critically examining the impacts of novel aquatic ecosystems upon human societies has become a necessary component of ecohydrology hobbs et al 2006 it represents the first case study of a novel tropical aquatic lentic ecosystem cf kwik et al 2020 thus highly appropriate for a unesco ihp ecohydrology demonstration site c carpio has been a highly prized species in eastern europe and asia for hundreds of years produced mainly by aquaculture for human consumption and introduced into many lakes and rivers for sport fishing the first known introduction of c carpio to the african continent is attributed to c a fairbridge of cape town who introduced six fishes from england for ornamental and angling purposes in september 1859 moreau and costa pierce 1997 it proved to be a highly adaptable and successful alien invader in the afrotropics as well as in australia able to dominate fish communities in lentic waters and to negatively affect internal ecological processes globally it is considered to be a highly damaging invasive lowe browne boudjelas de poorter 2000 c carpio invaded lake naivasha in 1998 9 during the high rains which frequently follow the el niño event in the pacific floods must have brought juveniles washed out from the gwakiongo dam at the headwaters of the gilgil river where they had been stocked alongside rainbow trout earlier in that decade by the kenya fisheries department nyandarua office harper et al 2012 carp was first observed in the lake in 2001 and has dominated the commercial fishery that used to be based upon two tilapias and the large mouthed bass since 2003 britton et al 2007 carp very rapidly became keystone species within the lake ecosystem by acting as competitor of the alien crayfish procambarus clarkii girard jackson et al 2012 itself previously regarded as the dominant keystone species in the lake smart et al 2002 food of young c carpio from lake naivasha was found to be similar to that in europe consisting mostly of zooplankton cladocera and copepoda in all size classes with chironomid larvae and oligochaete worms in guts of larger fish individuals over 100 mm in naivasha also contained crayfish and occasionally small fish in 45 of cases britton et al 2007 there is no knowledge of the impact of c carpio upon the naivasha ecosystem however despite this partial knowledge of its ecology and position in the food web this paper predicts its impact from a review of empirical and published studies and tests the hypotheses using original data one might have predicted that c carpio would have a devastating effect on the aquatic ecosystem of lake naivasha such statements were made by ojuok et al 2007 and aloo et al 2013 but had not been tested until now nine linked hypotheses were proposed based upon a review of the literature of lake naivasha limnology and of c carpio impacts on other aquatic systems that c carpio would cause 1 lower water transparency 2 increased soluble nutrients 3 a cyanobacterial soup with higher primary productivity 4 small size of zooplankton 5 depletion of benthos 6 loss of macrophytes 7 reduction of numbers of herbivorous birds but an increase in numbers of piscivorous birds 8 dominance of the food web by carp diminishing other species in the fishery 9 no net benefits to the human lakeside communities this paper tests the hypotheses by comparing data collected in two different time periods called pre carp the 1990s and post carp by members of the same team supported by such published knowledge as exists the discussion section includes other published studies and evaluates the future of this novel ecosystem 2 site description lake naivasha kenya is an endorheic freshwater lake conductivity between 250 and 400 µs cm 1 situated in the eastern rift valley just south of the equator fig 1 the climate is characterised by the alternation of two wet warm rainy periods and two relatively cold dry spells but superimposed upon fluctuating lake levels and areas between 100 150 km2 as a result of annual rainfall influenced by the inter tropical convergence zone the shallow lake average depth usually 3 3 5 m was created by the infilling of 1 major and 3 minor volcanic craters its deepest point is situated at ca 1873 m a s l in crescent island lagoon where water is usually over 10 m deep its approx 4 000 km2 catchment rises to a maximum of just over 4 000 m in the north east aberdare or nyandarua mountain range during the last 1 000 years the lake dried completely out at least three times most recently in the 19th century just before european settlement verschuren et al 2001 in the 20th century water levels have fluctuated by 10 m i e the maximum main lake depth ranged from 4 to 14 m becht and harper 2002 the depth fluctuation in just the past three decades has been half that but with 5 vertical metres in just 5 years between the end of 2009 and 2016 fig 2 representing both the highest and the lowest levels since 1945 lnra unpublished data the lake has a low volume surface ratio typical of ecosystems responsive to the hydrological forcing caused by seasonal rains and floods the impact of floods is further enhanced by its muted seasonality melack 1979 due to a modest seasonal variation in temperature and in solar radiation a riparian papyrus swamp gaudet 1979 used to attenuate the river pulse by buffering allochthonous nutrients and by releasing moderate and continuous internal nutrient fluxes that stabilised primary production litterick et al 1979 but its influence has been decreasing for the past 20 years due to significant riparian degradation harper and mavuti 2004 water column mixing occurs daily in the main lake caused by frequent afternoon winds and by night time cooling melack 1979 crescent island lagoon ca 1 2 km2 at the eastern side of the lake is the only portion that is deep in 2012 16 m and that tends to remain stratified for several weeks months the main lake shoreline length was 117 km and the surface area was 132 km2 on 31 05 2013 fig 3 the lake s ecology was first described by early 20th century uk expeditions beadle 1932 and studied in greater detail during the late 20th century role of c papyrus in the ecotone by gaudet 1979 primary productivity by melack 1979 causes of freshness by gaudet and melack 1981 nutrient chemistry and phytoplankton melack 1976 and by kalff 1983 1986 1993 then by kitaka harper mavuti 2002 and kitaka et al 2002b aquatic macrophyte dynamics by harper 1984 gouder de beauregard et al 2002 crayfish impacts by smart et al 2002 fish by litterick et al 1979 hickley et al 1994 2004 and by britton et al 2007 its ecosystem has been extensively modified by alien species since the 1970s gherardi et al 2011 and by the greatly increased number of people dwelling around its shores and in its catchment harper et al 2012 these latter changes in population density as well as intensification in land use have occurred steadily throughout the two periods under consideration their effects upon the conclusions are considered in the discussion 3 methods the same methods were used in two different time periods called pre carp and post carp on all sample occasions water transparency hypothesis 1 was measured by 25 cm diameter secchi disc submerged and floating leaved macrophytes were collected by double headed rake and identified using agnew and agnew 1974 hypothesis 6 3 1 times of study four separate studies were undertaken at naivasha in the late 1990s pre carp they were 1 surface water chemistry august 1995 2 phytoplankton diversity biomass and productivity december 1994 3 zooplankton diversity and biomass may 1995 april 1996 and 4 benthic diversity and biomass july 1996 august 1998 september 1999 and march 2001 the collection laboratory and analytical methods were the same as those subsequently used between 2012 13 to study the post carp ecosystem and to test the hypotheses stated above samples were not collected in exactly the same locations but in all cases the depth of the sample was recorded which because of the fluctuations of lake level is more important than position pre carp studies of the macrophyte community dynamics population dynamics of procambarus clarkii lousiana crayfish fish community and commercial fish catch have been studied and published by various authors these are considered in the discussion samples of water chemistry plankton benthos and fish were taken on four separate occasions in 2012 2014 post carp all sampling sought to distinguish the littoral zone the area covered by floating plants measured as 3 m maximum which at this time was dominated by scattered e crassipes from the open water zone samples were compared in the same way between littoral and pelagic for both periods using depth comparison samples for the food web for stable isotope analysis were collected in 2003 5 as described in jackson et al 2012 3 2 hypothesis 2 soluble nutrients surface water samples were collected at 50 cm depth along transects running across the shallows of the lake into the deepest point see fig 3 all used a remote messenger closed 1 litre water sampler the samples were analysed upon return to the laboratory after immediate filtration 0 45 µ cellulose nitrate filters hach kits were employed to analyse nitrate ammonia and silicate and the standard manual methylene blue method for phosphate mackereth et al 1989 total filtered and total unfiltered phosphorus and nitrogen were mineralised by persulphate digestion in a pressure cooker and then determined using standard techniques for phosphate mackereth et al 1989 and nitrate kalff and bentzen 1984 a sub set of filtered and unfiltered sample aliquots in 2013 and again in 2015 were carried frozen in a cool box with freezer bags to the enki o p s třebon iso certified laboratory in czech republic www enki cz to confirm the range of values for both soluble and total forms of n and p that had been measured on site the latter analysis was performed through flow injection analysis using automatic analysers fiastartm 5000 and fiastartm 5012 3 3 hypothesis 3 phytoplankton abundance and primary production a plankton net fba type now nhbs totnes uk of 20 µm mesh size was used up to 2 m depth to collect samples for identification unfiltered water samples were taken from depths of 0 and 1 m for quantitative counting both sample types were preserved with formaldehyde some samples were collected and preserved in lugol s iodine the main groups of algae and cyanobacteria were distinguished and the dominant species determined komárek and anagnostidis 1998 komárek and anagnostidis 2005 komárek et al 2013 chlorophyll a was assessed spectrophotometrically at 665 nm after overnight cold 90 acetone extraction of the ground plankton retained on a whatman gfc glass fibre filter obtained by filtering 300 500 ml from a water sample collected as above for chemical sampling stored between lake and lab in a portable cool box calculations were carried out according to talling and driver 1961 planktonic primary production was estimated by determining differences in oxygen concentration measured in light and dark bottles incubated under water as described by schwoerbel 1970 and analysed within 24 hours by winkler titration following mackereth et al 1989 gross primary production was calculated as the difference between the oxygen concentration measured before and after incubation and then integrated throughout the photosynthetic depth profile conversion into g c m 2 day 1 was carried out assuming 12 hours day of effective production and considering that 6 moles of o2 are released for every mole of c6h12o6 assimilated therefore 0 375 g c are fixed into biomass for every 1 g of o2 released 3 4 hypothesis 4 zooplankton species occurrence and abundance the same type and manufacturer s plankton net mesh size 80 µm fba type now nhbs totnes uk was used for sampling zooplankton on both occasions from the upper layer of the water column 2 m each sample corresponded to 69 litres filtered zooplankton samples were preserved in 20 ml bottles in a final concentration of formaldehyde of 4 genus and species of zooplankton were determined later in the laboratory according to fernando 2002 biomass of zooplankton in individual samples was estimated according to the volume of its fresh mass 1 ml volume of fresh biomass 0 5 gm fresh biomass as estimated from length weight relationships in prikryl 1980 zooplankton dry weight was estimated as 10 fresh weight 3 5 hypothesis 5 macrozoobenthos species and density lake sediment was collected quantitatively by the same ekman grab 25 cm x 25 cm in size also on transects from shallow to deep open water sediment samples were washed at collection by sieving through a 1 mm mesh held over the side of the boat in the laboratory live benthic organisms were identified and counted weighed for total fresh biomass and the sample was preserved in 4 formaldehyde three grabs were taken for each sample and results converted to m2 3 6 hypothesis 7 water bird species and density annual water bird censuses have been carried out by the national museums of kenya with the kenya wildlife services since 1990 under the auspices of wetlands international part of the international waterbird census used to indicate wetland health wetlands international 2012 the methods are observation using binoculars and telescopes by several trained observers in groups covering sections of the lake in the same day they are always conducted on a day in january and sometimes also in july the census data were used during this study after confirming they remained accurate in the appropriate sections to calculate the species richness and density of herbivorous piscivorous birds and from the latter data the probable offtake of fish in kg daily consumption of fish by common piscivorous birds was estimated from cooper winkler lenz 1984 glahn et al 1999 crocker et al 2002 and gremillet et al 2003 the total annual consumption of fish by birds in the two decades 1991 2000 pre carp 2001 10 post carp as well as 2011 15 was calculated 3 7 hypothesis 8 fish community and food web pre carp fish community and densities were taken from published papers and commercial fisheries reports no new research is described here during the post carp period random samples were taken in november 2012 and in april 2013 casting nets mesh size 10 mm and 50 mm gill nets mesh size 20 100 mm and basket traps were used freshly caught fish were also purchased from fishermen about 1000 tilapiines and 100 carp were analysed and recorded gut contents of 25 carp were extracted from live fishes using a syringe and immediately fixed digestible food tends to disappear rapidly after fish is caught the samples were preserved in formaldehyde later sorted and identified in the laboratory under a binocular microscope each carp was weighed ballast material parts of macrophytes detritus mineral soil was recorded as indicator of where carp had been feeding the density of the tilapiines present mainly in the littoral and of barbus pelagic were estimated on the basis of a calculation of the total area of the littoral zone and of the amount of fish caught from gillnets and from the cast net fish density in the pelagic zone was estimated using official catch statistics provided by the kenyan ministry of fisheries naivasha office stable carbon and nitrogen biplots were used to determine trophic position and relationships within the lake based upon data collected in november 2003 after the carp had established for methodological details see britton et al 2007 no similar data was available for pre carp although muchiri et al 1994 and hickley et al 1994 had suggested food web relationships based on gut analysis of the then common fish species 3 8 hypothesis 9 benefits to human communities around the lake the approximate market price in 2013 of freshly caught carp was established at kamere landing beach during several visits at the times of the fieldwork described above by observing daily market negotiation between fishmongers and customers official catch statistics were kindly provided by the naivasha district fishery office at karagita the data indicate the number and weight of fish by species caught each month whilst fieldwork was being undertaken it became clear that shoreline fishermen who are un licenced and use fine mesh beach seines and cast nets were taking a considerable quantity of small fish so we made an estimate of this harvest the numbers of people engaged on each day of fieldwork in 2012 and 2013 were counted and a questionnaire was distributed to riparian owners covering other parts of the lake not visited the weight of fish taken was estimated as 50 kg per sack and average catch was taken to be 1 sack every two people each day it is not known how much un licenced shoreline fishing occurred during the pre carp period but personal observations during research suggested it was small up to the turn of the century because the fisheries department operated anti poaching teams the data are used to show the weight of fish that is likely taken from the lake unrecorded compared with the licenced catch in addition the calculated offtake by birds was also considered because birds are essential for the tourist value of the lake the nutritional and health related quality of carp flesh was established by evaluating the composition of unsaturated organic acids and the presence of agricultural pesticides the content of unsaturated organic acids was analysed at the faculty of fisheries and water protection university of south bohemia in české budějovice czech republic lipid analysis was performed as described by mráz and pickova 2009 after being extracted by hexane isopropanol hara and radin 1978 fish organoleptic quality was assessed by means of a blind test involving 15 people carp fillet was served at the same time as commercial tilapia from lake victoria oreochromis niloticus l and kenyan red snapper lutjanidae each simmered in lightly salted water with a little olive oil samples of carp hepatopancreas carp fillet and tilapia 4 individuals taken in 2013 were tested for some 1400 synthetic compounds in the czech republic 1000 of which are common agro industrial pesticides including triazines organchlorines and pyrethroids organic compounds in the water column were assessed at the same time by means of 5 passive samplers polar organic chemical integrative sampler columbia environmental research center usa kept for one week suspended in the water column no pre carp work had been undertaken on any fish species 4 results 4 1 hypothesis 1 lower water transparency water transparency throughout the late 1980s and 1990s was between 45 cm secchi disc extinction and 100 cm it was higher for shorter periods in 1982 mean 140 cm and 1999 mean 150 cm both periods which coincided with high lake levels it ranged between 64 93 cm at most times between 2012 4 with a single clear water phase in december 2014 of 2 65 m there is no evidence that transparency has been reduced by carp 4 2 hypothesis 2 increased soluble nutrients conductivity was 345 368 µs cm 1 and ph between 6 9 and 8 2 of the 9 samples taken at different depths in 1995 no significant concentration differences were detected between sites in chemistry with moderate nitrogen concentrations 40 160 µg nh4 n l 1 30 130 µg no3 n l 1 and low phosphorus 3 8 µg srp p l 1 40 120 µg tp p l 1 soluble reactive silicate concentrations were between 5 and 5 3 mg si l 1 during the 2012 2014 post carp period conductivity was between 221 and 265 µs cm 1 and ph between 7 1 and 8 7 but with occasional peaks up to 9 3 within the littoral during the central part of the day soluble reactive forms of phosphate were undetectable in surface water while ammonia and nitrate were present at low concentrations tables 1 and 2 soluble nitrogen was lowest in the littoral zone increasing slightly moving towards mid lake soluble reactive phosphate was always undetectable at mid lake stations while moderate srp concentrations 8 10 µg p l 1 occurred within the shallow littoral in particular close to river inlets and under e crassipes mats digested samples revealed low concentrations of total nutrients there was a higher tn tp ratio than the redfield ratio and the presence of a detectable concentration of nitrate and ammonia which suggest p limitation of phytoplankton growth higher values of nitrate and ammonia up to 536 µg nh4 n l 1 and 552 µg no3 n l 1 but not of phosphate were recorded in early december 2014 at that time a clear water event transparency 2 65 m with a dense daphniid population dominated by daphnia pulex leydig was recorded there is no evidence that carp have increased soluble nutrients 4 3 hypothesis 3 phytoplankton species change increased density and primary production in 1995 96 green algae chlorophyta made the greatest contribution to overall cell numbers with a diverse assemblage consisting of the genera scenedesmus 12 cosmarium 4 botryococcus 4 dictyosphaerium 5 and tetraëdron 6 botryococcus dominated the phytoplankton during april and may 1995 giving a brown coloration to the water cyanobacteria represented on average less than 30 of the total cell count and diatoms just above 20 these included the genera aulacoseira navicula nitzchia and synedra flagellates comprised of the genera euglenophyta chrysophyta cryptophyta and dinophyta were at low abundance 9 and at low diversity chlorophyll a measurements in the late 1990s averaged 31 µg l 1 with a few surface outliers between 140 145 35 primary production in the top 3 m of the water column averaged of 1 06 g m 2 d 1 between january and may 1998 n 6 phytoplankton in the post carp period was dominated by cyanobacteria in terms of cell numbers mainly the genera cylindrospermopsis aphanocapsa coelosphaerium planktolyngbya microcystis but with a variable proportion in terms of biomass 13 90 dinophytes mostly forms non palatable to zooplankton were high in the november 2012 samples while diatoms colonies of aulacoseira cells of achnanthes and small centric diatoms appeared more consistently in may 2013 fig 4 desmids included mainly staurastrum and in particular closterium aciculare t west a large and unpalatable species which contributed significantly to biomass in 2013 small chlorophytes were relatively common next to large unpalatable pediastrum duplex meyen and p simplex meyen no clear difference could be detected between samples collected in littoral and in pelagic zones the range of chlorophyll a was between 19 and 71 µg l 1 n 30 primary production was 3 5 0 5 g c m 2 d 1 n 5 a full species list for lake naivasha is provided at https data mendeley com there is no evidence from these results that carp have caused change in phytoplankton composition or biomass 4 4 hypothesis 4 zooplankton abundance and size during may 1995 april 1996 rotifers made up the largest proportion of the zooplankton community together with copepoda nauplii species of the genus brachionus dominated the rotifera population in all stations with brachionus calyciflorus pallas being commonest and showing little variability in its density copepoda dominated the crustacean population with thermocyclops oblongatus sars the commonest cladocerans were diaphanosoma excisum et mongolianum sars d pulex simocephalus vetulus mueller daphnia laevis birge ceriodaphnia cornuta sars and moina micrura kurz they dominated the biomass in one month december when higher densities of all zooplankton were observed following prolonged rains samples taken in 2012 and 2013 showed a similar composition to 18 years earlier but with greater prevalence of small bodied taxa the zooplankton community was dominated by rotifera and by juvenile copepoda nauplii and copepodites collectively small sized forms represented 60 90 of the zooplankton larger bodied zooplankton were scarce and dominated by the cladocerans c cornuta d excisum d mongolianum and by the copepod t oblongatus zooplankton biomass was distinctly different between littoral samples with an average of 60 mg dry biomass m 3 and pelagic ones closer to 200 mg m 3 diaphanosoma excisum et mongolianum represented a sizeable portion of the zooplankton biomass followed by cyclopoid copepodites fig 5 december 2013 and again 2014 showed significant changes from the earlier two years yet a similarity to december 1995 on both occasions there was a strong predominance of cladocerans in 2013 it was s vetulus d excisum d mongolianum and d volzi stingelin in 2014 it was d pulex with d laevis at lower densities other cladocerans such as m micrura d excisum and s vetulus were in very low numbers as were other zooplankters such as copepods and rotifers generally littoral zooplankton were larger than pelagial zooplankton thus whilst there is no strong evidence that carp have caused a decrease in size of zooplankton there is evidence for the first time of differences between littoral and pelagial which is discussed below a full species list for zooplankton of lake naivasha is provided at https data mendeley com 4 5 hypothesis 5 density of macrozoobenthos mean benthic invertebrate biomass in 1996 was 24 8 g m 2 as fresh weight chironomid biomass accounted for 70 of this the majority represented by a species of chironomus the remaining 30 oligochaetes were dominated by branchiura sowerbyi beddard there had been a distinct change by 1998 and 1999 however with the near disappearance of chironomids 6 3 and 7 7 of fresh weight and dominance of oligochaetes this dominance was still apparent in 2012 and 2013 with pelagic areas containing fresh weights similar to 98 99 consisting mainly of b sowerbyi and other tubificids including limnodrilus hoffmeisteri claparède with few chironomids fresh weight biomass in littoral areas in 2012 3 was about 5 of pelagic dominated by chironomids with tubificids far smaller in size than b sowerbyi which dominated the oligochaetes table 3 the evidence available suggests that changes in the macrozoobenthos occurred in the five years before carp arrived in the lake and not subsequent to their arrival this is discussed further below 4 6 hypothesis 6 loss of macrophytes there were very dense mats of plants in the shallow littoral zone overwhelmingly dominated by water hyacinth eichhornia crassipes mart solms with occasional floating water fern salvinia molesta mitchell throughout the second half of the 1990s but no submerged plants this changed for a brief period in 2002 3 when submerged plants were found in the northern part of the lake potamogeton octandrus poir potamogeton pectinatus l najas horrida magn potamogeton schweinfurthii a ceratophyllum demersum l with occasional nymphaea caerulea sav no submerged plants were found between 2012 and 2014 the littoral zone contained scattered plants of e crassipes and s molesta never enough to form mats and few small c papyrus islands it is possible that carp abundance by 2003 might have caused the loss of submerged plants and breakup of floating plants after that time 4 7 hypothesis 7 reduction in the numbers of herbivorous birds increase in piscivorous twenty five years continuous water bird census have yielded a total of 110 species the actual number seen in any one year is about three quarters of this between 61 lowest in 1998 and 82 highest 2002 the decade average was 74 in the 1990s 71 in the 2000s and 70 in the first half of the 2110s the difference too small to be attributed to any one cause using the two commonest herbivorous birds yellow billed duck anas undulata and red knobbed coot fulica cristata as indicators of the group the average density in the 1990s was 3870 coot and 293 duck coot had dropped to 2740 in the 2000s whilst numbers of duck were similar 304 coot showed a further decline in the first half of this decade 1150 whilst duck remained similar 293 coot numbers exceeded 4000 only in the years 1991 95 2001 2 and 2006 mean numbers of piscivorous birds eagles herons egrets kingfishers pelicans and cormorants were more abundant in the decade post carp than pre carp table 4 primarily because of a 4 fold increase in the number of pelicans as well as lesser increases in smaller piscivores total intake by piscivorous birds was approximately 588 tonnes of fish biomass annually in the last decade of the 20th century pre carp this was more than doubled in the first decade of this post carp to an estimated 1 316 tonnes per annum table 4 the actual years of our study were mid way between these two figures 867 tonnes 4 8 hypothesis 8 dominance of the fish community and the lake food web all studies of the naivasha fish community in the 1990s have been published all sample dates in 2012 4 showed a clear separation between the littoral zone dominated by tilapiines and the pelagic zone dominated by cyprinids not previously observed fish density in the littoral was relatively high 20 50 individuals m 2 of small tilapia 1 5 cm size but no carp the riparian edges i e the biotope between the riparian rooted c papyrus and floating aquatic grasses and the outer floating vegetation were entirely dominated by young tilapia fry 3 5 cm barbus paludinosus peters locally known as adel was caught in the pelagic zone and in the littoral close to river inlets fish density there was moderate carp density was 12 kg ha 1 with the two cyprinids c carpio and b paludinosus representing over 80 of the fish biomass table 5 gut content analysis indicated that adult carp fed prevalently on benthic invertebrates and in particular on chironomids and oligochaetes mainly b sowerbyi secondary food items included ciliates copepods and vegetable matter planktonic algae and ballast tilapiine gut contents were very different primarily rotifers brachionus keratella algae and ciliates overall the analysis revealed very little overlap between tilapiines and carp table 6 no stable isotope analysis was carried out pre carp although food web on the basis of fish gut analysis was suggested by hickley north muchiri harper 1994 the predatory dominance of c carpio in the pelagic zone food web was clear fig 6 but there was a lack of a top predator in the food web of the littoral fig 7 where the highest δ15n values i e the highest position within the trophic web were attributed to odonata and to p clarkii piscivorous birds not analysed during this survey likely assumed the top predator role in the shallows as well as sharing the pelagial with carp this hypothesis was supported carp dominate the lake food web 4 9 hypothesis 9 benefits to humans from fish harvesting nutritional quality and value of carp the catches from the commercial boat and gill net fishery are recorded have been published and are discussed in the next section the catches by unlicensed fishermen operating from the shore in the littoral zone as deep as a man s armpits and using seine nets to encircle fish have not previously been recorded in 2012 14 groups of 2 3 people operated every day along the entire shoreline of the lake each holding a segment territory of about 500 metres we observed several local groups fishing catching not less than 50 kg of tilapia each per day the main lake shoreline length was 117 km thus we estimated that lake naivasha holds about 500 unlicensed fishermen catching no less than 11 7 tonnes of fish day i e around 4 270 tonnes per year this is more than 10x the annual catch of licensed fishermen in a good year the total estimated consumption of fish from lake naivasha from 2014 figures when the commercial catch 400 tonnes was highest was approximately 5 537 tonnes of which 77 was by shoreline illegal fishermen 16 by piscivorous birds with the commercial fishery 8 of the total table 4 we can conclude that poachers with nets of small mesh size well as birds minimise crossing of small fish particularly young tilapias from littoral to pelagial potential food in the pelagial is not used and the catch of bigger fish is low both birds and shoreline fishermen take smaller adult and juvenile fish which the commercial catch does not this is discussed further below the carp fillet fatty acid composition revealed a high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids ufa their concentration levels confirm high nutritional value table 7 the blind tasting event conducted in september 2014 with 15 people none of whom had eaten carp before resulted in tilapia scoring 1st carp 2nd above red snapper despite this all 15 had positive comments about their first carp experience and declared that if they had a chance they would have liked to consume carp regularly fish muscle samples contained synthetic compounds such as triazines organochlorines and pyrethroids far below tolerance limits and in most cases close to the detection limit of the instruments an exception was dde a metabolite of ddt that was found in measurable amounts 1 2 µg dde kg in carp 3 5 µg dde kg in tilapia one of the 5 passive samplers in the lake showed metalaxyl m an agrochemical known to be commonly used again concentrations were far below recommended tolerance limits carp do not thus appear to be negative to the human community this hypothesis is further evaluated below 5 discussion the results show some substantial differences between the pre carp and the post carp sampling periods but many other factors have changed over these 20 years in addition to the fish composition the water level fluctuations which were described in the introduction are potentially a very influential factor considering that water level rises are intimately linked with increased nutrients from the catchment kitaka et al 2002a human impact is another potentially highly relevant driver since the growth of naivasha town and of settlements around the lake has been very rapid over the past 30 years concurrent with the growth of the horticultural industry harper et al 2012 the nine hypotheses are discussed below with all potential factors causing the changes considered we recognise that small sets of samples and analyses particularly for water chemistry are inadequate when considered alone in almost any ecosystem but particularly so for a dynamic ecosystem such as naivasha where considerable hydrological variation occurs over time directly influencing the biota nevertheless such a comparison has never previously been made 5 1 hypothesis 1 lower water transparency transparency was in the same range in both measurement periods with occasional exceptions the ratio between mean depth ca 3 3 5 m and transparency was between 3 2 and 5 5 indicating conditions that were favourable to high photosynthetic rates wetzel 1983 although it has never been intensely compared it is highly likely that transparency is significantly related to water level high at high water level as depth is increased by river water that drops its silt in the lake when uni directional current ceases low at low water level because of sediment stirring by wind and by phytoplankton growth the indications of the highest transparency in 1982 and 1999 suggest this together with anecdotal observations from high lake levels in 2010 and 2016 pers obs dmh the 1st hypothesis that carp cause a turbid lake water cannot thus be supported 5 2 hypothesis 2 increased nutrients considered for p n and si separately higher p concentrations have always been associated with higher river discharges while much of the n present in the lake is considered the product of n fixation within the littoral swamp gaudet 1979 there has been a progressive increase in p and n over the past 40 years the ranges of phosphorus and nitrogen levels reported in 1995 and then in 2012 2013 are broader characterised by higher maxima than the range of concentrations reported up to the 1980s total p concentrations measured by gaudet in 1975 6 in the open water ranged between 5 58 µg p l 1 extrapolated from graphs gaudet 1979 while peters and maclntyre 1976 reported 3 µg po4 p l 1 in the open lake water kalff in 1979 80 measured 28 79 µg p l 1 kalff 1983 and njuguna between 1979 80 found an average of 56 µg p l 1 njuguna 1982 kalff also 1983 demonstrated strong p limitation of phytoplankton growth in the lake water through 33po4 fertilisation experiments and by studying the relationship between tp and chlorophyll a the undetectable srp with low tdp and tp concentrations measured by us in 2012 2013 and a high n p ratio confirm a sustained long term p limitation of phytoplankton with a seasonal increase in p availability triggered by rain and river runoff cycles as suggested by kitaka et al 2002a thus we have no evidence that carp may have increased phosphorus concentrations in the lake over concentration increases likely to have occurred due to increased catchment land use and erosion the second hypothesis that carp cause nutrient enrichment is not supported by the pattern of change in phosphorus levels nitrate increased in the open water station in gaudet s 1975 6 study from the onset of the rains reaching up to 49 µg no3 n l 1 a peak that is higher than concentrations measured by us in 2012 2013 our observations that there are inverse phosphate and nitrate gradients p decreasing from shore to mid lake while n increases are coherent with gaudet s studies gaudet 1979 gaudet and muthuri 1981 and reflect concurrent processes of p uptake by the lake phytoplankton but lack of n uptake because they are p limited within the erstwhile north swamp concentrations of phosphate and ammonia were relatively high due to localised anaerobic conditions favouring nutrient release gaudet 1979 gaudet and muthuri 1981 muthuri and jones 1997 there is periodic appearance of appreciable concentrations of phosphate and ammonia in shallow littoral zones under dense water hyacinth mats that now persist along the entire lake edge absent during gaudet s times water hyacinth invaded the lake from 1989 at the same time as a notable reduction of c papyrus was occurring due to water level decreases which allowed anthropogenic degradation e g cutting and grazing morrison and harper 2009 total nitrogen concentrations have a range of values comparable to those measured during the pre carp period 0 3 1 mg n l 1 for organic nitrogen tn not including ammonia were measured by gaudet 1979 1 3 2 5 tn by kalff in 1979 80 kalff 1983 a mean of 1 4 tn by njuguna in 1979 1981 njuguna 1982 and 0 6 1 1 mg tn l 1 by us in 2012 2013 ammonia is hard to compare due to its very high variability observed both during gaudet s times as well as during our surveys only on one occasion was there unusually high concentrations of nitrate and ammonia which coincided with the highest secchi depth of 2 65 m 2 6 m was the top of the range measured by kalff in 1979 80 during this clearwater event the lake surface was visibly covered in d pulex ephippia these high dissolved nitrogen values can thus be ascribed to zooplankton grazing this is more likely than eutrophication caused by carp excretion nuttall and richardson 1991 bioturbation braband et al 1990 breukelaar et al 1994 or nutrient release due to macrophyte damage by carp and low uptake by phytoplankton qin threkeld 1990 chakrabarty das das 2007 thus nutrient dynamics moderated by seasonal rains are more likely to be under the control of littoral and planktonic vegetation no significant nutrient increase that could be ascribed to carp has not been obvious and our second hypothesis is not supported for nitrogen soluble reactive silicate the diatom available form of dissolved sio2 has undergone a progressive reduction in lake waters since early measurements taken by beadle in 1930 11 7 mg si l 1 beadle 1932 by talling in 1960 1961 14 15 7 mg si l 1 talling and talling 1965 and by gaudet in 1975 6 10 3 mg si l 1 cited by litterick et al 1979 page 22 the malewa river delivered 7 mg si l 1 during baseflow in 1975 and 24 mg si l 1 during an increase in discharge in early 1976 values that are representative of a tropical river basin characterised by an alkaline volcanic substrate gaudet and melack 1981 intermediate values were measured by gaudet within the littoral swamp in 1976 3 3 7 1 mg si l 1 gaudet 1979 and at an open water site in 1995 5 5 3 mg si l 1 recently measured silicate values were however only around 1 mg si l 1 when measured at mid lake sites closer to 2 mg si l 1 at river inlet and above 3 mg si l 1 inside the river the progressive silicate depletion at lake naivasha can be interpreted as a sign of increasing diatom uptake linked to eutrophication as forecasted by kilham 1971 further discussed by conley et al 1993 for the north american great lakes and by ngupula et al 2014 for lake victoria thus we cannot associate the impact of carp with silica changes 5 3 hypothesis 3 phytoplankton species change increased density and primary production assessments of the lake s phytoplankton assemblage have been made since the 1930s changes during the pre carp period have been summarised by hubble and harper 2002 while ballot et al 2009 described phytoplankton dynamics during the early post carp period talling 1986 placed lake naivasha in a large group of african lakes and reservoirs where aulacoseira tends to be dominant at times of river inflow induced water column turbulence while cyanobacteria such as microcystis generally predominate at times and in portions of the lake where there is greater water column stability other taxa such as botryococcus occasionally form intense blooms but for relatively short periods hubble and harper 2002 showed that the water column tends to be daily mixed at lake naivasha with an even distribution of chlorophyll a also reported in litterick et al 1979 with the exception of the deeper crescent island lagoon the aulacoseira dominated phytoplankton community is controlled by p limitation and favoured by the occurrence of strong winds and by river flood pulses cyanobacteria are able to impose themselves by creating particularly stable populations during prolonged dry seasons in the absence of allochthonous inputs these periods are typically characterised by strong p deficiency the alternation between an aulacoseira and a cyanobacteria dominated assemblage has been documented several times at lake naivasha by lind in the 1960s aulacoseira by kallqvist in 1976 77 cyanobacteria kallqvist 1987 by kalff in 1979 80 aulacoseira then microcystis and botryococcus kalff and watson 1986 and by hubble in 1997 98 aulacoseira hubble and harper 2002 during 1979 80 microcystis reached over 50 of the overall phytoplankton biomass 22 mg l 1 kalff and watson 1986 and was later partly replaced by botryococcus since the turn of the century blooms have become more intense in september 2002 56 6 mg l 1 of botryococcus terribilis komarek and marvan diatom diversity decreased and periods of sustained cyanobacteria dominance seem to have become more common ballot et al 2009 a dense microcystis bloom was recorded in the littoral south west portion of the lake in 2006 possibly concentrated by wind ballot et al 2009 cyanobacterial dominance was also strong during 2005 9 harper et al 2012 similar conditions were apparent in 2012 2013 cyanobacteria up to 50 of the phytoplankton biomass in the pelagic region dominated by microcystis while n2 fixing cyanobacteria belonging to the nostocales were far less abundant the composition abundance and the decreasing diversity of the naivasha phytoplankton during 2001 2004 were interpreted as signs of increasing eutrophic conditions giving a rising risk of cyanobacterial toxin release ballot et al 2005 after this period however the effects of cultural eutrophication that then seemed so clear have become blurred due to a severe drawdown that saw the lake reaching its lowest water levels in 56 years 1884 12 m a s l on 24th december 2009 followed by a relatively rapid recovery during the period 2010 2014 see fig 2 an increase in the proportion of small cyanobacterial species and a noticeable increase in streptophytes desmids occurred concurrently these characteristics indicate a moderation of the eutrophication trend that could be ascribed to the relative dilution 2011 2013 the proportion of palatable phytoplankton taxa observed in pelagic samples now indicate a relatively good potential for zooplankton grazing chlorophyll a concentrations had ranged between 26 74 µg l 1 in the early 1970s melack 1976 9 48 µg l 1 in 1979 80 kalff 1983 21 37 in 1979 1981 njuguna 1982 occasional higher values 100 µg l 1 were recorded during drawdown periods in 1997 98 pre carp period hubble 2000 and by us when the lake was temporarily lower the primary production is high in relation to other freshwater lakes and it has increased considerably over recent years as can be seen by comparing gross primary production measurements carried out by melack in 1973 74 with data obtained by hubble in 1997 1998 and then in 2012 2013 table 8 overall it is more likely that periodical cyanobacterial prominence and higher chlorophyll levels have developed and still do as a consequence of physical conditions accentuated by drawdown events rather than because of the effects of carp so the 3rd hypothesis cannot be supported 5 4 hypothesis 4 zooplankton abundance and size the low body size of the dominant zooplankters on one hand and the fact that palatable phytoplankton were available on the other indicate that the zooplankton community of lake naivasha is shaped by a relatively intense fish predation pressure both in the pre carp and in the post carp period rotifera and copepoda too small to be retained by filtering fish predominated cladocera due to their larger size tend to be caught in the gills of planktivorous fish and retained as food and their density was consistently low the proportion of cladocera has been steadily decreasing between surveys illustrated by comparing mavuti 1983 with surveys pre carp in 1995 1996 and those post carp in 2012 2013 the low abundance of zooplankton and in particular of cladocera in the littoral in 2012 2013 was most likely due to predation by tilapia fry as no young carp or b paludinosus was found in littoral fish catches higher zooplankton densities were present in the pelagic but still contained no large daphniids this is believed to be an effect of predation by b paludinosus which is able to prey selectively on large cladocerans the only time when abundant large cladocerans were found in the lake coincident with clear water was between late 2013 and november 2014 at times of lower river discharge cyprinids in general and b paludinosus in particular are strongly attracted by water movements and thus tend to congregate towards river mouths in lakes when there is little in lake water movements at lower lake levels we believe that the presence of daphniids in november 2014 was due to low fish activity in the open water at a time of low river discharge the role of carp in relation to naivasha s zooplankton remains ambiguous adult carp is an obligatory benthivore due to the large size of its gill rakers sibbing 1988 and it does not prey extensively on zooplankton however carp fingerlings can be pelagic planktivores khan et al 2003 britton et al 2007 weber and brown 2013 howell et al 2014 in a way that could be similar to b paludinosus the short term reappearance of d laevis a cool and clearwater loving species mergeay et al 2006 that had not been recorded in naivasha since 1995 6 suggests that species characterising the former mesotrophic stable state are still present but kept at check by cyprinid predation any action taken to reduce the predation pressure caused by b paludinosus would probably result in higher zooplankton densities with the presence of cladocerans similarly reducing adult carp by intensifying selective fishing practices would also tend to reduce any negative impacts due to bioturbation sediment resuspension and the related hindrance to zooplankton grazing bonneau and scarnecchia 2014 that are localised as we found no evidence of decreased transparency the recent clearwater period of november 2014 indicates that at times in naivasha phytoplankton control by zooplankton grazing is possible we thus cannot support this 4th hypothesis either that carp alone have had a negative impact upon zooplankton 5 5 hypothesis 5 density of macrozoobenthos the first comprehensive review of the benthos of lake naivasha was published by clark et al 1989 they compared observations made in 1982 3 and in mid 1984 with earlier accounts cox 1977 millbrink 1977 carried out at a time when the lake was dominated by native submerged macrophyte and extensive water lily beds with a more diverse population of naidid oligochetes samples collected at the lake edge as well as from the littoral and the profundal by clark et al 1989 reported a predominance of l hoffmeisteri over b sowerbyi in biomass they also noted the presence of a third oligochete potamothrix heuscheri bretscher the large glossoscolecid alma emini michaelsen and of at least 6 different chironomid genera chironomus cladotanytarsus procladius tanypus dicrotendypes nilodorum the molluscan fauna was very poor comprising ferrisia sp and physa acuta draparnaud b sowerbyi accounted for 58 of a total benthic invertebrate biomass of 4 07 g dw m 2 in 1989 90 raburu et al 2002 with l hoffmeisteri 27 chironomids 8 and other oligochaetes and microturbellarian worms respectively 4 and 3 our benthos in 1998 and 1999 was about half this total dry weight but with similar proportions similar benthos occured in the pelagic zone in 2012 2013 but the littoral was considerably depleted by comparison this indicates the greater intensity of fish predation mainly by juveniles in littoral areas that resulted in small sized invertebrate species similarly as was found in the zooplankton two differences appear between all the quantitative grab based studies the change in relative abundance of chironomids and the absolute biomass change it is tempting to attribute the high proportion of chironomids in 1996 but neither before or after to the release from crayfish predation that occurred after submerged macrophyte collapse in the early 1990s but before crayfish recovery made possible by the dense hyacinth beds in the late 1990s four five years later after this century began hyacinth mats had collapsed through weevil introduction and have never regained their density or cover oligochaetes now dominate the benthic fauna harper et al 2012 the persistence of this moderately high benthos biomass in the post carp period is a strong indication of the low impact of carp on the lake s pelagic food web we thus can see a probable effect of juvenile fish predation but not necessarily of carp alone on the benthos and thus our 5th hypothesis is not supported 5 6 hypothesis 6 loss of macrophytes in the decades before c carpio arrival in the early years of this century there was a moderately turbid ecosystem strongly modified by the presence of the red louisiana crayfish p clarkii which arrived in 1975 and had wiped out all rooted aquatic macrophytes by 1982 harper 1984 smart et al 2002 crayfish then declined through predation made possible by the absence of shelter hickley et al 2002 showed a distinct negative correlation between the occurrence of crayfish in micropterus salmoides large mouthed bass stomachs and submerged plant density this was followed by the arrival and spread through the 1990s of e crassipes mats whose roots provided shelter to crayfish from predation by day allowing them to drop out and feed on detritus by night adams et al 2002 harper et al 2012 by 2003 the lake s macrophytes had partially recovered believed to be due to heavy avian and fish predation on p clarkii following breakup of the e crassipes mats which had previously sheltered them itself a result of the introduction of neo tropical weevils neochetina eichhorniae warner for biological control by the kenya agricultural research institute harper et al 2012 this scenario is unlikely to allow the reappearance of rooted macrophytes kept in check by the presence of crayfish harper et al 2002 unless in particular years of low crayfish recruitment as happened again in 2006 when 5 species of rooted macrophytes genera najas nitella potamogeton reappeared covering 2000 ha britton et al 2007 harper et al 2012 our sixth hypothesis that c carpio has destroyed the macrophytes cannot thus be supported since macrophyte health and abundance is much more closely related to the abundance of crayfish it is possible but not proven that carp reduce macrophyte germination through benthos feeding when conditions low crayfish densities are favourable the future scenario is that lake naivasha s littoral will probably remain macrophyte free dominated by floating alien plants almost independently of the impact of carp the lake now has clarias gariepinus which first appeared in 2012 keyombe waithaka obegi 2015 and is a predominantly carnivorous feeder with juveniles taking a substantial proportion of crayfish meri 2016 careful monitoring of the ecosystem which now appears to be undertaken by the kenya marine fisheries institute kmfri waithaka et al 2020 will confirm this scenario or document its change thus there is no evidence that carp have to date caused macrophyte decline 5 7 hypothesis 7 reduction in the numbers of herbivorous birds increase in piscivorous the abundance of f cristata in the first five years of the 1990s can be explained by the abundance of submerged plants at this time before the arrival of any water hyacinth gouder de beauregard harper malaise symoens 1998 the decline after that occurred at the same time as e crassipes appearance and dominance with the revival of the herbivorous crayfish p clarkii populations smart et al 2002 the individual year highs of coot populations coincide with water level increases which are followed by submerged plant germination for a few months before crayfish populations respond to the increased water area and food provided grey jackson 2012 thus it is highly unlikely that the presence of carp had any direct effect upon herbivorous birds although an indirect effect via crayfish cannot be ruled out piscivorous birds showed distinct increase in the post carp period over the decade before most piscivorous birds feed on juvenile carp and smaller species prior to the arrival of carp fishery yields had always dropped with water level decline and increased after water level rise oyugi et al 2011 the annual catch of tilapiines had increased by over an order of magnitude for two years following a lake level rise caused by heavy el nino rains in 1998 njiru et al 2008 the fishery was maintained closed for june august each year throughout the first decade of this century with no noticeable improvement on catches of tilapiine fish once it re opened njiru et al 2008 this is most likely due to the overwhelming dominance of c carpio post 2003 britton et al 2007 which had not been predicted at the time of the over fishing that caused the annual closure annual carp catches continued to increase steadily thereafter up to a maximum in 2009 when the lake reached its lowest level since 1954 and carp were easy to catch harper et al 2012 several authors have noted that predation can be a factor significantly affecting carp populations paukert et al 2003 bajer and sorensen 2010 young of the year carp are considered a vulnerable prey especially when the shelter provided by rooted macrophyte is absent weber and brown 2012 the fisheries department introduced over 400 000 fingerlings of o niloticus between 2010 and 2012 in an effort to re establish the tilapia fishery keyombe et al 2015 with the subsequent appearance of this species in fish catches a small quantity of o niloticus appeared in the commercial catch in 2012 for the first time just 279 individuals at 145 kg from the almost half a million fingerlings introduced over the previous 2 years together with a similar quantity 139 kg of c gariepinus the governor of nakuru county fisheries management had devolved to counties following adoption of the new kenya constitution in august 2010 announced in july 2014 that he would abolish the closed season and that further stocking would soon be carried out with a half a million tilapia fingerlings http kenyanewsagency go ke p 27653 despite this relatively low stocking rate in central europe restocking is carried out at a density of 1 million fingerlings ha 1 considering a survival rate of 5 as success it did have some effect waithaka et al 2019 report that the fisheries showed a steady increase in annual catches after 2014 until it exceeded 1 000 tons for the first time in the history of the fishery keyombe et al 2018 with almost 1 3 o nilotica and a little over 2 3 c carpio today the lake hosts the cichlids o leucostictus o niloticus and t zillii the centrarchid m salmoides the cyprinids c carpio and b paludinosus synonymous of b amphigramma which migrates from the rivers the poecilid poecilia reticulata w peters introduced in the 1960s for supposed mosquito control and c gariepinus it is thus highly likely that the increase in piscivorous birds has not been caused directly by the carp but indirectly by a fishery closure at the beginning of this decade which allowed tilapiines populations to recover b growth of the carp fishery which led the legal gill net fishermen to maintain the legal net size to prevent adult carp damaging the nets so under sized fish were not taken and c the large introductions of tilapiine fingerlings to support this fishery since 2010 the hypothesis that carp have caused an increase in piscivorous birds is not supported 5 8 hypothesis 8 dominance of the food web by carp at the beginning of the 20th century the fish community comprised only one native species which had survived a 19th century dry period an endemic poecilidae aplocheilichthys antinorii vinc this was last recorded in 1962 and believed to have been driven to extinction by the first deliberate introduction the predatory micropterus salmoides lacepède large mouthed bass from north america elder garrod and whitehead 1971 a commercial gill net fishery opened in the 1950s on tilapiines introduced to feed the bass and extensive further introductions were made thereafter gherardi et al 2011 of new fish species the commercial fishery used to be based mainly on the oreochromis tilapia and the bass muchiri et al 1995 but it was in long term decline with only small interruptions caused by water level rise and increased lake area until 2001 when it dramatically crashed and was closed for a year otiang a owiti and oswe 2007 since that time up to 2015 it has been re opened with a closed season to seek to protect spawning but more significantly c carpio has become completely dominant in numbers and biomass in the catch hickley et al 2004 aloo et al 2013 reducing the need for such management the activities of licensed fishermen have been limited to 9 months annually for the past decade in order to give tilapiines chance to recover since the overfishing of the late 20th century licensed fishermen use seine nets of 4 cm mesh size to prevent catch of small fish the commercial catch was increasing during the period of our study with the annual yield of tilapias rising from just under 5 tonnes in 2012 to almost 400 tonnes in 2016 keyombe et al 2018 the carp catch over this time rose from 142 tonnes to 325 tonnes the catch of other species m salmoides and a newly recorded alien species catfish clarias gariepinus burchell was low only between 3 to 9 tonnes hickley et al 2002 discussed the theoretical maximum sustainable yield msy for the naivasha fishery calculated on the basis of a range of models selected from scientific literature and suitable for tropical lakes showing that it was far greater than the yield calculated from fish landing statistics provided by the kenyan fisheries office similarly trophic cascade arguments linking primary and secondary production would predict that primary production rates measured here should result in a far greater fish biomass in the lake a positive logarithmic relationship between primary production and fish yield was proposed by melack 1976 for a set of tropical lakes log y 0 113 gpp 1 1 gpp gross primary production g o2 m 2 d 1 0 91 this function implies that the energy conversion efficiency increases with increasing primary production on the other hand in highly eutrophic czech fish ponds hrbáček 1969 modelled carp production according to y 3 48 gpp 0 563 postulating a progressive decrease in energy transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and fish as primary production increased due to fish habitat degradation and to the progressive selection of less palatable phytoplankton species calculations based on our gpp measurements 9 3 g o m 2 d 1 give quite different predicted annual fish yields melack s formula 91 4 kg ha 1 year 1 equivalent to 1370 2 2 the calculation implies that the lake surface is 150 km2 t year 1 hrbacek s formula 12 2 kg ha 1 year 1 equivalent to 183 t year 1 hrbacek s formula gives an estimate that is very close to the open water carp density found during our experimental catches using a multimesh gillnet but melack s estimate as well as other secondary production indices calculated and discussed by hickley et al 2002 give figures that are far higher than the fish yields that have been achieved from official catch statistics catch statistics tend to naturally underestimate annual yields as saturday and sunday catches usually go unrecorded oyugi et al 2011a these authors also suggested that data collection has not been always continuous which could lead to some underestimation the data shown here on potential fish predation and illegal catch effort indicate that fish production at lake naivasha is far higher in real terms than the official fishery yield suggests estimates thus support calculations which show that birds and illegal fishermen extract more fish from the lake than the legal fishery during rising water levels carp will tend to migrate towards newly inundated littoral areas conversely during stable or receding water levels carp will tend to concentrate in deeper waters as discussed above carp impacts would tend to exacerbate due to more intensive sediment probing and bioturbation if protracted periods of low water levels were to occur the concentration of large numbers of carp into a small water volume is likely to lead to benthos exhaustion and rapid ecosystem degradation the highest ever recorded turbidity in lake naivasha was observed in 2009 when water levels reached their lowest value in recent years however it could not be decided whether this was due to bioturbation or to enhanced sediment stirring caused by wind action the presence of carp in lake naivasha is likely to have increased its ecosystem vulnerability to low water level conditions the significant correlation between fish catch and water transparency shown at lake baringo hickley et al 2004b illustrates the extent of fishery degradation that could occur if carp bioturbation as well as other sources of high turbidity were to permanently affect the water column carp growth rates were analysed by oyugi et al 2011b who concluded that by 2009 naivasha carp achieved very high growth rates and that its rising annual yields appeared to be independent of catch effort reducing carp density could have a positive effect in moderating the lake s eutrophic status because fishes can be storing a large portion of a lake s nutrients kitchell et al 1975 nakashima and leggett 1980 andersson et al 1988 weber and brown 2013 this would become exported from the lake and provide revenue at the same time a win win situation reducing the average individual size of carp through intensive fishing will additionally make the carp population more vulnerable to predation by birds and this may partially reduce the high predation exerted by birds on smaller tilapia it remains highly unlikely that implementing biomanipulation in lake naivasha by specifically targeting a strong reduction in cyprinids and by adding a stock of predatory fish would be able to reverse the on going progressive eutrophication despite to the benefits that might be obtained by reducing carp density this is due to the difficulty of bringing back rooted macrophytes destroyed by louisiana crayfish which represent an essential step towards the stabilisation of mesotrophy in shallow lakes jackson et al 2010 and ultimately to the constantly rising pressure represented by increasing human population within the basin and rising development impacts 5 9 hypothesis 9 benefits to human lakeside communities carp is mainly consumed locally much of it literally at the lakeshore by the low income portion of the resident community the ecosystem services value depends on the fish market value there is currently a deeply rooted negative perception of carp flesh organoleptic and health related properties which prevents its wider distribution and its sale in local restaurants and hotels a factor that strongly reduces carp s potential value a similar situation has been recorded elsewhere in kenya the annual yield of the masinga dam tana river kenya fishery apparently decreased in value following carp invasion as the local luo fishing community attributed greater value to tilapia whose proportion in the catch had decreased following carp appearance allela 1986 on the other hand the czech carp production industry over the years has improved carp based products thus enhancing the provisional service value represented by carp through better marketing zelený plzáková hán kašparc 2020 in 2013 1 kg of fresh tilapia was sold for 400 ksh 3 60 euro while 1 kg of carp sold for 250 ksh 2 30 euro local authorities and ngos now support the fishing community by equipping fish landing sites with deep freeze storage facilities by 2011 and proper weight balances for recording the catch beach management units established in 2005 manage daily operations at official fish landing sites carp will remain the predominant species in the commercial fishery more intensive fishing pressure as recommended together with better management and marketing should combine to keep it as an inexpensive protein source the high proportion of ω 3 compared to ω 6 levels found in the fatty acids of carp fillet confirm the excellent nutritional value of the lake fish the overall value of the fish catch in the lake had increased significantly following the arrival of carp which filled a pelagic benthivorous niche that had remained virtually entirely vacant as postulated by muchiri et al 1994 higher carp yields can thus potentially provide local communities with affordable nutritious protein with an ideal ratio of ω 3 ω 6 a large variety of xenobiotic compounds as well as means of integrated pest control are employed in the naivasha basin by small farmers as well as by large scale horticultural industry producing cut flowers for export mburu et al 2013 measurable levels of dieldrin organchlorine insecticide of documented carcinogenicity and dde ddt metabolite were reported in pelicans and in raptors from the naivasha area in the 1970s see gitahi et al 2002 commonly used pesticides excluding herbicides in the lake basin such as organophosphates carbamates pyrethroids and few organochlorines were listed by gitahi et al 2002 who were able to detect traces of lindane and dieldrin and β endosulfan in bass and in crayfish collected in 1997 8 they found no traces of organic contaminants in water or sediment neither did kaoga et al 2013 recent evidence of sediment and partly also water contamination however were found by gudka 2012 total endosulfan p p ddt and methoxychlor onyango et al 2015 found 4 4 ddt 2 4 dde 4 4 ddd γ hch α hch aldrin and otieno et al 2015 found chlorpyrifos and diazinon the concentration of polar pesticides detected in lake naivasha fish muscle were low significantly lower than average values monitored in central europe r grabic personal communication carp and tilapia samples showed no trace of the chemicals detected in the environment apart from dde that was detected at lower concentrations than those found by gitahi et al 2002 in bass in 1997 8 thus contrary to alarmist views that are often published in the kenyan as well as in the international press e g garric 2015 there was no evidence of dangerous levels of pesticide residues in naivasha carp and tilapia fillet analysed in 2008 2009 by njogu et al 2010 njogu 2011 by gudka in late 2010 gudka 2012 by us in 2012 13 or in tilapia by otieno et al 2015 samples of fish eagle serum and clotted blood revealed the presence of low amounts of organochlorine pesticides but no greater than levels that were found by research conducted in the 1970s gudka 2012 all were below levels that may induce eggshell thinning or any acute effects gudka 2012 despite alarmist reports and claims never substantiated with evidence of severe pollution by agro industrial activities around the lake we found no evidence that levels of agrochemical pesticides in fish fillet are increasing the occasional presence of daphniids in the lake a microcrustacean family known to be highly susceptible to pesticide pollution supports the view that the lake does not suffer from chronic chemical pollution impacts the management of the lake naivasha fishery may require increased fishing effort to reduce direct and indirect impacts of carp increasing fishing licences from 50 to 100 and removing the annual 3 month fishing ban but maintaining a 4 cm mesh prescription is likely to increase the uptake of adult carp this goes in the direction of relaxing bottom up controls linked to potential sediment re suspension and enhanced internal loading this scenario could result in the benefit of lower turbidity and a stronger phosphorus limitation of phytoplankton growth that would control phytoplankton biomass despite the removal of adults carp recruitment is unlikely to be affected due to its high reproductive potential reducing adult carp will possibly further reduce impacts on the benthos but it will not affect zooplankton predation by the young of the year weber and brown 2011 britton et al 2010 the fish yield to the shoreline fishermen remains a management problem ideally they should be the individuals offered licences to fish from boat by gill nets increasing the fishing pressure on carp and decreasing it on juveniles and smaller species the offtake of smaller fish to piscivorous birds is shown in this paper for the first time it should be regarded as an essential benefit to the tourist industry and in future can be quantified annually as another ecosystem service that the fishery provides to the community the final hypothesis that there are no net benefits to the human population around the lake is not supported carp offer several real and potential benefits without showing any of the negative impacts recorded from other tropical and semi tropical lake ecosystems management should recognise this positive benefit 6 concluding remarks and management recommendations 1 the lake naivasha ecosystem has been characterised by higher primary production rates higher maximum tp concentrations and lower soluble reactive silicate concentrations all indicating a general tendency towards increasing eutrophication despite this no appreciable difference in water transparency phytoplankton biomass or nutrient dominance has been observed between the pre carp and the post carp period changes in nutrient n p si concentrations started at least a decade before the appearance of carp indicating that catchment degradation and increased external loading are the cause rather than enhanced internal loading due to carp activities 2 no decrease in key ecosystem parameters that could be ascribed to the presence of carp were found on the basis of 9 working hypotheses initially defined from a literature review carp impact upon tilapia in naivasha is unlikely to be occurring through predation or through direct food competition it is possible sediment disturbance and bioturbation by carp may destroy brood structures and hinder young tilapia recruitment young carp is also likely to cause a worsening of zooplankton community biomass and composition which are important for tilapia development 3 naivasha carp are fast growing and seem to cope well with increasing exploitation rates therefore carp numbers should be kept low through intensive fishing management especially during low water level periods when the lake ecosystem is more vulnerable to degradation 4 reducing carp density will have additional beneficial effects on the tilapia fishery which yields a provisional service of potentially greater value given the higher price per fish biomass 5 lake naivasha s potential fish productivity is likely to be far greater than the official fish catches also because of a significant uptake by birds and by illegal fishermen 6 the overall value of the naivasha commercial fish catch has significantly improved since carp appearance the situation would greatly benefit from the marketing of added value products such as carp fillet that could be offered fresh in tourist hotels 7 carp flesh did not contain dangerous levels of pesticides it proved to be of appreciable taste and of excellent nutritional quality however given the high intensity of industrial exploitation of the lake basin it is recommended that regular monitoring should continue product transformation and marketing initiatives are warranted to improve the benefits delivered by this successful invasive species 8 management of carp indeed the entire fishery should be considered as a lake or even an area management issue rather than just a fisheries management issue for two reasons firstly the supply of food to piscivorous birds is the most important aspect of the lake s tourist industry and the many local people who depend upon tourism secondly the unregistered bankside fishermen have largely come from the ranks of unemployed youth drawn to or living in naivasha and its settlements because of the horticultural industry there are many more of them than licenced fishermen 9 lake naivasha has already demonstrated the ecohydrological impacts caused by loss of moderating papyrus swamps methods of restoring papyrus were formulated next to other ecohydrological tools wanjala et al 2018 here it demonstrates the benefits from a novel ecosystem of alien species to set against few dis benefits it represents a complex tropical ecohydrology case study and detailed

1002,in mongolia overuse and degradation of groundwater is a serious issue mainly in the urban and economic hub in ulaanbaatar and the southern gobi mining hub the authors have recently applied a process based eco hydrology model nice national integrated catchment based eco hydrology to these two contrasting river basins in order to explicitly quantify spatio temporal variations in water availability in this study they further extended the model to couple with inverse method for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of anthropogenic water uses nice inverse the model quantified the spatio temporal variations of livestock water use in these river basins in comparison with the estimated values by aggregating statistical data gis data observation data and field surveys in their previous studies the amount of water use by animals were generally small for each soum district and could also be heavily returned back to the ecosystems the result also showed a temporal decreasing trend of unit water use in some typical livestock cattle sheep and goats suggesting a substantial increase in water stress due to local regional eco hydrological degradation by urbanization and mining these results clarified the substantial increase in water stress of groundwater degradation was mainly caused by urbanization and mining locally in addition to climatic change sensitivity analysis and inverse estimation of model parameters helped to improve the accuracy of hydrologic budgets in basins this methodology is powerful for evaluating spatio temporal variations of water availability in regions with fewer inventory data on urbanization mining and livestock key words eco hydrology model inverse estimation water availability human activity 1 introduction in mongolia the water resources are unevenly distributed being abundant in the predominantly rural north but very scarce or non existent in the south in particular more than 80 of water resources were dependent on groundwater at the beginning of the 21st century fig 1 currently the national water resources are under increasing pressure and causes serious environmental degradation due to climatic change urbanization and rapid economic growth banerjee et al 2014 there are 29 river basins in the country under direct management by the ministry of environment and green development megd mnet 2013 fig 1 the areas at serious water risk are predominantly the urban and economic hub ulaanbaatar and the southern gobi mining hub banerjee et al 2014 in order to evaluate the degradation of water availability due to anthropogenic activity and climate change in these two contrasting hubs the authors began to monitor the groundwater level in two river basins from 2018 summer nakayama et al 2021 then they applied the process based national integrated catchment based eco hydrology nice model nakayama 2014 2015 to two contrasting river basins including the above two hubs the tuul and galba river basins the model could simulate successfully the effects of past climatic change and human induced disturbances such as urbanization mining and herders livestock on water resources during the last four decades nakayama et al 2021 the tuul river basin is located in northern grassland and steppe and the river flows through ulaanbaatar the capital in the middle stretch jamsran et al 2018 fig 1 groundwater has been drawn heavily for its municipal and industrial water supply in contrast the galba river basin galba uush doloodiing gobi river basin is located in the southern gobi desert and includes large mines such as oyu tolgoi ot and tavan tolgoi in this region jamsran et al 2018 fig 1 in particular ot is one of the world s largest copper gold mining started in 2008 oyu tolgoi llc 2013 torquoise hill resources ltd 2019 these two regions are in a similar situation that current water use may not be sustainable for meeting the projected water demand by the rapidly growing urban population and the expanding mining activity banerjee et al 2016 ulaanbaatar 2018 the authors recent study showed quantitative and explicit evaluations of spatio temporal variations of water availability in both basins nakayama et al 2021 however they assumed a constant unit water use of 5 types of typical livestock sheep horses cattle goats and camels with reference to the previous materials sekine 1993 yoshida 2009 because drinking water requirements for livestock vary by animal types species age diet and temperature wada et al 2016 there are some ranges and equations of water requirements in major livestock from a global perspective alcamo et al 1997 fao 2006 schlink et al 2010 there are also different ways to estimate water use such as direct animal drinking component and consumptive use from the viewpoint of water balance drinking water mainly from blue water sources is about the two thirds of water intake in the case of a lactating holstein dairy cow fao 2019 actually each livestock seems to have a different unit water use both temporally and spatially in mongolia and it is necessary to satisfy competing water demands from the mining urbanization herder nexus banerjee et al 2014 in the present study the process based nice was applied to the above two representative river basins in the extension of the authors recent study nakayama et al 2021 the original nice was newly coupled with inverse method for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of anthropogenic water uses nice inverse fig 2 based on the background described above three basic science questions were addressed i how do anthropogenic water uses influence hydrologic cycle in these two contrasting river basins ii how does change unit water use in 5 types of typical livestock in each basin iii how does change the relation between groundwater overuse and water stress there in order to answer these questions nice inverse simulation was performed to estimate spatio temporal change in unit water use of 5 types of typical livestock by comparing with the high resolution gridded dataset of water use for livestock urban activity and mining developed in the authors recent study nakayama et al 2021 the modelled result also clarified the relation between groundwater overuse and water stress by separating the effect of climatic change and human activity livestock urban and mining on water resources during the past decades the results obtained here would be used as a basis for extension to uncertainty analysis of the hydrologic cycle in order to improve the evaluation of pasture carrying capacity and its vulnerability 2 materials and methods 2 1 coupling process based nice with inverse parameter estimation nice inverse the original nice national integrated catchment based eco hydrology framework includes the following complex sub compartments nakayama 2014 2015 a surface hydrology submodel a land surface submodel including urban and crop processes a groundwater submodel a regional atmospheric submodel a mass transport submodel for constituents in sediment and water and a vegetation succession submodel nice was further coupled with biogeochemical cycle models nice bgc to evaluate the role of inland water on biogeochemical cycle nakayama 2017 2020 recently the model was applied to tuul and galba river basins to evaluate the effects of past climatic change and human induced disturbances such as urbanization and mining on water resources during the last four decades nakayama et al 2021 in this study the original nice in forward mode was newly coupled with inverse method for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of anthropogenic water uses nice inverse fig 2 the submodel of nice was coupled with the inverse computational program as a subroutine to include sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation processes hill et al 2000 this inverse method solves a modified gauss newton method to adjust values of input parameters in an iterative procedure to minimize the value of the weighted least squares objective function difference between the simulated and observed hydraulic heads and river flows 1 j i 1 n h o b s i h c a l i 2 where hobs i and hcal i are the observed and calculated values at time t ti i 1 2 3 n are individual observations and n is the total number of observations respectively in this study we applied unit water use of 5 types of typical livestock sheep horses cattle goats and camels as the input parameters to estimate the best values in the model the sensitivity equation for sensitivities of hydraulic heads and river flows throughout the grid with respect to each parameter was solved by the preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg2 solver whereas we applied the strongly implicit procedure in the original nice in forward model harbaugh et al 2000 this pcg2 solver has some characteristics that are important to the solution of sensitivities and is faster than the direct solver hill et al 2000 2 2 model input data six hour re analyzed data for downward radiation precipitation atmospheric pressure air temperature air humidity wind speed cloud cover the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar and leaf area index lai were input to the original nice after interpolation of the ecmwf reanalysis interim product era interim ecmwf 2019 in inverse proportion to the distance back calculated in each grid the input data at various spatial resolutions were prepared and arranged to calculate a spatially averaged 0 05 x 0 05 grid about 4 6 km resolution using the spatial analyst tools in arcgis v10 2 software for the simulation table 1 elevation land cover soil texture vegetation type river networks lakes and wetlands reservoir types and storage and geological structures were categorized for input to nice u s geological survey 1996a b lehner and döll 2004 hartmann and moosdorf 2012 iiasa 2012 nasa 2013 european commission 2015 most of the tuul river basin is covered with grassland and steppe except for forest in the upstream area whereas most of the galba river basin is covered by bare land desert except for grassland in the northeastern region in the classification of glc2000 nakayama et al 2021 gridded data regarding water use for livestock urban activity and mining were estimated for the entire tuul and galba river basins during 1980 2018 by combining a global dataset statistical data gis data literature and observation data as far as possible for input to the nice simulation table 1 total numbers of livestock sheep horses cattle goats and camels were estimated in each soum district of both basins using statistical data national statistics office of mongolia 2019 and global gridded data gilbert et al 2018 the authors assumed that all water intake was from groundwater in both basins and used conversion factors 1 horse 7 sheep 1 cattle 6 sheep 1 goat 0 9 sheep and 1 camel 5 sheep yoshida 2009 and water consumption per sheep 2 8 l day average 5 l day sekine 1993 to calculate the annual averaged livestock water use in ulaanbaatar urban water use was estimated by combining statistical population data for each soum every year national statistics office of mongolia 2019 there are 6 groundwater sources upper central industrial meat complex gachuurt and yarmag water sources to use and 2 more sources bio industrial complex and emerto water sources are planned to supply the capital in the future jica and cti engineering international co ltd 2010 in the absence of perennial rivers in the southern gobi region groundwater use in ot mining was calculated using the previous materials oyu tolgoi llc 2013 adb 2014 torquoise hill resources ltd 2019 these data were finally gridded into 0 05 x 0 05 resolution during 1980 2018 using the arcgis software in the tuul river basin a huge amount of groundwater has been used in ulaanbaatar over the last few decades whereas in the galba river basin there has been a large increase in the share of water use by the mining sector 84 since 2010 nakayama et al 2021 2 3 estimation of unit water use in 5 types of typical livestock the authors calculated unit water use of each livestock in the 20 observation stations of groundwater level nakayama et al 2021 in order to compare with the simulated water use by using nice inverse and with the above conversion factors in the previous studies sekine 1993 yoshida 2009 firstly they compiled the number of each livestock in the observation well by using global data gilbert et al 2018 statistical data national statistics office of mongolia 2019 and field survey in 2018 summer secondly they calculated the annual groundwater use by counting the timing and magnitude of water level decrease in the time series of groundwater level fluctuations with δt 30 min in each observation well table 2 thirdly they solved n pieces of simultaneous equations n 11 in tuul and n 9 in galba with r unknown parameters r 5 unit water use of horse cattle sheep goat and camel respectively because the number of equations was greater than that of unknown parameters n r we had ncr types of solutions in the probability theory 2 n c r n r n r where ncr is number of ways in which r objects can be chosen from a set of n objects each set of r simultaneous equations was solved by calculating the inverse matrix of left hand side and the product of this matrix and right hand side in the function of microsoft excel 365 finally they calculated the average and median values range and standard deviations of unit water use of each livestock which were derived from ncr types of solutions in the tuul and galba river basins respectively this average or median values of each livestock in addition to previous materials can be regarded as the best approximate solutions in n pieces of simultaneous equations 2 4 boundary conditions and running the simulation at the upstream boundaries conditions at the hydraulic head were based on an assumption of no inflow from the mountains in the opposite direction nakayama and watanabe 2004 for the hillslope hydrology flow depth and discharge on the uppermost boundaries of basins were set to zero throughout the simulation inflows or outflows from the riverbeds were simulated at each time step depending on the difference in the groundwater and river hydraulic heads details have been described in the previous paper nakayama et al 2021 the simulation areas in the tuul and galba river basins were 7 0 wide by 3 0 long and 11 0 wide by 6 0 long in longitude latitude coordinates respectively there are 29 river channels in the tuul river basin and 106 in the galba river basin fig 1 nice simulation in the original forward mode was performed at 0 05 x 0 05 resolution about 4 6 km resolution in the horizontal direction and in 20 layers with a weighting factor of 1 1 layer thicknesses being graduated from thinner in the upper layer to thicker in the deeper layer in the vertical direction the upper land layer was set at 0 2 m from the ground surface and the 20th land layer was defined as an elevation of 200 m below sea level simulations were performed with a time step of δt 6 h for 1980 2018 after a 1 year warm up period to allow a time varying equilibrium the simulated results were calibrated and validated using ground water level and river discharge observations in both basins tables 2 and 3 nakayama et al 2021 then nice inverse simulation was conducted backward again with sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation modes in the same resolution as the forward simulation for 2015 2018 in both basins fig 2 this inverse method enabled the regression to measure model fit to the observations groundwater level and river discharge tables 2 and 3 as much as possible we used the maximum number of parameter estimation iterations as 10 the maximum fractional change for parameter values in each iteration as 2 0 the head change closure criterion as 0 001 in the simulation after this procedure the model calculated backward the residuals the dimensionless and one percent scaled sensitivities hill et al 2000 the parameter values and statistics of unit water use in 5 types of typical livestock and the correlation matrix for each parameter 3 results 3 1 impact of anthropogenic activity on groundwater level in urban and mining hubs of mongolia the authors have quantified the effects of past climatic change and human induced disturbances such as urbanization and mining on water resources during 1980 2018 in these two river basins in their previous paper fig 3 in the tuul river basin the model result showed more than half of groundwater degradation in urban areas has been caused by urban water use after 2000 fig 3a in comparison to non urban areas fig 3b in contrast in the galba river basin the model showed more serious situation that almost all of groundwater degradation in mining areas has been caused by ot mining water use after 2010 fig 3c in comparison with non mining areas fig 3d the amount of water use by animals are generally small for each soum the ratios of livestock water use to total usage in 2018 were calculated as 1 8 in ulaanbaatar of the tuul river and 4 4 in khanbogd of the galba river respectively and can also be heavily returned back to the ecosystems these results mean the large impact of water use due to urbanization and mining on groundwater degradation around the water sources locally in addition to climatic change nakayama et al 2021 3 2 spatio temporal variations of livestock water use in two contrasting river basins nice inverse simulated the temporal change of unit water use in 5 types of typical livestock in each basin during 2015 2018 fig 4 it can be seen that unit water use was almost constant and in the range of previous materials during the four years however some typical livestock cattle sheep and goats shows a temporal decreasing trend in water use particularly in galba river basin in this basin annual rainfall was less than 100 mm year in semi arid region and the groundwater degradation was serious caused by ot mining water use after 2010 nakayama et al 2021 further the numbers of sheep and goat occupy almost 85 of total livestock during the last 2010s national statistics office of mongolia 2019 the result implies a substantial increase in water stress due to local regional eco hydrological degradation by urbanization and mining 3 3 sensitivity analysis and reliability of parameter estimation of water uses the new model also simulated the composite scaled sensitivity fig 5 and the correlation between each parameter table 4 the composite scaled sensitivity means whether the available observations are likely to provide adequate information to allow estimation of defined parameters the result shows the sensitivity for unit water use in each livestock generally increases for all observations which means a temporal decreasing trend in water use in some typical livestock cattle sheep and goats shown in fig 4 is accompanied by the increase in sensitivity of parameters the correlation between each parameter in table 4 shows q sheep and q goat in the tuul and q horse and q sheep and q cattle and q camel in the galba are negatively correlated with each other correlation is 0 96 q horse and q camel correlation is 0 79 q cattle and q sheep correlation is 0 77 in the tuul and q cattle and q sheep in the galba correlation is 0 68 are also positively correlated with each other there correlations are valuable to understand the relation of water use in each livestock yoshida 2009 4 discussion 4 1 for better understanding of regional water resources in the two river basins the present simulation showed that these two contrasting river basins in mongolia are heavily dependent on the use of groundwater resources for urbanization mining and livestock the result showed the amount of water use by animals are relatively smaller than that of urban and mining for each soum fig 3 nice inverse clarified the spatio temporal variations of unit water use in 5 types of typical livestock in each basin fig 4 the authors also conducted a sensitivity analysis and the correlation of each parameter these results imply the change in relation between groundwater overuse and water stress there so far fig 5 the authors previous study analysed the relative contribution of human activity and climate change on groundwater level change and quantified the large impact of water use due to urbanization and mining on groundwater degradation around the water sources locally nakayama et al 2021 this finding is supported by the above results in this paper frequent trend of increased temperature extreme flooding and heavy winter precipitation in recent years has decreased reliability of the water supply unep 2009 fao 2012 whereas deep aquifers have been continuously degraded by urban and mining overuse ifc 2017 though nice inverse is a powerful tool for improving the accuracy of hydrologic budgets in basins we need more input data about livestock water use drinking water requirements for livestock vary by animal types species age diet and temperature wada et al 2016 in particular details of heterogeneous distribution of livestock number and its seasonal water use are important for improving the accuracy of the simulated results for hydrologic cycle in this study the authors estimated unit water use of each livestock in the 20 observation stations of groundwater level nakayama et al 2021 to compare with the simulated water use by the model fig 3 though this estimation is the best approximate solutions in simultaneous equations at the moment it is necessary to obtain more ground truth data and field surveys by using gps tracking and image analysis of drone and aerial photograph payne et al 2020 and to apply a learning algorithm such as random forest to improve the downscaling of census data nicolas et al 2016 4 2 changing relation between groundwater overuse and water stress in the

1002,in mongolia overuse and degradation of groundwater is a serious issue mainly in the urban and economic hub in ulaanbaatar and the southern gobi mining hub the authors have recently applied a process based eco hydrology model nice national integrated catchment based eco hydrology to these two contrasting river basins in order to explicitly quantify spatio temporal variations in water availability in this study they further extended the model to couple with inverse method for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of anthropogenic water uses nice inverse the model quantified the spatio temporal variations of livestock water use in these river basins in comparison with the estimated values by aggregating statistical data gis data observation data and field surveys in their previous studies the amount of water use by animals were generally small for each soum district and could also be heavily returned back to the ecosystems the result also showed a temporal decreasing trend of unit water use in some typical livestock cattle sheep and goats suggesting a substantial increase in water stress due to local regional eco hydrological degradation by urbanization and mining these results clarified the substantial increase in water stress of groundwater degradation was mainly caused by urbanization and mining locally in addition to climatic change sensitivity analysis and inverse estimation of model parameters helped to improve the accuracy of hydrologic budgets in basins this methodology is powerful for evaluating spatio temporal variations of water availability in regions with fewer inventory data on urbanization mining and livestock key words eco hydrology model inverse estimation water availability human activity 1 introduction in mongolia the water resources are unevenly distributed being abundant in the predominantly rural north but very scarce or non existent in the south in particular more than 80 of water resources were dependent on groundwater at the beginning of the 21st century fig 1 currently the national water resources are under increasing pressure and causes serious environmental degradation due to climatic change urbanization and rapid economic growth banerjee et al 2014 there are 29 river basins in the country under direct management by the ministry of environment and green development megd mnet 2013 fig 1 the areas at serious water risk are predominantly the urban and economic hub ulaanbaatar and the southern gobi mining hub banerjee et al 2014 in order to evaluate the degradation of water availability due to anthropogenic activity and climate change in these two contrasting hubs the authors began to monitor the groundwater level in two river basins from 2018 summer nakayama et al 2021 then they applied the process based national integrated catchment based eco hydrology nice model nakayama 2014 2015 to two contrasting river basins including the above two hubs the tuul and galba river basins the model could simulate successfully the effects of past climatic change and human induced disturbances such as urbanization mining and herders livestock on water resources during the last four decades nakayama et al 2021 the tuul river basin is located in northern grassland and steppe and the river flows through ulaanbaatar the capital in the middle stretch jamsran et al 2018 fig 1 groundwater has been drawn heavily for its municipal and industrial water supply in contrast the galba river basin galba uush doloodiing gobi river basin is located in the southern gobi desert and includes large mines such as oyu tolgoi ot and tavan tolgoi in this region jamsran et al 2018 fig 1 in particular ot is one of the world s largest copper gold mining started in 2008 oyu tolgoi llc 2013 torquoise hill resources ltd 2019 these two regions are in a similar situation that current water use may not be sustainable for meeting the projected water demand by the rapidly growing urban population and the expanding mining activity banerjee et al 2016 ulaanbaatar 2018 the authors recent study showed quantitative and explicit evaluations of spatio temporal variations of water availability in both basins nakayama et al 2021 however they assumed a constant unit water use of 5 types of typical livestock sheep horses cattle goats and camels with reference to the previous materials sekine 1993 yoshida 2009 because drinking water requirements for livestock vary by animal types species age diet and temperature wada et al 2016 there are some ranges and equations of water requirements in major livestock from a global perspective alcamo et al 1997 fao 2006 schlink et al 2010 there are also different ways to estimate water use such as direct animal drinking component and consumptive use from the viewpoint of water balance drinking water mainly from blue water sources is about the two thirds of water intake in the case of a lactating holstein dairy cow fao 2019 actually each livestock seems to have a different unit water use both temporally and spatially in mongolia and it is necessary to satisfy competing water demands from the mining urbanization herder nexus banerjee et al 2014 in the present study the process based nice was applied to the above two representative river basins in the extension of the authors recent study nakayama et al 2021 the original nice was newly coupled with inverse method for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of anthropogenic water uses nice inverse fig 2 based on the background described above three basic science questions were addressed i how do anthropogenic water uses influence hydrologic cycle in these two contrasting river basins ii how does change unit water use in 5 types of typical livestock in each basin iii how does change the relation between groundwater overuse and water stress there in order to answer these questions nice inverse simulation was performed to estimate spatio temporal change in unit water use of 5 types of typical livestock by comparing with the high resolution gridded dataset of water use for livestock urban activity and mining developed in the authors recent study nakayama et al 2021 the modelled result also clarified the relation between groundwater overuse and water stress by separating the effect of climatic change and human activity livestock urban and mining on water resources during the past decades the results obtained here would be used as a basis for extension to uncertainty analysis of the hydrologic cycle in order to improve the evaluation of pasture carrying capacity and its vulnerability 2 materials and methods 2 1 coupling process based nice with inverse parameter estimation nice inverse the original nice national integrated catchment based eco hydrology framework includes the following complex sub compartments nakayama 2014 2015 a surface hydrology submodel a land surface submodel including urban and crop processes a groundwater submodel a regional atmospheric submodel a mass transport submodel for constituents in sediment and water and a vegetation succession submodel nice was further coupled with biogeochemical cycle models nice bgc to evaluate the role of inland water on biogeochemical cycle nakayama 2017 2020 recently the model was applied to tuul and galba river basins to evaluate the effects of past climatic change and human induced disturbances such as urbanization and mining on water resources during the last four decades nakayama et al 2021 in this study the original nice in forward mode was newly coupled with inverse method for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of anthropogenic water uses nice inverse fig 2 the submodel of nice was coupled with the inverse computational program as a subroutine to include sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation processes hill et al 2000 this inverse method solves a modified gauss newton method to adjust values of input parameters in an iterative procedure to minimize the value of the weighted least squares objective function difference between the simulated and observed hydraulic heads and river flows 1 j i 1 n h o b s i h c a l i 2 where hobs i and hcal i are the observed and calculated values at time t ti i 1 2 3 n are individual observations and n is the total number of observations respectively in this study we applied unit water use of 5 types of typical livestock sheep horses cattle goats and camels as the input parameters to estimate the best values in the model the sensitivity equation for sensitivities of hydraulic heads and river flows throughout the grid with respect to each parameter was solved by the preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg2 solver whereas we applied the strongly implicit procedure in the original nice in forward model harbaugh et al 2000 this pcg2 solver has some characteristics that are important to the solution of sensitivities and is faster than the direct solver hill et al 2000 2 2 model input data six hour re analyzed data for downward radiation precipitation atmospheric pressure air temperature air humidity wind speed cloud cover the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar and leaf area index lai were input to the original nice after interpolation of the ecmwf reanalysis interim product era interim ecmwf 2019 in inverse proportion to the distance back calculated in each grid the input data at various spatial resolutions were prepared and arranged to calculate a spatially averaged 0 05 x 0 05 grid about 4 6 km resolution using the spatial analyst tools in arcgis v10 2 software for the simulation table 1 elevation land cover soil texture vegetation type river networks lakes and wetlands reservoir types and storage and geological structures were categorized for input to nice u s geological survey 1996a b lehner and döll 2004 hartmann and moosdorf 2012 iiasa 2012 nasa 2013 european commission 2015 most of the tuul river basin is covered with grassland and steppe except for forest in the upstream area whereas most of the galba river basin is covered by bare land desert except for grassland in the northeastern region in the classification of glc2000 nakayama et al 2021 gridded data regarding water use for livestock urban activity and mining were estimated for the entire tuul and galba river basins during 1980 2018 by combining a global dataset statistical data gis data literature and observation data as far as possible for input to the nice simulation table 1 total numbers of livestock sheep horses cattle goats and camels were estimated in each soum district of both basins using statistical data national statistics office of mongolia 2019 and global gridded data gilbert et al 2018 the authors assumed that all water intake was from groundwater in both basins and used conversion factors 1 horse 7 sheep 1 cattle 6 sheep 1 goat 0 9 sheep and 1 camel 5 sheep yoshida 2009 and water consumption per sheep 2 8 l day average 5 l day sekine 1993 to calculate the annual averaged livestock water use in ulaanbaatar urban water use was estimated by combining statistical population data for each soum every year national statistics office of mongolia 2019 there are 6 groundwater sources upper central industrial meat complex gachuurt and yarmag water sources to use and 2 more sources bio industrial complex and emerto water sources are planned to supply the capital in the future jica and cti engineering international co ltd 2010 in the absence of perennial rivers in the southern gobi region groundwater use in ot mining was calculated using the previous materials oyu tolgoi llc 2013 adb 2014 torquoise hill resources ltd 2019 these data were finally gridded into 0 05 x 0 05 resolution during 1980 2018 using the arcgis software in the tuul river basin a huge amount of groundwater has been used in ulaanbaatar over the last few decades whereas in the galba river basin there has been a large increase in the share of water use by the mining sector 84 since 2010 nakayama et al 2021 2 3 estimation of unit water use in 5 types of typical livestock the authors calculated unit water use of each livestock in the 20 observation stations of groundwater level nakayama et al 2021 in order to compare with the simulated water use by using nice inverse and with the above conversion factors in the previous studies sekine 1993 yoshida 2009 firstly they compiled the number of each livestock in the observation well by using global data gilbert et al 2018 statistical data national statistics office of mongolia 2019 and field survey in 2018 summer secondly they calculated the annual groundwater use by counting the timing and magnitude of water level decrease in the time series of groundwater level fluctuations with δt 30 min in each observation well table 2 thirdly they solved n pieces of simultaneous equations n 11 in tuul and n 9 in galba with r unknown parameters r 5 unit water use of horse cattle sheep goat and camel respectively because the number of equations was greater than that of unknown parameters n r we had ncr types of solutions in the probability theory 2 n c r n r n r where ncr is number of ways in which r objects can be chosen from a set of n objects each set of r simultaneous equations was solved by calculating the inverse matrix of left hand side and the product of this matrix and right hand side in the function of microsoft excel 365 finally they calculated the average and median values range and standard deviations of unit water use of each livestock which were derived from ncr types of solutions in the tuul and galba river basins respectively this average or median values of each livestock in addition to previous materials can be regarded as the best approximate solutions in n pieces of simultaneous equations 2 4 boundary conditions and running the simulation at the upstream boundaries conditions at the hydraulic head were based on an assumption of no inflow from the mountains in the opposite direction nakayama and watanabe 2004 for the hillslope hydrology flow depth and discharge on the uppermost boundaries of basins were set to zero throughout the simulation inflows or outflows from the riverbeds were simulated at each time step depending on the difference in the groundwater and river hydraulic heads details have been described in the previous paper nakayama et al 2021 the simulation areas in the tuul and galba river basins were 7 0 wide by 3 0 long and 11 0 wide by 6 0 long in longitude latitude coordinates respectively there are 29 river channels in the tuul river basin and 106 in the galba river basin fig 1 nice simulation in the original forward mode was performed at 0 05 x 0 05 resolution about 4 6 km resolution in the horizontal direction and in 20 layers with a weighting factor of 1 1 layer thicknesses being graduated from thinner in the upper layer to thicker in the deeper layer in the vertical direction the upper land layer was set at 0 2 m from the ground surface and the 20th land layer was defined as an elevation of 200 m below sea level simulations were performed with a time step of δt 6 h for 1980 2018 after a 1 year warm up period to allow a time varying equilibrium the simulated results were calibrated and validated using ground water level and river discharge observations in both basins tables 2 and 3 nakayama et al 2021 then nice inverse simulation was conducted backward again with sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation modes in the same resolution as the forward simulation for 2015 2018 in both basins fig 2 this inverse method enabled the regression to measure model fit to the observations groundwater level and river discharge tables 2 and 3 as much as possible we used the maximum number of parameter estimation iterations as 10 the maximum fractional change for parameter values in each iteration as 2 0 the head change closure criterion as 0 001 in the simulation after this procedure the model calculated backward the residuals the dimensionless and one percent scaled sensitivities hill et al 2000 the parameter values and statistics of unit water use in 5 types of typical livestock and the correlation matrix for each parameter 3 results 3 1 impact of anthropogenic activity on groundwater level in urban and mining hubs of mongolia the authors have quantified the effects of past climatic change and human induced disturbances such as urbanization and mining on water resources during 1980 2018 in these two river basins in their previous paper fig 3 in the tuul river basin the model result showed more than half of groundwater degradation in urban areas has been caused by urban water use after 2000 fig 3a in comparison to non urban areas fig 3b in contrast in the galba river basin the model showed more serious situation that almost all of groundwater degradation in mining areas has been caused by ot mining water use after 2010 fig 3c in comparison with non mining areas fig 3d the amount of water use by animals are generally small for each soum the ratios of livestock water use to total usage in 2018 were calculated as 1 8 in ulaanbaatar of the tuul river and 4 4 in khanbogd of the galba river respectively and can also be heavily returned back to the ecosystems these results mean the large impact of water use due to urbanization and mining on groundwater degradation around the water sources locally in addition to climatic change nakayama et al 2021 3 2 spatio temporal variations of livestock water use in two contrasting river basins nice inverse simulated the temporal change of unit water use in 5 types of typical livestock in each basin during 2015 2018 fig 4 it can be seen that unit water use was almost constant and in the range of previous materials during the four years however some typical livestock cattle sheep and goats shows a temporal decreasing trend in water use particularly in galba river basin in this basin annual rainfall was less than 100 mm year in semi arid region and the groundwater degradation was serious caused by ot mining water use after 2010 nakayama et al 2021 further the numbers of sheep and goat occupy almost 85 of total livestock during the last 2010s national statistics office of mongolia 2019 the result implies a substantial increase in water stress due to local regional eco hydrological degradation by urbanization and mining 3 3 sensitivity analysis and reliability of parameter estimation of water uses the new model also simulated the composite scaled sensitivity fig 5 and the correlation between each parameter table 4 the composite scaled sensitivity means whether the available observations are likely to provide adequate information to allow estimation of defined parameters the result shows the sensitivity for unit water use in each livestock generally increases for all observations which means a temporal decreasing trend in water use in some typical livestock cattle sheep and goats shown in fig 4 is accompanied by the increase in sensitivity of parameters the correlation between each parameter in table 4 shows q sheep and q goat in the tuul and q horse and q sheep and q cattle and q camel in the galba are negatively correlated with each other correlation is 0 96 q horse and q camel correlation is 0 79 q cattle and q sheep correlation is 0 77 in the tuul and q cattle and q sheep in the galba correlation is 0 68 are also positively correlated with each other there correlations are valuable to understand the relation of water use in each livestock yoshida 2009 4 discussion 4 1 for better understanding of regional water resources in the two river basins the present simulation showed that these two contrasting river basins in mongolia are heavily dependent on the use of groundwater resources for urbanization mining and livestock the result showed the amount of water use by animals are relatively smaller than that of urban and mining for each soum fig 3 nice inverse clarified the spatio temporal variations of unit water use in 5 types of typical livestock in each basin fig 4 the authors also conducted a sensitivity analysis and the correlation of each parameter these results imply the change in relation between groundwater overuse and water stress there so far fig 5 the authors previous study analysed the relative contribution of human activity and climate change on groundwater level change and quantified the large impact of water use due to urbanization and mining on groundwater degradation around the water sources locally nakayama et al 2021 this finding is supported by the above results in this paper frequent trend of increased temperature extreme flooding and heavy winter precipitation in recent years has decreased reliability of the water supply unep 2009 fao 2012 whereas deep aquifers have been continuously degraded by urban and mining overuse ifc 2017 though nice inverse is a powerful tool for improving the accuracy of hydrologic budgets in basins we need more input data about livestock water use drinking water requirements for livestock vary by animal types species age diet and temperature wada et al 2016 in particular details of heterogeneous distribution of livestock number and its seasonal water use are important for improving the accuracy of the simulated results for hydrologic cycle in this study the authors estimated unit water use of each livestock in the 20 observation stations of groundwater level nakayama et al 2021 to compare with the simulated water use by the model fig 3 though this estimation is the best approximate solutions in simultaneous equations at the moment it is necessary to obtain more ground truth data and field surveys by using gps tracking and image analysis of drone and aerial photograph payne et al 2020 and to apply a learning algorithm such as random forest to improve the downscaling of census data nicolas et al 2016 4 2 changing relation between groundwater overuse and water stress in the future the simulated result of the change in relation between groundwater overuse and water stress there so far figs 4 and 5 also seems a serious alarm to satisfy competing water demands from the mining urbanization herder nexus banerjee et al 2014 future water demand in ulaanbaatar and large new mines in the southern gobi is expected to exceed the maximum available resources in the near

geographically the global positioning system gps coordinates of the site is in 107 26 e to 107 95 e 6 73 s to 7 25 s and 600 m to 3 000 m above sea level elevations figure 1 meanwhile its region boundary covers upper citarum river basin 16 sub basins and saguling reservoir catchment area with the total area of 2 310 km2 a small hillslope river catchment part of saguling reservoir tributaries was selected in the cibitung river catchment 35 5 km2 to install different equipment of eds forest seasonal crops and paddy fields are mostly dominated land use of this area 2 2 equipment s installation and tools several equipment and tools were used and installed in order to support saguling eds function as a place for capacity building field station and research activities related to ecohydrology based sustainable water resource management these equipment and tools include a online and real time monitoring system for meteorological component as well as river s water quality and quantity parameters the system has been set up at three locations of river segment representing upper area two stations middle area 1 station and downstream area two stations the monitoring system consists of two main parts field measurement station in the cibitung watershed and data centre server located at the research centre for limnology lipi sensors data logger communication system server and on site power supply were used to support the overall online system data from field station is sent to the server via the gprs network or by sms using the gsm network collected data is also stored in the field for data backup b concept and design for controlling soil erosion rate at catchment scale were proposed it is combined and completed by rainfall sediment runoff model for spatial temporal quantification and optimization of soil erosion and deposition rate transportation sediment material and hydrological cycle dynamics vegetation may play important role to minimize anthropological structure according to local topography property erosion rate magnitude and sediment yield in the river catchment c phytoremediation ponds composed by 36 small pools measured approximately 2 m x 5 m x 0 5 m were constructed to provide an example of direct field phytotechnology application for water quality improvement at small scale figure 2 lemna perpusilla torr landoltia punctata salvinia sp pistia stratiotes and eichhornia crassipes are different floating plants used in remediation ponds to remove pollutants in liquid waste coming from households paddy field sago industry waste waters figure 3 these types of water flowed to fish ponds and remediation ponds by gravity nile and catfish were placed in upper part of the system to increase nutrient concentration in the water to stimulate growth of floating plants as bioremediation agent this phytoremediation system will be completed by a concept and design for the environmental sanitation improvement of the selected housing block d socio economic and cultural aspects elaboration and understanding of the local community to convey community habit perception and response to the existing of new developed ecohydrology demosite this important part is worth to do so in order to strengthen local community participation and involvement in the demosite activities and its future development using mixed method consisting of quantitative and qualitative data collection mini survey with simple questionnaire fgd and interview of people s daily activities surrounding eds related desk study of secondary demographic data figuring in sub district and village level was also conducted e assessment of water quality was executed periodically covering in situ parameters such as turbidity dissolved total dissolved solids tds temperature ph conductivity dissolved oxygen do and salinity using portable water quality checker chemical parameters were analysed in research centre for limnology laboratory such as nitrite no2 phosphate po4 3 3 results and discussions ecohydrology approach is considered as a comprehensive and sustainable way to restore water ecosystem and its environment due to their ability in facilitating excess water born nutrients conversion into plant biomass sediment and pollutants trapping and habitats providing for different species implementation of ecohydrology in saguling catchment area in term of ecohydrology demonstration site establishment aims to demonstrate the potential power of this concept to mitigate anthropogenic and other impacts on water environments based on its natural capacity wolanski et al 2004 3 1 online monitoring system for river water and weather condition an online monitoring system in general has the function to record the dynamics of river water quality and quantity as well as weather elements in real time and continuously the purpose of this system establishment is to monitor and evaluate the environmental conditions of the cibitung river before entering the saguling reservoir and also to calibrate and validate the rain runoff sediment simulation model at watershed scale supporting flood early warning system development figure 4 figure 5 shows a typical and interesting monitoring data recorded on february 7 2016 it was raining from 13 11 14 14 26 12 at 9 4 mm and raining again at 16 11 13 18 56 13 at 26 6 mm the first stage rain tended to increase cibitung river water level at watershed outlet from 24 cm at the beginning and reached its peak 260 cm at 17 26 14 as shown in the figure 5 there were two water level peaks consisting of first peak with a 60 cm increase closely related to early stages rainfall 9 4 mm and the second peak relatively caused by the first and second stages of rain combination meanwhile water level decrease after first peak was probably due to one hour lag between the two stages of rain figure 5 similar pattern was observed for turbidity level fluctuation with a shift of peak time compared to water level lu et al 2014 li et al 2020 hydraulic characteristics streamflow velocity and slope of the river seems to be the main factors making evident relation between water level flow discharge and suspended sediment concentration csermak et al 1987 the sediment content represented by turbidity of river water may reflect erosion level of related watershed area for this reason river water turbidity monitoring is an important tool in managing water resources based on previous recorded data a total of 36 mm rain increased water turbidity in cibitung river from 24 ntu to 3 292 ntu indicating very high erosion on its watershed cibitung watershed land use profile covering 52 1 of dry agricultural cultivation 21 8 of rice fields 14 6 of shrubs 7 7 of settlements and only 3 6 of forest seems to be the main trigger of erosion source forest area generally has different functions of rain interception surface runoff reduction soil moisture storage and water infiltration process soil erosion rate reduction and river water discharge maintenance schwab et al 1981 the magnitude of the suspended sediment load transported by cibitung river will have important implication on natural function of the river system including channel morphology water quality and quantity aquatic ecosystems saguling reservoir capacity 3 2 distributed rainfall runoff sediment model and its aplication one of the activities carried out at the saguling ecohydrology demosite is the development of an ecohydrological modelling system and its application suitable for the asia pacific region the modelling system is designed to have the ability as a tool for quantification simulation prediction projection eco hydrology process understanding scenario based management plan and quantitative assessment of ecosystem carrying capacity and its services the type of model developed is a distributed model type and its formulization based on the interaction and process mechanism of hydrological ecological anthropogenic elements physically based distributed model type the practical use of the model is able to be integrated with remote sensing technology gis and online monitoring system environmental hazards and risks at the demosite location targeted to be assessed and predicted through an ecohydrological modelling system include floods and droughts soil erosion and sedimentation and water quality degradation therefore in the early stages of model development a sub module has been successfully created for simulating the relationship of rainfall surface flow soil erosion and sediment transport processes resulting from erosion processes the model successfully developed for demosite and upper citarum watershed was distributed rainfall runoff sediment model this model consists of hillslope rainfall runoff soil erosion and sediment transport algorithm the rainfall runoff model was based on a kinematic wave approach and simulated three lateral flow mechanisms including subsurface and surface flows tachikawa et al 2004 simulation of soil transport processes was also included in the rainfall runoff model soil detachment processes associated with inter rill and rill erosion were implicitly simulated as raindrop splash and surface flow detachment respectively the concept of sediment transport capacity was used to determine soil detachment or deposition by surface flow in the present work sediment transport capacity was calculated based on unit stream power usp theory apip et al 2011 apip et al 2012 apip et al 2015 the ecological module construction i e water quality erosion control phytotechnology modules will be addressed at the further stage of ecohydrological modelling system development evaluation of model performance for re simulating flow rate and amount of sediment produced was carried out through a process of calibration and validation in the upper citarum watershed with the main inlet of saguling reservoir as outlet point figure 6 as well as using a long term simulation the years 2009 and 2010 were selected as the calibration and validation periods observed daily water discharge and sediment concentration data from nanjung station located at the outlet were used for the model evaluation moreover daily rainfall recorded at 17 stations was used as one of the input data the 90 m hydro topographic data from the hydrosheds product http hydrosheds cr usgs gov was used as another model input comparisons of hydrograph sedigraph and cumulative water and sediment yields between model output and measurement results at nanjung station during the validation period 2010 can be seen in figure 7 using a set of calibrated model parameter rainfall sediment runoff model was run for the validation period the results show that after calibration process the model produced results values and shapes relatively similar to observed hydrograph sedigraph and long term accumulated sediment values then the model performance in predicting cumulative amount of sediment yield per year was evaluated using the nash sutcliff nse efficiency coefficient nash et al 1970 and giving high values of nse for water accumulation and sediment yields 0 96 and 0 92 respectively in this case the model can quantitatively predict sediment yield production relatively similar to observed data at nanjung station around 4 0 5 0 million tons in 2010 in addition to quantifying the amount of water and sediment yields this model could be used to determine the sources of surface runoff soil erosion and deposition which are very important to be known in designing the location and approach for flood erosion and sedimentation controls in the internal watershed following are the results of the model application in the cibitung watershed in which the model had previously been tested in the entire upper citarum watershed the aim is to determine the river flow regime soil erosion and resettling hotspots extreme rainfall data on 7 10 july 2016 on 15 minute time interval was used as one of the main inputs of the model the simulation results figure 8 obtained spatial pattern of river flow regimes top right hotspots of erosion below left and deposition below right sources at internal catchments this information is important and required for identification of mitigation priority locations selection and making technical design of ecotechnology bio engineering 3 3 phytoremediation system for water quality improvement aquatic plants capability to reduce contaminants in waste water was tested in the phytoremediation ponds table 1 summarizes the characteristics of five different waste waters recorded around the demosite mixed waste was regulated to represent a mixture of four types of liquid waste including domestic agricultural sago and river water the concentration of nutrient parameters was no2 0 03 0 05 mg l nh4 0 04 0 06 mg l po4 3 0 02 0 04 mg l and cod 20 30 mg l respectively meanwhile the level of do tds and turbidity were 40 50 mg l 1 5 2 0 mg l and 30 40 ntu respectively floating plants seem to be able to remediate water pollutants by taking up nutrients and other substances in plant biomass irwanto et al reported that ceratophyllum demersum irwanto et al 2017 and lemna minor ugya 2015 can reduce the concentration of heavy metal pb pollutants in waste water up to 75 5 and 81 1 respectively meanwhile eichhornia crassipes may reduce 85 83 and 88 10 of cd and pb concentrations respectively indrasti et al 2006 in lining with these data the aquatic plants in the phytoremediation ponds showed positive response in improving water quality entering to the system figure 9 recorded reduction of water tds and conductivity in the lemna perpusilla and landoltia punctata pools these two parameters are closely related to ions amount accumulated in the water in the other hand it can be observed that lemna s growth was less pronounced than that of landoltia within the first 45 days 2 4 compared to 4 7 in average and landoltia ponds have less conductivity than lemna 0 05 0 07 ms cm and 0 07 0 09 ms cm respectively similar pattern can also be observed in tds data on day 59 it was observed that biomass of landoltia was decreasing 15 this was likely related to the existence of several snails in the pond as a total of 50 gr of new landoltia should be placed in dumbass of the pond water quality improvement due to the presence of different aquatic organisms demonstrate its ability through several mechanisms such as nutrients regulation co2 absorption mixing attenuation and environmental stabilization blindow et al 2002 tokoro et al 2004 chen et al 2007 koch et al 2009 two other aquatic plants showing the capacity to reduce water pollutants were pistia stratiotes and salvinia sp figure 10 shows the faster growth of pistia stratiotes compared to salvinia sp despite their mutual input in opposite way pistia stratiotes reduces conductivity and tds of water more rapidly however its growth rate started to decrease after the pools became too dense and several snails were spotted in the ponds overall pistia stratiotes has highest maximum growth 19 73 and reduced the most electrical conductivity and tds while lowest maximum growth was observed for salvinia sp 3 97 different ways of water turbidity reduction by aquatic vegetation including floating plants consist of water movement decrease reducing sedimentation nepf et al 1999 phytoplankton growth subtraction by nutrients limitation kufel et al 1994 allelochemical substances release wium andersen et al 1982 pool bottom stabilization decreasing resuspended sediment table 2 shows turbidity decreasing trend of five aquatic plants during 64 days lemna and landoltia physically the smallest plants could reduce turbidity most when the input turbidity was at the lowest in day 37 meanwhile salvinia and pistia reduce turbidity most at the peak turbidity input in day 59 turbidity reduction by eichhornia was not as high as that by pistia maximum water turbidity reduction in the ponds of lemna landoltia salvinia pistia and eichhornia were 64 76 68 92 and 88 respectively it seems that sediments stabilization and nutrients uptake may decrease turbidity and increase local penetration of light as reported by van der heide et al van der heide et al 2011 and scheffer scheffer 2004 3 4 understanding of local community social economic and cultural aspect understanding characteristics of local communities around the demosite will greatly assist ecohydrology concept implementation to support sustainable water resource management sutapa et al 2021 the development of eds was expected to be in social and environmental harmony by considering among others their interests on water resources to meet multiple purposes and involving them inclusively during planning construction and implementation of the project the fourth principle of ecohydrology proposed by asia pacific centre for ecohydrology apce views society and its culture as an important factor needs to be integrated comprehensively with the other 3 principles a survey was conducted in the mukapayung village in 2016 forty two 42 respondents consisting of 26 males and 16 females were selected from eight sub villages of the mukapayung village asia pacific centre for ecohydrology apce internal report 2016 respondents must be over 20 years of age to ensure that they were familiar to water and environmental problems in the mukapayung village the distance of the settlement to the river was one of the factors to be considered in the selection of the respondents figure 11 results of survey shown in figure 12 indicated predominant respondents finished their junior high school 42 9 and followed by senior high school 31 these conditions figure out the capacity of people s literacy respondent s livelihood system mostly are farmer and petty traders with diverse average monthly income predominantly respondent s monthly income more than two million idr approximately us 137 figure 13 since water is main issue within eds expenditure information related water needs will be valuable to be considered this field survey noted that most of the respondents 83 3 spend their money less than idr 250 000 00 for water consumptions including bottled water drinking and daily cooking figure 14 this was probably related to the abundant availability of water resources in mukapayung village dug wells were the main water source in the village represented by 69 respondents while the rest 31 used spring water river basin and its ecosystem were not maintained properly as the river was not a primary water source river was still regarded as a place to discharge any wastes however local people basically have wisdom in managing water to meet their needs as a system based on local wisdom water management has characteristics identity for the community adhesive element across residents and togetherness encouragement as an integrated community sufia et al 2016 sutapa 2019 this condition is a good opportunity to increase community understanding and concern for the management of water ecosystem and its environment based on ecohydrology the variables of socio economic condition consisting of education level monthly income and spending money for water purpose shown to us potential economic capitals of the local people meanwhile their social capitals covering local knowledge related to water issues community self help gotong royong local leadership religion practices need to be considered for eds management in the future combining several these are inevitably in current development practices 3 5 lesson learnt the dynamics of hydrological cycle regulate the amount of water volume in aquatic ecosystems and its availability potentially a limiting factor for primary productivity and vegetation growth development therefore water is one of major driving forces for ecological processes at the catchment scale combining with biological operation to regulate hydrological cycle as well as soil erosion mechanism through evapotranspiration evaporation soil water storage interception rate of soil erosion and sediment material transportation ecohydrology application such as water retention increase erosion rate control water quality improvement will be useful in regulating water circulation eroded soil transportation water quality quantity and availability and floods and drought risk accurate estimation model of hydrological cycle elements is an important tool to understand the functioning and factors regulating biogeochemical cycles of water ecosystem and its environment eds establishment is based on the implementation of three ecohydrological principles it seems important to consider cultural factor as fourth principle in the tropical region first and second principles of ecohydrology focus more on hydrological processes quantification and areas mapping that have potential of water related disasters as well as ecosystem services improvement in this case an online monitoring system and modelling were developed meanwhile third principle was carried out to improve water quality through phytoremediation requiring support of fourth principle in implementation to assure the system run well the eds is a model combining water ecosystem and social aspect in real life of community and their environments it will be working properly if it is developed in particular social economy and cultural context and give possibility to address comprehensively water resources problems in a sustainable manner 4 conclusions and recommendations indonesia is a tropical country with abundant water resources consisting of rivers lakes dams swamps and flood plains high pressure on these natural resources mostly related to anthropogenic activities and climate change tend to increase environmental degradation and water ecosystem deterioration various possible efforts need to be considered in order to overcome water related problems in the future several important findings and recommendations are noted in this study online monitoring system installed in field site was able to record the dynamics of river water in real time and continuously water turbidity in cibitung river increased indicating very high erosion on its watershed land use profile with only 3 6 of forest may probably be the trigger of erosion source on the other hand developed modelling system showed a good performance in predicting cumulative amount of sediment yield per year with high values of nse meanwhile five tested aquatic plants had capability to reduce water pollutants entering in the phytoremediation ponds water turbidity reduction in the ponds of lemna landoltia salvinia pistia and eichhornia reached up to 64 76 68 92 and 88 respectively it seems that sediments stabilization and nutrients uptake may decrease water turbidity water resources management as a system based on local wisdom has different characteristics including identity for the community adhesive element across residents and togetherness encouragement as an integrated community learning from community participation in eds area there are several variables need to be considered main livelihood socio economic characters human and social capital willingness to participate in eds were determined by understanding of eds functions and benefits for community introduction of eds and daily interaction between eds s field staffs and community were key success understanding and taking into account these characteristics will greatly assist ecohydrology concept implementation to support sustainable water resource management around ecohydrology demonstration site in saguling watershed asia pacific is a dynamic region in terms of different aspects population social economy industry environmental pollution and water related disasters culture is an important asset greatly influencing almost all of people activities in this sense implementation of the ecohydrology concept seems to be valuable considering these parameters from learning and capacity building planning executing monitoring assessment and evaluation and follow up of any related activities and program behaviour added values local potency and knowledge and community participation are important parts of culture to be

tended to increase cibitung river water level at watershed outlet from 24 cm at the beginning and reached its peak 260 cm at 17 26 14 as shown in the figure 5 there were two water level peaks consisting of first peak with a 60 cm increase closely related to early stages rainfall 9 4 mm and the second peak relatively caused by the first and second stages of rain combination meanwhile water

to water level lu et al 2014 li et al 2020 hydraulic characteristics streamflow velocity and slope of the river seems to be the main factors making evident relation between water level flow discharge and suspended sediment concentration csermak et al 1987 the sediment content represented by turbidity of river water may reflect erosion level of related watershed area for this reason river water turbidity monitoring is an important tool in managing water resources based on previous recorded data a total of 36 mm rain increased water turbidity in cibitung river from 24 ntu to 3 292 ntu indicating very high erosion on its watershed cibitung watershed land use profile covering 52 1 of dry agricultural cultivation 21 8 of rice fields 14 6 of shrubs 7 7 of settlements and only 3 6 of forest seems to be the main trigger of erosion source forest area generally has different functions of rain interception surface runoff reduction soil moisture storage and water infiltration process soil erosion rate reduction and river water discharge maintenance schwab et al 1981 the magnitude of the suspended sediment load transported by cibitung river will have important implication on natural function of the river system including channel morphology water quality and quantity aquatic ecosystems saguling reservoir capacity 3 2 distributed rainfall runoff sediment model and its aplication one of the activities carried out at the saguling ecohydrology demosite is the development of an ecohydrological modelling system and its application suitable for the asia pacific region the modelling system is designed to have the ability as a tool for quantification simulation prediction projection eco hydrology process understanding scenario based management plan and quantitative assessment of ecosystem carrying capacity and its services the type of model developed is a distributed model type and its formulization based on the interaction and process mechanism of hydrological ecological anthropogenic elements physically based distributed model type the practical use of the model is able to be integrated with remote sensing technology gis and online monitoring system environmental hazards and risks at the demosite location targeted to be assessed and predicted through an ecohydrological modelling system include floods and droughts soil erosion and sedimentation and water quality degradation therefore in the early stages of model development a sub module has been successfully created for simulating the relationship of rainfall surface flow soil erosion and sediment transport processes resulting from erosion processes the model successfully developed for demosite and upper citarum watershed was distributed rainfall runoff sediment model this model consists of hillslope rainfall runoff soil erosion and sediment transport algorithm the rainfall runoff model was based on a kinematic wave approach and simulated three lateral flow mechanisms including subsurface and surface flows tachikawa et al 2004 simulation of soil transport processes was also included in the rainfall runoff model soil detachment processes associated with inter rill and rill erosion were implicitly simulated as raindrop splash and surface flow detachment respectively the concept of sediment transport capacity was used to determine soil detachment or deposition by surface flow in the present work sediment transport capacity was calculated based on unit stream power usp theory apip et al 2011 apip et al 2012 apip et al 2015 the ecological module construction i e water quality erosion control phytotechnology modules will be addressed at the further stage of ecohydrological modelling system development evaluation of model performance for re simulating flow rate and amount of sediment produced was carried out through a process of calibration and validation in the upper citarum watershed with the main inlet of saguling reservoir as outlet point figure 6 as well as using a long term simulation the years 2009 and 2010 were selected as the calibration and validation periods observed daily water discharge and sediment concentration data from nanjung station located at the outlet were used for the model evaluation moreover daily rainfall recorded at 17 stations was used as one of the input data the 90 m hydro topographic data from the hydrosheds product http hydrosheds cr usgs gov was used as another model input comparisons of hydrograph sedigraph and cumulative water and sediment yields between model output and measurement results at nanjung station during the validation period 2010 can be seen in figure 7 using a set of calibrated model parameter rainfall sediment runoff model was run for the validation period the results show that after calibration process the model produced results values and shapes relatively similar to observed hydrograph sedigraph and long term accumulated sediment values then the model performance in predicting cumulative amount of sediment yield per year was evaluated using the nash sutcliff nse efficiency coefficient nash et al 1970 and giving high values of nse for water accumulation and sediment yields 0 96 and 0 92 respectively in this case the model can quantitatively predict sediment yield production relatively similar to observed data at nanjung station around 4 0 5 0 million tons in 2010 in addition to quantifying the amount of water and sediment yields this model could be used to determine the sources of surface runoff soil erosion and deposition which are very important to be known in designing the location and approach for flood erosion and sedimentation controls in the internal watershed following are the results of the model application in the cibitung watershed in which the model had previously been tested in the entire upper citarum watershed the aim is to determine the river flow regime soil erosion and resettling hotspots extreme rainfall data on 7 10 july 2016 on 15 minute time interval was used as one of the main inputs of the model the simulation results figure 8 obtained spatial pattern of river flow regimes top right hotspots of erosion below left and deposition below right sources at internal catchments this information is important and required for identification of mitigation priority locations selection and making technical design of ecotechnology bio engineering 3 3 phytoremediation system for water quality improvement aquatic plants capability to reduce contaminants in waste water was tested in the phytoremediation ponds table 1 summarizes the characteristics of five different waste waters recorded around the demosite mixed waste was regulated to represent a mixture of four types of liquid waste including domestic agricultural sago and river water the concentration of nutrient parameters was no2 0 03 0 05 mg l nh4 0 04 0 06 mg l po4 3 0 02 0 04 mg l and cod 20 30 mg l respectively meanwhile the level of do tds and turbidity were 40 50 mg l 1 5 2 0 mg l and 30 40 ntu respectively floating plants seem to be able to remediate water pollutants by taking up nutrients and other substances in plant biomass irwanto et al reported that ceratophyllum demersum irwanto et al 2017 and lemna minor ugya 2015 can reduce the concentration of heavy metal pb pollutants in waste water up to 75 5 and 81 1 respectively meanwhile eichhornia crassipes may reduce 85 83 and 88 10 of cd and pb concentrations respectively indrasti et al 2006 in lining with these data the aquatic plants in the phytoremediation ponds showed positive response in improving water quality entering to the system figure 9 recorded reduction of water tds and conductivity in the lemna perpusilla and landoltia punctata pools these two parameters are closely related to ions amount accumulated in the water in the other hand it can be observed that lemna s growth was less pronounced than that of landoltia within the first 45 days 2 4 compared to 4 7 in average and landoltia ponds have less conductivity than lemna 0 05 0 07 ms cm and 0 07 0 09 ms cm respectively similar pattern can also be observed in tds data on day 59 it was observed that biomass of landoltia was decreasing 15 this was likely related to the existence of several snails in the pond as a total of 50 gr of new landoltia should be placed in dumbass of the pond water quality improvement due to the presence of different aquatic organisms demonstrate its ability through several mechanisms such as nutrients regulation co2 absorption mixing attenuation and environmental stabilization blindow et al 2002 tokoro et al 2004 chen et al 2007 koch et al 2009 two other aquatic plants showing the capacity to reduce water pollutants were pistia stratiotes and salvinia sp figure 10 shows the faster growth of pistia stratiotes compared to salvinia sp despite their mutual input in opposite way pistia stratiotes reduces conductivity and tds of water more rapidly however its growth rate started to decrease after the pools became too dense and several snails were spotted in the ponds overall pistia stratiotes has highest maximum growth 19 73 and reduced the most electrical conductivity and tds while lowest maximum growth was observed for salvinia sp 3 97 different ways of water turbidity reduction by aquatic vegetation including floating plants consist of water movement decrease reducing sedimentation nepf et al 1999 phytoplankton growth subtraction by nutrients limitation kufel et al 1994 allelochemical substances release wium andersen et al 1982 pool bottom stabilization decreasing resuspended sediment table 2 shows turbidity decreasing trend of five aquatic plants during 64 days lemna and landoltia physically the smallest plants could reduce turbidity most when the input turbidity was at the lowest in day 37 meanwhile salvinia and pistia reduce turbidity most at the peak turbidity input in day 59 turbidity reduction by eichhornia was not as high as that by pistia maximum water turbidity reduction in the ponds of lemna landoltia salvinia pistia and eichhornia were 64 76 68 92 and 88 respectively it seems that sediments stabilization and nutrients uptake may decrease turbidity and increase local penetration of light as reported by van der heide et al van der heide et al 2011 and scheffer scheffer 2004 3 4 understanding of local community social economic and cultural aspect understanding characteristics of local communities around the demosite will greatly assist ecohydrology concept implementation to support sustainable water resource management sutapa et al 2021 the development of eds was expected to be in social and environmental harmony by considering among others their interests on water resources to meet multiple purposes and involving them inclusively during planning construction and implementation of the project the fourth principle of ecohydrology proposed by asia pacific centre for ecohydrology apce views society and its culture as an important factor needs to be integrated comprehensively with the other 3 principles a survey was conducted in the mukapayung village in 2016 forty two 42 respondents consisting of 26 males and 16 females were selected from eight sub villages of the mukapayung village asia pacific centre for ecohydrology apce internal report 2016 respondents must be over 20 years of age to ensure that they were familiar to water and environmental problems in the mukapayung village the distance of the settlement to the river was one of the factors to be considered in the selection of the respondents figure 11 results of survey shown in figure 12 indicated predominant respondents finished their junior high school 42 9 and followed by senior high school 31 these conditions figure out the capacity of people s literacy respondent s livelihood system mostly are farmer and petty traders with diverse average monthly income predominantly respondent s monthly income more than two million idr approximately us 137 figure 13 since water is main issue within eds expenditure information related water needs will be valuable to be considered this field survey noted that most of the respondents 83 3 spend their money less than idr 250 000 00 for water consumptions including bottled water drinking and daily cooking figure 14 this was probably related to the abundant availability of water resources in mukapayung village dug wells were the main water source in the village represented by 69 respondents while the rest 31 used spring water river basin and its ecosystem were not maintained properly as the river was not a primary water source river was still regarded as a place to discharge any wastes however local people basically have wisdom in managing water to meet their needs as a system based on local wisdom water management has characteristics identity for the community adhesive element across residents and togetherness encouragement as an integrated community sufia et al 2016 sutapa 2019 this condition is a good opportunity to increase community understanding and concern for the management of water ecosystem and its environment based on ecohydrology the variables of socio economic condition consisting of education level monthly income and spending money for water purpose shown to us potential economic capitals of the local people meanwhile their social capitals covering local knowledge related to water issues community self help gotong royong local leadership religion practices need to be considered for eds management in the future combining several these are inevitably in current development practices 3 5 lesson learnt the dynamics of hydrological cycle regulate the amount of water volume in aquatic ecosystems and its availability potentially a limiting factor for primary productivity and vegetation growth development therefore water is one of major driving forces for ecological processes at the catchment scale combining with biological operation to regulate hydrological cycle as well as soil erosion mechanism through evapotranspiration evaporation soil water storage interception rate of soil erosion and sediment material transportation ecohydrology application such as water retention increase erosion rate control water quality improvement will be useful in regulating water circulation eroded soil transportation water quality quantity and availability and floods and drought risk accurate estimation model of hydrological cycle elements is an important tool to understand the functioning and factors regulating biogeochemical cycles of water ecosystem and its environment eds establishment is based on the implementation of three ecohydrological principles it seems important to consider cultural factor as fourth principle in the tropical region first and second principles of ecohydrology focus more on hydrological processes quantification and areas mapping that have potential of water related disasters as well as ecosystem services improvement in this case an online monitoring system and modelling were developed meanwhile third principle was carried out to improve water quality through phytoremediation requiring support of fourth principle in implementation to assure the system run well the eds is a model combining water ecosystem and social aspect in real life of community and their environments it will be working properly if it is developed in particular social economy and cultural context and give possibility to address comprehensively water resources problems in a sustainable manner 4 conclusions and recommendations indonesia is a tropical country with abundant water resources consisting of rivers lakes dams swamps and flood plains high pressure on these natural resources mostly related to anthropogenic activities and climate change tend to increase environmental degradation and water ecosystem deterioration various possible efforts need to be considered in order to overcome water related problems in the future several important findings and recommendations are noted in this study online monitoring system installed in field site was able to record the dynamics of river water in real time and continuously water turbidity in cibitung river increased indicating very high erosion on its watershed land use profile with only 3 6 of forest may probably be the trigger of erosion source on the other hand developed modelling system showed a good performance in predicting cumulative amount of sediment yield per year with high values of nse meanwhile five tested aquatic plants had capability to reduce water pollutants entering in the phytoremediation ponds water turbidity reduction in the ponds of lemna landoltia salvinia pistia and eichhornia reached up to 64 76 68 92 and 88 respectively it seems that sediments stabilization and nutrients uptake may decrease water turbidity water resources management as a system based on local wisdom has different characteristics including identity for the community adhesive element across residents and togetherness encouragement as an integrated community learning from community participation in eds area there are several variables need to be considered main livelihood socio economic characters human and social capital willingness to participate in eds were determined by understanding of eds functions and benefits for community introduction of eds and daily interaction between eds s field staffs and community were key success understanding and taking into account these characteristics will greatly assist ecohydrology concept implementation to support sustainable water resource management around ecohydrology demonstration site in saguling watershed asia pacific is a dynamic region in terms of different aspects population social economy industry environmental pollution and water related disasters culture is an important asset greatly influencing almost all of people activities in this sense implementation of the ecohydrology concept seems to be valuable considering these parameters from learning and capacity building planning executing monitoring assessment and evaluation and follow up of any related activities and program behaviour added values local potency and knowledge and community participation are important parts of culture to be

1004,at present low impact development lid faces with problems such as lack of systematic planning immature benefit assessment system and unreasonable index system in order to establish an area allocation optimization evaluation index system this study selects multiple indicators of the rain garden in terms of environmental economic and social benefits analytic hierarchy process is used to determine the weight of each index the study takes a built city as an example and then constructs a regional mike urban model the water volume and water quality control effect under different rain garden layout areas in the built area are simulated and studied to provide data for various indicators according to the 63 years rainfall data in the study area the rainfall of different recurrence periods are designed the environmental economic and social benefits under different recurrence periods are calculated through the proposed evaluation system and then the comprehensive benefits of various schemes are calculated the results show that when the layout area ratio is 4 10 the comprehensive benefit value decreases gradually and so does the reduction rate until a stable interval is reached the optimal area for the layout of the rain garden in the built city is 4 key words urban flooding mike urban rain garden analytic hierarchy process ahp monetization 1 introduction as urbanization accelerates problems such as worsening climate environment loss of rainwater resources and serious runoff pollution have become increasingly prominent the most direct impact is the change in urban land use types which has also changed the hydrological mechanism of the city qin et al 2010 the increase of urban impervious surface an increase of rainfall drainage pressure the rapid increase of runoff and large advancement of the arrival time of the flood peak has caused large losses in rainfall resources and increased risk of waterlogging lee et al 2005 li et al 2014 zalewski et al 2012 at present cities need sustainable development the traditional rainfall discharge model has gradually been eliminated a recent report by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco shows that 4 european cities and 1 region are incorporating water and sanitation into the creation of a broader circular economy the source control concept and low impact development lid model that realizes the harvest and control of rainfall are important subjects li et al 2014 as a simple efficient and landscaped approach to ecological rainfall management lid is characterized by high flexibility multiple functions source control and natural effects as long term monitoring data are difficult to obtain using models to simulate the long term performance of lid has become a research trend liu and cao 2009 zoppou 2001 various models have been developed internationally such as storm water management model swmm info works cs and mike ana and bauwens 2010 from the perspective of the feasibility of simulating lid measures in various development states of the region the mike model is suitable for simulating and analyzing various land use scenarios and lid measures schmitt et al 2004 in china research on and construction of sponge cities is in its infancy although many simulations of lid facilities have been performed few studies have been conducted on the comprehensive benefits and monetization of layout plans for different areas therefore research methods and lid facility layout optimization index system are particularly important in this study a comprehensive benefit evaluation system for lid facilities is constructed the mike urban model is used to simulate the water quantity and water quality control effects of the various layout area ratios in rain gardens in the built city and provide data for each index according to the rainfall data of 63 years in the study area the rainfall in various recurrence periods is designed the environmental economic and social benefits under different recurrence periods are calculated through the proposed evaluation system then comprehensive benefits of different area layout schemes are calculated 2 establishment of comprehensive benefit evaluation system 2 1 objectives and principles of benefit evaluation lid measures have significant effects on mitigating waterlogging and non point source pollution control in urban areas and can effectively improve the urban ecological environment restore the urban hydrology cycle and recharge groundwater lu 2018 establishment a comprehensive benefit evaluation index system can provide a basis for the layout problems encountered in the construction of sponge cities in china this system can be used reasonably and accurately in applying lid measures minimizing unnecessary construction investment maximizing the effect of facilities and reducing the blindness of lid measures in practice the benefits of lid measure involve multiple levels and aspects of environment economy and society and an evaluation index system is the core of comprehensive evaluation the principles of purpose comprehensiveness and independence science and objectivity measurability and operability must be followed to ensure the reliability accuracy and credibility of the evaluation system qi 2013 2 2 selection of evaluation indicators the environmental benefits of sponge city construction refer to its role in promoting the urban ecological environment the environmental benefits are mainly reflected in the control of hydrological environmental pollution flood discharge and waterlogging reduction combined with the characteristics of the mike urban model this study considers two factors water quantity and water quality the water quantity indexes are total runoff reduction rate overflow reduction rate and overload pipe section reduction rate the water quality indicators are load reduction rate for main pollutants ss cod tn and tp the economic benefits of lid measures are first reflected in the reduction of capital construction and maintenance costs a smart growth research report by the brookings institute shows that lid measures can reduce the cost of public infrastructure public service industry and site development by reducing the use of numerous pipelines roads and other high energy infrastructure li 2016 furthermore lid measures can promote the economic benefits of land appreciation and drive the development of other industries the economic benefits of lid measures can be divided into direct and indirect economic benefits the direct benefit is reducing the construction and maintenance costs and the indirect benefit is promoting housing value and driving industrial development saaty 2008 this study mainly considers the construction cost and operation and maintenance cost of lid facilities the social benefits of sponge city construction refer to the promotion of the social environment after the project is completed the meaning of social benefits can be analyzed from multiple perspectives first from a public point of view the construction of a sponge city improves the livability of the city creates a comfortable living and production environment for residents and then improves the welfare and living standards of residents second the construction of the sponge city conveys the concept of sustainable urban development promoting rainfall utilization facilities within the city can improve overall civil literacy third the construction requires labor investment thereby increasing employment opportunities for workers the main indicators include rainfall resource utilization landscape value environmental regulation project destructiveness and public acceptance the present study selects the index of rainfall regeneration and water safety that can be monetized 2 3 benefit index weight in this study analytic hierarchy process ahp is used to weigh the selected indicators ahp is one of the multi criteria decision analysis methods developed by saaty liu 2010 the basic idea is that the evaluator first decomposes the complex problem into several constituent elements and arranges these elements in an orderly hierarchical structure according to the dominant relationship then the relative importance of each element in the hierarchy is determined through comparison the importance of the elements is determined from a comprehensive evaluation value of each one which is the basis of decision making 2 4 monetization of lid benefits evaluation methods for the construction benefits of sponge cities can be divided into two types establishing a benefit evaluation system and calculating benefit monetization based on relevant research worldwide the present study builds a benefit recognition system and monetization calculation method the benefit monetization method has to be related to environmental economics such as the market value alternative market and ecological service value coefficient methods chen et al 2015 the benefits brought by the total runoff control for water volume benefit index adopt the alternative engineering method and the pipeline operation and water treatment are regarded as their substitute tools then the benefit is the saved pipe network operation and water treatment costs in this study the indicators of water efficiency are quantified by alternative engineering method according to the total runoff and the benefits brought by overflow control the benefit calculation formula is as follows 1 b q p 1 p 2 where q is the amount of rainfall reduction m3 p1 is the operating cost of the rainfall pipe network cny m3 and p2 is the water pollution treatment fee cny m3 according to the information the operation cost of the rainfall pipe network in this area is 0 08 cny m3 and the sewage treatment cost is 0 60 cny m3 in the water quality benefit index the benefits of lid measure on reducing pollution load are quantified to obtain environmental pollution treatment benefits the ecological value method is used in calculation according to aquation 2 as follows 2 b q qc pc where q is the reduction amount of each pollutant kg qc is the pollutant equivalent value which is the relative relationship between the pollution hazard of various pollutants and the treatment cost kg and pc is the pollution equivalent collection standard in cny the reduction value of pollutants in stormwater runoff is used as the main environmental benefit evaluation index expressed by the product of the pollutant equivalent value qc and the pollution equivalent collection standard pc each pollution equivalent collection standard pc is 0 7 cny based on the regulations on the collection and use of sewage discharge fees for water pollution the pollution equivalent values of ss cod tn and tp are 4 0 1 0 0 8 and 0 25 kg respectively economic benefits mainly consider construction costs and operation and maintenance costs construction cost includes land cost construction and on site installation related costs which mainly depend on site conditions drainage area size rainfall and land cost in various regions operation and maintenance costs include labor material energy landscape maintenance equipment structure maintenance costs control and related treatment measures and sediment and garbage cleaning fees the specific cost should be determined in accordance with the actual market personnel materials energy and other expenses in the study area the social benefits of this study consider the utilization rate of rainfall regeneration and the calculation of the benefits of rainfall resources utilization uses the shadow price method shadow prices are subjective and more reasonable than exchange prices as no clear market price exists for rainfall a link exists between the market and shadow prices that is the perfect market supports the concept that the market price of goods is equal to the shadow price based on the price of tap water as the shadow price of rainfall the benefit is the product of the amount of reused rainfall and the price of tap water as follows lid or blue green infrastructure can effectively improve health of citizens 3 b q p where q is the amount of reused rainfall m3 and p is the price of tap water cny m3 which is 1 54 cny m3 in xi an in this study the weight of each indicator is determined according to ahp and then the benefit value of each indicator is obtained through the monetization method the weighted sum method is used to weigh and sum the aforementioned benefit values to evaluate the comprehensive benefit value of each lid measure the calculation is as follows 4 y i j 1 n α j y ij where y i is the comprehensive benefit of the i th lid measure layout plan α j is the weight of the j th index and y i j is the monetized benefit value of the j th index of the i th lid measure layout plan according to the preceding formula the comprehensive benefit value of lid measures can be calculated and the layout plan of these measures with higher comprehensive benefit value is the layout plan of lid facilities with improved comprehensive benefits 3 results and discussion a case study on lid benefit system 3 1 construction of mike urban model in study area select the xiying road chanhe area in the old city of xi an as the study area the study area is classified as part of the semi humid monsoon climate zone of the warm temperate zone with northeast wind in winter and southwest wind in summer the research scope of this area from xiying road and xianning east road in the south changle road in the north east second ring road in the west and changtian road and wanshou road in the east the rainfall is moderate and the annual rainfall is 507 720 mm the size of the study area is approximately 7 02 km2 of which the living area accounts for 62 87 the green area accounts for 21 96 the traffic area accounts for 10 73 and the commercial area accounts for 3 33 according to the basic data on the study area mike urban is used to establish 1d drainage network model figure 1 the study area is divided into 129 sub catchment areas according to the city planning and rainfall pipe network maps tyson polygon method is used in dividing the catchment area according to the inspection well in the model 139 pipes are in the drainage pipe network system all pipes are reinforced concrete round pipes with diameter of 500 2500 mm there are 132 inspection well nodes and one river inlet the water quality indicators at each monitoring point in the study area are ss cod tn and tp according to the measured rainfall data the contents of pollutants in natural rainfall in the study area are the following ss 10 33 12 50 mg l cod 7 68 10 22 mg l tn 0 3 0 62 mg l and tp 0 02 0 13 mg l the ss cod tn and tp of the roof in the contaminant background content of each underlying surface in the study area are 151 170 6 6 and 1 4 mg l respectively those of the road are 200 121 14 6 and 1 2 mg l and those of green space are 121 129 9 7 and 0 51 mg l according to parameter sensitivity analysis the main parameters that affect the water volume results are impervious rate and the water quality parameter is mainly attenuation coefficient the model water volume and water quality ratio are determined by 20170830 storm and the impervious rates of greening residential traffic and commerce are determined as 21 70 16 33 and 78 41 respectively the attenuation coefficients of the pollutant indicators cod ss tn and tp are 0 843 0 661 0 540 and 0 391 respectively the water volume is determined according to the depth of the 2d simulation and calculated value and its r2 value is 0 90 the simulated and measured values of the four pollutant indicators for water quality have a minimum ens of 0 76 and r2 is higher than 0 83 figure 2 the verification process still selects the simulation results of the r2 and ens evaluation models the rainfall dataset 20170927 was selected to simulate the flooding of the study area under the rainfall event the verification results are good and the correlation coefficient r2 between the simulated maximum water depth and calculated value in the waterlogged area is 0 84 the minimum ens value of the pollutant index is 0 69 and r2 is higher than 0 79 which shows that the model of the built study area has good reliability and stability 3 2 index weight determination based on the characteristics of local urban waterlogging non point source pollution rainfall utilization lid facility construction and operating costs this study established a sponge city evaluation index system figure 3 and obtained the original scores of various indicators through expert questionnaire surveys chen et al 2015 phua and minowa 2005 then the weight of each indicator table 1 2 3 and 4 is calculated through the pairwise comparison matrix operation in order to ensure the reliability of the analytic hierarchy process the consistency ratio cr was calculated and the consistency of the expert judgment on the index score is checked ishizaka and siraj 2018 jaiswal et al 2014 the index weights are shown in table 5 3 3 scene setting the specific division standard for the intensity of rainfall classification according to meteorological department is presented in table 6 based on the 24 hour rainfall in the rainfall scale table the rainfall data of the study area from 1951 to 2013 were analyzed during the 63 year period the study area had 8 501 days of rain the proportions of light moderate heavy rain intense fall rainstorm and torrential rain are 50 2 10 0 2 8 0 5 0 01 and 36 5 respectively figure 4 scholars have proposed various methods to establish short duration rain and rain patterns such as the chicago and huff rain patterns and others include the asymmetric triangle and scs rain patterns the chicago rain pattern proposed by keifer et al 1978 is generally used for short duration design of rain pattern allocation this a synthetic method of unsteady rainfall is based on the storm intensity formula and rain peak coefficient the present study uses the chicago rain pattern to design rainfall refers to the value of the rain peak coefficient to determine 0 4 as the design storm rain peak coefficient according to the rainfall classification table and the 63 year rainfall data in the study area the following 4 rainfalls were designed for simulation in this study 2 hour rainfall duration for 1 year recurrence interval 2 hour rainfall duration for 2 year recurrence interval 24 hour rainfall duration for 20 year recurrence interval and 24 hour rainfall duration for 50 year recurrence interval the formula for designing rainstorm intensity in the study area is 5 q 2785 833 1 1 658 lg p t 16 813 0 9302 where q is the design rainstorm intensity l s hm2 p is the design recurrence period and t is the rainfall duration min it can be calculated according to the formula of the intensity of rainstorm 20 708 mm rainfall for 1 year recurrence interval to present light and moderate rain 31 04 mm rainfall for 2 year recurrence interval to present heavy rain 86 85 mm rainfall for 20 year recurrence interval to present intense fall and 105 00 mm rainfall for 50 year recurrence interval to present rainstorm and torrential rain according to the simulation results of these four designed rainfalls the comprehensive benefit value of one year under different layout ratios of rain gardens in the built city is analyzed the mike urban model was used to simulate the reduction of water volume and pollutants in different areas of the rain garden in the study area under different rainfall periods node overflow refers to the total surface runoff which is responsible for the full flow of the drainage pipeline in this area and the total volume of rainfall collected at the node saaty 2008 the simulation results are shown in table 7 the number of overflow points reduction rate of overflow runoff and discharge flow are shown in figure 5 the results show the following when the design rainfall is 1a with the increase of the rain garden layout area 1 10 the reduction rate of the number of overflow points increased from 30 36 to 100 the reduction rate of overflow increased from 36 78 to 93 52 the discharge reduction rate increased from 41 56 to 88 08 and the runoff reduction rate increased from 30 36 to 90 48 when the design rainfall is 2a with the increase of the rain garden layout area the overflow indicates that the number reduction rate increased from 18 75 to 85 94 the overflow reduction rate increased from 28 91 to 84 64 the outlet flow reduction rate increased from 1 32 to 64 78 and the runoff reduction rate increased from 27 79 to 74 65 when the design rainfall is 20a with the increase of the rain garden layout area the reduction rate of the number of overflow points increased from 16 46 to 65 82 the reduction rate of overflow increased from 26 76

1004,at present low impact development lid faces with problems such as lack of systematic planning immature benefit assessment system and unreasonable index system in order to establish an area allocation optimization evaluation index system this study selects multiple indicators of the rain garden in terms of environmental economic and social benefits analytic hierarchy process is used to determine the weight of each index the study takes a built city as an example and then constructs a regional mike urban model the water volume and water quality control effect under different rain garden layout areas in the built area are simulated and studied to provide data for various indicators according to the 63 years rainfall data in the study area the rainfall of different recurrence periods are designed the environmental economic and social benefits under different recurrence periods are calculated through the proposed evaluation system and then the comprehensive benefits of various schemes are calculated the results show that when the layout area ratio is 4 10 the comprehensive benefit value decreases gradually and so does the reduction rate until a stable interval is reached the optimal area for the layout of the rain garden in the built city is 4 key words urban flooding mike urban rain garden analytic hierarchy process ahp monetization 1 introduction as urbanization accelerates problems such as worsening climate environment loss of rainwater resources and serious runoff pollution have become increasingly prominent the most direct impact is the change in urban land use types which has also changed the hydrological mechanism of the city qin et al 2010 the increase of urban impervious surface an increase of rainfall drainage pressure the rapid increase of runoff and large advancement of the arrival time of the flood peak has caused large losses in rainfall resources and increased risk of waterlogging lee et al 2005 li et al 2014 zalewski et al 2012 at present cities need sustainable development the traditional rainfall discharge model has gradually been eliminated a recent report by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco shows that 4 european cities and 1 region are incorporating water and sanitation into the creation of a broader circular economy the source control concept and low impact development lid model that realizes the harvest and control of rainfall are important subjects li et al 2014 as a simple efficient and landscaped approach to ecological rainfall management lid is characterized by high flexibility multiple functions source control and natural effects as long term monitoring data are difficult to obtain using models to simulate the long term performance of lid has become a research trend liu and cao 2009 zoppou 2001 various models have been developed internationally such as storm water management model swmm info works cs and mike ana and bauwens 2010 from the perspective of the feasibility of simulating lid measures in various development states of the region the mike model is suitable for simulating and analyzing various land use scenarios and lid measures schmitt et al 2004 in china research on and construction of sponge cities is in its infancy although many simulations of lid facilities have been performed few studies have been conducted on the comprehensive benefits and monetization of layout plans for different areas therefore research methods and lid facility layout optimization index system are particularly important in this study a comprehensive benefit evaluation system for lid facilities is constructed the mike urban model is used to simulate the water quantity and water quality control effects of the various layout area ratios in rain gardens in the built city and provide data for each index according to the rainfall data of 63 years in the study area the rainfall in various recurrence periods is designed the environmental economic and social benefits under different recurrence periods are calculated through the proposed evaluation system then comprehensive benefits of different area layout schemes are calculated 2 establishment of comprehensive benefit evaluation system 2 1 objectives and principles of benefit evaluation lid measures have significant effects on mitigating waterlogging and non point source pollution control in urban areas and can effectively improve the urban ecological environment restore the urban hydrology cycle and recharge groundwater lu 2018 establishment a comprehensive benefit evaluation index system can provide a basis for the layout problems encountered in the construction of sponge cities in china this system can be used reasonably and accurately in applying lid measures minimizing unnecessary construction investment maximizing the effect of facilities and reducing the blindness of lid measures in practice the benefits of lid measure involve multiple levels and aspects of environment economy and society and an evaluation index system is the core of comprehensive evaluation the principles of purpose comprehensiveness and independence science and objectivity measurability and operability must be followed to ensure the reliability accuracy and credibility of the evaluation system qi 2013 2 2 selection of evaluation indicators the environmental benefits of sponge city construction refer to its role in promoting the urban ecological environment the environmental benefits are mainly reflected in the control of hydrological environmental pollution flood discharge and waterlogging reduction combined with the characteristics of the mike urban model this study considers two factors water quantity and water quality the water quantity indexes are total runoff reduction rate overflow reduction rate and overload pipe section reduction rate the water quality indicators are load reduction rate for main pollutants ss cod tn and tp the economic benefits of lid measures are first reflected in the reduction of capital construction and maintenance costs a smart growth research report by the brookings institute shows that lid measures can reduce the cost of public infrastructure public service industry and site development by reducing the use of numerous pipelines roads and other high energy infrastructure li 2016 furthermore lid measures can promote the economic benefits of land appreciation and drive the development of other industries the economic benefits of lid measures can be divided into direct and indirect economic benefits the direct benefit is reducing the construction and maintenance costs and the indirect benefit is promoting housing value and driving industrial development saaty 2008 this study mainly considers the construction cost and operation and maintenance cost of lid facilities the social benefits of sponge city construction refer to the promotion of the social environment after the project is completed the meaning of social benefits can be analyzed from multiple perspectives first from a public point of view the construction of a sponge city improves the livability of the city creates a comfortable living and production environment for residents and then improves the welfare and living standards of residents second the construction of the sponge city conveys the concept of sustainable urban development promoting rainfall utilization facilities within the city can improve overall civil literacy third the construction requires labor investment thereby increasing employment opportunities for workers the main indicators include rainfall resource utilization landscape value environmental regulation project destructiveness and public acceptance the present study selects the index of rainfall regeneration and water safety that can be monetized 2 3 benefit index weight in this study analytic hierarchy process ahp is used to weigh the selected indicators ahp is one of the multi criteria decision analysis methods developed by saaty liu 2010 the basic idea is that the evaluator first decomposes the complex problem into several constituent elements and arranges these elements in an orderly hierarchical structure according to the dominant relationship then the relative importance of each element in the hierarchy is determined through comparison the importance of the elements is determined from a comprehensive evaluation value of each one which is the basis of decision making 2 4 monetization of lid benefits evaluation methods for the construction benefits of sponge cities can be divided into two types establishing a benefit evaluation system and calculating benefit monetization based on relevant research worldwide the present study builds a benefit recognition system and monetization calculation method the benefit monetization method has to be related to environmental economics such as the market value alternative market and ecological service value coefficient methods chen et al 2015 the benefits brought by the total runoff control for water volume benefit index adopt the alternative engineering method and the pipeline operation and water treatment are regarded as their substitute tools then the benefit is the saved pipe network operation and water treatment costs in this study the indicators of water efficiency are quantified by alternative engineering method according to the total runoff and the benefits brought by overflow control the benefit calculation formula is as follows 1 b q p 1 p 2 where q is the amount of rainfall reduction m3 p1 is the operating cost of the rainfall pipe network cny m3 and p2 is the water pollution treatment fee cny m3 according to the information the operation cost of the rainfall pipe network in this area is 0 08 cny m3 and the sewage treatment cost is 0 60 cny m3 in the water quality benefit index the benefits of lid measure on reducing pollution load are quantified to obtain environmental pollution treatment benefits the ecological value method is used in calculation according to aquation 2 as follows 2 b q qc pc where q is the reduction amount of each pollutant kg qc is the pollutant equivalent value which is the relative relationship between the pollution hazard of various pollutants and the treatment cost kg and pc is the pollution equivalent collection standard in cny the reduction value of pollutants in stormwater runoff is used as the main environmental benefit evaluation index expressed by the product of the pollutant equivalent value qc and the pollution equivalent collection standard pc each pollution equivalent collection standard pc is 0 7 cny based on the regulations on the collection and use of sewage discharge fees for water pollution the pollution equivalent values of ss cod tn and tp are 4 0 1 0 0 8 and 0 25 kg respectively economic benefits mainly consider construction costs and operation and maintenance costs construction cost includes land cost construction and on site installation related costs which mainly depend on site conditions drainage area size rainfall and land cost in various regions operation and maintenance costs include labor material energy landscape maintenance equipment structure maintenance costs control and related treatment measures and sediment and garbage cleaning fees the specific cost should be determined in accordance with the actual market personnel materials energy and other expenses in the study area the social benefits of this study consider the utilization rate of rainfall regeneration and the calculation of the benefits of rainfall resources utilization uses the shadow price method shadow prices are subjective and more reasonable than exchange prices as no clear market price exists for rainfall a link exists between the market and shadow prices that is the perfect market supports the concept that the market price of goods is equal to the shadow price based on the price of tap water as the shadow price of rainfall the benefit is the product of the amount of reused rainfall and the price of tap water as follows lid or blue green infrastructure can effectively improve health of citizens 3 b q p where q is the amount of reused rainfall m3 and p is the price of tap water cny m3 which is 1 54 cny m3 in xi an in this study the weight of each indicator is determined according to ahp and then the benefit value of each indicator is obtained through the monetization method the weighted sum method is used to weigh and sum the aforementioned benefit values to evaluate the comprehensive benefit value of each lid measure the calculation is as follows 4 y i j 1 n α j y ij where y i is the comprehensive benefit of the i th lid measure layout plan α j is the weight of the j th index and y i j is the monetized benefit value of the j th index of the i th lid measure layout plan according to the preceding formula the comprehensive benefit value of lid measures can be calculated and the layout plan of these measures with higher comprehensive benefit value is the layout plan of lid facilities with improved comprehensive benefits 3 results and
