10335,a calibrated swat model equipped with an improved auto irrigation function was used to evaluate the impacts of agricultural production practices on water balances and crop yields of corn sorghum and winter wheat for the palo duro watershed located in the texas high plains thp fourteen scenarios were simulated including alternative irrigation application depths of 12 7 mm and 38 1 mm for irrigated corn sorghum and wheat and with different planting dates for irrigated corn sorghum wheat and dryland wheat results indicated the greater irrigation depth 38 1 mm led to reductions in seasonal irrigation requirements and crop evapotranspiration etc when compared to the baseline scenarios using an irrigation depth of 25 4 mm for corn sorghum and wheat however soil water content surface runoff and percolation were increased the opposite was observed for simulations of the same hydrologic variables but with an irrigation depth of 12 7 mm crop yields associated with the alternative irrigation depths were similar to those achieved with the baseline delayed planting of corn and sorghum resulted in the decrease of all the studied hydrologic parameters relative to the baseline by contrast the early planting scenarios showed the increase in those variables generally simulated corn yields were relatively stable but a 3 7 reduction in irrigated sorghum yield was found with late planting notably the early planting of wheat resulted in a clear increase in both irrigated and dryland yields of 11 2 and 13 5 respectively however the yields of irrigated and dryland wheat were reduced by 28 8 and 2 7 respectively for the late planting these findings suggest the greater irrigation application depth is promising for maintaining crop yields and reducing groundwater use

providing supplemental irrigation however in the majority of the southern ogallala aquifer region well capacities have declined to the extent that they are not sufficient to meet full irrigation

irrigation application depth of 31 8 mm 1 5 in compared to a conventional irrigation depth of 25 4 mm 1 in at bushland texas they found that reductions in seasonal irrigation requirements associated with greater irrigation application depths are greatest under incomplete canopy conditions of the early crop development the potential for evaporative losses from soil is greater with lesser more frequent irrigation applications however seasonal irrigation reductions associated with changes in irrigation depths are dependent upon crop type soil properties and regional climate in the semi arid

and harvested in the middle of october winter wheat is seeded in mid october and harvested around the end of june early planting of crops may provide an opportunity to take advantage of early season rainfall during wet years the primary benefit of early planting is an increased overall growing period and earlier harvest of a drier yield on a larger portion of the total acreage lauer 2000 however

to assess the bmps on water conservation and crop production in the palo duro watershed the objectives of this study were to 1 assess the impacts of irrigation application depths on water conservation for corn sorghum and winter wheat in the intensively irrigated palo duro watershed and 2 evaluate the effects of alternative planting dates on water cycle and crop production of irrigated corn irrigated sorghum and both irrigated and dryland winter wheat 2 materials and methods 2 1 study watershed the palo duro watershed drainage area of 2600 km2 is located within the counties of hartley moore hutchinson hansford and sherman in the semi arid thp fig 1 the watershed has a relatively flat terrain 905 1208 m above mean sea level the major land uses are irrigated corn irrigated sorghum and dual purpose winter wheat under both irrigation and dryland conditions which account for 15 6 and 34 respectively of the entire watershed area fig 1 the predominant soil types are sherm silty clay loam soil fine mixed mesic torrertic paleustolls and sunray loam soil fine silty mixed superactive mesic calcidic paleustolls which account for 60 and 11 respectively of the total watershed area soil survey staff 2014 fig 1 daily climate data from 1995 to 2014 were obtained from three research grade weather stations adjacent to or within the study watershed marek et al 2010 2 2 an improved swat model the swat model version 2012 10 2 19 and revision 664 for arcgis 10 2 2 platform was used in this study an extensively tested mad auto irrigation function chen et al 2018 was used to simulate irrigation for the irrigated land uses in the palo duro watershed the mad auto irrigation method triggers irrigation according to a user defined allowable depletion percentage of plant available water determined by maximum crop rooting depth and soil characteristics the entire simulation period was from 1995 to 2014 the swat mad warm up calibration and validation periods for streamflow simulations were 1995 1999 2000 2006 and 2007 2014 respectively the swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup 2012 with the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2007 were

design the primary management practices of irrigated corn irrigated sorghum irrigated winter wheat and dryland winter wheat under the baseline scenario in the palo duro watershed are listed in table 3 for the best management scenario design fourteen scenarios were simulated in this study including the alternative irrigation application depths of 12 7 mm 0 5 in and 38 1 mm 1 5 in per application for irrigated corn sorghum and winter wheat and alternative planting dates of early planting a half month ahead and late planting a half month delay for irrigated corn irrigated sorghum irrigated winter wheat and dryland winter wheat table 4 it is worth noting that the harvest dates were adjusted accordingly with respect to the planting dates table 4 the different irrigation application depths represent associated irrigation management by local producers in this semi arid thp due to the various well capacities and soil water holding capacities the alternative planting dates cover the typical planting periods used by local producers 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated average annual water balances under the alternative irrigation depths of corn sorghum and winter wheat swat mad simulations using alternative irrigation application depths of 12 7 mm 0 5 in and 38 1 mm 1 5 in low and high regional well capacities respectively showed that the seasonal corn irrigation requirements were 6 6 larger for the 12 7 mm application depth compared to the baseline 25 4 mm irrigation depth however a 3 1 lower of seasonal corn irrigation requirement was observed for the irrigation depth of 31 8 mm relative to the baseline table 5 marek et al 2020 also found a 2 3 decrease in corn irrigation requirement when using an irrigation application depth of 31 8 mm compared to an irrigation depth of 25 4 mm in the texas panhandle similar results were found for the irrigated sorghum scenarios with a 10 4 increase and a 5 1 decrease in seasonal sorghum irrigation requirement for irrigation application depths of 12 7 and 38 1 mm respectively table 5 the clear difference in irrigation frequency was the major reason to cause the various irrigation requirements using a smaller application depth such as 12 7 mm for corn resulted in an increased irrigation frequency 35 applications vs 16 applications for irrigation depths of 12 7 and 25 4 mm to fully satisfy crop evapotranspiration etc requirements and increased evaporative losses associated with irrigation events the increased irrigation requirements of the 12 7 mm irrigation depth resulted in the increased etc of 4 under both the irrigated corn and irrigated sorghum land uses decreasing the irrigation application depth could increase the number of events required to supplement the seasonal water needs and subject the water application to additional canopy water losses mekonentiku and singh 2019 in addition soil water evaporation losses are greater from the irrigation events during the early and late seasons when the crop canopy is absent or reduced rogers et al 2017 however the reductions in soil water content surface runoff percolation and water yield were 2 0 5 1 65 5 and 5 2 respectively for the irrigated corn with the 12 7 mm irrigation depth compared to the baseline table 5 those values were 3 5 4 3 72 5 and 4 3 for the irrigated sorghum with the irrigation depth 12 7 mm table 5 it is intuitive that the lower irrigation depth amount can lead to relatively lower runoff and percolation however opposite results were found for those hydrologic parameters under both the summer crops of irrigated corn and irrigated sorghum with the irrigation depth of 38 1 mm table 5 even though the irrigation application depths caused a marked change in hydrologic parameters the crop yields of corn and sorghum had almost no change under the alternative adequate irrigation management as for the irrigated winter wheat the same change trend was observed for the hydrologic variables the higher irrigation depth 38 1 mm indicated 6 6 and 2 6 reductions in seasonal irrigation and etc when compared to the baseline table 5 however the increase in soil water content surface runoff percolation and water yield were 2 3 2 5 32 8 and 2 6 respectively for the irrigated winter wheat with the irrigation depth of 38 1 mm the lower irrigation depth 12 7 mm denoted that the increase in seasonal irrigation requirement and etc were 12 1 and 4 8 while the soil water content surface runoff percolation and water yield were decreased by 3 5 4 3 72 5 and 4 3 table 5 carefoot and major 1994 also reported that the higher irrigation water use of soft white wheat was found in the light and frequent irrigation treatment than the conventional irrigation treatment in the higher water stress years of 1988 and 1989 in the semi arid climate of southern alberta canada no apparent change in winter wheat yield was found with the alternative irrigation application depths therefore there is a potential for maintaining crop yields and reducing groundwater mining from the ogallala aquifer when using a greater irrigation application depth 3 2 simulated average monthly hydrologic cycle under the alternative irrigation application depths for corn sorghum and winter wheat the monthly analysis showed the peak irrigation and etc occurred in july under the irrigated corn land use in the palo duro watershed corresponding to a relatively lower rainfall during the vegetative growth period fig 2a c the valley of the soil water content was also shown in july the higher irrigation application depth for corn resulted in relatively larger percentage reductions in irrigation requirement and etc by 10 and 20 in may and 5 and 4 in october when compared to the baseline however the decreased irrigation depth resulted in the increase of irrigation requirement and etc by 32 and 22 in may and 15 and 6 in september fig 2b d the monthly soil water content consistently decreased under the irrigated corn with the irrigation depth of 38 1 mm relative to the baseline by contrast the irrigated corn with the irrigation depth of 12 7 mm maintained a higher soil water content compared to the baseline fig 2e f nevertheless the changes in soil water content were within 4 under the alternative irrigation application depths in the study region sorghum was usually planted a half month later than corn according to local field experiments therefore results found the peak irrigation and etc shift to august or from july to august under the irrigated sorghum land use fig 3a c the trough of the soil water content was from july to september under the irrigated sorghum scenario using the irrigation depth of 12 7 mm the increase in irrigation requirement and etc were 50 and 20 in june and 13 and 7 in september relative to the baseline however using the greater irrigation depth the decreases in irrigation requirement and etc were 24 and 6 in june fig 3b d the same trend observed for irrigated corn for monthly soil water content was identified for irrigated sorghum with a change that ranged from 6 to 6 fig 3e f regarding the winter crop october to june of the irrigated winter wheat the peak irrigation and etc and minimum soil water content were all observed in may fig 4a c e in the study watershed the monthly precipitation during the winter wheat major growing period march to may is generally low 40 mm which requires high irrigation inputs 30 80 mm apparent increases in irrigation requirement and etc were found for each month from january to june under the lower irrigation application depth relative to the baseline decreases of irrigation requirement and etc were detected from february to june for the high irrigation depth fig 4a c the monthly soil water content was increased from 2 to 6 and decreased from 2 5 to 6 for the low and high irrigation depths respectively fig 4f 3 3 impacts of alternative planting dates of irrigated corn and sorghum on water cycle simulated irrigation requirements increased by 2 8 and 4 3 with early planting of corn and sorghum relative to the baseline corn and sorghum respectively table 6 however the late planting resulted in the decrease of corn and sorghum irrigation requirements by 6 1 and 2 6 these reductions coincided with the increase of seasonal rainfall with the delayed planting date in the thp figs 5 and 6 the reductions in irrigation requirements with late planting of corn and sorghum led to the decrease of all the studied hydrologic parameters table 6 however the early planting scenarios showed an increase in those hydrologic variables except for the negligible decrease in the absolute value of percolation simulated corn yields were relatively stable in this study however a 3 7 reduction in irrigated sorghum yield was found using the delayed planting date table 6 baumhardt and howell 2006 and allen and musick 1993 all found late planted sorghum with adequate irrigation led to a decrease in yield compared to the conventional and early planting dates at bushland tx sorghum requires less seasonal irrigation compared to corn 264 vs 417 mm in this study in the thp therefore the earlier planting of sorghum might be appropriate in maintaining yield while late planting of corn could be selected in view of water conservation the early planting of corn indicated an increase of irrigation required compared to the baseline from may to july and the decrease of irrigation required in august and september fig 5a the opposite was found for the late planting of corn the same trend was detected for monthly corn etc when using the alternative planting dates fig 5c generally the late planted corn had lower monthly soil water content compared to the baseline fig 5e f the patterns of monthly irrigation required and etc for the late planting of sorghum exhibited a one month shift toward the late season relative to the baseline fig 6a c etc from irrigated crops was affected strongly by the dynamic environmental conditions in the thp hao et al 2015 generally the monthly corn etc was greater than sorghum etc in this study which was mainly due to the longer growing season of corn and perhaps lower canopy resistance howell et al 1997 the early planting of sorghum kept a higher monthly soil water content compared to the baseline and late planting of sorghum fig 6e f 3 4 effects of different planting dates of both irrigated and dryland winter wheat on water dynamics the early planting of winter wheat increased average annual irrigation requirement and etc by 18 7 and 7 3 relative to the baseline while it reduced surface runoff soil water content percolation and water yield by 11 6 19 8 76 2 and 11 5 respectively table 7 the changes in irrigation requirement etc surface runoff soil water content percolation and water yield were 36 6 14 1 51 2 5 2 27 5 and 5 1 respectively for the late planting of winter wheat the water balance assessments under the dryland winter wheat hrus indicated a comparison for which precipitation was the only source of water input a decrease in all the studied hydrologic parameters was found for the early planting of winter wheat table 7 however an increase in the hydrologic variables was observed for the late planting of winter wheat except for a slight reduction in etc 0 4 regarding the winter wheat yield the early planting resulted in the clear increase in both irrigated and dryland yields of 11 2 and 13 5 table 7 nevertheless the yield of irrigated winter wheat was reduced by 28 8 for the late planting and the yield of dryland wheat was reduced by 2 7 for the late planting the current irrigation management of winter wheat in the palo duro watershed had a lower seasonal irrigation requirement 218 mm compared to irrigated corn and sorghum 417 mm and 264 mm dual purpose winter wheat production in the commercial fields of the thp is commonly not well managed compared to the research fields actually winter wheat in the commercial fields typically is not sufficiently irrigated as the net return does not offset the costs of management inputs marek et al 2018 information from growers also indicated a more than 30 reduction in irrigation water use for the deficit irrigated winter wheat compared to the irrigated corn in the thp texas water development board 2011 therefore to maintain or increase winter wheat yield a suitable early planting date may be warranted in the region when compared to the irrigated winter wheat of the baseline there is a considerable increase in monthly irrigation requirement and etc from january to may for the early planting of winter wheat fig 7a b c d however the monthly soil water content was reduced in each month for the early planting fig 7e f under the dryland management apparent changes in etc were observed in april 13 4 increase and november 29 7 decrease for the late planting of winter wheat relative to the baseline fig 8a b clear changes of etc were found in february 21 7 decrease and october 43 4 increase for the early planting of dryland winter wheat the monthly soil water content increased from 16 to 45 for the late planting of dryland winter wheat while the soil water content decreased from 7 to 27 for the early planting of dryland winter wheat fig 8c d 4 conclusions evaluations of the watershed scale agricultural production practices on the water cycle and crop yields are deemed critical for informing and implementing relevant strategies for agricultural bmps assessments from this study explored some potential bmps for water conservation and sustainable crop production in the semi arid thp using the swat mad model simulation results indicated using a small irrigation application depth for corn sorghum and winter wheat resulted in increased irrigation frequencies and seasonal requirements corresponding increases in etc were also considerable by contrast the high irrigation application depth for corn sorghum and winter wheat showed a water saving effect without influencing the crop yields in the irrigated hrus in the palo duro watershed the auto irrigation function was used to simulate the local irrigation management practices which partially emphasized the differences in water requirements of corn sorghum and winter wheat results found that the decreasing order of the baseline irrigation requirement was corn sorghum and winter wheat with seasonal irrigation requirements of 417 mm 264 mm and 218 mm respectively therefore more attention should be given for water conservation under corn land use high irrigation application depth and late planting for corn could support groundwater conservation however early planting of irrigated sorghum irrigated winter wheat dryland winter wheat might be considered for maintaining or enhancing crop yields in the texas panhandle growers should keep in mind that too early or too late planting dates may influence crop insurance coverage declaration of

irrigation requirement and etc were 12 1 and 4 8 while the soil water content surface runoff percolation and water yield were decreased by 3 5 4 3 72 5 and 4 3 table 5 carefoot and major 1994 also reported that the higher irrigation water use of soft white wheat was found in the light and frequent irrigation treatment than the conventional irrigation treatment in the higher water stress years of 1988 and 1989 in the semi arid climate of southern alberta canada no apparent change in winter wheat yield was found with the alternative irrigation application depths therefore there is a potential for maintaining crop yields and reducing groundwater mining from the ogallala aquifer when using a greater irrigation application depth 3 2 simulated average monthly hydrologic cycle under the alternative irrigation application depths for corn sorghum and winter wheat the monthly analysis showed the peak irrigation and etc occurred in july under the irrigated corn land use in the palo duro watershed corresponding to a relatively lower rainfall during the vegetative growth period fig 2a c the valley of the soil water content was also shown in july the higher irrigation application depth for corn resulted in relatively larger percentage reductions in irrigation requirement and etc by 10 and 20 in may and 5 and 4 in october when compared to the baseline however the decreased irrigation depth resulted in the increase of irrigation requirement and etc by 32 and 22 in may and 15 and 6 in september fig 2b d the monthly soil water content consistently decreased under the irrigated corn with the irrigation depth of 38 1 mm relative to the baseline by contrast the irrigated corn with the irrigation depth of 12 7 mm maintained a higher soil water content compared to the baseline fig 2e f nevertheless the changes in soil water content were within 4 under the alternative irrigation application depths in the study region sorghum was usually planted a half month later than corn according to local field experiments therefore results found the peak irrigation and etc shift to august or from july to august under the irrigated sorghum land use fig 3a c the trough of the soil water content was from july to september under the irrigated sorghum scenario using the irrigation depth of 12 7 mm the increase in irrigation requirement and etc were 50 and 20 in june and 13 and 7 in september relative to the baseline however using the greater irrigation depth the decreases in irrigation requirement and etc were 24 and 6 in june fig 3b d the same trend observed for irrigated corn for monthly soil water content was identified for irrigated sorghum with a change that ranged from 6 to 6 fig 3e f regarding the winter crop october to june of the irrigated winter wheat the peak irrigation and etc and minimum soil water content were all observed in may fig 4a c e in the study watershed the monthly precipitation during the winter wheat major growing period march to may is generally low 40 mm which requires high irrigation inputs 30 80 mm apparent increases in irrigation requirement and etc were found for each month from january to june under the lower irrigation application depth relative to the baseline decreases of irrigation requirement and etc were detected from february to june for the high irrigation depth fig 4a c the monthly soil water content was increased from 2 to 6 and decreased from 2 5 to 6 for the low and high irrigation depths respectively fig 4f 3 3 impacts of alternative planting dates of irrigated corn and sorghum on water cycle simulated irrigation requirements increased by 2 8 and 4 3 with early planting of corn and sorghum relative to the baseline corn and sorghum respectively table 6 however the late planting resulted in the decrease of corn and sorghum irrigation requirements by 6 1 and 2 6 these reductions coincided with the increase of seasonal rainfall with the delayed planting date in the thp figs 5 and 6 the reductions in irrigation requirements with late planting of corn and sorghum led to the decrease of all the studied hydrologic parameters table 6 however the early planting scenarios showed an increase in those hydrologic variables except for the negligible decrease in the absolute value of percolation simulated corn yields were relatively stable in this study however a 3 7 reduction in irrigated sorghum yield was found using the delayed planting date table 6 baumhardt and howell 2006 and allen and musick 1993 all found late planted sorghum with adequate irrigation led to a decrease in yield compared to the conventional and early planting dates at bushland tx sorghum requires less seasonal irrigation compared to corn 264 vs 417 mm in this study in the thp therefore the earlier planting of sorghum might be appropriate in maintaining yield while late planting of corn could be selected in view of water conservation the early planting of corn indicated an increase of irrigation required compared to the baseline from may to july and the decrease of irrigation required in august and september fig 5a the opposite was found for the late planting of corn the same trend was detected for monthly corn etc when using the alternative planting dates fig 5c generally the late planted corn had lower monthly soil water content compared to the baseline fig 5e f the patterns of monthly irrigation required and etc for the late planting of sorghum exhibited a one month shift toward the late season relative to the baseline fig 6a c etc from irrigated crops was affected strongly by the dynamic environmental conditions in the thp hao et al 2015 generally the monthly corn etc was greater than sorghum etc in this study which was mainly due to the longer growing season of corn and perhaps lower canopy resistance howell et al 1997 the early planting of sorghum kept a higher monthly soil water content compared to the baseline and late planting of sorghum fig 6e f 3 4 effects of different planting dates of both irrigated and dryland winter wheat on water dynamics the early planting of winter wheat increased average annual irrigation requirement and etc by 18 7 and 7 3 relative to the baseline while it reduced surface runoff soil water content percolation and water yield by 11 6 19 8 76 2 and 11 5 respectively table 7 the changes in irrigation requirement etc surface runoff soil water content percolation and water yield were 36 6 14 1 51 2 5 2 27 5 and 5 1 respectively for the late planting of winter wheat the water balance assessments under the dryland winter wheat hrus indicated a comparison for which precipitation was the only source of water input a decrease in all the studied hydrologic parameters was found for the early planting of winter wheat table 7 however an increase in the hydrologic variables was observed for the late planting of winter wheat except for a slight reduction in etc 0 4 regarding the winter wheat yield the early planting resulted in the clear increase in both irrigated and dryland yields of 11 2 and 13 5 table 7 nevertheless the yield of irrigated winter wheat was reduced by 28 8 for the late planting and the yield of dryland wheat was reduced by 2 7 for the late planting the current irrigation management of winter wheat in the palo duro watershed had a lower seasonal irrigation requirement 218 mm compared to irrigated corn and sorghum 417 mm and 264 mm dual purpose winter wheat production in the commercial fields of the thp is commonly not well managed compared to the research fields actually winter wheat in the commercial fields typically is not sufficiently irrigated as the net return does not offset the costs of management inputs marek et al 2018 information from growers also indicated a more than 30 reduction in irrigation water use for the deficit irrigated winter wheat compared to the irrigated corn in the thp texas water development board 2011 therefore to maintain or increase winter wheat yield a suitable early planting date may be warranted in the region when compared to the irrigated winter wheat of the baseline there is a considerable increase in monthly irrigation requirement and etc from january to may for the early planting of winter wheat fig 7a b c d however the monthly soil water content was reduced in each month for the early planting fig 7e f under the dryland management apparent changes in etc were observed in april 13 4 increase and november 29 7 decrease for the late planting of winter wheat relative to the baseline fig 8a b clear changes of etc were found in february 21 7 decrease and october 43 4 increase for the early planting of dryland winter wheat the monthly soil water content increased from 16 to 45 for the late planting of dryland winter wheat while the soil water content decreased from 7 to 27 for the early planting of dryland winter wheat fig 8c d 4 conclusions evaluations of the watershed scale agricultural production practices on the water cycle and crop yields are deemed critical for informing and implementing relevant strategies for agricultural bmps assessments from this study explored some potential bmps for water conservation and sustainable crop production in the semi arid thp using the swat mad model simulation results indicated using a small irrigation application depth for corn sorghum and winter wheat resulted in increased irrigation frequencies and seasonal requirements corresponding increases in etc were also considerable by contrast the high irrigation application depth for corn sorghum and winter wheat showed a water saving effect without influencing the crop yields in the irrigated hrus in the palo duro watershed the auto irrigation function was used to simulate the local irrigation management practices which partially emphasized the differences in water requirements of corn sorghum and winter wheat results found that the decreasing order of the baseline irrigation requirement was corn sorghum and winter wheat with seasonal irrigation requirements of 417 mm 264 mm and 218 mm respectively therefore more attention should be given for water conservation under corn land use high irrigation application depth and late planting for corn could support groundwater conservation however early planting of irrigated sorghum irrigated winter wheat dryland winter wheat might be considered for maintaining or enhancing crop yields in the texas panhandle growers should keep in mind that too early or too late planting dates may influence crop insurance coverage declaration of

10336,land spreading of olive mill wastewater omw allows a cheap and environmentally sound effluent disposal however this practice requires suitable application protocols in order to avoid negative effects on soil hydrological properties such as the increase of soil water repellency swr the effects of omw land spreading on swr mainly evaluated in the long term have been rarely measured few days or weeks after land spreading to this purpose this study has evaluated the short term effects of omw land spreading on swr of olive groves with silt loam or silty clay loam soil texture using the water drop penetration test wdpt at laboratory scale swr significantly p 0 001 varied with the soil texture and depth surface layer or 10 cm depth as well as the treatment land spreading of omw or fresh water fw and time elapsed from land application more specifically swr was significantly higher p 0 001 in the topsoil than the sub surface layer compared to the soils irrigated with fw a two fold wdpt thus a slightly higher swr was found after omw application in both soil layers regardless of the texture however this weak swr disappears just after 2weeks from land spreading and the hydrophobicity of the soils treated with omw and fw becomes very similar moreover the topsoil and sub surface layer showed the same swr after 4weeks the high coefficients of determination r2 0 86 in the linear regressions between wdpt and om content of soils proved the clear influence of the organic compounds on swr which decreases with om as expected overall omw land spreading has not significantly changed swr at least under the limited hydraulic and organic loads adopted in this study and less noticeably on loam or silty clay loam soil compared to sandy loam texture however this practice is more viable in spring or autumn since in these seasons the risk of groundwater contamination is particularly reduced keywords water drop penetration test soil hydrophobicity omw land spreading soil organic matter wastewater management 1 introduction olive oil production is a primary agro industrial activity in many mediterranean countries mateo and maicas 2015 fountoulakis et al 2008 olive processing produces large amounts of residues a very wet cake the so called olive pomace and a liquid stream called olive mill wastewater omw the latter is generated during the different stages of oil production and by the water used for cleaning purposes moreno et al 2017 omw has a dark colour characteristic odour low ph and contains high concentrations of fats oils and greases fogs organic matter om suspended solids and pollutant compounds such as polyphenols the presence of polyphenols as well as short and long chain fatty acids of fogs contribute to the phytotoxic and antimicrobial effects of omw saadi et al 2007 because of these characteristics omw management poses serious environmental risks to water soil and air as a matter of fact the uncontrolled disposal of the oil industry effluents may cause water body pollution soil degradation and odour emissions dermeche et al 2013 chaari et al 2015 the techniques applied for omw depuration physico chemical or biological treatments are complex and expensive dourou et al 2016 calabrò et al 2018 in the last decades novel bio technologies have been proposed and tested for the omw treatment and valorisation such as the production of phenolic compounds e g tsioulpas et al 2002 aggelis et al 2003 citric acid papanikolaou et al 2008 single cell oil bellou et al 2014 bio ethanol sarris et al 2014 and added value metabolites sarris et al 2017 these bio technologies techniques seem to be promising but not yet consolidated in the common practice therefore these management options may be economically unsustainable for the smallest oil mills calabrò et al 2018 diamantis et al 2013b a viable solution is omw land spreading which consists of the controlled application of the oil industry effluents to cultivated soil through soil application omw can be used as a cheap soil conditioner and or fertiliser barbera et al 2014 moreover omw is an additional water resource for the mediterranean agricultural areas affected by a chronic water and om scarcity chaari et al 2015 by this practice the treatment cost related to the large volume of omw produced by oil mills can be reduced despite these environmental and economic benefits omw land spreading must be practised with caution the agronomic reuse of omw without following suitable protocols for soil application can degrade soil characteristics s habou et al 2009 the effects of omw land spreading have been largely studied particularly in the long terms zema et al 2019 on this regard mekki et al 2006 and barbera et al 2013 have issued two interesting reviews discussing the effects of omw land spreading on soils and crops of different characteristics for instance it has been demonstrated that omw land spreading induces beneficial effects on the physico chemical organic matter and nutrients and microbiological arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi e g caruso et al 2018 chatzistathis and koutsos 2017 properties of the treated soils potential phytotoxicity to some crops has been reported in some studies e g saadi et al 2007 however literature data about omw effects on soil properties are not unanimous and in some cases contradictory since the effluents whose qualitative variability due to the high variability of ph and the wide range of concentrations of total solids as well as of organic matter and polyphenols is large are applied at several hydraulic rates and over soils of different characteristics chartzoulakis et al 2010 as regards the hydrological characteristics of the soils receiving omw much caution should be paid to the possible reduction in the water infiltration after application in the mediterranean areas where the infiltration excess mechanism dominates the soil hydrological response lucas borja et al 2018 a reduced infiltration capacity could make these areas particularly prone to runoff and soil erosion risks fortugno et al 2017 moreover since omw also contains residual oil 1 2 1 4 kg per 100 kg of treated olives abegunrin et al 2016 servili et al 2004 the wax like substances of omw can form a coating on soil particles bisdom et al 1993 therefore under the mediterranean conditions the soils irrigated with omw could become hydrophobic tarchitzky et al 2007 travis et al 2008 soil hydrophobicity also known as soil water repellency hereinafter swr abegunrin et al 2016 debano 1969 doerr et al 2000 is the situation whereby the soil does not wet when water is spontaneously applied wallach and graber 2007 swr presence has been documented in various regions climates soils and land uses doerr et al 2000 ritsema and dekker 2003 this effect induces degradation of soil hydrological properties such as reduction of water infiltration swr is influenced by several soil properties and conditions e g om content texture ph water content doerr et al 2000 for instance soil om strongly affects swr graber et al 2006 serres 1992 wallach et al 2005 the presence of organic compounds derived from living or decomposing plants or microorganisms coat soil particle surfaces and aggregates making it repellent to the water infiltration abegunrin et al 2016 swr is found on coarse textured soils where it is more pronounced but is also common in fine textured soils where a high level of hydrophobicity is possible doerr et al 2000 2006 moreover swr usually occurs when soils dry out to below a critical soil water content dekker et al 2001 wallis and horne 1992 which is common in the dry seasons of the mediterranean climate therefore the omw land spreading on dry soils may generate or even aggravate swr with the subsequent worsening of hydrological response also in the dry seasons several studies have evaluated the effects of wastewater on swr on different soil types e g debano 2000 wallach et al 2005 the experiences dealing with omw land spreading are less numerous and have been carried out mainly on the long term e g mahmoud et al 2010 peikert et al 2015 the evaluation of the effects of omw on the physical properties of soil thus including swr performed some weeks or months after application are equally important since many adverse effects may be present only in this period zema et al 2019 therefore there is the need of studies evaluating how and by what extent swr of the mediterranean soils may change immediately or few weeks after receiving omw to fill this gap this study evaluates the short term effects at 2 7 14 and 21days of omw application on swr of sandy loam silt loam and silty clay loam soils at different depths surface and at a depth of 10 cm at laboratory scale we hypothesised that the high contents of om and hydrophobic substances in omw may noticeably alter swr depending on the soil depth and the time elapsed since omw application overall these short term effects after omw land spreading are expected to be negative leading to the swr increase particularly at the soil surface 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas the investigation was carried out in olive groves olea europea of two farms in calabria southern italy fig 1a of which one is located in locri and the other in gioia tauro the climate of both farms is typically semi arid hot summer mediterranean climate csa class according to koppen 1918 the annual rainfall and minimum maximum temperatures are on average 1300 1400 mm and 11 28 c respectively historical observations of 1923 2017 of environmental protection agency of calabria region arpacal the olive grove in locri 38 2671 n 16 1872 e mean altitude of 114 m above mean sea level is planted with trees of cultivar geracese about 10 12years old at 6 mx6 m spacing the olive grove in gioia tauro 38 4136 n 15 9351 e mean altitude of 10 m a s l is planted with trees of cultivar sinopolese 20 year old planted at 5 mx4 m both olive groves are usually subject to mechanical tillage twice a year and weed removal using disc ploughs and harrows respectively in the olive groves three plots with as many soil types were identified in order to catch the swr variability among different textures one plot covering an area of 250 m2 42 mx6 m was in locri the two other plots of 2 360 m2 24 mx15 m were set in the olive grove of gioia tauro in each plot two areas were chosen three soil samples per area were collected for the subsequent treatments and swr tests in laboratory fig 1b more details about the characteristics of the experimental sites can be found in the works of andiloro et al 2007 and bombino et al 2019 according to the usda fao soil classification soil survey division staff 1993 the soils were characterised on 30 45 samples per plot collected at a depth of 10 cm below ground as i sandy loam on the average 70 wt wt of sand 24 of silt and 6 of clay and 3 of skeleton in one plot of gioia tauro ii silt loam 19 of sand 71 of silt and 10 of clay and a lack of skeleton in the second plot of gioia tauro iii silty clay loam 2 of sand 70 of silt and 28 of clay with 3 of skeleton in the plot of locri hereinafter the three soils will be indicated as sal sil and scl respectively 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 soil sampling eighteen soil samples 3 soilsx2 treatmentsx3 replicates were extracted in late may from the three plots using a steel ring 0 32 m in diameter and 0 26 m in height before sampling rocks and weeds were removed over the soil surface then the ring was inserted into the soil by pressing the soil sample was carefully extracted and transported to the laboratory where the sample gently put in the same day in a 18 5 l pot diameter of 0 30 m and depth of 0 26 cm with an upper surface area of 0 07 m2 the pots were stored in a climatic chamber at 20 c until the dates of land spreading and swr measurement the day after collection the samples were irrigated with 0 71 l about 100 m3 ha 1 of omw treated soil or fresh water hereinafter fw the latter treatment in which groundwater was used was considered as control in this study the hydraulic load of omw supply was within the same order of the maximum limit permitted by the italian law n 574 96 equal to 80 m3 ha 1 per year 2 2 2 swr measurement swr was measured in each pot containing the soil samples at 2 7 14 and 21days henceforth indicated as t2 t7 t14 and t21 respectively after land spreading of omw or fw according to letey 1969 the water drop penetration time wdpt according to the methods proposed by van t woudt 1959 and commonly accepted in literature letey et al 2000 buczko and bens 2006 tarchitzky et al 2007 was used to evaluate swr in more detail two soil samples were gently collected at the measurement dates from the surface layer sl and on the same vertical line at a depth of 10 cm sub surface layer ssl of every pot caring to sampling the soil from a different area of the pot surface at each date after the measurement the sampled soils were restored in the pot the samples were sieved at 2 mm sieve the material of the samples was filled into circular dishes of 10 cm diameter and the soil surface was manually smoothed field moist samples were used instead of oven dried soil in order to measure more realistic values of swr instead of the potential repellency buczko and bens 2006 since the samples were collected at the same date from soils with practically the same characteristics the variability of the water content 10 4 1 1 for sal 19 1 2 4 for sil and 18 3 1 9 for scl soil was very low moreover since all the samples were stored under the same conditions significant changes in their water content were not expected a total of 10 15 drops of distilled water were applied to the surface of the soil samples through a medical pipette water volume of one droplet 58 5 μl and the wdpt was recorded mahmoud et al 2010 according to bisdom et al 1993 the swr was classified as follows wettable or non water repellent soil wdpt 5 s slightly water repellent soil wdpt 5 60 s strongly water repellent soil wdpt 60 600 s severely water repellent soil 600 3600 s extremely water repellent soil wdpt 3600 s overall the experimental design consisted of two treatments omw vs fw two soil depths sl vs ssl four dates t2 vs t7 vs t14 vs t21 three soils sal vs sil vs scl three replicates spatially independent and randomly established for a total of 144 tests 2 2 3 wastewater and soil characterisation omw was collected from a local olive oil processing plant using a continuous 3 phase extraction system the omw samples were stored in an open concrete tank for about 30days prior to land application as usually done to face off the time variability of omw production the main chemical physical properties of omw and fw were determined in triplicate immediately before the soil watering table 1 the italian standards apat 2003 which refer to the common international methods apha awwa ef 2012 astm 1981 epa 1974 were adopted for the analyses the polyphenol concentration of omw was determined by using folin ciocalteau method folin and ciocalteu 1927 the following properties over the fraction finer than 2 mm after sample air drying and sieving were determined on three composite samples of surface and sub surface layers in the three soils table 2 i ph by portable electrochemical instrument hach lange hq30d hach company loveland colorado usa ii om content by walkey and black method walkey and black 1934 iii total carbon and nitrogen by elemental analyzer leco cn628 leco corporation michigan usa carried out on samples crushed to pass through a 500 μm sieve 2 3 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was carried out using the three way anova treatment omw or fw soil depth sl or ssl and time t2 t7 t15 or t21 were chosen as factors while swr was considered as the response variable the pairwise comparison by tukey s test at p 0 001 was also used to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences in swr among factors in order to satisfy the assumptions of the statistical tests equality of variance and normal distribution the data were subjected to normality test or were square root transformed whenever necessary moreover a regression analysis between wdpt and the om content of the three soils all the statistical tests were carried out by with the statgraphics centurion and xlstat software 3 results according to the three way anova each individual factor treatment soil depth and measurement date significantly p 0 001 influences swr similarly all interactions between couples of factors soil depth treatment time treatment and soil depth time although at p 0 01 are significant to explain the swr variations conversely the interaction among all the factors soil depth treatment time is not significant table 3 wdpt of the surface samples was in the range 1 39 sal soil treated with fw at 21nd day to 28 53 sal soil treated with omw at 2nd day seconds the average wpdt was 4 38 1 27 s for land spreading of fw and 9 15 7 64 s for soils treated with omw the difference between the treatments was significant p 0 001 table 4 in the sub surface layer wdpt varied between 0 58 sal soil treated with omw at the 21nd day and 10 38 same soil type and treatment but at the 2nd day seconds for the deeper soil layer an average wdpt of 3 84 0 86 s was measured for fw treatments this value was significantly different compared to the wdpt of the soils irrigated with omw 4 84 2 33 s based on these wdpt values the investigated soils can be classified as wettable or sligthly water repellent table 4 3 1 swr variations with treatments the wdpt values of soils irrigated with omw were significantly higher about two fold p 0 001 compared to fw treatment until the first week due to this swr increase the soils became slightly repellent however their swr decreased over time and the soils became not repellent in the following 2 weeks the final wdpt of soils treated with omw was very close to the values of the soils irrigated with fw and the differences lower than 15 were not significant fig 2 3 2 swr variations with soil depth the surface layer was always more repellent compared to the sub surface soil and this effect was more significant in the first 2weeks when the surface wdpt values were about 50 higher in the following 2 weeks swr of the two layers became very close and the differences were not significant although the surface soil was slightly more repellent differences in wdpt of about 15 fig 3 in more detail the surface layer was slightly repellent for both treatments until the second week and became wettable when irrigated with omw the sub surface soil was instead always wettable except for the first 2weeks after omw land spreading when a slight repellency was noticed table 4 more specifically the control soils after fw land spreading was wettable in the sub surface layer and slightly water repellent in the surface layer throughout the experiment conversely both the layers of the soils treated with omw showed a slight repellency throughout the first 2weeks after irrigation but became wettable in the following period table 4 3 3 effects of om content on swr immediately after omw application the increase in om content of both surface and sub surface layers was higher in the sal soil respectively 7 6 and 6 1 subsequently the increase in om due to omw application became similar among the three soil types 2 5 2 6 at the soil surface 2 3 3 2 at 10 cm for the sub surface layer om content of soils showed a low variability over time although sudden increases mainly in the surface layer was observed 1week after omw application fig 4 it should be noticed that after one month from the soil treatment the original om content 2 80 0 45 for sal soil 3 80 0 44 for sil and 1 94 0 03 for scl was increased by percentages between 2 5 and 2 7 surface layer and 2 3 3 2 sub surface soil fig 4 and table 2 linear regressions with high coefficients of determination r2 0 86 were evident by plotting wdpt against om content of the three soils the related equations show that swr increases with om moreover this increase is very sensitive to the changes in om content of soil as shown by the high slope of the regression lines for the sub surface layer these correlations were evident and positive for sal and sil soils while the coefficient of determination was much lower for the scl soil r2 0 21 fig 5 4 discussions a large body of literature exists about the evaluation of the effects of wastewater application on swr however much research focussed the long term effects from 18 months to even 15 years and was carried out at field scale as shown by the main experiences reported in table 5 this study has instead evaluated the degree of soil hydrophobicity determined by omw few weeks after land spreading this evaluation is very important to avoid decaying of soil hydraulic properties and thus to control the runoff and erosion risks in the short terms barbera et al 2013 chatzistathis and koutsos 2017 zema et al 2019 the effects of omw land spreading significantly vary with soil profile layer treatment and time elapsed from application these variables combine in exerting their influence on soil hydrological response which also depends on the soil type more specifically land spreading of omw and fw makes the surface layer more repellent compared to the sub surface soil fw application never influences soil hydrophobicity in sal soils which are not repellent both in the surface and in the sub surface layers over time this is in accordance with the results of wallach et al 2005 who found that land spreading sandy soils with fw does not induce swr however fw induces a slight swr in the topsoil in sil and scl soils throughout the observation period the increased hydrophobicity of two of our experimental soils could be explained by their higher content of finer soil particles compared to sal soils land spreading induced dispersion of soil particles in the topsoil with consequent formation of a soil crust inducing a slight swr andiloro et al 2007 compared to soils irrigated with fw all soils treated with omw shows a slight swr in both layers for about 2weeks this slight swr affects all soils regardless of their texture after this period the soils become wettable the higher time required for drop penetration in the surface layer in the first 2weeks can be attributable to the formation of a lenticular drop of water on the topsoil which makes the soil surface partially water repellent conversely water infiltrates more rapidly in the wettable soils the increase in swr with omw application has been attributed by mahmoud et al 2010 to two factors the generation of hydrophobic components during the decomposition of organic matter and residues of oil and grease that are wax like substances forming a coating on soil particles bisdom et al 1993 this coating determines occlusion of the superficial pores due to the chemical composition of the soil solution and the presence of suspended solids sealing effect barbera et al 2013 2014 in more detail the residual oil in omw adsorbs onto the soil grains but with decreasing particle size i e in clayey soil the dispersed clay particles coat the hydrophobic compounds responsible for swr and the soil becomes wettable diamantis et al 2017 beside the residual oil the sources of soil hydrophobicity may include plant derived organic matter decomposing roots and plant tissues plant derived waxes and exudates fungal activity and microbial products moreover soil contamination by hydrocarbons may induce severe swr sawatski and li 1997 diamantis et al 2013b the repulsion of water by the hydrophobic group of organic molecules or are formed during wastewater decomposition in the omw bisdom et al 1993 tarchitzky et al 2007 temporarily reduces the water retention capacity of soils therefore the water availability for plants decreases gonzalez vila et al 1995 wallach et al 2005 travis et al 2008 mahmoud et al 2010 and this may be a serious problem for semi arid climates characterised by a water shortage in the long and dry season when the concentration of hydrophobic compounds in the omw that were rich in oils and fats decrease soil water retention increases thanks to the hygroscopicity of the organic matter released by omw and the microporosity improvement in the soil barbera et al 2013 however this study has demonstrated that much of the om degradation occurs over time piotrowska et al 2006 decreasing swr and the previously repellent soil resulted to be wettable after just 2weeks therefore this weak hydrophobicity is only temporary and in short time the swr of the soils treated with omw becomes very similar as the hydrophobicity of soils irrigated with fw whose water repellency is practically constant over time moreover the swr of topsoil and sub surface layer tends to be equal in the short time as also found by mohawesh et al 2019 the high coefficients of determination of the linear regressions between wdpt and om with the only exception of the sub surface layer of the scl soil detected in this study confirm the clear influence of om on swr and their simultaneous variability in the investigated soils in general at the early stage after omw application om noticeably increases in the sal topsoil subsequently the om content decreases with time as also observed by peikert et al 2015 in the other soil types om content is more stable particularly in the sub surface layer which leads to think that the excess of organic compounds applied with omw is mainly retained in the first centimeters of soil surface without infiltrating due to lower water infiltrability compared to the sal soil the increase after 7 days in both scl and sil soils is instead quite surprising this increase may be attributable to a local accumulation of om which increases the aggregate stability and macroporosity of soils chaney and swift 1984 haynes and swift 1990 preferential water pathway in cracks of these soils with higher clay content which have been visually detected some days after omw application the different soil types may have also affected the microbial activity and therefore the biodegradation rate of hydrophobic compounds in omw with time different researches have demonstrated that soil texture is an important characteristic modulating the microbial communities activity in general sessitsch et al 2001 bach et al 2010 for example clay soils generally support more diverse and greater soil microbial communities compared to sandy soils as clay better protects the microbial biomass has got a larger and higher number of soil aggregates and shows a higher water holding capacity sessitsch et al 2001 six et al 2006 voroney 2007 wick et al 2009 the swr response is consistent to the om variations in the soil in other words swr decreases with om a partial persistence of low swr with om contents over the baseline cannot be excluded peikert et al 2015 however at the end of the tests all soils are characterised more or less by similar om content and swr class leading to the conclusion that land spreading of omw does not noticeably alter om dynamic and thus soil hydrophobicity for the different soil textures this main result of this study is in close accordance to the findings of kurtz et al 2015 these authors found no repellency wdpt 60 s or a slight swr wdpt 5 s in clayey loam or sandy clay loam soils 3weeks after omw land spreading at a 1 5 fold hydraulic load compared to the value of our study 147 against 100 m3 ha the comparative analysis of the other literature results about swr determined by land spreading with wastewater shows that i the main factor influencing swr is the om increase of soil wallis and horne 1992 more specifically nadav et al 2013 reported that om properties have a limited effect on swr class while wallach et al 2005 concluded that the most influencing factor is om quantity rather that its quality ii swr occurs mainly in the soil surface layer independently of the soil texture tarchitzky et al 2007 probably because of the om content decrease with soil depth wallach et al 2005 wallis and horne 1992 iii land spreading of wastewater induces noticeable effects on sandy soil rusan et al 2007 due to its lower specific surface area nadav et al 2013 since the sand particles are more readily coated by om compared to clay soils wallis and horne 1992 iv conversely swr effects on clay soil treated with wastewater are less evident singh et al 2012 overall our study has demonstrated that at least in the experimental conditions the land application of omw does not significantly change swr in these experiments the hydraulic and organic loads of the applied water were quite limited compared to the other literature experiences e g mahmoud et al 2010 peikert et al 2015 albalasmeh et al 2019 limiting the applied volumes does not change swr and even limits the short term reduction of soil infiltration rate detected in some studies e g barbera et al 2013 zema et al 2019 therefore the risk of hydrological response worsening immediately after omw application to soils suggests caution in irrigation of agricultural land since it may increase runoff and erosion processes moreover according to steinmetz et al 2015 and tamimi et al 2016 omw should not applied to the soil during summer or winter in summer the inhibition of degradation of om constituents and their immobilisation in soil at high temperature and low soil moisture after omw land spreading could be possible steinmetz et al 2015 omw application in winter immediately after oil production although allowing the natural recovery of the soil could increase the leaching risk due to low temperature and frequent rains tamimi et al 2016 moreover in this season when rainfall amount and intensity are high the soil is often saturated and the infiltration is lower bombino et al 2010 therefore crop irrigation with omw is preferable during late spring or early autumn when the irrigation requirement is noticeable but the rainfall input is lower compared to the wet season in these periods biotic degradation of omw organic compounds is possible which could reduce the risk of groundwater contamination and enhance biodegradation overall heavy negative effects on soil hydrophobicity and more in general on infiltration characteristics at least in the experimental conditions are excluded if omw application on soils is practiced following the current italian limits for omw spreading on crops therefore omw land spreading can represent as a viable valorisation approach for these effluents in mediterranean areas supporting the olive and oil production chains 5 conclusions in the short term the effects of omw application on soil water repellency significantly vary with depth surface layer or 10 cm depth and treatment land spreading of omw or fw of soil as well as with the time elapsed from water application compared to soils treated with fw omw determines a slight swr has affected in both layers of the investigated soils regardless of their texture however this weak hydrophobicity is only temporary since it disappears after 2weeks evident linear regressions have been found between wdpt and om content of soils which show the clear influence of the organic compounds on swr decreasing with om of soil from these results the working hypothesis that the high contents of organic matter and hydrophobic substances of omw may induce a significant swr with consequent worsening of the soil hydraulic properties should be rejected conversely the study has demonstrated that land spreading omw does not significantly change swr at least at the limited hydraulic and organic loads adopted declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10336,land spreading of olive mill wastewater omw allows a cheap and environmentally sound effluent disposal however this practice requires suitable application protocols in order to avoid negative effects on soil hydrological properties such as the increase of soil water repellency swr the effects of omw land spreading on swr mainly evaluated in the long term have been rarely measured few days or weeks after land spreading to this purpose this study has evaluated the short term effects of omw land spreading on swr of olive groves with silt loam or silty clay loam soil texture using the water drop penetration test wdpt at laboratory scale swr significantly p 0 001 varied with the soil texture and depth surface layer or 10 cm depth as well as the treatment land spreading of omw or fresh water fw and time elapsed from land application more specifically swr was significantly higher p 0 001 in the topsoil than the sub surface layer compared to the soils irrigated with fw a two fold wdpt thus a slightly higher swr was found after omw application in both soil layers regardless of the texture however this weak swr disappears just after 2weeks from land spreading and the hydrophobicity of the soils treated with omw and fw becomes very similar moreover the topsoil and sub surface layer showed the same swr after 4weeks the high coefficients of determination r2 0 86 in the linear regressions between wdpt and om content of soils proved the clear influence of the organic compounds on swr which decreases with om as expected overall omw land spreading has not significantly changed swr at least under the limited hydraulic and organic loads adopted in this study and less noticeably on loam or silty clay loam soil compared to sandy loam texture however this practice is more viable in spring or autumn since in these seasons the risk of groundwater contamination is particularly reduced keywords water drop penetration test soil hydrophobicity omw land spreading soil organic matter wastewater management 1 introduction olive oil production is a primary agro industrial activity in many mediterranean countries mateo and maicas 2015 fountoulakis et al 2008 olive processing produces large amounts of residues a very wet cake the so called olive pomace and a liquid stream called olive mill wastewater omw the latter is generated during the different stages of oil production and by the water used for cleaning purposes moreno et al 2017 omw has a dark colour characteristic odour low ph and contains high concentrations of fats oils and greases fogs organic matter om suspended solids and pollutant compounds such as polyphenols the presence of polyphenols as well as short and long chain fatty acids of fogs contribute to the phytotoxic and antimicrobial effects of omw saadi et al 2007 because of these characteristics omw management poses serious environmental risks to water soil and air as a matter of fact the uncontrolled disposal of the oil industry effluents may cause water body pollution soil degradation and odour emissions dermeche et al 2013 chaari et al 2015 the techniques applied for omw depuration physico chemical or biological treatments are complex and expensive dourou et al 2016 calabrò et al 2018 in the last decades novel bio technologies have been proposed and tested for the omw treatment and valorisation such as the production of phenolic compounds e g tsioulpas et al 2002 aggelis et al 2003 citric acid papanikolaou et al 2008 single cell oil bellou et al 2014 bio ethanol sarris et al 2014 and added value metabolites sarris et al 2017 these bio technologies techniques seem to be promising but not yet consolidated in the common practice therefore these management options may be economically unsustainable for the smallest oil mills calabrò et al 2018 diamantis et al 2013b a viable solution is omw land spreading which consists of the controlled application of the oil industry effluents to cultivated soil through soil application omw can be used as a cheap soil conditioner and or fertiliser barbera et al 2014 moreover omw is an additional water resource for the mediterranean agricultural areas affected by a chronic water and om scarcity chaari et al 2015 by this practice the treatment cost related to the large volume of omw produced by oil mills can be reduced despite these environmental and economic benefits omw land spreading must be practised with caution the agronomic reuse of omw without following suitable protocols for soil application can degrade soil characteristics s habou et al 2009 the effects of omw land spreading have been largely studied particularly in the long terms zema et al 2019 on this regard mekki et al 2006 and barbera et al 2013 have issued two interesting reviews discussing the effects of omw land spreading on soils and crops of different characteristics for instance it has been demonstrated that omw land spreading induces beneficial effects on the physico chemical organic matter and nutrients and microbiological arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi e g caruso et al 2018 chatzistathis and koutsos 2017 properties of the treated soils potential phytotoxicity to some crops has been reported in some studies e g saadi et al 2007 however literature data about omw effects on soil properties are not unanimous and in some cases contradictory since the effluents whose qualitative variability due to the high variability of ph and the wide range of concentrations of total solids as well as of organic matter and polyphenols is large are applied at several hydraulic rates and over soils of different characteristics chartzoulakis et al 2010 as regards the hydrological characteristics of the soils receiving omw much caution should be paid to the possible reduction in the water infiltration after application in the mediterranean areas where the infiltration excess mechanism dominates the soil hydrological response lucas borja et al 2018 a reduced infiltration capacity could make these areas particularly prone to runoff and soil erosion risks fortugno et al 2017 moreover since omw also contains residual oil 1 2 1 4 kg per 100 kg of treated olives abegunrin et al 2016 servili et al 2004 the wax like substances of omw can form a coating on soil particles bisdom et al 1993 therefore under the mediterranean conditions the soils irrigated with omw could become hydrophobic tarchitzky et al 2007 travis et al 2008 soil hydrophobicity also known as soil water repellency hereinafter swr abegunrin et al 2016 debano 1969 doerr et al 2000 is the situation whereby the soil does not wet when water is spontaneously applied wallach and graber 2007 swr presence has been documented in various regions climates soils and land uses doerr et al 2000 ritsema and dekker 2003 this effect induces degradation of soil hydrological properties such as reduction of water infiltration swr is influenced by several soil properties and conditions e g om content texture ph water content doerr et al 2000 for instance soil om strongly affects swr graber et al 2006 serres 1992 wallach et al 2005 the presence of organic compounds derived from living or decomposing plants or microorganisms coat soil particle surfaces and aggregates making it repellent to the water infiltration abegunrin et al 2016 swr is found on coarse textured soils where it is more pronounced but is also common in fine textured soils where a high level of hydrophobicity is possible doerr et al 2000 2006 moreover swr usually occurs when soils dry out to below a critical soil water content dekker et al 2001 wallis and horne 1992 which is common in the dry seasons of the mediterranean climate therefore the omw land spreading on dry soils may generate or even aggravate swr with the subsequent worsening of hydrological response also in the dry seasons several studies have evaluated the effects of wastewater on swr on different soil types e g debano 2000 wallach et al 2005 the experiences dealing with omw land spreading are less numerous and have been carried out mainly on the long term e g mahmoud et al 2010 peikert et al 2015 the evaluation of the effects of omw on the physical properties of soil thus including swr performed some weeks or months after application are equally important since many adverse effects may be present only in this period zema et al 2019 therefore there is the need of studies evaluating how and by what extent swr of the mediterranean soils may change immediately or few weeks after receiving omw to fill this gap this study evaluates the short term effects at 2 7 14 and 21days of omw application on swr of sandy loam silt loam and silty clay loam soils at different depths surface and at a depth of 10 cm at laboratory scale we hypothesised that the high contents of om and hydrophobic substances in omw may noticeably alter swr depending on the soil depth and the time elapsed since omw application overall these short term effects after omw land spreading are expected to be negative leading to the swr increase particularly at the soil surface 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas the investigation was carried out in olive groves olea europea of two farms in calabria southern italy fig 1a of which one is located in locri and the other in gioia tauro the climate of both farms is typically semi arid hot summer mediterranean climate csa class according to koppen 1918 the annual rainfall and minimum maximum temperatures are on average 1300 1400 mm and 11 28 c respectively historical observations of 1923 2017 of environmental protection agency of calabria region arpacal the olive grove in locri 38 2671 n 16 1872 e mean altitude of 114 m above mean sea level is planted with trees of cultivar geracese about 10 12years old at 6 mx6 m spacing the olive grove in gioia tauro 38 4136 n 15 9351 e mean altitude of 10 m a s l is planted with trees of cultivar sinopolese 20 year old planted at 5 mx4 m both olive groves are usually subject to mechanical tillage twice a year and weed removal using disc ploughs and harrows respectively in the olive groves three plots with as many soil types were identified in order to catch the swr variability among different textures one plot covering an area of 250 m2 42 mx6 m was in locri the two other plots of 2 360 m2 24 mx15 m were set in the olive grove of gioia tauro in each plot two areas were chosen three soil samples per area were collected for the subsequent treatments and swr tests in laboratory fig 1b more details about the characteristics of the experimental sites can be found in the works of andiloro et al 2007 and bombino et al 2019 according to the usda fao soil classification soil survey division staff 1993 the soils were characterised on 30 45 samples per plot collected at a depth of 10 cm below ground as i sandy loam on the average 70 wt wt of sand 24 of silt and 6 of clay and 3 of skeleton in one plot of gioia tauro ii silt loam 19 of sand 71 of silt and 10 of clay and a lack of skeleton in the second plot of gioia tauro iii silty clay loam 2 of sand 70 of silt and 28 of clay with 3 of skeleton in the plot of locri hereinafter the three soils will be indicated as sal sil and scl respectively 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 soil sampling eighteen soil samples 3 soilsx2 treatmentsx3 replicates were extracted in late may from the three plots using a steel ring 0 32 m in diameter and 0 26 m in height before sampling rocks and weeds were removed over the soil surface then the ring was inserted into the soil by pressing the soil sample was carefully extracted and transported to the laboratory where the sample gently put in the same day in a 18 5 l pot diameter of 0 30 m and depth of 0 26 cm with an upper surface area of 0 07 m2 the pots were stored in a climatic chamber at 20 c until the dates of land spreading and swr measurement the day after collection the samples were irrigated with 0 71 l about 100 m3 ha 1 of omw treated soil or fresh water hereinafter fw the latter treatment in which groundwater was used was considered as control in this study the hydraulic load of omw supply was within the same order of the maximum limit permitted by the italian law n 574 96 equal to 80 m3 ha 1 per year 2 2 2 swr measurement swr was measured in each pot containing the soil samples at 2 7 14 and 21days henceforth indicated as t2 t7 t14 and t21 respectively after land spreading of omw or fw according to letey 1969 the water drop penetration time wdpt according to the methods proposed by van t woudt 1959 and commonly accepted in literature letey et al 2000 buczko and bens 2006 tarchitzky et al 2007 was used to evaluate swr in more detail two soil samples were gently collected at the measurement dates from the surface layer sl and on the same vertical line at a depth of 10 cm sub surface layer ssl of every pot caring to sampling the soil from a different area of the pot surface at each date after the measurement the sampled soils were restored in the pot the samples were sieved at 2 mm sieve the material of the samples was filled into circular dishes of 10 cm diameter and the soil surface was manually smoothed field moist samples were used instead of oven dried soil in order to measure more realistic values of swr instead of the potential repellency buczko and bens 2006 since the samples were collected at the same date from soils with practically the same characteristics the variability of the water content 10 4 1 1 for sal 19 1 2 4 for sil and 18 3 1 9 for scl soil was very low moreover since all the samples were stored under the same conditions significant changes in their water content were not expected a total of 10 15 drops of distilled water were applied to the surface of the soil samples through a medical pipette water volume of one droplet 58 5 μl and the wdpt was recorded mahmoud et al 2010 according to bisdom et al 1993 the swr was classified as follows wettable or non water repellent soil wdpt 5 s slightly water repellent soil wdpt 5 60 s strongly water repellent soil wdpt 60 600 s severely water repellent soil 600 3600 s extremely water repellent soil wdpt 3600 s overall the experimental design consisted of two treatments omw vs fw two soil depths sl vs ssl four dates t2 vs t7 vs t14 vs t21 three soils sal vs sil vs scl three replicates spatially independent and randomly established for a total of 144 tests 2 2 3 wastewater and soil characterisation omw was collected from a local olive oil processing plant using a continuous 3 phase extraction system the omw samples were stored in an open concrete tank for about 30days prior to land application as usually done to face off the time variability of omw production the main chemical physical properties of omw and fw were determined in triplicate immediately before the soil watering table 1 the italian standards apat 2003 which refer to the common international methods apha awwa ef 2012 astm 1981 epa 1974 were adopted for the analyses the polyphenol concentration of omw was determined by using folin ciocalteau method folin and ciocalteu 1927 the following properties over the fraction finer than 2 mm after sample air drying and sieving were determined on three composite samples of surface and sub surface layers in the three soils table 2 i ph by portable electrochemical instrument hach lange hq30d hach company loveland colorado usa ii om content by walkey and black method walkey and black 1934 iii total carbon and nitrogen by elemental analyzer leco cn628 leco corporation michigan usa carried out on samples crushed to pass through a 500 μm sieve 2 3 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was carried out using the three way anova treatment omw or fw soil depth sl or ssl and time t2 t7 t15 or t21 were chosen as factors while swr was considered as the response variable the pairwise comparison by tukey s test at p 0 001 was also used to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences in swr among factors in order to satisfy the assumptions of the statistical tests equality of variance and normal distribution the data were subjected to normality test or were square root transformed whenever necessary moreover a regression analysis between wdpt and the om content of the three soils all the statistical tests were carried out by with the statgraphics centurion and xlstat software 3 results according to the three way anova each individual factor treatment soil depth and measurement date significantly p 0 001 influences swr similarly all interactions between couples of factors soil depth treatment time treatment and soil depth time although at p 0 01 are significant to explain the swr variations conversely the interaction among all the factors soil depth treatment time is not significant table 3 wdpt of the surface samples was in the range 1 39 sal soil treated with fw at 21nd day to 28 53 sal soil treated with omw at 2nd day seconds the average wpdt was 4 38 1 27 s for land spreading of fw and 9 15 7 64 s for soils treated with omw the difference between the treatments was significant p 0 001 table 4 in the sub surface layer wdpt varied between 0 58 sal soil treated with omw at the 21nd day and 10 38 same soil type and treatment but at the 2nd day seconds for the deeper soil layer an average wdpt of 3 84 0 86 s was measured for fw treatments this value was significantly different compared to the wdpt of the soils irrigated with omw 4 84 2 33 s based on these wdpt values the investigated soils can be classified as wettable or sligthly water repellent table 4 3 1 swr variations with treatments the wdpt values of soils irrigated with omw were significantly higher about two fold p 0 001 compared to fw treatment until the first week due to this swr increase the soils became slightly repellent however their swr decreased over time and the soils became not repellent in the following 2 weeks the final wdpt of soils treated with omw was very close to the values of the soils irrigated with fw and the differences lower than 15 were not significant fig 2 3 2 swr variations with soil depth the surface layer was always more repellent compared to the sub surface soil and this effect was more significant in the first 2weeks when the surface wdpt values were about 50 higher in the following 2 weeks swr of the two layers became very close and the differences were not significant although the surface soil was slightly more repellent differences in wdpt of about 15 fig 3 in more detail the surface layer was slightly repellent for both treatments until the second week and became wettable when irrigated with omw the sub surface soil was instead always wettable except for the first 2weeks after omw land spreading when a slight repellency was noticed table 4 more specifically the control soils after fw land spreading was wettable in the sub surface layer and slightly water repellent in the surface layer throughout the experiment conversely both the layers of the soils treated with omw showed a slight repellency throughout the first 2weeks after irrigation but became wettable in the following period table 4 3 3 effects of om content on swr immediately after omw application the increase in om content of both surface and sub surface layers was higher in the sal soil respectively 7 6 and 6 1 subsequently the increase in om due to omw application became similar among the three soil types 2 5 2 6 at the soil surface 2 3 3 2 at 10 cm for the sub surface layer om content of soils showed a low variability over time although sudden increases mainly in the surface layer was observed 1week after omw application fig 4 it should be noticed that after one month from the soil treatment the original om content 2 80 0 45 for sal soil 3 80 0 44 for sil and 1 94 0 03 for scl was increased by percentages between 2 5 and 2 7 surface layer and 2 3 3 2 sub surface soil fig 4 and table 2 linear regressions with high coefficients of determination r2 0 86 were evident by plotting wdpt against om content of the three soils the related equations show that swr increases with om moreover this increase is very sensitive to the changes in om content of soil as shown by the high slope of the regression lines for the sub surface layer these correlations were evident and positive for sal and sil soils while the coefficient of determination was much lower for the scl soil r2 0 21 fig 5 4 discussions a large body of literature exists about the evaluation of the effects of wastewater application on swr however much research focussed the long term effects from 18 months to even 15 years and was carried out at field scale as shown by the main experiences reported in table 5 this study has instead evaluated the degree of soil hydrophobicity determined by omw few weeks after land spreading this evaluation is very important to avoid decaying of soil hydraulic properties and thus to control the runoff and erosion risks in the short terms barbera et al 2013 chatzistathis and koutsos 2017 zema et al 2019 the effects of omw land spreading significantly vary with soil profile layer treatment and time elapsed from application these variables combine in exerting their influence on soil hydrological response which also depends on the soil type more specifically land spreading of omw and fw makes the surface layer more repellent compared to the sub surface soil fw application never influences soil hydrophobicity in sal soils which are not repellent both in the surface and in the sub surface layers over time this is in accordance with the results of wallach et al 2005 who found that land spreading sandy soils with fw does not induce swr however fw induces a slight swr in the topsoil in sil and scl soils throughout the observation period the increased hydrophobicity of two of our experimental soils could be explained by their higher content of finer soil particles compared to sal soils land spreading induced dispersion of soil particles in the topsoil with consequent formation of a soil crust inducing a slight swr andiloro et al 2007 compared to soils irrigated with fw all soils treated with omw shows a slight swr in both layers for about 2weeks this slight swr affects all soils regardless of their texture after this period the soils become wettable the higher time required for drop penetration in the surface layer in the first 2weeks can be attributable to the formation of a lenticular drop of water on the topsoil which makes the soil surface partially water repellent conversely water infiltrates more rapidly in the wettable soils the increase in swr with omw application has been attributed by mahmoud et al 2010 to two factors the generation of hydrophobic components during the decomposition of organic matter and residues of oil and grease that are wax like substances forming a coating on soil particles bisdom et al 1993 this coating determines occlusion of the superficial pores due to the chemical composition of the soil solution and the presence of suspended solids sealing effect barbera et al 2013 2014 in more detail the residual oil in omw adsorbs onto the soil grains but with decreasing particle size i e in clayey soil the dispersed clay particles coat the hydrophobic compounds responsible for swr and the soil becomes wettable diamantis et al 2017 beside the residual oil the sources of soil hydrophobicity may include plant derived organic matter decomposing roots and plant tissues plant derived waxes and exudates fungal activity and microbial products moreover soil contamination by hydrocarbons may induce severe swr sawatski and li 1997 diamantis et al 2013b the repulsion of water by the hydrophobic group of organic molecules or are formed during wastewater decomposition in the omw bisdom et al 1993 tarchitzky et al 2007 temporarily reduces the water retention capacity of soils therefore the water availability for plants decreases gonzalez vila et al 1995 wallach et al 2005 travis et al 2008 mahmoud et al 2010 and this may be a serious problem for semi arid climates characterised by a water shortage in the long and dry season when the concentration of hydrophobic compounds in the omw that were rich in oils and fats decrease soil water retention increases thanks to the hygroscopicity of the organic matter released by omw and the microporosity improvement in the soil barbera et al 2013 however this study has demonstrated that much of the om degradation occurs over time piotrowska et al 2006 decreasing swr and the previously repellent soil resulted to be wettable after just 2weeks therefore this weak hydrophobicity is only temporary and in short time the swr of the soils treated with omw becomes very similar as the hydrophobicity of soils irrigated with fw whose water repellency is practically constant over time moreover the swr of topsoil and sub surface layer tends to be equal in the short time as also found by mohawesh et al 2019 the high coefficients of determination of the linear regressions between wdpt and om with the only exception of the sub surface layer of the scl soil detected in this study confirm the clear influence of om on swr and their simultaneous variability in the investigated soils in general at the early stage after omw application om noticeably increases in the sal topsoil subsequently the om content decreases with time as also observed by peikert et al 2015 in the other soil types om content is more stable particularly in the sub surface layer which leads to think that the excess of organic compounds applied with omw is mainly retained in the first centimeters of soil surface without infiltrating due to lower water infiltrability compared to the sal soil the increase after 7 days in both scl and sil soils is instead quite surprising this increase may be attributable to a local accumulation of om which increases the aggregate stability and macroporosity of soils chaney and swift 1984 haynes and swift 1990 preferential water pathway in cracks of these soils with higher clay content which have been visually detected some days after omw application the different soil types may have also affected the microbial activity and therefore the biodegradation rate of hydrophobic compounds in omw with time different researches have demonstrated that soil texture is an important characteristic modulating the microbial communities activity in general sessitsch et al 2001 bach et al 2010 for example clay soils generally support more diverse and greater soil microbial communities compared to sandy soils as clay better protects the microbial biomass has got a larger and higher number of soil aggregates and shows a higher water holding capacity sessitsch et al 2001 six et al 2006 voroney 2007 wick et al 2009 the swr response is consistent to the om variations in the soil in other words swr decreases with om a partial persistence of low swr with om contents over the baseline cannot be excluded peikert et al 2015 however at the end of the tests all soils are characterised more or less by similar om content and swr class leading to the conclusion that land spreading of omw does not noticeably alter om dynamic and thus soil hydrophobicity for the different soil textures this main result of this study is in close accordance to the findings of kurtz et al 2015 these authors found no repellency wdpt 60 s or a slight swr wdpt 5 s in clayey loam or sandy clay loam soils 3weeks after omw land spreading at a 1 5 fold hydraulic load compared to the value of our study 147 against 100 m3 ha the comparative analysis of the other literature results about swr determined by land spreading with wastewater shows that i the main factor influencing swr is the om increase of soil wallis and horne 1992 more specifically nadav et al 2013 reported that om properties have a limited effect on swr class while wallach et al 2005 concluded that the most influencing factor is om quantity rather that its quality ii swr occurs mainly in the soil surface layer independently of the soil texture tarchitzky et al 2007 probably because of the om content decrease with soil depth wallach et al 2005 wallis and horne 1992 iii land spreading of wastewater induces noticeable effects on sandy soil rusan et al 2007 due to its lower specific surface area nadav et al 2013 since the sand particles are more readily coated by om compared to clay soils wallis and horne 1992 iv conversely swr effects on clay soil treated with wastewater are less evident singh et al 2012 overall our study has demonstrated that at least in the experimental conditions the land application of omw does not significantly change swr in these experiments the hydraulic and organic loads of the applied water were quite limited compared to the other literature experiences e g mahmoud et al 2010 peikert et al 2015 albalasmeh et al 2019 limiting the applied volumes does not change swr and even limits the short term reduction of soil infiltration rate detected in some studies e g barbera et al 2013 zema et al 2019 therefore the risk of hydrological response worsening immediately after omw application to soils suggests caution in irrigation of agricultural land since it may increase runoff and erosion processes moreover according to steinmetz et al 2015 and tamimi et al 2016 omw should not applied to the soil during summer or winter in summer the inhibition of degradation of om constituents and their immobilisation in soil at high temperature and low soil moisture after omw land spreading could be possible steinmetz et al 2015 omw application in winter immediately after oil production although allowing the natural recovery of the soil could increase the leaching risk due to low temperature and frequent rains tamimi et al 2016 moreover in this season when rainfall amount and intensity are high the soil is often saturated and the infiltration is lower bombino et al 2010 therefore crop irrigation with omw is preferable during late spring or early autumn when the irrigation requirement is noticeable but the rainfall input is lower compared to the wet season in these periods biotic degradation of omw organic compounds is possible which could reduce the risk of groundwater contamination and enhance biodegradation overall heavy negative effects on soil hydrophobicity and more in general on infiltration characteristics at least in the experimental conditions are excluded if omw application on soils is practiced following the current italian limits for omw spreading on crops therefore omw land spreading can represent as a viable valorisation approach for these effluents in mediterranean areas supporting the olive and oil production chains 5 conclusions in the short term the effects of omw application on soil water repellency significantly vary with depth surface layer or 10 cm depth and treatment land spreading of omw or fw of soil as well as with the time elapsed from water application compared to soils treated with fw omw determines a slight swr has affected in both layers of the investigated soils regardless of their texture however this weak hydrophobicity is only temporary since it disappears after 2weeks evident linear regressions have been found between wdpt and om content of soils which show the clear influence of the organic compounds on swr decreasing with om of soil from these results the working hypothesis that the high contents of organic matter and hydrophobic substances of omw may induce a significant swr with consequent worsening of the soil hydraulic properties should be rejected conversely the study has demonstrated that land spreading omw does not significantly change swr at least at the limited hydraulic and organic loads adopted declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10337,sloping farmland spf is an important component of cultivated land resources in the context of food security and sustainable agricultural development comprehensive spf utilization has drawn wide and increasing attentions a systematic analysis on the research progress of comprehensive spf utilization is critical for a better understanding of the sustainable agricultural cultivation facilitating the macroeconomic decision making this paper conducted a quantitative analysis of literature related to comprehensive spf utilization over the past few decades 1946 2019 by using scientometrics methods with the objectives to 1 identify the research hotspots and summarize the relevant research processes in different time periods 2 reveal the temporal evolution of those hotspots our results showed 1 research on spf dramatically increased over the past few decades 1946 2019 which can be classified into four chronological periods i ii iii and iv 2 research regarding land productivity improvement and hydrological and erosion processes on spf were dominant in the period i 3 the research hotspots were switched to land use changes and associated soil erosion response ecological disturbance and restoration as the social demand was intensifying in the period ii 4 the research focus of period iii was aiming at the governance and rational utilization of spf and gradually transforming to a large regional scale 5 the intercross and penetration between disciplines had been continuously enhanced in the period iv and the application of high and new technologies had also promoted the diversification of research methods with aims to achieve sustainable agricultural development although considerable progress had been achieved around the world more theoretical and empirical studies are required to understand the comprehensive spf utilization and their implications to better support sustainable agricultural development keywords sloping farmland comprehensive utilization scientometrics research hotspots 1 introduction sloping farmland spf is a compound ecological system that providing numerical cultivated resources and is significantly affected both by natural processes and anthropic activities the area of spf in china is 3824 hm2 which can account for 28 35 of the total cultivated land area ding et al 2017 however a lot of environmental problems such as severe soil erosion non point pollution land degradation and even natural disasters have been occurring in the past few decades due to the intensified and inappropriate exploitation of spf tao et al 2003 ziadat and taimeh 2013 ma et al 2016 the appropriate utilization of spf therefore is of importance to reach the tradeoff between mining the valuable soil and water resources while maintaining their high productivity to meet the increasing global food demand and sustainable agricultural development lal 2018 the fundamental first step of such tradeoff was to throughout quantify the characteristics of comprehensive spf utilization for formulating agricultural sustainable development strategies and ecological system promotion worldwide numerous studies had been conducted about sediment sources transports and distributions nutrients cycling and hydrological processes on spf as well as their effects on soil health and water body biederman and harpole 2013 regues and nadal romero 2013 chen et al 2016 rochelle newall et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the early research on spf were mainly related to land productivity which was significantly declined due to the loss of topsoil and soil nutrients that induced by severe soil erosion on the spf where slope was instable and environmental attributes were fragile in this period field plots with different sizes hydrological and erosion models across various scales and tracing techniques were widely deployed kumar et al 1994 ciesiolka et al 1995 hashim et al 1995 lal 1998 angima et al 2003 boix fayos et al 2006 with the growth of global population and rapid economic growth other research aspects relevant ecological restoration conservation agriculture organic carbon soil amendment and climate change gradually attracted attentions and became the research hotpots requiring multi disciplinary intersections and integrations doetterl et al 2016 wang et al 2016a de la rosa et al 2018 sun et al 2018 peng et al 2019 teravest et al 2019 with advent of geographic information system gis remote sensing rs artificial intelligence ai big data analysis more sophisticatedly physical based models were available and the research scales were not limited to field plots and small watersheds but extended to typical regions and even global scale monreal et al 1997 wei et al 2016 li et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 emphases on comprehensive spf utilization are varying across different countries and regions the united states has a leading position in hydrological and erosion process mechanisms models development and application studies in china have gone through a shift from meeting food demand of the growing population and increasing productivity as the main goals to environmental protection strategies such as returning spf to woodland and grassland while in southeast asia the design and quantitative evaluation of agroforestry systems are the main research focus therefore a macro scale quantitative analysis on the research of spf over different time and regional scales is urgent to better support the sustainable agriculture development and to benefit the efficient region to region incorporations and communications the recent development of scientometrics methods offers an excellent opportunity to conduct such macro scale analysis and even to visualize the temporal evolution of research progresses amongst those tools citespace a java based citation network analysis tool launched by drexel university has become extensively used for mining and analyzing scientific literature data due to its ability to efficiently display the emerging trends in the scientific development li and chen 2016 the objectives of this study are to make a comprehensive and systematic scientometrics review of the related research on comprehensive spf utilization specifically this study focuses on the research hotspots and trends on comprehensive spf utilization in different periods by analyzing the keywords co word network and evolution mapping of keywords co word clusters the guidance and implications that provided in the end would benefit future policy oriented research on sustainable agricultural utilization of spf in the future 2 material and methods 2 1 data collection and processing the literature retrieval source came from the web of science wos core collection science citation index expanded sci e our query was created by using field tag ts boolean operators or parentheses quotation marks and wildcards as shown in fig 1 the quotation marks were used to look for exact phrases and the wildcards were used to find plural and other forms of the words the final dataset of our study was based on two datasets the core dataset cd and the expanded dataset ed the core dataset cd was obtained through a topic retrieval in the wos to cover as much literature as possible a large number of retrieval terms were used in the query at the same time to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the retrieval results the retrieved literature had been strictly reviewed and filtered the method of obtaining the expanded dataset ed was shown in fig 1 and the data were de duplicated and filtered again for the core dataset cd and the expanded dataset ed only the literature types of articles and reviews were retained and all records of each data authors title source author keywords abstract cited references etc were downloaded in plain text format and integrated into citespace for scientometrics analysis it is worth noting that author keywords refer to the keywords listed by the author in each literature the final combined dataset consisted of 8482 articles and reviews between 1946 and 2019 and based on this combined dataset a scientific metrological evaluation of comprehensive spf utilization was carried out 2 2 scientometrics analysis most of the analysis in our study was conducted by citespace 5 6 r2 citespace is a multivariate time series and dynamic citation visualization analysis software and it has gradually developed in the context of scientometrics data and information visualization it is concentrated on analyzing the basic knowledge contained in the scientific literature on comprehensive spf utilization and could be used to analyze and visualize co citation networks particularly this study used the visual images of citespace to show the research hotspots and frontiers of comprehensive spf utilization at different development periods citespace uses color coded nodes and links to distinguish the combined networks of which each year in the combined dataset is assigned a different color and nodes are formed as tree rings with different colors in keywords co word analysis the node size reflects the number of occurrences of a certain keyword and the wider the tree ring of a certain year the more occurrences of the corresponding year the link color represents the time when the two keywords first appeared together and the thickness represents the number of times the two keywords appear together it is worth noting that the nodes in keywords co word analysis of different periods were set to the same size parameter values to show the time changing trends 3 results and discussion 3 1 the overall knowledge evolution of comprehensive spf utilization spf is mainly distributed in areas with relatively poor production conditions and fragile ecological environment resulting in its low soil quality and challenge to be sustainably maintained comprehensive spf utilization is affected by social economic and environmental changes throughout the entire period 1946 2019 the research hotspots of comprehensive spf utilization had gradually shifted from slope hydrological and erosion processes nutrients loss and pollutants migration to the critical social and environmental issues such as land use changes ecological restoration and global climate change the processes and mechanisms of soil erosion including surface runoff and interflow have always been the focus and difficulty of spf research the research scales had gradually transitioned from soil water interface and field plots to watersheds and even global scale fig 2 the rapid development of high and new technologies such as gis rs ai and big data analysis etc had facilitated the research of large spatial scale models compared to developing and underdeveloped countries the research hotspots of spf in the developed countries was switched to environmental issues much earlier emphasizing the joint development of high productivity and sustainable land use and focusing on the revolutions of key and innovative technologies in developing countries represented by china that returning spf to woodland and grassland was the main ecological restoration strategy and research hotspot and these countries had also become the main research areas in underdeveloped countries land reclamation on steep slopes was still a common phenomenon and the degradation of spf and associated environmental problems were extremely severe the number of relevant studies on comprehensive spf utilization dramatically increased from 1 in 1946 to 1365 in 2019 fig 3 inasmuch as the growth rates in 1995 2006 and 2013 were much greater that those in previous years scientometrics analysis therefore was conducted respectively for the periods of i 1946 1994 ii 1995 2005 iii 2006 2012 and iv 2013 2019 to better illustrate the temporal evolution of the research hotpots on comprehensive spf utilization from the perspective of the cumulative number of literature in various countries and regions in the world china contributed the most literature by 3969 articles plus reviews followed by the united states with 1551 and other countries and regions were less than 600 in terms of literature publication trends throughout the period the initial period of research was mainly concentrated in developed countries including the united states spain germany australia and the united kingdom etc after 2006 the number of literature in china completely exceeded that of the united states and grew rapidly which was determined by the large proportion of spf resources in the cultivated land resources and the adjustment of land use policies in china 3 2 an initial period of mainly focusing on slope hydrological and erosion process mechanism related to land productivity and transport of nutrients and pollutants 1946 1994 the research hotspots in this period mainly focused on spf drainage and runoff sediment nutrients and pesticides losses while emphasizing land productivity and environmental issues note here the keywords of most of the literature in this period failed to be extracted from the combined database we therefore used the high frequency key terms in the literature titles to represent the research hotspots fig 4 3 2 1 artificial drainage of spf studies on artificial drainage of spf initially aimed to understand the slope drainage mechanism by theoretical analysis and laboratory experiment verification for the purpose of maintaining the water table at an optimal depth compatible with crops climate and soil so as to improve the rooting conditions of crops and to control the salinity in irrigated arid areas thereby increasing crop yields artificial drainage of spf focused on both the shallow movement of water in the plough layer and the interflow in deeper layer parkinson and reid 1986 based on the boussinesq equation of dupuit forchheimer assumption and its modified forms as well as the two dimensional form of richards equation various analytical and numerical solutions to steady state and unsteady state drainage were obtained these solutions were also verified by some laboratory experiments based on the hele shaw model guitjens and luthin 1965 chauhan et al 1968 childs 1971 towner 1975 chapman 1980 yates et al 1985 ram and chauhan 1987 fipps and skaggs 1989 and based on the previous theories kumar et al 1994 pointed out that computer simulation technology incorporated with appropriate equations was an effective combination of drainage design parameters in most practical situations kumar et al 1994 with the support of theoretical research field plot experiments increased gradually the design of artificial drainage systems varied according to topography soil texture climate and crops planted of different regions artificial drainage systems of spf in the united states were mainly distributed in the corn belt the lake states the mississippi delta the southern coastal plains and the irrigated regions of the west including surface drainage systems and subsurface drainage systems vithayathil et al 1979 in victoria australia the effectiveness of subsurface tubes and mole drains had been proven while in western australia open drains were more suitable because of their resistance to storm runoff and seepage water mcfarlane and cox 1992 in addition the results of some field plot experiment studies showed that artificial drainage systems of spf had a good effect on reducing soil and water loss and non point source pollution such as that of nitrogen phosphorus pesticides lowery et al 1982 skaggs et al 1982 istok and kling 1983 3 2 2 runoff sediment nutrients and pesticides losses in addition to the engineering systems of artificial drainage studies on the effects of conservation tillage systems on runoff sediment nutrients and pesticides losses were also conducted since nutrients loss in spf had been identified as an important source of pollution for eutrophication and overuse of pesticides and fertilizers caused water pollution conservation tillage systems especially no tillage and reduced tillage that retain crop residues on the soil surface were thought to be the best available measures to control soil erosion and reduce nutrients and pesticides losses from spf according to some studies in the united states based on the results of simulated rainfall and natural rainfall experiments no tillage and reduced tillage greatly reduced runoff loss sediment loss and total loss of nitrogen and phosphorus soluble plus sediment transported forms compared to conventional tillage systems mcdowell and mcgregor 1984 angle et al 1984 laflen and tabatabai 1984 andraski et al 1985 zhu et al 1989 but for clay loam no tillage did not significantly reduce runoff amounts chichester and richardson 1992 studies on pesticides loss found that most pesticides chemicals were mainly lost through surface runoff since they had intermediate adsorption fawcett et al 1994 the results of related studies showed that conservation tillage systems effectively reduced pesticides runoff ritter et al 1974 baker et al 1978 baker and johnson 1979 felsot et al 1990 however when extreme rainfall is occurring after pesticides application or due to the poor water permeability of the soil itself the loss of pesticides runoff from conservation tillage systems may be equal to or greater than that of conventional tillage systems fawcett et al 1994 3 3 a period of aiming at achieving grain yield increase and preventing soil degradation adopting models and tracer techniques as the main method 1995 2005 the research hotpots in this period mainly focused on agroforestry systems soil nutrients and spatial variation models and tracer techniques on tillage erosion and the typical research region is loess plateau the cluster names were extracted from the literature titles and the keywords in each cluster were closely related fig 5 in addition to the close relationship between keywords in the same cluster keywords in different clusters also had strong correlations such as the sustainable analysis of agroforestry systems between the keywords tillage and system in cluster 0 and the keyword indicator in cluster 7 spatial variation of soil nutrients between the keywords nitrogen and organic matter in cluster 1 and the keyword variability in cluster 3 tillage erosion models between the keyword soil erosion in cluster 2 and the keywords usle and rusle in cluster 5 etc 3 3 1 agroforestry systems agroforestry systems combining trees with crops or pastures had been widely used to improve soil fertility of spf and increase agricultural income and were mainly distributed in africa tropical asia and latin america the research in this period mainly focused on land productivity and technologies with soil and water conservation functions and the research region was mainly concentrated in southern africa in southern africa an agroforestry project initiated by the international center for research in agroforestry icraf in 1987 to solve the problems of low soil fertility low crop and livestock production low income and shortages of fuelwood and timber in spf in this region the research results of this project mainly included the following five aspects 1 soil fertility improvement technologies such as intercropping of food crops with coppicing trees annual relay intercropping and biomass transfer technologies were developed 2 nitrogen fixing and fast growing tree shrub species were used to solve soil fertility problems of short term fallow 3 tree fodder banks were established to increase fodder production 4 rotational woodlots were developed to meet fuelwood and timber demand 5 indigenous fruits were researched and planted to solve the food shortage problem and increase income in addition this project pointed out that future research must be closely linked to key local and national policies and gis and rs should also be used to determine the spatial target of soil fertility practice kwesiga et al 2003 another review of the biophysical interactions of agroforestry systems in southern africa suggested that future research should focus on 1 development of technologies of high value fruit pole and medicinal trees that can be integrated with crops 2 more research on the potential of interspecific and intraspecific genetic variation 3 development and verification of models of belowground biophysical interactions 4 more research on large spatial scales 5 the combination of biophysical interactions with socioeconomic factors rao et al 1997 as a spf utilization system agroforestry is important not only in terms of agricultural sustainability but also in issues related to climate change a review of carbon sequestration in tropical agroforestry systems indicated that implementing agroforestry systems on a global scale over the next 50 years can remove a large amount of carbon 1 1 2 2 pg from the atmosphere but at the same time carbon stocks in agroforestry systems and its ultimate impacts on the global climate were full of uncertainties in addition methods for estimating carbon stocks and trace gas balances such as nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 needed to be improved as well as prediction models adapted to future climate and land use changes albrecht and kandji 2003 3 3 2 soil nutrients and spatial variation field plot experiments geostatistical methods and models were mainly used in studies of soil nutrients in this period represented by studies on the effects of land use changes on soil nutrients in china land use policies such as household contract responsibility system and green for grain project were the main reasons for land use changes in china the results of studies on the relationship between soil nutrients and land use changes at the small watershed scale in the loess plateau region showed that the soil nutrients of woodland shrubland and grassland were higher than those of spf and spf with soil organic matter som content less than 0 44 should be converted to woodland and grassland and the simplified prediction models of soil nutrients combined with the key value of som can improve agricultural practices and provide useful information for sustainable land use wang et al 2001 2003 the results of studies on the spatial variation of soil nutrients by using geostatistical methods in zunhua county china showed that land use changes have a greater impact on available phosphorus and a less impact on available potassium and further research should be conducted on the threshold range of phosphate fertilizer that can ensure crop growth and environmental safety guo et al 2001 in addition a study using a model to estimate the global soil nutrients budgets of soil nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k of major crops showed that severe nutrient deficits of n p and k are widespread in developing and underdeveloped countries and many developed countries also faced the problem of soil nutrient depletion due to high yields and declining use of chemical fertilizers tan et al 2005 in addition to studies of spatial variation of soil nutrients geostatistical methods combined with gis also provided technical support for studies of spatial variation of soil heavy metals lin et al 2002 lin 2002 3 3 3 models and tracer techniques on tillage erosion tillage erosion was originally thought to have only indirect effects on soil erosion some studies have shown that tillage causes significant soil redistribution and the erosion and sedimentation rates caused by tillage may be more important than the erosion and sedimentation rates caused by water and wind erosion tillage erosion should be considered as an important erosion process high tillage erosion rates of spf were mainly related to the development of mechanized agriculture during this period researchers had conducted studies on mechanized tillage erosion in some countries and regions such as the united states spain and belgium lindstrom et al 1992 govers et al 1994 lobb et al 1995 van oost et al 2005 and 137cs technique were widely used in the quantitative evaluation of tillage translocation and tillage erosion rates in the highlands of asia and africa due to the insufficient development of mechanization and the limitation of steep slope topography manual tillage was the main tillage method some studies of physical tracing methods also showed that tillage erosion has a greater contribution to the total soil erosion and slope and tillage methods are the main influencing factors turkelboom et al 1997 nyssen et al 2000 zhang et al 2004 in addition models had also been applied in studies of tillage erosion lobb et al developed a soil redistribution model by tillage erosion in topographically complex upland landscapes of southwestern ontario lobb and gary kachanoski 1999 studies on erosion models mainly focused on assessing the applicability of the universal soil loss equation usle and the revised universal soil loss equation rusle on the small watershed scale of various countries and regions in the world such as central highlands of kenya central croatia the three gorge area of china etc and combination with gis can more conveniently predict potential erosion on large spatial scales angima et al 2003 basic et al 2004 shi et al 2004 cohen et al 2005 based on usle warren et al studied the accuracy of the 3 dimensional enhanced unit stream power erosion and deposition usped model in the prediction of soil erosion and sediment deposition the results showed that the simulation results of two of the three locations were acceptable compared to field estimates warren et al 2005 3 3 4 typical region of spf the loess plateau region in china the loess plateau region is a typical region of spf in china it is known for the history of long agricultural and serious soil and water losses has unique landform features for a long time the inappropriate utilization of spf had caused serious soil erosion and land productivity decline therefore rational land management and vegetation restoration were the keys to improve the ecological environment in this region during this period studies on the changes of spf utilization in the loess plateau region were in preliminary exploration and the research scales were mainly field plots and small watersheds soil erosion soil moisture soil fertility and modelling the processes of water flow and sediment transportation were the main focus during this period zhang et al 1998 fu et al 2003 stolte et al 2003 fan et al 2005 3 4 a transitional period of aiming at the governance and rational utilization of spf and gradually transforming to a large regional scale 2006 2012 the research hotpots in this period mainly focused on soil organic carbon soc models and large scale research on tillage erosion and land use changes in typical regions compared with the previous period 1995 2005 the growth rates of high frequency keywords such as impact climate change carbon vegetation land use and catchment were faster the relationship between different clusters is closer which is mainly reflected in the impact of tillage erosion on soc between the keywords organic carbon and sequestration in cluster 0 and the keyword soil erosion in cluster 1 and the impact of ecological restoration in the loess plateau region on soc between the keywords land use organic carbon and sequestration in cluster 0 and the keyword reforestation in cluster 4 fig 6 3 4 1 soil organic carbon soc studies on soc in spf mainly focused on two aspects land use changes and soil erosion soc is an important component of soil giving strong support for improving crop production and quality in addition soc as a vital component of global carbon stocks acts a pivotal part in the global carbon cycle fang et al 2012 the united nations convention on climate change unfccc and its kyoto protocol and other united nations conventions to combat desertification and on biodiversity all recognize the importance of soc and point to the need for quantification of soc stocks and changes milne et al 2007 land use changes are an important factor affecting the biogeochemical cycling of soc according to the ipcc report 1 6 pg of carbon was emitted into the atmosphere per year from land use changes which was the second largest source of the increased atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide after 7 2 pg c emitted from fossil fuel use solomon et al 2007 a large number of studies had been conducted on the impacts of land use changes on soc at small watershed regional and national scales goidts and van wesemael 2007 chaplot et al 2010 han et al 2010 don et al 2011 due to the spatial variability of soc regional soc contents and stocks data can help to assess soc sequestration potential the environmental tracers 137cs and 210pb were widely used to predict the distribution of soc 137cs and 210pb moved by the same physical mechanisms and 137cs and 210pb can be used to predict the spatial distribution of soc li et al 2006 2007 martinez et al 2010 most of the research results showed that the conversion of spf to woodland and grassland will increase the net sequestration rate of soc but as the number of years increased the net sequestration rate of soc tended to decrease minasny et al 2011 the effect of soil redistribution process and erosion caused by tillage on the distribution and loss of soc was also a main focus of research on soc in spf the processes of land use changes were different in each country and region 3 4 2 models and large scale research on tillage erosion tillage erosion was still a research hotspot in this period and it had been considered as an important factor that limits crop yields worldwide and leads to soil quality degradation papiernik et al 2007 the soil distribution caused by different tillage methods the impact of primary tillage operations and the assessment of tillage erosion rates were still the research directions while the different crops cereal potato and olive secondary and tertiary tillage operations effects of soil erosion on soil properties and productivity the effects of conservation tillage measures had also been studied in more depth and directions li et al 2007a tiessen et al 2007 barneveld et al 2009 papiernik et al 2009 su et al 2010 great progresses had also been made in models including the improvement and verification of previous tillage erosion models and the establishment of new tillage erosion models such as the directional tillage erosion model dirtillem li et al 2007b dupin et al 2009 li et al 2009 in addition the development of gis also provided technical support for the research of tillage erosion su et al 2012 it is worth noting that the research on large scale european and world scale tillage erosion by van oost et al had received high attention and one of which was published in science van oost et al 2007 van oost et al 2009 3 4 3 land use changes in typical regions land use changes had received a lot of attentions during this period represented by developing countries such as china and india including the loess plateau region the yellow river basin and southern india grain for green project was the main focus of researchers in china and around the world a great number of studies had been conducted in the loess plateau region since the grain for green project launched in 1999 this project proposed that all steep spf steeper than 15 be converted to woodland and grassland while local farmers will receive grain from the government to reduce food losses caused by the farmland reduction chen et al 2007 conservation tillage measures soil properties soil water storage soil nutrients and ecological benefits were the main research contents of this land use conversion project gong et al 2006 wang et al 2007a chen et al 2010 feng et al 2010 jiao et al 2011 in the yellow river basin agricultural activities have been very frequent since ancient times to provide food for the growing population the forest was cut down tuning for the agricultural utilization of spf while causing serious land degeneration to establish a sustainable land use system rs and gis were used to analyze the landscape pattern of soil distribution the spatial pattern and driving factors of land use and the eco environmental vulnerability of the entire river basin wang et al 2007b 2008 2010 and in southern india land use changes were mainly restricted by topographic condition and social demand a large number of forests had been cut down for farmland resulting in land degradation and severe erosion agroforestry system had proven to be a sustainable agricultural system suitable for this region and the design of agroforestry systems and the selection of tree species were the main concerns of researchers prasad et al 2010 nath et al 2011 3 5 a new period of aiming at achieving agricultural sustainable development adopting multi disciplinary research methods and focusing on global change and ecological restoration 2013 2019 the research hotpots in this period mainly focused on soil and water conservation water use efficiency and ecological restoration compared with the previous period 2006 2012 the high frequency keyword ecological service increased 38 times and the growth rates of high frequency keywords such as climate change organic carbon loess plateau and sediment were also faster from the perspective of the relationship of keywords between different clusters ecological restoration was closely related to the other three clusters and ecological restoration had an important impact on studies of land use soil erosion soil nutrients and climate change fig 7 3 5 1 soil and water conservation land use change and climate change impact on soil erosion erosion and sediment quantitative evaluation and conservation and management measures were the main concerns of soil and water conservation on spf in this period land use change has been a key factor affecting soil erosion it will change the regional runoff characteristics and climatic conditions a great number of studies on different scales plots watersheds regions and countries had been conducted in various countries and regions in the world anh et al 2014 wang et al 2016b brandolini et al 2018 cheng et al 2018 climate change directly or indirectly affects soil erosion through rainfall characteristics temperature changes and human activities the results of the fifth assessment report of ipcc showed that there had been significant changes in global average precipitation and surface temperature and these changes were very likely to continue in the 21st century ipcc 2014 the combination of climate models and soil erosion models can predict future changes in soil erosion which can help to formulate regional and national soil and water conservation and environmental protection policies teng et al 2018 in the research of erosion and sediment quantitative evaluation with the rapid development of computer technology various erosion and sediment models had been developed applied and verified hessel et al 2014 di stefano et al 2016 zi et al 2016 in addition the radionuclide tracing techniques 137cs 7be 210pb 239pu and 240pu the isotope tracing techniques the rare earth elements rees tracing techniques were also important research methods agata et al 2015 alewell et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 in terms of conservation and management measures no tillage straw mulching and grass hedges were widely used soil and water conservation measures in addition management measures with regional characteristics and high economic value had also been studied such as the organic tillage combined with winter cover crops and residue mulching in korea and the cross slope barrier soil and water conservation csb swc techniques in sub saharan africa arnhold et al 2014 wolka et al 2018 3 5 2 water use efficiency studies on water use efficiency are related to global food security inherent low soil fertility combined with inappropriate tillage measures are the main reasons for low crop productivity in arid and semi arid areas various countries and regions of the world had conducted studies on water use efficiency such as sustainable utilization of spf by supplementary irrigation and

period in china studies on a series of ecological restoration programs launched by the government are no longer mainly focused on the loess plateau region but on other regions such as northern china the karst regions of southwest china the beijing tianjin sand source region the qinghai tibetan plateau and xinjiang wu et al 2013 yang et al 2014 deng et al 2016 li et al 2016 wang et al 2016c tong et al 2017 on a global scale due to the global environmental changes caused by natural and human activities ecological restoration can curb the trend of land degradation and biodiversity loss and studies on ecological restoration in various regions of the world are also increasing such as the eroded marly gullies in france the high altitude semi arid rangeland ecosystems in central iran and the global meta analysis erktan et al 2013 barral et al 2015 raiesi and salek gilani 2018 3 6 temporal changes of comprehensive spf utilization blocks with different colors are scattered to aggregate clearly showing that the research on comprehensive spf utilization has developed from a single discipline to a multi disciplinary integration the keywords co word networks in three periods from 1995 to 2005 2006 2012 and 2013 2019 each occupies a column and are horizontally connected by stream fields showing the evolution of keywords clusters over time fig 8 take the evolution of the keywords soil translocation and soil conservation in 1995 2005 as examples from 1995 to 2005 tillage erosion caused by soil translocation was mainly concentrated in the agricultural field and then in 2006 2012 its research developed with 137cs technique and the application of gis and finally transformed into multi disciplinary fields such as soil science environmental science and ecology represented by the keywords runoff nitrogen soil organic carbon and ecosystem service soil conservation systems mainly focused on agricultural production issues from 1995 to 2005 and then in 2006 2012 its focus was on water erosion including the application of gis from 2013 2019 it gradually changed to research on environmental and ecological issues such as runoff and nutrients losses carbon sequestration and environmental and economic impacts in terms of research methods the early research on comprehensive spf utilization were based on field plot experiments and laboratory analyses the high frequency keywords from 2006 to 2012 included methods such as 137cs technique gis and models which are also the mainstream methods for spf research today the isotope tracing techniques the rare earth elements rees tracing techniques the fingerprinting methods the large spatial scale regional national and global models big data analysis artificial intelligence ai and machine learning and interdisciplinary methods provide new technical support for sustainable agricultural development and policy making zhang et al 2017 2019 sharma et al 2018 wang et al 2018 zeraatpisheh et al 2019 in addition it is worth noting that soil microbe should be quite hot topic in spf however it was not found to be high frequency keyword the soil environment consists of a huge microbial diversity in which the biological components of the soil are present and active soil microbe has significant effects on nutrients availability and soil carbon cycle so they play an important role in the soil ecosystem park et al 2014 studies on the biogeochemical and microbiological reactions of soil erosion and the role of microbe in the process of soil carbon cycling are of great significance for the interpretation of soil microscopic mechanisms 4 conclusion the hotspots methods and scales of relevant studies on comprehensive spf utilization have been gradually developed from unicity to diversity the early research hotspots of comprehensive spf utilization mainly focused on land productivity improvement and hydrological and erosion processes various countries and regions highlighted regional characteristics in the research on soil fertility improvement and measures to deal with soil erosion and with the continuous development of globalization research oriented on environmental issues such as soil degradation caused by land use and global climate change became a common concern sustainable soil and water conservation measures had become the core of research on the rational utilization of spf the research scales extended from field plots small watersheds to the typical regions and the whole world with the continuous intercross and penetration between disciplines there are new technologies such as informatization digitization and intellectualization that are emerging in the research methods in this field in future research interdisciplinary development will promote more innovative research

10337,sloping farmland spf is an important component of cultivated land resources in the context of food security and sustainable agricultural development comprehensive spf utilization has drawn wide and increasing attentions a systematic analysis on the research progress of comprehensive spf utilization is critical for a better understanding of the sustainable agricultural cultivation facilitating the macroeconomic decision making this paper conducted a quantitative analysis of literature related to comprehensive spf utilization over the past few decades 1946 2019 by using scientometrics methods with the objectives to 1 identify the research hotspots and summarize the relevant research processes in different time periods 2 reveal the temporal evolution of those hotspots our results showed 1 research on spf dramatically increased over the past few decades 1946 2019 which can be classified into four chronological periods i ii iii and iv 2 research regarding land productivity improvement and hydrological and erosion processes on spf were dominant in the period i 3 the research hotspots were switched to land use changes and associated soil erosion response ecological disturbance and restoration as the social demand was intensifying in the period ii 4 the research focus of period iii was aiming at the governance and rational utilization of spf and gradually transforming to a large regional scale 5 the intercross and penetration between disciplines had been continuously enhanced in the period iv and the application of high and new technologies had also promoted the diversification of research methods with aims to achieve sustainable agricultural development although considerable progress had been achieved around the world more theoretical and empirical studies are required to understand the comprehensive spf utilization and their implications to better support sustainable agricultural development keywords sloping farmland comprehensive utilization scientometrics research hotspots 1 introduction sloping farmland spf is a compound ecological system that providing numerical cultivated resources and is significantly affected both by natural processes and anthropic activities the area of spf in china is 3824 hm2 which can account for 28 35 of the total cultivated land area ding et al 2017 however a lot of environmental problems such as severe soil erosion non point pollution land degradation and even natural disasters have been occurring in the past few decades due to the intensified and inappropriate exploitation of spf tao et al 2003 ziadat and taimeh 2013 ma et al 2016 the appropriate utilization of spf therefore is of importance to reach the tradeoff between mining the valuable soil and water resources while maintaining their high productivity to meet the increasing global food demand and sustainable agricultural development lal 2018 the fundamental first step of such tradeoff was to throughout quantify the characteristics of comprehensive spf utilization for formulating agricultural sustainable development strategies and ecological system promotion worldwide numerous studies had been conducted about sediment sources transports and distributions nutrients cycling and hydrological processes on spf as well as their effects on soil health and water body biederman and harpole 2013 regues and nadal romero 2013 chen et al 2016 rochelle newall et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 the early research on spf were mainly related to land productivity which was significantly declined due to the loss of topsoil and soil nutrients that induced by severe soil erosion on the spf where slope was instable and environmental attributes were fragile in this period field plots with different sizes hydrological and erosion models across various scales and tracing techniques were widely deployed kumar et al 1994 ciesiolka et al 1995 hashim et al 1995 lal 1998 angima et al 2003 boix fayos et al 2006 with the growth of global population and rapid economic growth other research aspects relevant ecological restoration conservation agriculture organic carbon soil amendment and climate change gradually attracted attentions and became the research hotpots requiring multi disciplinary intersections and integrations doetterl et al 2016 wang et al 2016a de la rosa et al 2018 sun et al 2018 peng et al 2019 teravest et al 2019 with advent of geographic information system gis remote sensing rs artificial intelligence ai big data analysis more sophisticatedly physical based models were available and the research scales were not limited to field plots and small watersheds but extended to typical regions and even global scale monreal et al 1997 wei et al 2016 li et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 emphases on comprehensive spf utilization are varying across different countries and regions the united states has a leading position in hydrological and erosion process mechanisms models development and application studies in china have gone through a shift from meeting food demand of the growing population and increasing productivity as the main goals to environmental protection strategies such as returning spf to woodland and grassland while in southeast asia the design and quantitative evaluation of agroforestry systems are the main research focus therefore a macro scale quantitative analysis on the research of spf over different time and regional scales is urgent to better support the sustainable agriculture development and to benefit the efficient region to region incorporations and communications the recent development of scientometrics methods offers an excellent opportunity to conduct such macro scale analysis and even to visualize the temporal evolution of research progresses amongst those tools citespace a java based citation network analysis tool launched by drexel university has become extensively used for mining and analyzing scientific literature data due to its ability to efficiently display the emerging trends in the scientific development li and chen 2016 the objectives of this study are to make a comprehensive and systematic scientometrics review of the related research on comprehensive spf utilization specifically this study focuses on the research hotspots and trends on comprehensive spf utilization in different periods by analyzing the keywords co word network and evolution mapping of keywords co word clusters the guidance and implications that provided in the end would benefit future policy oriented research on sustainable agricultural utilization of spf in the future 2 material and methods 2 1 data collection and processing the literature retrieval source came from the web of science wos core collection science citation index expanded sci e our query was created by using field tag ts boolean operators or parentheses quotation marks and wildcards as shown in fig 1 the quotation marks were used to look for exact phrases and the wildcards were used to find plural and other forms of the words the final dataset of our study was based on two datasets the core dataset cd and the expanded dataset ed the core dataset cd was obtained through a topic retrieval in the wos to cover as much literature as possible a large number of retrieval terms were used in the query at the same time to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the retrieval results the retrieved literature had been strictly reviewed and filtered the method of obtaining the expanded dataset ed was shown in fig 1 and the data were de duplicated and filtered again for the core dataset cd and the expanded dataset ed only the literature types of articles and reviews were retained and all records of each data authors title source author keywords abstract cited references etc were downloaded in plain text format and integrated into citespace for scientometrics analysis it is worth noting that author keywords refer to the keywords listed by the author in each literature the final combined dataset consisted of 8482 articles and reviews between 1946 and 2019 and based on this combined dataset a scientific metrological evaluation of comprehensive spf utilization was carried out 2 2 scientometrics analysis most of the analysis in our study was conducted by citespace 5 6 r2 citespace is a multivariate time series and dynamic citation visualization analysis software and it has gradually developed in the context of scientometrics data and information visualization it is concentrated on analyzing the basic knowledge contained in the scientific literature on comprehensive spf utilization and could be used to analyze and visualize co citation networks particularly this study used the visual images of citespace to show the research hotspots and frontiers of comprehensive spf utilization at different development periods citespace uses color coded nodes and links to distinguish the combined networks of which each year in the combined dataset is assigned a different color and nodes are formed as tree rings with different colors in keywords co word analysis the node size reflects the number of occurrences of a certain keyword and the wider the tree ring of a certain year the more occurrences of the corresponding year the link color represents the time when the two keywords first appeared together and the thickness represents the number of times the two keywords appear together it is worth noting that the nodes in keywords co word analysis of different periods were set to the same size parameter values to show the time changing trends 3 results and discussion 3 1 the overall knowledge evolution of comprehensive spf utilization spf is mainly distributed in areas with relatively poor production conditions and fragile ecological environment resulting in its low soil quality and challenge to be sustainably maintained comprehensive spf utilization is affected by social economic and environmental changes throughout the entire period 1946 2019 the research hotspots of comprehensive spf utilization had gradually shifted from slope hydrological and erosion processes nutrients loss and pollutants migration to the critical social and environmental issues such as land use changes ecological restoration and global climate change the processes and mechanisms of soil erosion including surface runoff and interflow have always been the focus and difficulty of spf research the research scales had gradually transitioned from soil water interface and field plots to watersheds and even global scale fig 2 the rapid development of high and new technologies such as gis rs ai and big data analysis etc had facilitated the research of large spatial scale models compared to developing and underdeveloped countries the research hotspots of spf in the developed countries was switched to environmental issues much earlier emphasizing the joint development of high productivity and sustainable land use and focusing on the revolutions of key and innovative technologies in developing countries represented by china that returning spf to woodland and grassland was the main ecological restoration strategy and research hotspot and these countries had also become the main research areas in underdeveloped countries land reclamation on steep slopes was still a common phenomenon and the degradation of spf and associated environmental problems were extremely severe the number of relevant studies on comprehensive spf utilization dramatically increased from 1 in 1946 to 1365 in 2019 fig 3 inasmuch as the growth rates in 1995 2006 and 2013 were much greater that those in previous years scientometrics analysis therefore was conducted respectively for the periods of i 1946 1994 ii 1995 2005 iii 2006 2012 and iv 2013 2019 to better illustrate the temporal evolution of the research hotpots on comprehensive spf utilization from the perspective of the cumulative number of literature in various countries and regions in the world china contributed the most literature by 3969 articles plus reviews followed by the united states with 1551 and other countries and regions were less than 600 in terms of literature publication trends throughout the period the initial period of research was mainly concentrated in developed countries including the united states spain germany australia and the united kingdom etc after 2006 the number of literature in china completely exceeded that of the united states and grew rapidly which was determined by the large proportion of spf resources in the cultivated land resources and the adjustment of land use policies in china 3 2 an initial period of mainly focusing on slope hydrological and erosion process mechanism related to land productivity and transport of nutrients and pollutants 1946 1994 the research hotspots in this period mainly focused on spf drainage and runoff sediment nutrients and pesticides losses while emphasizing land productivity and environmental issues note here the keywords of most of the literature in this period failed to be extracted from the combined database we therefore used the high frequency key terms in the literature titles to represent the research hotspots fig 4 3 2 1 artificial drainage of spf studies on artificial drainage of spf initially aimed to understand the slope drainage mechanism by theoretical analysis and laboratory experiment verification for the purpose of maintaining the water table at an optimal depth compatible with crops climate and soil so as to improve the rooting conditions of crops and to control the salinity in irrigated arid areas thereby increasing crop yields artificial drainage of spf focused on both the shallow movement of water in the plough layer and the interflow in deeper layer parkinson and reid 1986 based on the boussinesq equation of dupuit forchheimer assumption and its modified forms as well as the two dimensional form of richards equation various analytical and numerical solutions to steady state and unsteady state drainage were obtained these solutions were also verified by some laboratory experiments based on the hele shaw model guitjens and luthin 1965 chauhan et al 1968 childs 1971 towner 1975 chapman 1980 yates et al 1985 ram and chauhan 1987 fipps and skaggs 1989 and based on the previous theories kumar et al 1994 pointed out that computer simulation technology incorporated with appropriate equations was an effective combination of drainage design parameters in most practical situations kumar et al 1994 with the support of theoretical research field plot experiments increased gradually the design of artificial drainage systems varied according to topography soil texture climate and crops planted of different regions artificial drainage systems of spf in the united states were mainly distributed in the corn belt the lake states the mississippi delta the southern coastal plains and the irrigated regions of the west including surface drainage systems and subsurface drainage systems vithayathil et al 1979 in victoria australia the effectiveness of subsurface tubes and mole drains had been proven while in western australia open drains were more suitable because of their resistance to storm runoff and seepage water mcfarlane and cox 1992 in addition the results of some field plot experiment studies showed that artificial drainage systems of spf had a good effect on reducing soil and water loss and non point source pollution such as that of nitrogen phosphorus pesticides lowery et al 1982 skaggs et al 1982 istok and kling 1983 3 2 2 runoff sediment nutrients and pesticides losses in addition to the engineering systems of artificial drainage studies on the effects of conservation tillage systems on runoff sediment nutrients and pesticides losses were also conducted since nutrients loss in spf had been identified as an important source of pollution for eutrophication and overuse of pesticides and fertilizers caused water pollution conservation tillage systems especially no tillage and reduced tillage that retain crop residues on the soil surface were thought to be the best available measures to control soil erosion and reduce nutrients and pesticides losses from spf according to some studies in the united states based on the results of simulated rainfall and natural rainfall experiments no tillage and reduced tillage greatly reduced runoff loss sediment loss and total loss of nitrogen and phosphorus soluble plus sediment transported forms compared to conventional tillage systems mcdowell and mcgregor 1984 angle et al 1984 laflen and tabatabai 1984 andraski et al 1985 zhu et al 1989 but for clay loam no tillage did not significantly reduce runoff amounts chichester and richardson 1992 studies on pesticides loss found that most pesticides chemicals were mainly lost through surface runoff since they had intermediate adsorption fawcett et al 1994 the results of related studies showed that conservation tillage systems effectively reduced pesticides runoff ritter et al 1974 baker et al 1978 baker and johnson 1979 felsot et al 1990 however when extreme rainfall is occurring after pesticides application or due to the poor water permeability of the soil itself the loss of pesticides runoff from conservation tillage systems may be equal to or greater than that of conventional tillage systems fawcett et al 1994 3 3 a period of aiming at achieving grain yield increase and preventing soil degradation adopting models and tracer techniques as the main method 1995 2005 the research hotpots in this period mainly focused on agroforestry systems soil nutrients and spatial variation models and tracer techniques on tillage erosion and the typical research region is loess plateau the cluster names were extracted from the literature titles and the keywords in each cluster were closely related fig 5 in addition to the close relationship between keywords in the same cluster keywords in different clusters also had strong correlations such as the sustainable analysis of agroforestry systems between the keywords tillage and system in cluster 0 and the keyword indicator in cluster 7 spatial variation of soil nutrients between the keywords nitrogen and organic matter in cluster 1 and the keyword variability in cluster 3 tillage erosion models between the keyword soil erosion in cluster 2 and the keywords usle and rusle in cluster 5 etc 3 3 1 agroforestry systems agroforestry systems combining trees with crops or pastures had been widely used to improve soil fertility of spf and increase agricultural income and were mainly distributed in africa tropical asia and latin america the research in this period mainly focused on land productivity and technologies with soil and water conservation functions and the research region was mainly concentrated in southern africa in southern africa an agroforestry project initiated by the international center for research in agroforestry icraf in 1987 to solve the problems of low soil fertility low crop and livestock production low income and shortages of fuelwood and timber in spf in this region the research results of this project mainly included the following five aspects 1 soil fertility improvement technologies such as intercropping of food crops with coppicing trees annual relay intercropping and biomass transfer technologies were developed 2 nitrogen fixing and fast growing tree shrub species were used to solve soil fertility problems of short term fallow 3 tree fodder banks were established to increase fodder production 4 rotational woodlots were developed to meet fuelwood and timber demand 5 indigenous fruits were researched and planted to solve the food shortage problem and increase income in addition this project pointed out that future research must be closely linked to key local and national policies and gis and rs should also be used to determine the spatial target of soil fertility practice kwesiga et al 2003 another review of the biophysical interactions of agroforestry systems in southern africa suggested that future research should focus on 1 development of technologies of high value fruit pole and medicinal trees that can be integrated with crops 2 more research on the potential of interspecific and intraspecific genetic variation 3 development and verification of models of belowground biophysical interactions 4 more research on large spatial scales 5 the combination of biophysical interactions with socioeconomic factors rao et al 1997 as a spf utilization system agroforestry is important not only in terms of agricultural sustainability but also in issues related to climate change a review of carbon sequestration in tropical agroforestry systems indicated that implementing agroforestry systems on a global scale over the next 50 years can remove a large amount of carbon 1 1 2 2 pg from the atmosphere but at the same time carbon stocks in agroforestry systems and its ultimate impacts on the global climate were full of uncertainties in addition methods for estimating carbon stocks and trace gas balances such as nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 needed to be improved as well as prediction models adapted to future climate and land use changes albrecht and kandji 2003 3 3 2 soil nutrients and spatial variation field plot experiments geostatistical methods and models were mainly used in studies of soil nutrients in this period represented by studies on the effects of land use changes on soil nutrients in china land use policies such as household contract responsibility system and green for grain project were the main reasons for land use changes in china the results of studies on the relationship between soil nutrients and land use changes at the small watershed scale in the loess plateau region showed that the soil nutrients of woodland shrubland and grassland were higher than those of spf and spf with soil organic matter som content less than 0 44 should be converted to woodland and grassland and the simplified prediction models of soil nutrients combined with the key value of som can improve agricultural practices and provide useful information for sustainable land use wang et al 2001 2003 the results of studies on the spatial variation of soil nutrients by using geostatistical methods in zunhua county china showed that land use changes have a greater impact on available phosphorus and a less impact on available potassium and further research should be conducted on the threshold range of phosphate fertilizer that can ensure crop growth and environmental safety guo et al 2001 in addition a study using a model to estimate the global soil nutrients budgets of soil nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k of major crops showed that severe nutrient deficits of n p and k are widespread in developing and underdeveloped countries and many developed countries also faced the problem of soil nutrient depletion due to high yields and declining use of chemical fertilizers tan et al 2005 in addition to studies of spatial variation of soil nutrients geostatistical methods combined with gis also provided technical support for studies of spatial variation of soil heavy metals lin et al 2002 lin 2002 3 3 3 models and tracer techniques on tillage erosion tillage erosion was originally thought to have only indirect effects on soil erosion some studies have shown that tillage causes significant soil redistribution and the erosion and sedimentation rates caused by tillage may be more important than the erosion and sedimentation rates caused by water and wind erosion tillage erosion should be considered as an important erosion process high tillage erosion rates of spf were mainly related to the development of mechanized agriculture during this period researchers had conducted studies on mechanized tillage erosion in some countries and regions such as the united states spain and belgium lindstrom et al 1992 govers et al 1994 lobb et al 1995 van oost et al 2005 and 137cs technique were widely used in the quantitative evaluation of tillage translocation and tillage erosion rates in the highlands of asia and africa due to the insufficient development of mechanization and the limitation of steep slope topography manual tillage was the main tillage method some studies of physical tracing methods also showed that tillage erosion has a greater contribution to the total soil erosion and slope and tillage methods are the main influencing factors turkelboom et al 1997 nyssen et al 2000 zhang et al 2004 in addition models had also been applied in studies of tillage erosion lobb et al developed a soil redistribution model by tillage erosion in topographically complex upland landscapes of southwestern ontario lobb and gary kachanoski 1999 studies on erosion models mainly focused on assessing the applicability of the universal soil loss equation usle and the revised universal soil loss equation rusle on the small watershed scale of various countries and regions in the world such as central highlands of kenya central croatia the three gorge area of china etc and combination with gis can more conveniently predict potential erosion on large spatial scales angima et al 2003 basic et al 2004 shi et al 2004 cohen et al 2005 based on usle warren et al studied the accuracy of the 3 dimensional enhanced unit stream power erosion and deposition usped model in the prediction of soil erosion and sediment deposition the results showed that the simulation results of two of the three locations were acceptable compared to field estimates warren et al 2005 3 3 4 typical region of spf the loess plateau region in china the loess plateau region is a typical region of spf in china it is known for the history of long agricultural and serious soil and water losses has unique landform features for a long time the inappropriate utilization of spf had caused serious soil erosion and land productivity decline therefore rational land management and vegetation restoration were the keys to improve the ecological environment in this region during this period studies on the changes of spf utilization in the loess plateau region were in preliminary exploration and the research scales were mainly field plots and small watersheds soil erosion soil moisture soil fertility and modelling the processes of water flow and sediment transportation were the main focus during this period zhang et al 1998 fu et al 2003 stolte et al 2003 fan et al 2005 3 4 a transitional period of aiming at the governance and rational utilization of spf and gradually transforming to a large regional scale 2006 2012 the research hotpots in this period mainly focused on soil organic carbon soc models and large scale research on tillage erosion and land use changes in typical regions compared with the previous period 1995 2005 the growth rates of high frequency keywords such as impact climate change carbon vegetation land use and catchment were faster the relationship between different clusters is closer which is mainly reflected in the impact of tillage erosion on soc between the keywords organic carbon and sequestration in cluster 0 and the keyword soil erosion in cluster 1 and the impact of ecological restoration in the loess plateau region on soc between the keywords land use organic carbon and sequestration in cluster 0 and the keyword reforestation in cluster 4 fig 6 3 4 1 soil organic carbon soc studies on soc in spf mainly focused on two aspects land use changes and soil erosion soc is an important component of soil giving strong support for improving crop production and quality in addition soc as a vital component of global carbon stocks acts a pivotal part in the global carbon cycle fang et al 2012 the united nations convention on climate change unfccc and its kyoto protocol and other united nations conventions to combat desertification and on biodiversity all recognize the importance of soc and point to the need for quantification of soc stocks and changes milne et al 2007 land use changes are an important factor affecting the biogeochemical cycling of soc according to the ipcc report 1 6 pg of carbon was emitted into the atmosphere per year from land use changes which was the second largest source of the increased atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide after 7 2 pg c emitted from fossil fuel use solomon et al 2007 a large number of studies had been conducted on the impacts of land use changes on soc at small watershed regional and national scales goidts and van wesemael 2007 chaplot et al 2010 han et al 2010 don et al 2011 due to the spatial variability of soc regional soc contents and stocks data can help to assess soc sequestration potential the environmental tracers 137cs and 210pb were widely used to predict the distribution of soc 137cs and 210pb moved by the same physical mechanisms and 137cs and 210pb can be used to predict the spatial distribution of soc li et al 2006 2007 martinez et al 2010 most of the research results showed that the conversion of spf to woodland and grassland will increase the net sequestration rate of soc but as the number of years increased the net sequestration rate of soc tended to decrease minasny et al 2011 the effect of soil redistribution process and erosion caused by tillage on the distribution and loss of soc was also a main focus of research on soc in spf the processes of land use changes were different in each country and region 3 4 2 models and large scale research on tillage erosion tillage erosion was still a research hotspot in this period and it had been considered as an important factor that limits crop yields worldwide and leads to soil quality degradation papiernik et al 2007 the soil distribution caused by different tillage methods the impact of primary tillage operations and the assessment of tillage erosion rates were still the research directions while the different crops cereal potato and olive secondary and tertiary tillage operations effects of soil erosion on soil properties and productivity the effects of conservation tillage measures had also been studied in more depth and directions li et al 2007a tiessen et al 2007 barneveld et al 2009 papiernik et al 2009 su et al 2010 great progresses had also been made in models including the improvement and verification of previous tillage erosion models and the establishment of new tillage erosion models such as the directional tillage erosion model dirtillem li et al 2007b dupin et al 2009 li et al 2009 in addition the development of gis also provided technical support for the research of tillage erosion su et al 2012 it is worth noting that the research on large scale european and world scale tillage erosion by van oost et al had received high attention and one of which was published in science van oost et al 2007 van oost et al 2009 3 4 3 land use changes in typical regions land use changes had received a lot of attentions during this period represented by developing countries such as china and india including the loess plateau region the yellow river basin and southern india grain for green project was the main focus of researchers in china and around the world a great number of studies had been conducted in the loess plateau region since the grain for green project launched in 1999 this project proposed that all steep spf steeper than 15 be converted to woodland and grassland while local farmers will receive grain from the government to reduce food losses caused by the farmland reduction chen et al 2007 conservation tillage measures soil properties soil water storage soil nutrients and ecological benefits were the main research contents of this land use conversion project gong et al 2006 wang et al 2007a chen et al 2010 feng et al 2010 jiao et al 2011 in the yellow river basin agricultural activities have been very frequent since ancient times to provide food for the growing population the forest was cut down tuning for the agricultural utilization of spf while causing serious land degeneration to establish a sustainable land use system rs and gis were used to analyze the landscape pattern of soil distribution the spatial pattern and driving factors of land use and the eco environmental vulnerability of the entire river basin wang et al 2007b 2008 2010 and in southern india land use changes were mainly restricted by topographic condition and social demand a large number of forests had been cut down for farmland resulting in land degradation and severe erosion agroforestry system had proven to be a sustainable agricultural system suitable for this region and the design of agroforestry systems and the selection of tree species were the main concerns of researchers prasad et al 2010 nath et al 2011 3 5 a new period of aiming at achieving agricultural sustainable development adopting multi disciplinary research methods and focusing on global change and ecological restoration 2013 2019 the research hotpots in this period mainly focused on soil and water conservation water use efficiency and ecological restoration compared with the previous period 2006 2012 the high frequency keyword ecological service increased 38 times and the growth rates of high frequency keywords such as climate change organic carbon loess plateau and sediment were also faster from the perspective of the relationship of keywords between different clusters ecological restoration was closely related to the other three clusters and ecological restoration had an important impact on studies of land use soil erosion soil nutrients and climate change fig 7 3 5 1 soil and water conservation land use change and climate change impact on soil erosion erosion and sediment quantitative evaluation and conservation and management measures were the main concerns of soil and water conservation on spf in this period land use change has been a key factor affecting soil erosion it will change the regional runoff characteristics and climatic conditions a great number of studies on different scales plots watersheds regions and countries had been conducted in various countries and regions in the world anh et al 2014 wang et al 2016b brandolini et al 2018 cheng et al 2018 climate change directly or indirectly affects soil erosion through rainfall characteristics temperature changes and human activities the results of the fifth assessment report of ipcc showed that there had been significant changes in global average precipitation and surface temperature and these changes were very likely to continue in the 21st century ipcc 2014 the combination of climate models and soil erosion models can predict future changes in soil erosion which can help to formulate regional and national soil and water conservation and environmental protection policies teng et al 2018 in the research of erosion and sediment quantitative evaluation with the rapid development of computer technology various erosion and sediment models had been developed applied and verified hessel et al 2014 di stefano et al 2016 zi et al 2016 in addition the radionuclide tracing techniques 137cs 7be 210pb 239pu and 240pu the isotope tracing techniques the rare earth elements rees tracing techniques were also important research methods agata et al 2015 alewell et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 in terms of conservation and management measures no tillage straw mulching and grass hedges were widely used soil and water conservation measures in addition management measures with regional characteristics and high economic value had also been studied such as the organic tillage combined with winter cover crops and residue mulching in korea and the cross slope barrier soil and water conservation csb swc techniques in sub saharan africa arnhold et al 2014 wolka et al 2018 3 5 2 water use efficiency studies on water use efficiency are related to global food security inherent low soil fertility combined with inappropriate tillage measures are the main reasons for low crop productivity in arid and semi arid areas various countries and regions of the world had conducted studies on water use efficiency such as sustainable utilization of spf by supplementary irrigation and reasonable fertilization in the mountainous areas of india combined applications of fertilizer micro dosing technology and hill placement of manure in the sahelian low input millet planting system soil and water conservation technique of ridge furrow precipitation harvesting with plastic mulching in semi arid regions of china and the potato vetch intercropping system under the rain fed semi arid conditions in inner mongolia china ibrahim et al 2015 panday et al 2018 li et al 2019 ren et al 2019 3 5 3 ecological restoration ecological restoration is also the main research hotspot in this period in china studies on a series of ecological restoration programs launched by the government are no longer mainly focused on the loess plateau region but on other regions such as northern china the karst regions of southwest china the beijing tianjin sand source region the qinghai tibetan plateau and xinjiang wu et al 2013 yang et al 2014 deng et al 2016 li et al 2016 wang et al 2016c tong et al 2017 on a global scale due to the global environmental changes caused by natural and human activities ecological restoration can curb the trend of land degradation and biodiversity loss and studies on ecological restoration in various regions of the world are also increasing such as the eroded marly gullies in france the high altitude semi arid rangeland ecosystems in central iran and the global meta analysis erktan et al 2013 barral et al 2015 raiesi and salek gilani 2018 3 6 temporal changes of comprehensive spf utilization blocks with different colors are scattered to aggregate clearly showing that the research on comprehensive spf utilization has developed from a single discipline to a multi disciplinary integration the keywords co word networks in three periods from 1995 to 2005 2006 2012 and 2013 2019 each occupies a column and are horizontally connected by stream fields showing the evolution of keywords clusters over time fig 8 take the evolution of the keywords soil translocation and soil conservation in 1995 2005 as examples from 1995 to 2005 tillage erosion caused by soil translocation was mainly concentrated in the agricultural field and then in 2006 2012 its research developed with 137cs technique and the application of gis and finally transformed into multi disciplinary fields such as soil science environmental science and ecology represented by the keywords runoff nitrogen soil organic carbon and ecosystem service soil conservation systems mainly focused on agricultural production issues from 1995 to 2005 and then in 2006 2012 its focus was on water erosion including the application of gis from 2013 2019 it gradually changed to research on environmental and ecological issues such as runoff and nutrients losses carbon sequestration and environmental and economic impacts in terms of research methods the early research on comprehensive spf utilization were based on field plot experiments and laboratory analyses the high frequency keywords from 2006 to 2012 included methods such as 137cs technique gis and models which are also the mainstream methods for spf research today the isotope tracing techniques the rare earth elements rees tracing techniques the fingerprinting methods the large spatial scale regional national and global models big data analysis artificial intelligence ai and machine learning and interdisciplinary methods provide new technical support for sustainable agricultural development and policy making zhang et al 2017 2019 sharma et al 2018 wang et al 2018 zeraatpisheh et al 2019 in addition it is worth noting that soil microbe should be quite hot topic in spf however it was not found to be high frequency keyword the soil environment consists of a huge microbial diversity in which the biological components of the soil are present and active soil microbe has significant effects on nutrients availability and soil carbon cycle so they play an important role in the soil ecosystem park et al 2014 studies on the biogeochemical and microbiological reactions of soil erosion and the role of microbe in the process of soil carbon cycling are of great significance for the interpretation of soil microscopic mechanisms 4 conclusion the hotspots methods and scales of relevant studies on comprehensive spf utilization have been gradually developed from unicity to diversity the early research hotspots of comprehensive spf utilization mainly focused on land productivity improvement and hydrological and erosion processes various countries and regions highlighted regional characteristics in the research on soil fertility improvement and measures to deal with soil erosion and with the continuous development of globalization research oriented on environmental issues such as soil degradation caused by land use and global climate change became a common concern sustainable soil and water conservation measures had become the core of research on the rational utilization of spf the research scales extended from field plots small watersheds to the typical regions and the whole world with the continuous intercross and penetration between disciplines there are new technologies such as informatization digitization and intellectualization that are emerging in the research methods in this field in future research interdisciplinary development will promote more innovative research

10338,improving the utilization efficiency of rainwater resources was a key issue for apple orchards in semi arid areas the rcip sa system combined rainwater collection systems infiltration promoting tube and soil anti seepage layer to gather limited rainwater resources into the soil layer where the roots of apple tree were concentrated to evaluate the effect of the rcip sa system on soil moisture change and fine root distribution a field experiment was completed in a hilly apple orchard on the loess plateau of china from 2017 to 2019 the results showed that the soil moisture of the rcip sa system was 24 0 43 9 higher than ck in the 0 60 cm soil layer in the rainwater collection ditch and generated a larger area with higher moisture content near the impermeable layer during the apple tree growth period the rcip sa system also expanded the dense distribution zone of apple tree roots the dry fine root densities of apple trees in the rcip sa system in the 0 200 cm soil layer was 11 7 59 6 and 18 2 30 3 higher than ck under the plastic film 60 cm from the trunk and edge of the rainwater collection ditch 100 cm from the trunk respectively soil moisture and root distribution of apple trees were significantly different under different impermeable layers and compacted red clay as the impermeable layer was the best anti seepage strategy in rcip sa systems the rcip sa system brought higher economic benefits the average yield per tree was recorded for red clay compaction treatment 38 1 kg tree 1 equating to a production level of 22 800 kg ha 1 and a difference of 9 6 kg tree 1 with ck treatment equating to 5700 kg ha 1 this strategy should be recommended as an agricultural measurement for apple production on the loess plateau of china graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil

2011 the world population was expected to increase from 6 7 billion 2005 to 9 billion by 2050 fao 2013 which will stress current agricultural production system and water resources hussain et al 2019 singh 2014 agriculture was the main consumer of water 80 90 and since the 1950s global water demand had tripled and freshwater resources have been drastically reduced gleick 2003 under such circumstances expanding agricultural land and using non conventional water resources will help stabilize food security and avoid environmental and land degradation fargione et al 2008 hussain et al 2019 the arid and semi arid regions accounted for 41 of the earth s surface and 38 of the population and were important areas for current and future agricultural production huang and shao 2019 reynolds et al 2007 however in arid and semi arid regions such as the middle east north africa and the loess plateau of china water shortage was still the main factor limiting agricultural production alcamo et al 2007 fedoroff et al 2010 huang and gallichand 2006 zhong et al 2019 the high yield of cash crops was still overly dependent on large amounts of irrigation and fertilization to obtain high returns fernández 2014 fernández and cuevas 2010 the demand for sustainable agricultural water in arid regions had forced the researchers to develop new methods and ideas to improve water use efficiency and increase the use of unconventional water such as groundwater extraction and rainwater harvesting huang et al 2001 kool et al 2014 qadir et al 2010 tejero et al 2011 wang et al 2020 apple trees malus pumila mill were an important crop in the semi arid loess plateau of china du et al 2017 in 2017 the total yield of apple trees on the loess plateau was reaching 1892 5 million tons accounting for about 22 8 of the world s apple production national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 2018 fao 2018 due to the high altitude sufficient light and large temperature differences between day and night the apples had appealing color and fragrance wang et al 2020 however fruit tree water consumption via transpiration and soil water evaporation in the loess plateau were both large which often produced water stress that restricts growth and development of fruit trees ruiz sanchez et al 2005 wang et al 2015 zhang and wang 2018 currently orchard water saving technologies are mainly focused on irrigation technologies such as sprinkler irrigation subsurface and surface drip irrigation and alternate partial root zone irrigation bianco and francaviglia 2012 van donk et al 2013 parvizi et al 2014 faci et al 2014 neilsen et al 2015 however due to limited irrigation water small planting area usually 1 ha and large elevation changes at least 30 m these irrigation techniques were difficult to use on the loess plateau song et al 2017 rainwater was the only source of soil moisture on the loess plateau improving the efficiency of rainwater utilization in arid areas will not only promote vegetation restoration but also reduce soil erosion relieve desertification and improve the ecosystem in arid areas oweis 2017 there were two main reasons for the low utilization of rainwater on the loess plateau the first was the uneven seasonal distribution of rainfall which resulted in low effective precipitation and large evapotranspiration in spring and early summer and intense precipitation with severe soil erosion from july to october heard et al 2012 wang et al 2020 the second was that loessi orthic primosols had high sand content large porosity and strong air and water conductivity and the rainwater evapotranspiration and infiltration were both fast therefore the soil cannot effectively concentrate the water in the root zone of the fruit trees shi and shao 2000 in response to these problems rainwater collection technology has been introduced into hilly apple orchards on the loess plateau in recent years li et al 2017 applied ridge with plastic film and ditch rain collection technology in luochuan and mizhi and it was found that the moisture of the 0 60 cm soil layer increased by 20 9 and 22 5 respectively song et al 2018 found that a rainwater collection and infiltration system significantly increased the soil moisture content θ in deep soils and changed the fine roots distribution of apple trees during the rainy season the rainwater collection system greatly increased the infiltration of rainwater which caused the rainwater and nutrients to leave the root zone and infiltrate into deeper soil layers suo et al 2019 previous studies have placed a plastic film at 60 80 cm from the rainwater collection and infiltration system to block water penetration song et al 2017 however plastic films were not easy to recycle large scale application of plastic films will cause soil pollution al salem et al 2009 li et al 2020 to replace the plastic film this study proposed to establish an impermeable layer to reduce or block soil water infiltration soil compaction can modify the pore system impacts the transport properties of the pore system and effectively prevent water from infiltrating into the lower layer hakansson and lipiec 2000 kulli et al 2003 weiler and naef 2003 alaoui and helbling 2006 found that compaction of soil by load traffic caused a reduction of soil structure in the top 0 10 m layer of soil and prevented water from flowing away from the compaction sites lipiec and hatano 2003 quantitatively described the effects of soil compaction on soil physical properties and water transport and the results showed that soil structural discontinuity caused by compaction has substantial effects on the entire soil water cycle and crop root growth richard et al 2001 conducted experiments comparing differences in compaction on silty soil and found that for water potentials 20 kpa the compacted layer retained more water than the uncompacted layer however previous studies had focused on soil surface compaction caused by human factors and the effect of this process on soil structure porosity kulli et al 2003 alaoui and helbling 2006 lu et al 2019 thierfelder and wall 2009 such as compaction damage of soil under cereal crop yield radford et al 2001 sugar beet koch et al 2008 forage maize nevens and reheul 2003 and grassland hargreaves et al 2019 there has been less research focused on the impact of soil compaction technology on water infiltration and redistribution in the root soil layer with rainwater collection systems its feasibility and actual effect have not been verified this study combined rainwater collection systems and an infiltration promoting tube with soil anti seepage layer rcip sa to collect rainwater for the root area of apple trees to reduce the evapotranspiration of soil water and reduce or block the infiltration of soil water to deep soil if successful this should increase the duration during which the limited rainwater resources concentrate around the roots of fruit trees and improve the soil water regulation ability the purpose of this study was to 1 investigated the effects of rcip sa on soil moisture change and fine root distribution in apple orchards on semi arid areas of the loess plateau and 2 compared the anti seepage effects of different impervious layers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted at the mizhi experimental station of northwest a f university located within the hill and gully region of the loess plateau in china n38 08 32 e109 57 20 altitude 986 1012 m this area is characterized as mid temperate and semi arid with a dry climate and strong evaporation the total annual radiation is 580 5 kj cm 2 the annual average temperature is 8 5 and annual accumulated effective temperature 10 c of 3281 c the frost free period is 156 170 d and the annual precipitation is 451 6 mm the seasonal distribution of rainfall is not uniform april to june is the dry season where the precipitation is minimal and most precipitation events are less than 5 mm and july to september is the rainy season and the precipitation during this time accounts for more than 60 of the total annual precipitation and is mostly in the form of heavy rain 2017 was an abundantly rainy year and rainfall of the experimental orchard was 516 3 mm during the apple tree growing season 2018 and 2019 were normal years as rainfall was 473 2 mm and 466 8 mm respectively fig 1 fuji apple trees were planted in april 2008 at a spacing of 4 3 m2 the soil type is loessal soil loessi orthic primosols with a sandy loam texture soil bulk density is 1 20 1 35 g cm 3 field water capacity is 22 25 wilting humidity is 3 5 5 soil stable humidity is 10 25 13 0 and ph is 8 91 the groundwater is deep mostly below 50 m and generally is not linked to surface water circulation most roots were found at depths of 20 60 cm while some fine roots were found as deep as 120 cm wang et al 2020 2 2 brief introduction to rcip sa systems the rcip sa system consists of an arc shaped ridge which is centered on the trunk with a length of 100 cm on one side and a height of 20 cm in the middle the 0 01 m thick black plastic film along the ridge is covered 10 cm of plastic film around the trunk is removed to allow the trunk runoff to infiltrate it could prevent the trunk from rooting and reduces resistance a rainwater ditch is created with a depth of 20 cm and a width of 20 cm and is built on the edge of the plastic film the ditch is covered with plant residue straw weeds branches and organic fertilizer an impervious layer thick of 5 cm and a width of 40 cm 60 cm below the ditch is set to retain the collected moisture in the root zone which improves the water supply to the apple tree an infiltration promoting tube is placed in the ditch directly opposite the trunk to help drainage the infiltration promoting tube is comprised of a tube covered with an aerating cap 5 0 cm in diameter 1 5 cm high the tube was 2 6 cm in diameter and 0 4 m long with 16 uniform holes drilled through the sides diameter 1 0 cm the bottom of the tube was beveled to facilitate insertion into the soil graphical abstract 2 3 experimental design and treatments apple tree roots are mainly concentrated in the soil 0 60 cm sokalska et al 2009 the depth of 60 cm was selected because the roots of the upper layer are densely distributed within that layer and the roots of the lower layer dropped sharply below that depth song et al 2017 wang et al 2020 to obtain more water in the root concentration area the impermeable layer was arranged in 60 cm depth in this research five types of treatments were selected for apple trees with the same age growth and management measures and none of the selected trees showed evidence of pests there were twenty apple trees in each treatment with each of the five trees treated as a plot and repeated four times the ck treatment does not have the rcip sa system for the rainwater collection system without soil compaction treatment l1 the ditch was dug to 65 cm and backfilled with loessal soil the rcip sa system for the loessal soil compaction treatment l2 the loessal soil was crushed removed impurities sieved through a 0 5 cm 0 5 cm sieve and then moistened and dried with the soil until the soil moisture content reached 15 20 the treated soil was flattened to 65 cm at the rainwater ditch with a thickness of 5 cm and it was compacted to 2 5 cm by manual compaction then an additional 5 cm of soil was spread on the compacted layer compacted to 2 5 cm for a total thickness of 5 cm and then backfilled with loessal soil for the rcip sa system with the red clay treatment r1 a ditch was dug to 65 cm and 5 cm of red clay was used as impermeable layer without soil compaction and then backfill with loessal soil for the rcip sa with red clay compaction treatment r2 the processing soil was red clay the compaction process was the same as for l2 the specific parameters of impermeable layers are detailed in table 1 the infiltration rate f mm min 1 for each treatment was calculated as 1 f 10 v a t where v is the amount of infiltration water ml a is the area of the inner ring in this a 314 2 cm2 and t is time min 2 4 field sampling and test methods to study the effects that the rcip sa system had on water storage volumetric soil moisture content θ was measured using time domain reflectometry tdr noborio 2001 pariva et al 2012 steven et al 2012 two probes each 60 cm long were arranged in the rain collection ditch 10 cm from the infiltration tube ck was 100 cm away from the trunk every 3 4 days the θ was measured by tdr and repeated three times to analyze the influence of the rcip sa system on the vertical distribution of θ at different locations we arranged 200 cm neutron tubes in the rainwater collection ditch 10 cm from the infiltration tube 100 cm from the trunk under the plastic film between the ditch and trunk 40 cm from the infiltration tube and between the rows in the middle of two rows of trees 100 cm away from the rainwater collection ditch and at the same locations and distances in the ck treatment every 10 15 d θ was measured by a neutron moisture analyzer unit measurement depth was 10 cm the neutron probe θ measurements of the top soil layers were limited so the θ of 0 40 cm depth were determined by the soil drying method total number of measurements n was 54 and measurement time was the same as the neutron tube measurement time to explore the effect of the rcip sa system on apple tree root growth we measured the density of fine roots diameter less than 2 mm in the 0 200 cm soil layer soil samples containing fine roots were collected using luoyang shovel a luoyang shovel has an inner diameter of 0 16 m a unit depth of 10 cm and a maximum depth of 10 m it is simple to use and easy to carry and is widely used in the collection of deep soils in soil science studies and archaeological excavation ma et al 2012 in october 2019 after the fruit was harvested root sampling boreholes were drilled the fine root in the edge of the rainwater collection ditch 100 cm from the trunk and under the plastic film 60 cm from the trunk which was near the location that the θ was measured each sample was 20 cm in depth subsequently the fine root in the soil sample were isolated thoroughly washed and dried to determine the dry weight of the fine roots the root biomass expressed by root density g m 3 of soil ma et al 2013 song et al 2017 fruits of all test trees were harvested on october 20 each year and the average value was calculated as yield per tree a small campbell scientific weather station situated in the orchard measured climate data such as temperature and precipitation 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 calculations of

table is below 10 m 0 4 0 5 and 0 1 are the ratio of the area occupied by between the row under plastic film and rainwater collection ditch respectively we assume that soil moisture in the same soil layer is uniform at the same location 2 5 2 statistical analysis the data was analyzed with a one way analysis of variance anova using spss v 21 0 the number of samples between groups was equal so the turkey s multiple range tests with p 0 05 was applied when normality and homogeneity of variance assumptions were satisfied otherwise the equivalent non parametric test was used to compare each group kolmogorov smirnov k s method was used for normality testing and kruskal wallis test p 0 05 was used for non parametric testing 3 results 3 1 variation of soil moisture fig 2 shows the θ of 0 60 cm soil layer average changes in rainwater ditch during the growth period april october in the apple orchards from 2017 to 2019 the average θ during the total observation period in the 0 60 cm of ck l1 l2 r1 and r2 in the rainwater ditches were 13 1 16 2 17 0 18 0 and 18 8 respectively the results showed that the rcip sa system could improve the soil water environment of apple tree root zone in the semi arid area of loess plateau in china and the type of impermeable layer also had an evident effect on the θ of the rcip sa system during the dry season when there was less rainfall from 1 april to 20 july 2017 from 1 april to 30 june 2018 from 1 april to 21 july 2019 there was no significant difference in θ between treatments p 0 05 however the θ of all treatments was significantly higher than that of the ck p 0 05 during the rainy season from 21 july to 26 october 2017 from 8 july to 27 september 2018 and from 21 july to 15 october 2019 the differences in treatments became apparent after higher daily precipitation occurred when rainfall was heavy and continuous the θ in each treatment in the rainwater ditches was approached to saturation after that due to different impermeable layers the θ difference between each treatment gradually increased in the rainy season analysis of the four groups of data found that the θ of r2 was significantly higher than l1 and l2 p 0 05 but r2 was not significantly higher than r1 p 0 05 the average θ in l1 l2 r1 and r2 were 24 0 30 0 38 2 and 43 9 higher than ck respectively this result also showed that r2 s impermeable layer was the most effective followed by r1 and then l2 table 2 shows soil moisture statistics in the rainwater ditch rcd and under the plastic film upf from 2017 to 2019 overall the presence of rcip sa increased the θ at 0 100 cm at the rainwater ditch and 60 100 cm under the plastic film in the rainwater ditch the θ at 60 100 cm in l1 treatment was significantly higher than in the ck r1 and r2 treatments these indicated that the impermeable layer of r2 effectively blocked infiltration of rainwater and in l1 without an impermeable layer water was infiltration into the deeper soil layers there was no significant difference in θ in the 100 200 cm soil layer between treatments under the plastic film the θ in 0 60 cm soil layer of l1 l2 r1 and r2 compared with ck increased by 0 94 0 88 0 99 and 0 96 respectively however there were no significant differences between the treatments which indicated that the plastic film increased the surface θ and the impervious layer had no effect on the θ of 0 60 cm soil layer in 60 100 cm soil layer the θ of r2 was significantly higher than ck and l1 increasing by 3 9 and 1 8 respectively this was due to the impervious layer blocking water infiltration and causing more water lateral flow in summary the r2 treatment was most effective at increasing soil moisture to further explored changes in θ we calculated the vertical distribution of mean θ and cv in the rainwater ditch and under the plastic film fig 3 in the rainwater ditch over the total observation period fig 3a and b the 0 60 cm θ of all treatments increased rapidly with the deepening of the soil layer it can be attributed to the combination of the rainwater collection ditch and infiltration tube which increased water flow to the 60 cm soil layer thereby increasing the deep water content and reducing the water evaporation in the 65 135 cm soil layer the θ of l2 r1 and r2 all dropped rapidly and the θ of l2 and ck dropped slowly which was because different impermeable layers had different effects when blocking rainwater below the 140 cm layer the θ of all treatments was close to ck under the plastic film during the dry season fig 3d the 0 120 cm θ of all treatments was significantly higher than that of ck p 0 05 and there were no significant difference between treatments this may indicate that the increase in soil moisture was mainly due to mulching and rainwater collection and the impermeable layer had little effect under the film in the dry season during the rainy season fig 3e because the plastic film blocked direct contact between rainwater and the soil surface the θ of the 0 40 cm soil layer in all treatments was lower than that of ck however the θ in the 60 140 cm soil layer was higher than in ck and the greatest increase in θ was in the r2 treatment which was due to the lateral infiltration of the rainwater collection ditch these phenomena again established that r2 s impermeable layer was the most effective followed by r1 and then l2 the cv at 0 60 cm in the rainwater ditch fig 3c and at 60 100 cm under the plastic film fig 3f increased with use of the rcip sa system this suggests the rcip sa system produced distinct lateral infiltration of water and increased the maximum of θ the cv of θ under the plastic film fig 3f at 0 40 cm soil layer was distinctly lower than that of the ck this may be because the plastic film blocked rainwater infiltration and soil evaporation which increased the stability of soil moisture to investigate whether the rcip sa system impacted θ in different locations we compared the average θ of 0 200 cm in three places the rainwater collection ditch under the plastic film and between the rows from table 3 comparison between treatments sig 1 of table 3 throughout the whole apple growing season the θ of all treatments at the ditch and under the plastic film was significantly greater compared to ck which is the same as table 2 and fig 3 but the θ between the rows was not significantly different to ck which indicated that the rcip sa system did not affect the θ between the rows comparison between locations sig 2 of table 3 the θ at the rainwater collection ditch was significantly higher than the θ between the rows in all treatments in the dry season the θ under the plastic film was significantly higher than the θ between the rows after entering the rainy season θ had no significant difference between the θ under the plastic film and the θ between the rows the rcip sa system had a significant impact on water processes in the orchard in theory six times as much rain flowed to the catchment ditch this water quickly infiltrated to reach 40 cm soil depth due to the infiltration promoting tube and then once infiltrated the water moved throughout the soil profile when rainwater infiltrating to 60 cm depth only a small amount of the rainwater penetrated the impermeable layer and infiltrated vertically and most of the water remained in the soil or flowed laterally to the surrounding soil the water retained in the soil was lost through evaporation transpiration and absorbed and utilized by apple trees and plastic film prevents water evaporation above the impermeable layer 0 60 cm soil layer compared with the ck the increment of water storage in the rainwater collecting ditch in l1 l2 r1 and r2 increased by 26 3 32 7 41 1 and 47 2 mm respectively table 4 while there was no difference under the plastic film and between rows in water storage under the impermeable layer 60 200 cm soil layer compared with the ck the increment of water storage in rainwater catchments of l1 l2 and r1 increased by 46 2 33 2 and 11 3 mm respectively while r2 decreased by 2 2 mm it was due to the different effects of impermeable layer types in preventing vertical water infiltration compared with the ck r2 showed the largest increase in water storage under plastic film which increased by 26 3 mm compared with ck it indicating that r2 had the greatest lateral water movement however there was little difference in lateral water movement between the rows et values in all treatments were significantly lower than ck and the et values in r2 were reduced by 15 3 mm it may be caused by plastic film prevented the evaporation and rain water infiltrated into the deep layers to slow down evaporation in the rainwater collection ditch this occurred in spite of the water consumption by apple tree transpiration 3 2 root distribution the vertical fine root distributions of different treatments under the plastic film 60 cm from the trunk are shown in figs 4 a and 5 a the dry root densities in the 0 200 cm soil profile were 295 5 327 5 381 0 and 422 2 g m 3 in l1 l2 r1 and r2 which were 11 7 23 8 44 0 and 59 6 higher than the dry root density of ck respectively this indicated that the rcip sa system effectively promoted the development of fine roots of apple trees on dry soil in the 0 60 cm soil layer there was no significant difference in root dry weight between all treatments and ck p 0 05 however the root dry weight varied significantly between treatments at 60 120 cm soil layer and the dry root densities in l1 l2 r1 and r2 were 53 6 91 4 201 4 and 271 6 higher than the ck at 60 120 cm soil layer respectively in the 60 80 cm soil layer the root dry weights of all treatments were significantly higher than ck p 0 05 and r1 and r2 were significantly higher than l1 and l2 respectively in the 80 120 cm soil layer except for l1 the root dry weight of all treatments was significantly higher than ck p 0 05 and there were significant differences in root dry weights in all treatments except between l1 and l2 which were not significantly different under 120 cm the dry density of all treatments was small and the difference was not significant at the edge of the rainwater collection ditch 100 cm from the trunk the dry root densities in the 0 200 cm soil profile were 239 3 242 5 258 0 and 263 9 g m 3 in l1 l2 r1 and r2 respectively which were 18 2 19 7 27 4 and 30 3 higher than the dry root density of ck respectively figs 4 b and 5 b the dry root weight of each treatment was significantly lower than under the plastic film this can be attributed greater distance from the roots to the trunk being greater than the distance from the trunk under the plastic film in the 0 20 cm soil layer there was no significant difference in root dry weights between all treatments and ck p 0 05 the difference in fine root dry weight occurred in the 20 60 cm soil layer between treatments the root dry weight of r2 was significantly higher than that of other treatments except r1 and the root dry weight of l1 was not significantly higher than that of ck below 60 cm the root dry weights of all treatments were close to the ck overall the rcip sa system increased the dry root densities of apple trees in the 60 120 cm layer under the plastic film and the dry root densities in the 20 60 cm layer at the rainwater collection ditch this result showed that the change of fine root distribution of different treatments was consistent with the change in soil moisture it was because fruits tree roots growth trends in the soil were mainly determined by water and nutrients and they tend to grew into soil layers rich in water and nutrients tanasescu and paltineanu 2004 sokalska et al 2009 3 3 yield and economic benefits table 5 shows that the rcip sa system consistently produced higher apple yields and net incomes compared to ck over the 3 years of this study and the economic benefit brought by rcip sa system was greater than its cost the order of production and total income from high to low was r2 r1 l2 l1 however l2 s net income was slightly lower than l1 due to higher costs this result proved that apple yields could be significantly increased by rainwater collection and infiltration promotion measures p 0 05 and apple yields could be higher after the soil infiltration prevention measures were introduced average apple yield per four trees was significantly higher with r2 than the ck at the 5 significance level for each year of the experiment the average yield per tree was recorded for r2 38 1 kg tree 1 equating to a production level of 22 800 kg ha 1 and a difference from ck of 9 6 kg tree 1 and a production of level 5700 kg ha 1 table 4 average net income was more than 153 per tree with r2 equating to a net income level of 91 800 ha 1 it was a statistically significant increase of 19 800 ha 1 over the ck at the 5 level for each year of the experiment regression analysis of yield and fine root showed that there was a positive correlation between yield and fine root density and the yield increased with the increase of root density fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 variation of soil moisture in root zone due to the lack of irrigation in arid areas rainwater resources were an important source of soil moisture and a lack of sufficient rainfall limited soil productivity kurothe et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 improving the efficiency of rainwater harvesting in the field through tillage techniques was becoming increasingly important in many parts of the world yue et al 2020 oweis 2017 salem et al 2014 hu et al 2014 found that rainwater harvesting systems could increase topsoil temperature and lead better growth at the early plant growth stage oweis 2007 found that rainwater harvesting could substantially increase rainwater productivity and reduce irrigation costs in west asia and north africa salem et al 2014 found that reservoir tillage on rainwater harvesting could reduce surface runoff by about 61 and the sediment yield concentration by about 79 in spain in semi arid regions shallow soil moisture was mainly affected by rainfall land surface evaporation seneviratne et al 2010 yang et al 2014 huang and shao 2019 soil water infiltration characteristics have been shown to be affected by many factors such as soil texture bulk density and water stable aggregates sahrawat et al 2010 margaret and peter 2014 in this study in rcip sa system the ridge with plastic film could not only reduce soil evaporation under the canopy in the dry season but also collect precipitation through the plastic film reduce the contact surface between water and soil and enable rainwater to be concentrated to improve infiltration in addition the infiltration promoting tube and plant residues effectively promoted rainwater infiltration into the deeper soil and reduced the surface runoff compared with l1 l2 r1 and r2 treatments increased θ 6 0 14 2 and 19 9 at the rainwater collection ditch respectively the presence of the impervious layer further increased the θ this result was consistent with those observed by other researchers jin et al 2018 suo et al 2014 soil compaction forced the soil aggregates closer together changed soil structure and reduced soil porosity thereby reducing the conduction and diffusion of gas and water through the soil gleick 2003 hargreaves et al 2019 lipiec et al 2005 ishaq et al 2001 kuncoro et al 2014 4 2 choice of impermeable layer as an impermeable layer soil compaction was low cost and did not cause soil pollution it showed higher soil penetration resistance and greater water retention kulli et al 2003 etana et al 2013 pierson et al 2008 lipiec and hakansson 2000 which were the main reasons why we choosed compacted soil as an impermeable layer plastic film has low cost and good anti seepage effect and it was an anti seepage material often used in agricultural management shemdoe et al 2009 song et al 2017 however the plastic film was fragile once buried deeply it was difficult to recycle long term using in a large area can cause serious soil pollution horodytska et al 2018 ramakrishna et al 2006 the organic mulch layer formed by corn straw and other organic matter also promoted soil moisture retention tu et al 2006 siczek et al 2015 jordán et al 2010 the addition of the organic layer could increase soil carbon storage reduce co2 emissions and alleviate global warming kader et al 2017 siczek et al 2015 however the anti seepage effect of organic coverings in rcip sa systems needed further research special materials such as reflective cloth and concrete can also be used as impermeable materials with rainwater collection systems lei et al 2004 but they were relatively expensive and the recycling process was complex in this study the soil type of the impervious layer and the facility of soil source were key factors for the application of rcip sa systems in apple production the sand content and infiltration rate of red clay was lower than of loess soil table 1 which was widely available in the study area after compaction bulk density increased porosity decreased and infiltration rate was lower as a result compacted red clay as the impermeable layer was the best anti seepage strategy for rcip sa systems in the semi arid loess plateau 4 3 variation of fine root distribution to make better use of rainwater resources in arid and semi arid areas water saving systems should be designed to better concentrate rainwater in the root zone therefore it was of great significance to study the distribution of apple tree roots sandro et al 2019 found that most of the roots of macauba adult palm were concentrated up to 1 0 m depth and the roots distribution coincided with the crown projection area song et al 2018 found that apple tree fine roots were mainly distributed in the 0 2 m soil layer of all studied orchards 84 60 69 65 and 63 of the total amount of roots in trees aged 6 9 12 18 and 21 years respectively many studies also showed that the root systems of fruit trees were mainly concentrated in the 0 100 cm soil layer wahid 2001 ma et al 2013 oswaldo et al 2017 in this study the proportion of fine roots in the 0 60 cm soil layer reached 65 6 in the ck treatment and decreased rapidly after 120 cm it could be seen that the 0 60 cm soil layer may be the main area for root water absorption the key to water management in apple orchards was to promote better water absorption by the root system gong et al 2006 which was also the main reason why we added an impervious layer at 60 cm to collect rain and prevent seepage the fruit tree root system was developed and widely distributed and the growth and expansion directions may change over time according to the soil profile moisture distribution zhong et al 2019 the root system grew towards soil layers with higher moisture and nutrient content and more root systems will be concentrated in soil layers with high θ sokalska et al 2009 ma et al 2012 even small changes in moisture could have significant effects on the root system tanasescu and paltineanu 2004 our research results confirmed this conclusion in some θ elevated soil layers fine root dry weight was also increased fig 4 this supports that where water and nutrients were more readily available in the soil root systems tend to grow faster we observed that the rcip sa system increased the dry root densities of apple trees in the 60 120 cm layer under the plastic film and the dry root densities in the 20 60 cm layer at the rainwater collection ditch this showed that the rcip sa system expanded the densely distributed apple tree roots in dry soil thereby expanding the range of water and nutrients available for absorption and increased the apple trees dry root densities in some deep soil layers ping et al 2010 celia et al 2014 in the rcip sa system the vertical distribution of roots was not only different from that of the ck treatment but the total biomass was significantly higher than that of the ck treatment throughout all investigations our results were similar to those of previous research sokalska et al 2009 song et al 2017 jin et al 2018 in semi arid areas the lack of deep soil moisture was the main factor limiting the growth of fruit tree roots du et al 2017 gong et al 2006 and poor root growth will have a serious negative impact on the growth of apple trees głąb 2013 sokalska et al 2009 in this study rcip sa system was shown to promote the development of deep fine roots and help the fruit trees to absorb water and nutrients therefore it can increase fruit yield improve fruit price and economic benefits although the adoption of rain collection and infiltration promotion measures can significantly improve apple yields seepage prevention technology can also further improve yields 5 conclusions the rcip sa system could effectively increase soil moisture content in the 0 60 cm soil layer where the apple roots are concentrated and generate a larger area with a higher moisture content around the impermeable layer during the growth period of apple trees the rcip sa system also expanded the dense distribution zone of roots of apple tree increased the dry root densities of apple trees and improved apple yields and net incomes on semi arid areas of the loess plateau adding an impermeable layer could more effectively concentrate the water in the apple root area and increase the utilization rate of rainwater after the compaction operation the porosity and permeability of the red clay decreased significantly and it has better anti seepage and

10338,improving the utilization efficiency of rainwater resources was a key issue for apple orchards in semi arid areas the rcip sa system combined rainwater collection systems infiltration promoting tube and soil anti seepage layer to gather limited rainwater resources into the soil layer where the roots of apple tree were concentrated to evaluate the effect of the rcip sa system on soil moisture change and fine root distribution a field experiment was completed in a hilly apple orchard on the loess plateau of china from 2017 to 2019 the results showed that the soil moisture of the rcip sa system was 24 0 43 9 higher than ck in the 0 60 cm soil layer in the rainwater collection ditch and generated a larger area with higher moisture content near the impermeable layer during the apple tree growth period the rcip sa system also expanded the dense distribution zone of apple tree roots the dry fine root densities of apple trees in the rcip sa system in the 0 200 cm soil layer was 11 7 59 6 and 18 2 30 3 higher than ck under the plastic film 60 cm from the trunk and edge of the rainwater collection ditch 100 cm from the trunk respectively soil moisture and root distribution of apple trees were significantly different under different impermeable layers and compacted red clay as the impermeable layer was the best anti seepage strategy in rcip sa systems the rcip sa system brought higher economic benefits the average yield per tree was recorded for red clay compaction treatment 38 1 kg tree 1 equating to a production level of 22 800 kg ha 1 and a difference of 9 6 kg tree 1 with ck treatment equating to 5700 kg ha 1 this strategy should be recommended as an agricultural measurement for apple production on the loess plateau of china graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil

singh 2014 agriculture was the main consumer of water 80 90 and since the 1950s global water demand had tripled and freshwater resources have been drastically reduced gleick 2003 under such circumstances expanding agricultural land and using non conventional water resources will help stabilize food security and avoid environmental and land degradation fargione et al 2008 hussain et al 2019 the arid and semi arid regions accounted for 41 of the earth s surface and 38 of the population and were important areas for current and future agricultural production huang and shao 2019 reynolds et al 2007 however in arid and semi arid regions such as the middle east north africa and the loess plateau of china water shortage was still the main factor limiting agricultural production alcamo et al 2007 fedoroff et al 2010 huang and gallichand 2006 zhong et al 2019 the high yield of cash crops was still overly dependent on large amounts of irrigation and fertilization to obtain high returns fernández 2014 fernández and cuevas 2010 the demand for sustainable agricultural water in arid regions had forced the researchers to develop new methods and ideas to improve water use efficiency and increase the use of unconventional water such as groundwater extraction and rainwater harvesting huang et al 2001 kool et al 2014 qadir et al 2010 tejero et al 2011 wang et al 2020 apple trees malus pumila mill were an important crop in the semi arid loess plateau of china du et al 2017 in 2017 the total yield of apple trees on the loess plateau was reaching 1892 5 million tons accounting for about 22 8 of the world s apple production national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 2018 fao 2018 due to the high altitude sufficient light and large temperature differences between day and night the apples had appealing color and fragrance wang et al 2020 however fruit tree water consumption via transpiration and soil water evaporation in the loess plateau were both large which often produced water stress that restricts growth and development of fruit trees ruiz sanchez et al 2005 wang et al 2015 zhang and wang 2018 currently orchard water saving technologies are mainly focused on irrigation technologies such as sprinkler irrigation subsurface and surface drip irrigation and alternate partial root zone irrigation bianco and francaviglia 2012 van donk et al 2013 parvizi et al 2014 faci et al 2014 neilsen et al 2015 however due to limited irrigation water small planting area usually 1 ha and large elevation changes at least 30 m these irrigation techniques were difficult to use on the loess plateau song et al 2017 rainwater was the only source of soil moisture on the loess plateau improving the efficiency of rainwater utilization in arid areas will not only promote vegetation restoration but also reduce soil erosion relieve desertification and improve the ecosystem in arid areas oweis 2017 there were two main reasons for the low utilization of rainwater on the loess plateau the first was the uneven seasonal distribution of rainfall which resulted in low effective precipitation and large evapotranspiration in spring and early summer and intense precipitation with severe soil erosion from july to october heard et al 2012 wang et al 2020 the second was that loessi orthic primosols had high sand content large porosity and strong air and water conductivity and the rainwater evapotranspiration and infiltration were both fast therefore the soil cannot effectively concentrate the water in the root zone of the fruit trees shi and shao 2000 in response to these problems rainwater collection technology has been introduced into hilly apple orchards on the loess plateau in recent years li et al 2017 applied ridge with plastic film and ditch rain collection technology in luochuan and mizhi and it was found that the moisture of the 0 60 cm soil layer increased by 20 9 and 22 5 respectively song et al 2018 found that a rainwater collection and infiltration system significantly increased the soil moisture content θ in deep soils and changed the fine roots distribution of apple trees during the rainy season the rainwater collection system greatly increased the infiltration of rainwater which caused the rainwater and nutrients to leave the root zone and infiltrate into deeper soil layers suo et al 2019 previous studies have placed a plastic film at 60 80 cm from the rainwater collection and infiltration system to block water penetration song et al 2017 however plastic films were not easy to recycle large scale application of plastic films will cause soil pollution al salem et al 2009 li et al 2020 to replace the plastic film this study proposed to establish an impermeable layer to reduce or block soil water infiltration soil compaction can modify the pore system impacts the transport properties of the pore system and effectively prevent water from infiltrating into the lower layer hakansson and lipiec 2000 kulli et al 2003 weiler and naef 2003 alaoui and helbling 2006 found that compaction of soil by load traffic caused a reduction of soil structure in the top 0 10 m layer of soil and prevented water from flowing away from the compaction sites lipiec and hatano 2003 quantitatively described the effects of soil compaction on soil physical properties and water transport and the results showed that soil structural discontinuity caused by compaction has substantial effects on the entire soil water cycle and crop root growth richard et al 2001 conducted experiments comparing differences in compaction on silty soil and found that for water potentials 20 kpa the compacted layer retained more water than the uncompacted layer however previous studies had focused on soil surface compaction caused by human factors and the effect of this process on soil structure porosity kulli et al 2003 alaoui and helbling 2006 lu et al 2019 thierfelder and wall 2009 such as compaction damage of soil under cereal crop yield radford et al 2001 sugar beet koch et al 2008 forage maize nevens and reheul 2003 and grassland hargreaves et al 2019 there has been less research focused on the impact of soil compaction technology on water infiltration and redistribution in the root soil layer with rainwater collection systems its feasibility and actual effect have not been verified this study combined rainwater collection systems and an infiltration promoting tube with soil anti seepage layer rcip sa to collect rainwater for the root area of apple trees to reduce the evapotranspiration of soil water and reduce or block the infiltration of soil water to deep soil if successful this should increase the duration during which the limited rainwater resources concentrate around the roots of fruit trees and improve the soil water regulation ability the purpose of this study was to 1 investigated the effects of rcip sa on soil moisture change and fine root distribution in apple orchards on semi arid areas of the loess plateau and 2 compared the anti seepage effects of different impervious layers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted at the mizhi experimental station of northwest a f university located within the hill and gully region of the loess plateau in china n38 08 32 e109 57 20 altitude 986 1012 m this area is characterized as mid temperate and semi arid with a dry climate and strong evaporation the total annual radiation is 580 5 kj cm 2 the annual average temperature is 8 5 and annual accumulated effective temperature 10 c of 3281 c the frost free period is 156 170 d and the annual precipitation is 451 6 mm the seasonal distribution of rainfall is not uniform april to june is the dry season where the precipitation is minimal and most precipitation events are less than 5 mm and july to september is the rainy season and the precipitation during this time accounts for more than 60 of the total annual precipitation and is mostly in the form of heavy rain 2017 was an abundantly rainy year and rainfall of the experimental orchard was 516 3 mm during the apple tree growing season 2018 and 2019 were normal years as rainfall was 473 2 mm and 466 8 mm respectively fig 1 fuji apple trees were planted in april 2008 at a spacing of 4 3 m2 the soil type is loessal soil loessi orthic primosols with a sandy loam texture soil bulk

linked to surface water circulation most roots were found at depths of 20 60 cm while some fine roots were found as deep as 120 cm wang et al 2020 2 2 brief introduction to rcip sa systems the rcip sa system consists of an arc shaped ridge which is centered on the trunk with a length of 100 cm on one side and a height of 20 cm in the middle the 0 01 m thick black plastic film along the ridge is covered 10 cm of plastic film around the trunk is removed to allow the trunk runoff to infiltrate it could prevent the trunk from rooting and reduces resistance a rainwater ditch is created with a depth of 20 cm and a width of 20 cm and is built on the edge of the plastic film the ditch is covered with plant residue straw weeds branches and organic fertilizer an impervious layer thick of 5 cm and a width of 40 cm 60 cm below the ditch is set to retain the collected moisture in the root zone which improves the water supply to the apple tree an infiltration promoting tube is placed in the ditch directly opposite the trunk to help drainage the infiltration promoting tube is comprised of a tube covered with an aerating cap 5 0 cm in diameter 1 5 cm high the tube was 2 6 cm in diameter and 0 4 m long with 16 uniform holes drilled through the sides diameter 1 0 cm the bottom of the tube was beveled to facilitate insertion into the soil graphical abstract 2 3 experimental design and treatments apple tree roots are mainly concentrated in the soil 0 60 cm sokalska et al 2009 the depth of 60 cm was selected because the roots of the upper layer are densely distributed within that layer and the roots of the lower layer dropped sharply below that depth song et al 2017 wang et al 2020 to obtain more water in the root concentration area the impermeable layer was arranged in 60 cm depth in this research five types of treatments were selected for apple trees with the same age growth and management measures and none of the selected trees showed evidence of pests there were twenty apple trees in each treatment with each of the five trees treated as a plot and repeated four times the ck treatment does not have the rcip sa system for the rainwater collection system without soil compaction treatment l1 the ditch was dug to 65 cm and backfilled with loessal soil the rcip sa system for the loessal soil compaction treatment l2 the loessal soil was crushed removed impurities sieved through a 0 5 cm 0 5 cm sieve and then moistened and dried with the soil until the soil moisture content reached 15 20 the treated soil was flattened to 65 cm at the rainwater ditch with a thickness of 5 cm and it was compacted to 2 5 cm by manual compaction then an additional 5 cm of soil was spread on the compacted layer compacted to 2 5 cm for a total thickness of 5 cm and then backfilled with loessal soil for the rcip sa system with the red clay treatment r1 a ditch was dug to 65 cm and 5 cm of red clay was used as impermeable layer without soil compaction and then backfill with loessal soil for the rcip sa with red clay compaction treatment r2 the processing soil was red clay the compaction process was the same as for l2 the specific parameters of impermeable layers are detailed in table 1 the infiltration rate f mm min 1 for each treatment was calculated as 1 f 10 v a t where v is the amount of infiltration water ml a is the area of the inner ring in this a 314 2 cm2 and t is time min 2 4 field sampling and test methods to study the effects that the rcip sa system had on water storage volumetric soil moisture content θ was measured using time domain reflectometry tdr noborio 2001 pariva et al 2012 steven et al 2012 two probes each 60 cm long were arranged in the rain collection ditch 10 cm from the infiltration tube ck was 100 cm away from the trunk every 3 4 days the θ was measured by tdr and repeated three times to analyze the influence of the rcip sa system on the vertical distribution of θ at different locations we arranged 200 cm neutron tubes in the rainwater collection ditch 10 cm from the infiltration tube 100 cm from the trunk under the plastic film between the ditch and trunk 40 cm from the infiltration tube and between the rows in the middle of two rows of trees 100 cm away from the rainwater collection ditch and at the same locations and distances in the ck treatment every 10 15 d θ was measured by a neutron moisture analyzer unit measurement depth was 10 cm the neutron probe θ measurements of the top soil layers were limited so the θ of 0 40 cm depth were determined by the soil drying method total number of measurements n was 54 and measurement time was the same as the neutron tube measurement time to explore the effect of the rcip sa system on apple tree root growth we measured the density of fine roots diameter less than 2 mm in the 0 200 cm soil layer soil samples containing fine roots were collected using luoyang shovel a luoyang shovel has an inner diameter of 0 16 m a unit depth of 10 cm and a maximum depth of 10 m it is simple to use and easy to carry and is widely used in the collection of deep soils in soil science studies and archaeological excavation ma et al 2012 in october 2019 after the fruit was harvested root sampling boreholes were drilled the fine root in the edge of the rainwater collection ditch 100 cm from the trunk and under the plastic film 60 cm from the trunk which was near the location that the θ was measured each sample was 20 cm in depth subsequently the fine root in the soil sample were isolated thoroughly washed and dried to determine the dry weight of the fine roots the root biomass expressed by root density g m 3 of soil ma et al 2013 song et al 2017 fruits of all test trees were harvested on october 20 each year and the average value was calculated as yield per tree a small campbell scientific weather station situated in the orchard measured climate data such as temperature and precipitation 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 calculations of water balance parameters evapotranspiration was calculated as et δ w rainfall irrigation r f d s g δ w rcip sasystem 0 4 δ w betweentherow 0 5 δ w undertheplasticfilm 0 1 w rainwatercollectionditch where et is evapotranspiration δw is the change of growth season final minus initial in soil water storage at 0 200 cm d is the downward drainage from the apple root zone rf is surface water runoff

table is below 10 m 0 4 0 5 and 0 1 are the ratio of the area occupied by between the row under plastic film and rainwater collection ditch respectively we assume that soil moisture in the same soil layer is uniform at the same location 2 5 2 statistical analysis the data was analyzed with a one way analysis of variance anova using spss v 21 0 the number of samples between groups was equal so the turkey s multiple range tests with p 0 05 was applied when normality and homogeneity of variance assumptions were satisfied otherwise the equivalent non parametric test was used to compare each group kolmogorov smirnov k s method was used for normality testing and kruskal wallis test p 0 05 was used for non parametric testing 3 results 3 1 variation of soil moisture fig 2 shows the θ of 0 60 cm soil layer average changes in rainwater ditch during the growth period april october in the apple orchards from 2017 to 2019 the average θ during the total observation period in the 0 60 cm of ck l1 l2 r1 and r2 in the rainwater ditches were 13 1 16 2 17 0 18 0 and 18 8 respectively the results showed that the rcip sa system could improve the soil water environment of apple tree root zone in the semi arid area of loess plateau in china and the type of impermeable layer also had an evident effect on the θ of the rcip sa system during the dry season when there was less rainfall from 1 april to 20 july 2017 from 1 april to 30 june 2018 from 1 april to 21 july 2019 there was no significant difference in θ between treatments p 0 05 however the θ of all treatments was significantly higher than that of the ck p 0 05 during the rainy season from 21 july to 26 october 2017 from 8 july to 27 september 2018 and from 21 july to 15 october 2019 the differences in treatments became apparent after higher daily precipitation occurred when rainfall was heavy and continuous the θ in each treatment in the rainwater ditches was approached to saturation after that due to different impermeable layers the θ difference between each treatment gradually increased in the rainy season analysis of the four groups of data found that the θ of r2 was significantly higher than l1 and l2 p 0 05 but r2 was not significantly higher than r1 p 0 05 the average θ in l1 l2 r1 and r2 were 24 0 30 0 38 2 and 43 9 higher than ck respectively this result also showed that r2 s impermeable layer was the most effective followed by r1 and then l2 table 2 shows soil moisture statistics in the rainwater ditch rcd and under the plastic film upf from 2017 to 2019 overall the presence of rcip sa increased the θ at 0 100 cm at the rainwater ditch and 60 100 cm under the plastic film in the rainwater ditch the θ at 60 100 cm in l1 treatment was significantly higher than in the ck r1 and r2 treatments these indicated that the impermeable layer of r2 effectively blocked infiltration of rainwater and in l1 without an impermeable layer water was infiltration into the deeper soil layers there was no significant difference in θ in the 100 200 cm soil layer between treatments under the plastic film the θ in 0 60 cm soil layer of l1 l2 r1 and r2 compared with ck increased by 0 94 0 88 0 99 and 0 96 respectively however there were no significant differences between the treatments which indicated that the plastic film increased the surface θ and the impervious layer had no effect on the θ of 0 60 cm soil layer in 60 100 cm soil layer the θ of r2 was significantly higher than ck and l1 increasing by 3 9 and 1 8 respectively this was due to the impervious layer blocking water infiltration and causing more water lateral flow in summary the r2 treatment was most effective at increasing soil moisture to further explored changes in θ we calculated the vertical distribution of mean θ and cv in the rainwater ditch and under the plastic film fig 3 in the rainwater ditch over the total observation period fig 3a and b the 0 60 cm θ of all treatments increased rapidly with the deepening of the soil layer it can be attributed to the combination of the rainwater collection ditch and infiltration tube which increased water flow to the 60 cm soil layer thereby increasing the deep water content and reducing the water evaporation in the 65 135 cm soil layer the θ of l2 r1 and r2 all dropped rapidly and the θ of l2 and ck dropped slowly which was because different impermeable layers had different effects when blocking rainwater below the 140 cm layer the θ of all treatments was close to ck under the plastic film during the dry season fig 3d the 0 120 cm θ of all treatments was significantly higher than that of ck p 0 05 and there were no significant difference between treatments this may indicate that the increase in soil moisture was mainly due to mulching and rainwater collection and the impermeable layer had little effect under the film in the dry season during the rainy season fig 3e because the plastic film blocked direct contact between rainwater and the soil surface the θ of the 0 40 cm soil layer in all treatments was lower than that of ck however the θ in the 60 140 cm soil layer was higher than in ck and the greatest increase in θ was in the r2 treatment which was due to the lateral infiltration of the rainwater collection ditch these phenomena again established that r2 s impermeable layer was the most effective followed by r1 and then l2 the cv at 0 60 cm in the rainwater ditch fig 3c and at 60 100 cm under the plastic film fig 3f increased with use of the rcip sa system this suggests the rcip sa system produced distinct lateral infiltration of water and increased the maximum of θ the cv of θ under the plastic film fig 3f at 0 40 cm soil layer was distinctly lower than that of the ck this may be because the plastic film blocked rainwater infiltration and soil evaporation which increased the stability of soil moisture to investigate whether the rcip sa system impacted θ in different locations we compared the average θ of 0 200 cm in three places the rainwater collection ditch under the plastic film and between the rows from table 3 comparison between treatments sig 1 of table 3 throughout the whole apple growing season the θ of all treatments at the ditch and under the plastic film was significantly greater compared to ck which is the same as table 2 and fig 3 but the θ between the rows was not significantly different to ck which indicated that the rcip sa system did not affect the θ between the rows comparison between locations sig 2 of table 3 the θ at the rainwater collection ditch was significantly higher than the θ between the rows in all treatments in the dry season the θ under the plastic film was significantly higher than the θ between the rows after entering the rainy season θ had no significant difference between the θ under the plastic film and the θ between the rows the rcip sa system had a significant impact on water processes in the orchard in theory six times as much rain flowed to the catchment ditch this water quickly infiltrated to reach 40 cm soil depth due to the infiltration promoting tube and then once infiltrated the water moved throughout the soil profile when rainwater infiltrating to 60 cm depth only a small amount of the rainwater penetrated the impermeable layer and infiltrated vertically and most of the water remained in the soil or flowed laterally to the surrounding soil the water retained in the soil was lost through evaporation transpiration and absorbed and utilized by apple trees and plastic film prevents water evaporation above the impermeable layer 0 60 cm soil layer compared with the ck the increment of water storage in the rainwater collecting ditch in l1 l2 r1 and r2 increased by 26 3 32 7 41 1 and 47 2 mm respectively table 4 while there was no difference under the plastic film and between rows in water storage under the impermeable layer 60 200 cm soil layer compared with the ck the increment of water storage in rainwater catchments of l1 l2 and r1 increased by 46 2 33 2 and 11 3 mm respectively while r2 decreased by 2 2 mm it was due to the different effects of impermeable layer types in preventing vertical water infiltration compared with the ck r2 showed the largest increase in water storage under plastic film which increased by 26 3 mm compared with ck it indicating that r2 had the greatest lateral water movement however there was little difference in lateral water movement between the rows et values in all treatments were significantly lower than ck and the et values in r2 were reduced by 15 3 mm it may be caused by plastic film prevented the evaporation and rain water infiltrated into the deep layers to slow down evaporation in the rainwater collection ditch this occurred in spite of the water consumption by apple tree transpiration 3 2 root distribution the vertical fine root distributions of different treatments under the plastic film 60 cm from the trunk are shown in figs 4 a and 5 a the dry root densities in the 0 200 cm soil profile were 295 5 327 5 381 0 and 422 2 g m 3 in l1 l2 r1 and r2 which were 11 7 23 8 44 0 and 59 6 higher than the dry root density of ck respectively this indicated that the rcip sa system effectively promoted the development of fine roots of apple trees on dry soil in the 0 60 cm soil layer there was no significant difference in root dry weight between all treatments and ck p 0 05 however the root dry weight varied significantly between treatments at 60 120 cm soil layer and the dry root densities in l1 l2 r1 and r2 were 53 6 91 4 201 4 and 271 6 higher than the ck at 60 120 cm soil layer respectively in the 60 80 cm soil layer the root dry weights of all treatments were significantly higher than ck p 0 05 and r1 and r2 were significantly higher than l1 and l2 respectively in the 80 120 cm soil layer except for l1 the root dry weight of all treatments was significantly higher than ck p 0 05 and there were significant differences in root dry weights in all treatments except between l1 and l2 which were not significantly different under 120 cm the dry density of all treatments was small and the difference was not significant at the edge of the rainwater collection ditch 100 cm from the trunk the dry root densities in the 0 200 cm soil profile were 239 3 242 5 258 0 and 263 9 g m 3 in l1 l2 r1 and r2 respectively which were 18 2 19 7 27 4 and 30 3 higher than the dry root density of ck respectively figs 4 b and 5 b the dry root weight of each treatment was significantly lower than under the plastic film this can be attributed greater distance from the roots to the trunk being greater than the distance from the trunk under the plastic film in the 0 20 cm soil layer there was no significant difference in root dry weights between all treatments and ck p 0 05 the difference in fine root dry weight occurred in the 20 60 cm soil layer between treatments the root dry weight of r2 was significantly higher than that of other treatments except r1 and the root dry weight of l1 was not significantly higher than that of ck below 60 cm the root dry weights of all treatments were close to the ck overall the rcip sa system increased the dry root densities of apple trees in the 60 120 cm layer under the plastic film and the dry root densities in the 20 60 cm layer at the rainwater collection ditch this result showed that the change of fine root distribution of different treatments was consistent with the change in soil moisture it was because fruits tree roots growth trends in the soil were mainly determined by water and nutrients and they tend to grew into soil layers rich in water and nutrients tanasescu and paltineanu 2004 sokalska et al 2009 3 3 yield and economic benefits table 5 shows that the rcip sa system consistently produced higher apple yields and net incomes compared to ck over the 3 years of this study and the economic benefit brought by rcip sa system was greater than its cost the order of production and total income from high to low was r2 r1 l2 l1 however l2 s net income was slightly lower than l1 due to higher costs this result proved that apple yields could be significantly increased by rainwater collection and infiltration promotion measures p 0 05 and apple yields could be higher after the soil infiltration prevention measures were introduced average apple yield per four trees was significantly higher with r2 than the ck at the 5 significance level for each year of the experiment the average yield per tree was recorded for r2 38 1 kg tree 1 equating to a production level of 22 800 kg ha 1 and a difference from ck of 9 6 kg tree 1 and a production of level 5700 kg ha 1 table 4 average net income was more than 153 per tree with r2 equating to a net income level of 91 800 ha 1 it was a statistically significant increase of 19 800 ha 1 over the ck at the 5 level for each year of the experiment regression analysis of yield and fine root showed that there was a positive correlation between yield and fine root density and the yield increased with the increase of root density fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 variation of soil moisture in root zone due to the lack of irrigation in arid areas rainwater resources were an important source of soil moisture and a lack of sufficient rainfall limited soil productivity kurothe et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 improving the efficiency of rainwater harvesting in the field through tillage techniques was becoming increasingly important in many parts of the world yue et al 2020 oweis 2017 salem et al 2014 hu et al 2014 found that rainwater harvesting systems could increase topsoil temperature and lead better growth at the early plant growth stage oweis 2007 found that rainwater harvesting could substantially increase rainwater productivity and reduce irrigation costs in west asia and north africa salem et al 2014 found that reservoir tillage on rainwater harvesting could reduce surface runoff by about 61 and the sediment yield concentration by about 79 in spain in semi arid regions shallow soil moisture was mainly affected by rainfall land surface evaporation seneviratne et al 2010 yang et al 2014 huang and shao 2019 soil water infiltration characteristics have been shown to be affected by many factors such as soil texture bulk density and water stable aggregates sahrawat et al 2010 margaret and peter 2014 in this study in rcip sa system the ridge with plastic film could not only reduce soil evaporation under the canopy in the dry season but also collect precipitation through the plastic film reduce the contact surface between water and soil and enable rainwater to be concentrated to improve infiltration in addition the infiltration promoting tube and plant residues effectively promoted rainwater infiltration into the deeper soil and reduced the surface runoff compared with l1 l2 r1 and r2 treatments increased θ 6 0 14 2 and 19 9 at the rainwater collection ditch respectively the presence of the impervious layer further increased the θ this result was consistent with those observed by other researchers jin et al 2018 suo et al 2014 soil compaction forced the soil aggregates closer together changed soil structure and reduced soil porosity thereby reducing the conduction and diffusion of gas and water through the soil gleick 2003 hargreaves et al 2019 lipiec et al 2005 ishaq et al 2001 kuncoro et al 2014 4 2 choice of impermeable layer as an impermeable layer soil compaction was low cost and did not cause soil pollution it showed higher soil penetration resistance and greater water retention kulli et al 2003 etana et al 2013 pierson et al 2008 lipiec and hakansson 2000 which were the main reasons why we choosed compacted soil as an impermeable layer plastic film has low cost and good anti seepage effect and it was an anti seepage material often used in agricultural management shemdoe et al 2009 song et al 2017 however the plastic film was fragile once buried deeply it was difficult to recycle long term using in a large area can cause serious soil pollution horodytska et al 2018 ramakrishna et al 2006 the organic mulch layer formed by corn straw and other organic matter also promoted soil moisture retention tu et al 2006 siczek et al 2015 jordán et al 2010 the addition of the organic layer could increase soil carbon storage reduce co2 emissions and alleviate global warming kader et al 2017 siczek et al 2015 however the anti seepage effect of organic coverings in rcip sa systems needed further research special materials such as reflective cloth and concrete can also be used as impermeable materials with rainwater collection systems lei et al 2004 but they were relatively expensive and the recycling process was complex in this study the soil type of the impervious layer and the facility of soil source were key factors for the application of rcip sa systems in apple production the sand content and infiltration rate of red clay was lower than of loess soil table 1 which was widely available in the study area after compaction bulk density increased porosity decreased and infiltration rate was lower as a result compacted red clay as the impermeable layer was the best anti seepage strategy for rcip sa systems in the semi arid loess plateau 4 3 variation of fine root distribution to make better use of rainwater resources in arid and semi arid areas water saving systems should be designed to better concentrate rainwater in the root zone therefore it was of great significance to study the distribution of apple tree roots sandro et al 2019 found that most of the roots of macauba adult palm were concentrated up to 1 0 m depth and the roots distribution coincided with the crown projection area song et al 2018 found that apple tree fine roots were mainly distributed in the 0 2 m soil layer of all studied orchards 84 60 69 65 and 63 of the total amount of roots in trees aged 6 9 12 18 and 21 years respectively many studies also showed that the root systems of fruit trees were mainly concentrated in the 0 100 cm soil layer wahid 2001 ma et al 2013 oswaldo et al 2017 in this study the proportion of fine roots in the 0 60 cm soil layer reached 65 6 in the ck treatment and decreased rapidly after 120 cm it could be seen that the 0 60 cm soil layer may be the main area for root water absorption the key to water management in apple orchards was to promote better water absorption by the root system gong et al 2006 which was also the main reason why we added an impervious layer at 60 cm to collect rain and prevent seepage the fruit tree root system was developed and widely distributed and the growth and expansion directions may change over time according to the soil profile moisture distribution zhong et al 2019 the root system grew towards soil layers with higher moisture and nutrient content and more root systems will be concentrated in soil layers with high θ sokalska et al 2009 ma et al 2012 even small changes in moisture could have significant effects on the root system tanasescu and paltineanu 2004 our research results confirmed this conclusion in some θ elevated soil layers fine root dry weight was also increased fig 4 this supports that where water and nutrients were more readily available in the soil root systems tend to grow faster we observed that the rcip sa system increased the dry root densities of apple trees in the 60 120 cm layer under the plastic film and the dry root densities in the 20 60 cm layer at the rainwater collection ditch this showed that the rcip sa system expanded the densely distributed apple tree roots in dry soil thereby expanding the range of water and nutrients available for absorption and increased the apple trees dry root densities in some deep soil layers ping et al 2010 celia et al 2014 in the rcip sa system the vertical distribution of roots was not only different from that of the ck treatment but the total biomass was significantly higher than that of the ck treatment throughout all investigations our results were similar to those of previous research sokalska et al 2009 song et al 2017 jin et al 2018 in semi arid areas the lack of deep soil moisture was the main factor limiting the growth of fruit tree roots du et al 2017 gong et al 2006 and poor root growth will have a serious negative impact on the growth of apple trees głąb 2013 sokalska et al 2009 in this study rcip sa system was shown to promote the development of deep fine roots and help the fruit trees to absorb water and nutrients therefore it can increase fruit yield improve fruit price and economic benefits although the adoption of rain collection and infiltration promotion measures can significantly improve apple yields seepage prevention technology can also further improve yields 5 conclusions the rcip sa system could effectively increase soil moisture content in the 0 60 cm soil layer where the apple roots are concentrated and generate a larger area with a higher moisture content around the impermeable layer during the growth period of apple trees the rcip sa system also expanded the dense distribution zone of roots of apple tree increased the dry root densities of apple trees and improved apple yields and net incomes on semi arid areas of the loess plateau adding an impermeable layer could more effectively concentrate the water in the apple root area and increase the utilization rate of rainwater after the compaction operation the porosity and permeability of the red clay decreased significantly and it has better anti seepage and

10339,seawater desalination process is analyzed in this paper as an option for reducing the groundwater usage of overexploited aquifers in irrigated agriculture the proposed approach is based on a new superstructure formulated as a multiobjective mixed integer nonlinear programming model where power requirements of the desalination process and agriculture activity are supplied by an integrated steam rankine cycle fed of solar energy and fossil fuels the multiobjective function includes the minimization of the groundwater consumption and the minimization of the total annual cost this cost is divided into the capital cost which consists of the catchment area desalination process power cycle and pumps as well as the operating costs for pumping fossil fuels groundwater and desalinated

and domestic uses chen and chen 2016 vakilifard et al 2018 however in many regions where water availability is low due to climate and or concentration of population in big cities the natural supply of water rarely satisfies the full demands seelen et al 2019 water scarcity in these regions has led to an increase in the extraction of water from aquifers dams and lakes moredia valek et al 2017 this has created serious problems in the overexploitation of ground and surface water resources pérez uresti et al 2019 various regions around the world have underground water as the main water source about 65 of irrigation and urban water moreno et al 2010 conagua 2015 water is extracted by using submersible pumps and the water can be stored in a reservoir or injected directly into the irrigation system ching fang 2018 agriculture is the activity with the highest water demand in the world it consumes approximately 70 of the water withdrawn per year world bank 2017 only about 17 of the world s cropland is irrigated but this irrigated land produces 40 of the world s food saccon 2018 irrigation is one of the sectors of agriculture that is increasing its energy consumption because of the modernization of irrigation water distribution systems sun et al 2019 pumping for water distribution and underground water extraction are the main energy consumers in pressurized water networks moreno et al 2010 also seasonal changes in river flows and temperatures have large impacts on the scheduling of electrical energy generation these variations directly affect the availability and reliability of electric power generation huang et al 2012 gjorgiev and sansavini 2017 for these reasons innovative technologies and methodologies have been developed to increase water resource availability for irrigated agriculture as such water conservation infrastructure modernization implementation of smart irrigation systems local water transfers treatment of low quality local water sources etc duke and casañas 2015 additionally finding optimal solutions to satisfy water demands has been studied by several authors for example arredondo ramirez et al 2015 presented an optimization approach for water use in agriculture that includes collection storage reuse and dispatch water bataineh 2016 presented the performance of solar thermal irrigation pump using a steam rankine cycle integrated with a parabolic trough collector ptc rubio castro et al 2016 proposed a mathematic model for the optimal design of agricultural water networks involving reusing recycling and storing of water and fertilizers between croplands at different time periods pérez uresti et al 2019 proposed an optimal water distribution network in which rain water harvesting rwh is considered as an alternative water source for places with over exploited water resources however most of these strategies can only improve the use or change the location of existing conventional water resources not increasing them in this context desalinated seawater has been identified as a potential option to mitigate water scarcity duke and casañas 2015 saccon 2018 aparicio et al 2019 furthermore recent studies have shown that the use of renewable sources such as solar biomass wind and geothermal power in energy systems and desalination plants are options for minimizing the environmental impact and maximizing the system efficiency hamawand et al 2017 mata torres et al 2017 the desalination technology most widely adopted for agricultural purposes is reverse osmosis ro due to the relative process simplicity ease operation low cost and most efficient technology to remove water from a saline source at a scale of value to farmers duke and casañas 2015 subramani and jacangelo 2015 aparicio et al 2019 presented a benefit economic analysis and concluded that a reverse osmosis desalination plant 120 m3 d is highly profitable from a minimum area of 1 ha but the final benefit is highly dependent on the irrigated surface extension most authors consider ro as the most adaptable technology for agricultural activities lahav et al 2010 barron et al 2015 gonzález bravo et al 2015 martínez alvarez et al 2016 therefore this paper presents a general optimization model based on a multi objective and multi period formulation to meet future water demands in regions where the aquifers are significantly overexploited due to agricultural activities a case study for the city of caborca in the state of sonora in mexico is considered for reducing underground water usage 2 problem statement the area dedicated to agriculture in mexico is about 20 million hectares where 30 is for irrigated agriculture and it uses about 80 of the total water consumption conagua 2016 however countries such as mexico with extensive arid regions and unequal distribution of water resources present strong overexploitation and depletion of piezometric levels in aquifers the availability of water in arid regions and with similar meteorological characteristics is nil because the actual evapotranspiration completely absorbs the precipitation in most cases also mexico has 653 aquifers defined for the assessment management and administration of national waters however 15 of them are overexploited this last has caused water pollution by salt intrusion affecting several tourism and service activities located in the coastal area and the low profitability of the agricultural activity conagua 2016 in consequence to restore hydrological equilibrium several actions have been applied such as annual programs to reduce pumping reduction of irrigated area and systematization of irrigation systems in areas destined for a large percentage of perennial crops nevertheless these programs do not have had the desired success for this reason desalinated seawater has been identified as a potential option for reducing water consumption from aquifers the proposed optimization approach considers limitations on the availability of groundwater for existing wells and the installation of a reverse osmosis desalination plant as a new water source the addressed problem in this paper can be stated as follows see fig 1 given an irrigated agricultural activity where there are crop fields with a specific geographical location extension and that consume large amounts of groundwater through the entire agricultural year from overexploited aquifers it is needed to design a water network for reducing the consumption of groundwater incorporating desalinated seawater through a reverse osmosis desalination plant also limitations in the availability of groundwater are considered for each field as well as the rainwater capturing by the crops and its evapotranspiration the system addressed in this paper can be stated as follows given are a reverse osmosis desalination plant due to the large amounts of electricity requirements it can be driven by the electric power produced from a steam rankine cycle and external electric power needed for the process to take place in the plant therefore the incorporation of the steam rankine cycle aims to reduce the demand for external electrical energy the model considers capital and operating costs of the new desalination plant the installation of a storage tank for desalinated seawater piping for transport water to the crops and the corresponding pumping power in addition it is required an efficiency factor to simulate its performance a steam rankine cycle can be used either to satisfy partially the energy demands of the participating systems or for sale the heat load supplied to the src boiler is optimized and driven by different primary energy sources solar energy and fossil fuels therefore the operational costs for the src are equal to the sum of the solar collector cost and the cost associated to the consumption of fossil fuels it should be noticed that a pre specified model is considered the maximum power is 2500 kw based on the total heat load provided by available fossil fuels and an efficiency factor is required to simulate its performance a set of available fossil fuels are used to provide primary energy to the src for each fossil fuel there are given the unitary cost and maximum availability for each time period a parabolic trough solar collector ptsc is considered which in previous works has obtained a good performance integrated with steam rankine cycles glasnović et al 2011 lira barragán et al 2013 and desalination plants mata torres et al 2017 ptsc is used considering the solar radiation available during the year in the specific place where the collector will be installed this parameter includes the equipment efficiency capital and operational cost functions and the capacity to catch solar radiation for each period of the year must be specified besides of the useful energy collected by the solar collector per area must be determined this last task can be made after knowing the location of the project since it makes possible to obtain the solar radiation data at each period of the year in addition to the capacity to capture the solar energy radiation the hanzel williams equation is used to determine the demand of electric power for pumping units it determines the friction loss for a given volumetric flow through a pipe knowing its size and length in this sense the formulation includes binary variables to determine the existence of new piping where the operations include fixed and variable costs the formulation also includes new piping and pumping costs the operating cost for the pump is related to the flowrates in the different time periods as well as the distance then water and power demands may change substantially throughout the year the problem consists in determining the optimal configuration for the agricultural water network involving the required water pipes pumps and distribution involving simultaneously the minimization for the total consumption of groundwater and total annual cost the problem is stated as a multiobjective optimization problem for minimizing the total groundwater consumption fw tot and the total annual cost tac as follows 1 objective function min f w t o t min t a c 3 model formulation the proposed model seeks to satisfy water and energy demands for agricultural activities through groundwater of aquifers a reverse osmosis desalination process and a power cycle the indexes are defined as follows t represents the time period months for this case k represents the fields for each product and f indicates the fossil fuels used in the steam rankine cycle the superscript fw represents the units for groundwater transportation and dw denotes the units for desalinated seawater transportation src and ro denote the components of steam rankine cycle and reverse osmosis desalination plant respectively finally solar represents the components of the solar collector the proposed model is based on the superstructure shown in fig 1 this model accounts for the energy distribution and water management in a macroscopic system the groundwater consumption objective is represented by 2 2 whereas eqs 3 9 represent the mass balances in the network availability of groundwater for each field and maximum capacity of the required equipment eqs 10 37 represent the energy balances in the network and participating systems as well as capacities for existing pumping units the economic objective is described by 38 38 where the calculation of the costs involved in this objective the existence or no existence of the new piping as well as the income by the selling of electric power are described by eqs 39 45 3 1 groundwater consumption the total consumption of groundwater fw tot can be calculated summing the groundwater consumed in each field k over all time periods t fw t k as follows 2 f w t o t t t k k f w t k the amount of groundwater needed for each field k over each time period t fw t k is based on the existence of limitations in the availability of groundwater in the aquifer therefore for each field k is assigned an upper bound fw k avail and the next relationship is considered 3 t t f w t k f w k a v a i l k k this parameter is a key part of the model because the existing limitations in the availability of groundwater in the aquifer determine the optimal water network it should be noticed that the maximum available

the non linearity appears associated with the cost function for the exponent related to the economies of scale and equations for determining the friction loss in the pipes the model was coded in the general algebraic modeling system gams which is high level modeling software for mathematical programming problems with large scale modeling applications brooke et al 2014 to solve the associated problem the solvers lindoglobal conopt and cplex were used to solve the associated mixed integer nonlinear programming nonlinear programming and linear programming problems respectively the problem was solved for minimizing to total net cost to determine the best economic solution which corresponds to the maximum groundwater consumption then the program was solved for minimizing the groundwater consumption which corresponds to the maximum cost and then the problem for minimizing the net tac with upper constraints for the consumption groundwater between the limits determined previously was solved after implementing the proposed optimization model with the information provided for this case study the optimization formulation consists of 1148 continuous variables 12 binary variables and this is restricted by 1213 constraints the proposed model was implemented in a computer with an i3 4150t processor at 3 0 ghz and 4 gb of ram 4 results and discussion this section presents the case study addressed under different scenarios which is described as follows 4 1 case study as a case study the problem of water scarcity in the region of caborca sonora in mexico was selected to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed optimization approach it has the coordinates n 307 47 03 and w 1127 31 05 see fig 2 this case study corresponds to the irrigation district 037 altar piquitito caborca it should be noticed that this region is semiarid and is sitting on the caborca aquifer the caborca region presents sever water problems because of the overexploitation of aquifers in addition the average annual precipitation for the caborca region is 269 mm y the average potential evaporation value is 2346 mm y and actual evapotranspiration has been estimated at around 262 9 mm with respect to the elevation of the static level it is observed that in the higher zone the elevations of the static level oscillates in a range of 122 400 m above sea level whereas that in the coastal zone it is 5 to 0 m above sea level its main use of water is in the agricultural activity and it is currently in overexploitation conagua 2015 hence there is required to improve the water use in agriculture and this paper presents the application of the proposed optimization approach to this case study it should be noted that the factors used in the cost functions were obtained from correlations of data from local equipment vendors fig 3 schematically shows the water networks of the addressed problem previous to the water and energy integration green framework it presents an agricultural activity with 4 crops olive orange grape pastures and meadow these are fed by groundwater of the caborca aquifer also there are presented the distances between the crop fields and the existing wells the availability assigned of groundwater by each field and the static height and static lift for determining the pumping power the associated operating costs by groundwater and electric power previous the proposed energy and water integration are us 95 433 88 y and us 5575 39 y respectively on the other hand the blue framework represents the water network implementing the proposed methodology including the incorporation of reverse osmosis plant desalination as a new water source fig 3 also shows the distances between the desalination plant and crop fields notice that the distances between the existing wells and fields are smaller and the above data it should be noticed that the sum of static height and static lift is zero meters for pumping desalinated seawater and 40 m for pumping groundwater table 1 shows the data for the economic parameters it should be noticed that c h takes a value of 140 average c h for clean and new pipes of plastic copper brass and glass η wr is 0 85 for drip irrigation η pump fw and η pump dw take a value of 0 7 table 2 presents the data for the occupied area the availability of groundwater over each field the distances between the water sources and fields and the diameter of the new piping notice that the distances between the desalination system and field are higher than those between existing water wells and crops also the grape field has the highest groundwater availability 40 000 m3 y table 3 shows the considered fossil fuels and their heating power and unitary costs it is worth noting that coal presents the lowest values of heating power and unitary cost table 4 shows the availability of fossil fuels and the useful energy that can be collected per month by the solar collector in that place to determine these values the solar radiation available in the specific location is computed by the efficiency to catch the solar energy of the ptsc also it is presented the rainwater available in the region obtained from data previously reported and the water requirements for each crop field there are available 390 000 535 000 and 346 000 kg y of coal oil and natural gas to feed the src it should be noticed that the may and june periods present the lower values of precipitation june july and august periods consume huge amounts of water 26 445 30 275 and 25 895 m3 respectively the results are shown in a pareto curve to identify the tradeoffs between the different objectives considered moreover different solutions are selected from the pareto curve to explore in detail these solutions several solutions that compensate these two objectives are identified between these two extreme solutions it is worth noting that the total cost increases when the groundwater consumption decreases representing contradicting objectives the resulting pareto curve is shown in fig 4 two extreme solutions are identified the first one for the minimum total annual cost but with the highest groundwater consumption and the other one for the minimum total groundwater consumption but with the highest associated cost the data of the identified solutions from the pareto curve are shown in tables 5 7 table 5 provides data about the monthly requirements of water for the irrigation system over each crop field in the different scenarios it shows that the total water required for irrigation is 151 482 36 m3 y where the 39 corresponds to the pastures and meadow field 25 are sent the orange crop 22 and 13 for the grape and olive fields respectively also the june period consumes 20 of the total water volume which is the biggest monthly value table 6 indicates the maximum capacity of each pumping unit the daily capacity of the desalination plants and annual consumption of groundwater for the different scenarios table 7 shows the associated costs for each scenario the presented configurations for the case study are addressed under the june period with different scenarios and conditions the scenarios selected are described below 4 1 1 scenario a scenario a represents the minimum cost but with the highest groundwater consumption it considers inputs of groundwater and desalinated seawater for the agricultural activity the desalination process and the water pumping are fed only by external electric power it consumes 88 13 of the total groundwater available in the process in addition table 6 shows that the groundwater consumption is 83 723 m3 y this is 44 73 less than the current situation the total consumption of electricity is 217 727 136 kw h y 8 98 times greater than the addressed problem see fig 11 fig 5 represents the solution for scenario a it contains the values of the june period the desalination plant is fed by 18 415 943 m3 of seawater it produces 8287 175 m3 of desalinated seawater and its daily capacity is 276 239 m3 d also fig 5 presents four pipes for transporting groundwater to the fields these sum 22 542 237 m3 of water requirements whereas for desalinated seawater is present two pipes that transport 8287 175 m3 which represents the 26 of water requirements for the fields the electric power required over each pump is 0 123 and 1 106 kw for desalinated seawater pumping and 4 481 5 045 12 497 and 8 414 kw for groundwater pumping it should be noticed that the whole process is driven by external electric power 135 345 kw scenario a is the best economic solution and presents a total operating cost of us 257 016 67 y a total capital cost of us 247 616 40 y and a total piping cost of us 390 000 00 y obtaining a tac of us 894 633 07 y notice that the new piping cost represents 44 of the tac here the total desalination plant cost is us 307 707 38 y it represents 34 of the tac where 27 corresponds to the operating cost and 73 to the capital cost and the capital cost of the storage tank is us 20 717 94 y moreover the groundwater and desalinated water costs represent 6 and 13 of the tac respectively finally the cost of the external power consumed is us 50 077 24 y see table 7 and fig 11 4 1 2 scenario c scenario c consumes 88 08 of the total groundwater available in the process 0 05 less than scenario a the groundwater consumption is 83 678 618 m3 y this is 44 76 less than the current situation here the external electric power satisfies the power requirements to the pumping units where the consumption of electricity is 3344 531 kw h y otherwise the total electric power required in the desalination plant is supplied by the src which represents a saving of us 46 785 908 y fig 6 shows the solution for scenario c here the capacity of the desalination plant is 313 419 m3 d and is fed by 18 572 404 m3 of seawater it sends 8357 582 m3 of water product to the orange pastures and meadows fields moreover there are 4 piping that transport 22 471 829 m3 of groundwater where the pumping power for desalinated seawater is supplied by external power 1 046 kw while the src provides the power required for pumping groundwater 30 445 kw in addition fig 7 shows that the main external energy sources for the solution of scenario c are solar and coal 76 1 and 14 9 of the heat load supplied to the src respectively scenario c presents a tac of us 1917 581 88 y where 20 corresponds the new piping cost 54 for the src cost including the solar collector cost and 15 for the desalination plant cost nevertheless the src generates electric power of 1000 kw which is enough to provide the power demanded in the desalination plant 104 47 kw and selling 865 086 kw this last produces us 404 070 00 y of profit and generates a net tac of us 1513 511 88 y it should be noted that the scenario takes as a priority to meet the energy requirements in the processes of higher consumption and later the minimization of the total annual cost through the income generated by selling electricity 4 1 3 scenario b scenario b shows the minimum groundwater consumption but with the highest associated cost it is shown in fig 8 this scenario consumes 54 01 of the total groundwater available for this process which is the lowest value it includes all the possible pipes as part of the solution the groundwater consumption is 51 315 241 m3 y this is 66 12 lower than the current situation here the external electric power meets the power requirements to all the pumping units where the consumption of electricity is 12 505 1 kw h y which represents us 2876 18 y also the src produces the power needed to satisfy the energy requirements of the desalination plant in each time period this represents a saving of us 69 271 313 y in this representation of fig 8 the src produces 600 kw generated by 1500 kw of heat load that is sent to the boiler the pumping power required is 30 kw and the total head in the condenser is 930 kw the area of the required solar collector is 5412 738 m2 fig 9 shows that the main external energy sources for the solution of scenario b which are solar and coal with 57 2 and 28 7 of the heat load supplied to the src respectively the power produced by src is sent to the desalination plant 364 231 kw and for sale 235 769 kw the pumping power required of the water sources to the fields is 18 896 kw this is provided by external power besides the capacity of the plant is 971 284 m3 d and it produces 29 034 976 m3 for the june period of desalinated seawater figs 10 11 and 12 present the groundwater external power and desalinated seawater consumption for the different scenarios brooke et al 2014 scenario b has a total operating cost of us 415 704 99 y a total capital cost of us 1379 706 80 y and a total piping cost of us 650 000 y which sum us 2445 411 79 y however the profit obtained by the sale of the generated energy by the power plants is us 217 620 00 y generating a net tac of us2227 791 79 y in this regard the total src cost the solar collector is considered part of the operating cost the total desalination plant cost and the new pipes cost represent 27 34 and 27 of the tac respectively notice that the greater cost in this scenario corresponds to the desalination plant cost and that this scenario uses 100 167 115 m3 y of desalinated water 32 35 and 32 30 higher than scenarios a and c respectively see fig 12 4 2 comparison between the different addressed scenarios for the case study scenario a presents external electricity consumption 8 98 17 41 and 65 09 times greater than the current situation scenario b and scenario c respectively see fig 11 this is because the high energy consumption of the desalination plant and that is fed only by external energy furthermore the addressed problem only consumes groundwater and on the other hand for the other scenarios there is an alternate source src to supply energy requirements to the reverse osmosis process scenario b and scenario c consume 48 41 and 86 20 less electricity than the current situation it should be mentioned that scenarios b and c present the desalination plant as an alternate source of water for irrigation while the current situation only uses water from wells scenario c consumes 73 25 less external electricity than scenario b notice that scenario b uses four pipes for carrying into desalinated water while scenario c does not exist the pipes that transporting desalinated water to fields 1 and 3 see figs 6 and 8 fig 10 shows that the groundwater consumption in scenarios a and c are slightly different scenario a is 0 053 greater than scenario c on the other hand scenario b consumes 38 70 and 38 67 less groundwater than scenarios c and a respectively also fig 10 shows that scenarios a and c send large amounts of groundwater for the months with high water demands periods from may to september while in the same periods scenario b sends large amounts of desalinated water than scenarios a and c see fig 12 in this context fields 2 and 4 olive pastures and meadows have higher water consumption for irrigation 38 and 59 of total demand however scenarios a b and c use pipes that transport desalinated water to fields 1 and 3 water requirements for irrigation by 38 402 353 and 59 356 474 m3 y due to limitations in water availability in aquifers see table 6 on the other hand the proposed approach considers the optimal integration of solar energy and fossil fuels for the operation of the src in this sense figs 7 and 9 show a certain tendency this is mainly due to the unit costs in fossil fuels and their availability and available solar radiation in the periods therefore to determine the sources of thermal load in the src the model mainly used the unit cost of coal the lowest value and then the solar radiation for july period the highest value notice that the unit cost of the solar collector is lower than the unit costs of gasoline and natural gas finally the thermal load provided by natural gas and gasoline are used scenarios b and c show that the produced electricity in the src takes two options the first one the src produces enough electricity to run the pumping units and to the desalination plant this way it reduces the consumption of external electrical energy to the system thus the desalination plant provides large quantities of desalinated seawater to the system which reduces the consumption of underground water the second one the src produces large amounts of electricity to feed the desalination plant supplying enough desalinated seawater to the system and reduces the external electricity consumption the excess of electricity is sent for sales reducing the total annual cost nevertheless for both scenarios the total cost of the src increases significantly finally the piping cost of scenario b is 60 higher than scenarios a and c scenario b presents src cost 35 5 lower than scenario c scenarios a and c show desalination plant costs 63 4 and 65 3 lower than scenario b respectively scenario b presents savings of us 69 271 313 y because the desalination plant does not consume external electric power as well as income by us 217 620 00 y these sum us 286 891 31 y it is 36 lower than scenario c for the same concepts us 450 855 91 y the total net cost of scenarios a and c are 59 and 32 lower than scenario b respectively this way scenario a shows the lowest total annual cost scenario b presents the lowest groundwater consumption and scenario c provides the highest savings and income by electricity production therefore the decision maker can choose anyone of these solutions and the optimal one depends on the specific requirements stated for the decision maker 5 conclusions a multi objective multi period optimization model has been formulated to design an optimal agricultural water distribution network where a desalination process has been incorporated to reduce the groundwater consumption from aquifers the proposed model seeks to satisfy the electric power and irrigation water requirements and simultaneously considers the minimization of the groundwater consumption and total annual cost for the case study presented in this paper results show that the maximum saving for groundwater consumption is about 66 12 and for external electrical power is 86 2 additionally results have demonstrated that the total annual cost is mainly influenced by the desalination plant the seawater and electricity consumption and its feasibility depend mainly on the location of the desalinization plant with respect to the sea and the specific conditions of the aquifer given in each country such as concessions and availability and src capital costs the proposed approach also determines the optimal usage and

10339,seawater desalination process is analyzed in this paper as an option for reducing the groundwater usage of overexploited aquifers in irrigated agriculture the proposed approach is based on a new superstructure formulated as a multiobjective mixed integer nonlinear programming model where power requirements of the desalination process and agriculture activity are supplied by an integrated steam rankine cycle fed of solar energy and fossil fuels the multiobjective function includes the minimization of the groundwater consumption and the minimization of the total annual cost this cost is divided into the capital cost which consists of the catchment area desalination process power cycle and pumps as well as the operating costs for pumping fossil fuels groundwater and desalinated seawater a case study for the state of sonora in mexico was considered to show the applicability of the proposed approach results show that the maximum saving for groundwater consumption is about 66

and domestic uses chen and chen 2016 vakilifard et al 2018 however in many regions where water availability is low due to climate and or concentration of population in big cities the natural supply of water rarely satisfies the full demands seelen et al 2019 water scarcity in these regions has led to an increase in the extraction of water from aquifers dams and lakes moredia valek et al 2017 this has created serious problems in the overexploitation of ground and surface water resources pérez uresti et al 2019 various regions around the world have underground water as the main water source about 65 of irrigation and urban water moreno et al 2010 conagua 2015 water is extracted by using submersible pumps and the water can be stored in a reservoir or injected directly into the irrigation system ching fang 2018 agriculture is the activity with the highest water demand in the world it consumes approximately 70 of the water withdrawn per year world bank 2017 only about 17 of the world s cropland is irrigated but this irrigated land produces 40 of the world s food saccon 2018 irrigation is one of the sectors of agriculture that is increasing its energy consumption because of the modernization of irrigation water distribution systems sun et al 2019 pumping for water distribution and underground water extraction are the main energy consumers in pressurized water networks moreno et al 2010 also seasonal changes in river flows and temperatures have large impacts on the scheduling of electrical energy generation these variations directly affect the availability and reliability of electric power generation huang et al 2012 gjorgiev and sansavini 2017 for these reasons innovative technologies and methodologies have been developed to increase water resource availability for irrigated agriculture as such water conservation infrastructure modernization implementation of smart irrigation systems local water transfers treatment of low quality local water sources etc duke and casañas 2015 additionally finding optimal solutions to satisfy water demands has been studied by several authors for example arredondo ramirez et al 2015 presented an optimization approach for water use in agriculture that includes collection storage reuse and dispatch water bataineh 2016 presented the performance of solar thermal irrigation pump using a steam rankine cycle integrated with a parabolic trough collector ptc rubio castro et al 2016 proposed a mathematic model for the optimal design of agricultural water networks involving reusing recycling and storing of water and fertilizers between croplands at different time periods pérez uresti et al 2019 proposed an optimal water distribution network in which rain water harvesting rwh is considered as an alternative water source for places with over exploited water resources however most of these strategies can only improve the use or change the location of existing conventional water resources not increasing them in this context desalinated seawater has been identified as a potential option to mitigate water scarcity duke and casañas 2015 saccon 2018 aparicio et al 2019 furthermore recent studies have shown that the use of renewable sources such as solar biomass wind and geothermal power in energy systems and desalination plants are options for minimizing the environmental impact and maximizing the system efficiency hamawand et al 2017 mata torres et al 2017 the desalination technology most widely adopted for agricultural purposes is reverse osmosis ro due to the relative process simplicity ease operation low cost and most efficient technology to remove water from a saline source at a scale of value to farmers duke and casañas 2015 subramani and jacangelo 2015 aparicio et al 2019 presented a benefit economic analysis and concluded that a reverse osmosis desalination plant 120 m3 d is highly profitable from a minimum area of 1 ha but the final benefit is highly dependent on the irrigated surface extension most authors consider ro as the most adaptable technology for agricultural activities lahav et al 2010 barron et al 2015 gonzález bravo et al 2015 martínez alvarez et al 2016 therefore this paper presents a general optimization model based on a multi objective and multi period formulation to meet future water demands in regions where the aquifers are significantly overexploited due to agricultural activities a case study for the city of caborca in the state of sonora in mexico is considered for reducing underground water usage 2 problem statement the area dedicated to agriculture in mexico is about 20 million hectares where 30 is for irrigated agriculture and it uses about 80 of the total water consumption conagua 2016 however countries such as mexico with extensive arid regions and unequal distribution of water resources present strong overexploitation and depletion of piezometric levels in aquifers the availability of water in arid regions and with similar meteorological characteristics is nil because the actual evapotranspiration completely absorbs the precipitation in most cases also mexico has 653 aquifers defined for the assessment management and administration of national waters however 15 of them are overexploited this last has caused water pollution by salt intrusion affecting several tourism and service activities located in the coastal area and the low profitability of the agricultural activity conagua 2016 in consequence to restore hydrological equilibrium several actions have been applied such as annual programs to reduce pumping reduction of irrigated area and systematization of irrigation systems in areas destined for a large percentage of perennial crops nevertheless these programs do not have had the desired success for this reason desalinated seawater has been identified as a potential option for reducing water consumption from aquifers the proposed optimization approach considers limitations on the availability of groundwater for existing wells and the installation of a reverse osmosis desalination plant as a new water source the addressed problem in this paper can be stated as follows see fig 1 given an irrigated agricultural activity where there are crop fields with a specific geographical location extension and that consume large amounts of groundwater through the entire agricultural year from overexploited aquifers it is needed to design a water network for reducing the consumption of groundwater incorporating desalinated seawater through a reverse osmosis desalination plant also limitations in the availability of groundwater are considered for each field as well as the rainwater capturing by the crops and its evapotranspiration the system addressed in this paper can be stated as follows given are a reverse osmosis desalination plant due to the large amounts of electricity requirements it can be driven by the electric power produced from a steam rankine cycle and external electric power needed for the process to take place in the plant therefore the incorporation of the steam rankine cycle aims to reduce the demand for external electrical energy the model considers capital and operating costs of the new desalination plant the installation of a storage tank for desalinated seawater piping for transport water to the crops and the corresponding pumping power in addition it is required an efficiency factor to simulate its performance a steam rankine cycle can be used either to satisfy partially the energy demands of the participating systems or for sale the heat load supplied to the src boiler is optimized and driven by different primary energy sources solar energy and fossil fuels therefore the operational costs for the src are equal to the sum of the solar collector cost and the cost associated to the consumption of fossil fuels it should be noticed that a pre specified model is considered the maximum power is 2500 kw based on the total heat load provided by available fossil fuels and an efficiency factor is required to simulate its performance a set of available fossil fuels are used to provide primary energy to the src for each fossil fuel there are given the unitary cost and maximum availability for each time period a parabolic trough solar collector ptsc is considered which in previous works has obtained a good performance integrated with steam rankine cycles glasnović et al 2011 lira barragán et al 2013 and desalination plants mata torres et al 2017 ptsc is used considering the solar radiation available during the year in the specific place where the collector will be installed this parameter includes the equipment efficiency capital and operational cost functions and the capacity to catch solar radiation for each period of the year must be specified besides of the useful energy collected by the solar collector per area must be determined this last task can be made after knowing the location of the project since it makes possible to obtain the solar radiation data at each period of the year in addition to the capacity to capture the solar energy radiation the hanzel williams equation is used to determine the demand of electric power for pumping units it determines the friction loss for a given volumetric flow through a pipe knowing its size and length in this sense the formulation includes binary variables to determine the existence of new piping where the operations include fixed and variable costs the formulation also includes new piping and pumping costs the operating cost for the pump is related to the flowrates in the different time periods as well as the distance then water and power demands may change substantially throughout the year the problem consists in determining the optimal configuration for the agricultural water network involving the required water pipes pumps and distribution involving simultaneously the minimization for the total consumption of groundwater and total annual cost the problem is stated as a multiobjective optimization problem for minimizing the total groundwater consumption fw tot and the total annual cost tac as follows 1 objective function min f w t o t min t a c 3 model formulation the proposed model seeks to satisfy water and energy demands for agricultural activities through groundwater of aquifers a reverse osmosis desalination process and

cycle the superscript fw represents the units for groundwater transportation and dw denotes the units for desalinated seawater transportation src and ro denote the components of steam rankine cycle and reverse osmosis desalination plant respectively finally solar represents the components of the solar collector the proposed model is based on the superstructure shown in fig 1 this model accounts for the energy distribution and water management in a macroscopic system the groundwater consumption objective is represented by 2 2 whereas eqs 3 9 represent the mass balances in the network availability of groundwater for each field and maximum capacity of the required equipment eqs 10 37 represent the energy balances in the network and participating systems as well as capacities for existing pumping units the economic objective is described by 38 38 where the calculation of the costs involved in this objective the existence or no existence of the new piping as well as the income by the selling of electric power are described by eqs 39 45 3 1 groundwater consumption the total consumption of groundwater fw tot can be calculated summing the groundwater consumed in each field k over all time periods t fw t k as follows 2 f w t o t t t k k f w t k the amount of groundwater needed for each field k over each time period t fw t k is based on the existence of limitations in the availability of groundwater in the aquifer therefore for each field k is assigned an upper bound fw k avail and the next relationship is considered 3 t t f w t k f w k a v a i l k k this parameter is a key part of the model because the existing limitations in the availability of groundwater in the aquifer determine the optimal water network it should be noticed that the maximum available groundwater is regulated by the government 3 1 1 irrigation water requirements aquifers are considered for satisfying the water consumption in each field k and the reverse osmosis desalination plant

radius and l k is the length of the pipes c h is the hanzel williams coefficient it only depends on the condition of the pipe surface or conduit it should be noticed that hanzel williams equation is limited for the flow of water in pipes with diameters between 2 in and 6 ft the flow velocity should not exceed 10 ft s and water temperature about 60 f 3 2 1 overall energy balance for the src the

problem the solvers lindoglobal conopt and cplex were used to solve the associated mixed integer nonlinear programming nonlinear programming and linear programming problems respectively the problem was solved for minimizing to total net cost to determine the best economic solution which corresponds to the maximum groundwater consumption then the program was solved for minimizing the groundwater consumption which corresponds to the maximum cost and then the problem for minimizing the net tac with upper constraints for the consumption groundwater between the limits determined previously was solved after implementing the proposed optimization model with the information provided for this case study the optimization formulation consists of 1148 continuous variables 12 binary variables and this is restricted by 1213 constraints the proposed model was implemented in a computer with an i3 4150t processor at 3 0 ghz and 4 gb of ram 4 results and discussion this section presents the case study addressed under different scenarios which is described as follows 4 1 case study as a case study the problem of water scarcity in the region of caborca sonora in mexico was selected to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed optimization approach it has the coordinates n 307 47 03 and w 1127 31 05 see fig 2 this case study corresponds to the irrigation district 037 altar piquitito caborca it should be noticed that this region is semiarid and is sitting on the caborca aquifer the caborca region presents sever water problems because of the overexploitation of aquifers in addition the average annual precipitation for the caborca region is 269 mm y the average potential evaporation value is 2346 mm y and actual evapotranspiration has been estimated at around 262 9 mm with respect to the elevation of the static level it is observed that in the higher zone the elevations of the static level oscillates in a range of 122 400 m above sea level whereas that in the coastal zone it is 5 to 0 m above sea level its main use of water is in the agricultural activity and it is currently in overexploitation conagua 2015 hence there is required to improve the water use in agriculture and this paper presents the application of the proposed optimization approach to this case study it should be noted that the factors used in the cost functions were obtained from correlations of data from local equipment vendors fig 3 schematically shows the water networks of the addressed problem previous to the water and energy integration green framework it presents an agricultural activity with 4 crops olive orange grape pastures and meadow these are fed by groundwater of the caborca aquifer also there are presented the distances between the crop fields and the existing wells the availability assigned of groundwater by each field and the static height and static lift for determining the pumping power the associated operating costs by groundwater and electric power previous the proposed energy and water integration are us 95 433 88 y and us 5575 39 y respectively on the other hand the blue framework represents the water network implementing the proposed methodology including the incorporation of reverse osmosis plant desalination as a new water source fig 3 also shows the distances between the desalination plant and crop fields notice that the distances between the existing wells and fields are smaller and the above data it should be noticed that the sum of static height and static lift is zero meters for pumping desalinated seawater and 40 m for pumping groundwater table 1 shows the data for the economic parameters it should be noticed that c h takes a value of 140 average c h for clean and new pipes of plastic copper brass and glass η wr is 0 85 for drip irrigation η pump fw and η pump dw take a value of 0 7 table 2 presents the data for the occupied area the availability of groundwater over each field the distances between the water sources and fields and the diameter of the new piping notice that the distances between the desalination system and field are higher than those between existing water wells and crops also the grape field has the highest groundwater availability 40 000 m3 y table 3 shows the considered fossil fuels and their heating power and unitary costs it is worth noting that coal presents the lowest values of heating power and unitary cost table 4 shows the availability of fossil fuels and the useful energy that can be collected per month by the solar collector in that place to determine these values the solar radiation available in the specific location is computed by the efficiency to catch the solar energy of the ptsc also it is presented the rainwater available in the region obtained from data previously reported and the water requirements for each crop field there are available 390 000 535 000 and 346 000 kg y of coal oil and natural gas to feed the src it should be noticed that the may and june periods present the lower values of precipitation june july and august periods consume huge amounts of water 26 445 30 275 and 25 895 m3 respectively the results are shown in a pareto curve to identify the tradeoffs between the different objectives considered moreover different solutions are selected from the pareto curve to explore in detail these solutions several solutions that compensate these two objectives are identified between these two extreme solutions it is worth noting that the total cost increases when the groundwater consumption decreases representing contradicting objectives the resulting pareto curve is shown in fig 4 two extreme solutions are identified the first one for the minimum total annual cost but with the highest groundwater consumption and the other one for the minimum total groundwater consumption but with the highest associated cost the data of the identified solutions from the pareto curve are shown in tables 5 7 table 5 provides data about the monthly requirements of water for the irrigation system over each crop field in the different scenarios it shows that the total water required for irrigation is 151 482 36 m3 y where the 39 corresponds to the pastures and meadow field 25 are sent the orange crop 22 and 13 for the grape and olive fields respectively also the june period consumes 20 of the total water volume which is the biggest monthly value table 6 indicates the maximum capacity of each pumping unit the daily capacity of the desalination plants and annual consumption of groundwater for the different scenarios table 7 shows the associated costs for each scenario the presented configurations for the case study are addressed under the june period with different scenarios and conditions the scenarios selected are described below 4 1 1 scenario a scenario a represents the minimum cost but with the highest groundwater consumption it considers inputs of groundwater and desalinated seawater for the agricultural activity the desalination process and the water pumping are fed only by external electric power it consumes 88 13 of the total groundwater available in the process in addition table 6 shows that the groundwater consumption is 83 723 m3 y this is 44 73 less than the current situation the total consumption of electricity is 217 727 136 kw h y 8 98 times greater than the addressed problem see fig 11 fig 5 represents the solution for scenario a it contains the values of the june period the desalination plant is fed by 18 415 943 m3 of seawater it produces 8287 175 m3 of desalinated seawater and its daily capacity is 276 239 m3 d also fig 5 presents four pipes for transporting groundwater to the fields these sum 22 542 237 m3 of water requirements whereas for desalinated seawater is present two pipes that transport 8287 175 m3 which represents the 26 of water requirements for the fields the electric power required over each pump is 0 123 and 1 106 kw for desalinated seawater pumping and 4 481 5 045 12 497 and 8 414 kw for groundwater pumping it should be noticed that the whole process is driven by external electric power 135 345 kw scenario a is the best economic solution and presents a total operating cost of us 257 016 67 y a total capital cost of us 247 616 40 y and a total piping cost of us 390 000 00 y obtaining a tac of us 894 633 07 y notice that the new piping cost represents 44 of the tac here the total desalination plant cost is us 307 707 38 y it represents 34 of the tac where 27 corresponds to the operating cost and 73 to the capital cost and the capital cost of the storage tank is us 20 717 94 y moreover the groundwater and desalinated water costs represent 6 and 13 of the tac respectively finally the cost of the external power consumed is us 50 077 24 y see table 7 and fig 11 4 1 2 scenario c scenario c consumes 88 08 of the total groundwater available in the process 0 05 less than scenario a the groundwater consumption is 83 678 618 m3 y this is 44 76 less than the current situation here the external electric power satisfies the power requirements to the pumping units where the consumption of electricity is 3344 531 kw h y otherwise the total electric power required in the desalination plant is supplied by the src which represents a saving of us 46 785 908 y fig 6 shows the solution for scenario c here the capacity of the desalination plant is 313 419 m3 d and is fed by 18 572 404 m3 of seawater it sends 8357 582 m3 of water product to the orange pastures and meadows fields moreover there are 4 piping that transport 22 471 829 m3 of groundwater where the pumping power for desalinated seawater is supplied by external power 1 046 kw while the src provides the power required for pumping groundwater 30 445 kw in addition fig 7 shows that the main external energy sources for the solution of scenario c are solar and coal 76 1 and 14 9 of the heat load supplied to the src respectively scenario c presents a tac of us 1917 581 88 y where 20 corresponds the new piping cost 54 for the src cost including the solar collector cost and 15 for the desalination plant cost nevertheless the src generates electric power of 1000 kw which is enough to provide the power demanded in the desalination plant 104 47 kw and selling 865 086 kw this last produces us 404 070 00 y of profit and generates a net tac of us 1513 511 88 y it should be noted that the scenario takes as a priority to meet the energy requirements in the processes of higher consumption and later the minimization of the total annual cost through the income generated by selling electricity 4 1 3 scenario b scenario b shows the minimum groundwater consumption but with the highest associated cost it is shown in fig 8 this scenario consumes 54 01 of the total groundwater available for this process which is the lowest value it includes all the possible pipes as part of the solution the groundwater consumption is 51 315 241 m3 y this is 66 12 lower than the current situation here the external electric power meets the power requirements to all the pumping units where the consumption of electricity is 12 505 1 kw h y which represents us 2876 18 y also the src produces the power needed to satisfy the energy requirements of the desalination plant in each time period this represents a saving of us 69 271 313 y in this representation of fig 8 the src produces 600 kw generated by 1500 kw of heat load that is sent to the boiler the pumping power required is 30 kw and the total head in the condenser is 930 kw the area of the required solar collector is 5412 738 m2 fig 9 shows that the main external energy sources for the solution of scenario b which are solar and coal with 57 2 and 28 7 of the heat load supplied to the src respectively the power produced by src is sent to the desalination plant 364 231 kw and for sale 235 769 kw the pumping power required of the water sources to the fields is 18 896 kw this is provided by external power besides the capacity of the plant is 971 284 m3 d and it produces 29 034 976 m3 for the june period of desalinated seawater figs 10 11 and 12 present the groundwater external power and desalinated seawater consumption for the different scenarios brooke et al 2014 scenario b has a total operating cost of us 415 704 99 y a total capital cost of us 1379 706 80 y and a total piping cost of us 650 000 y which sum us 2445 411 79 y however the profit obtained by the sale of the generated energy by the power plants is us 217 620 00 y generating a net tac of us2227 791 79 y in this regard the total src cost the solar collector is considered part of the operating cost the total desalination plant cost and the new pipes cost represent 27 34 and 27 of the tac respectively notice that the greater cost in this scenario corresponds to the desalination plant cost and that this scenario uses 100 167 115 m3 y of desalinated water 32 35 and 32 30 higher than scenarios a and c respectively see fig 12 4 2 comparison between the different addressed scenarios for the case study scenario a presents external electricity consumption 8 98 17 41 and 65 09 times greater than the current situation scenario b and scenario c respectively see fig 11 this is because the high energy consumption of the desalination plant and that is fed only by external energy furthermore the addressed problem only consumes groundwater and on the other hand for the other scenarios there is an alternate source src to supply energy requirements to the reverse osmosis process scenario b and scenario c consume 48 41 and 86 20 less electricity than the current situation it should be mentioned that scenarios b and c present the desalination plant as an alternate source of water for irrigation while the current situation only uses water from wells scenario c consumes 73 25 less external electricity than scenario b notice that scenario b uses four pipes for carrying into desalinated water while scenario c does not exist the pipes that transporting desalinated water to fields 1 and 3 see figs 6 and 8 fig 10 shows that the groundwater consumption in scenarios a and c are slightly different scenario a is 0 053 greater than scenario c on the other hand scenario b consumes 38 70 and 38 67 less groundwater than scenarios c and a respectively also fig 10 shows that scenarios a and c send large amounts of groundwater for the months with high water demands periods from may to september while in the same periods scenario b sends large amounts of desalinated water than scenarios a and c see fig 12 in this context fields 2 and 4 olive pastures and meadows have higher water consumption for irrigation 38 and 59 of total demand however scenarios a b and c use pipes that transport desalinated water to fields 1 and 3 water requirements for irrigation by 38 402 353 and 59 356 474 m3 y due to limitations in water availability in aquifers see table 6 on the other hand the proposed approach considers the optimal integration of solar energy and fossil fuels for the operation of the src in this sense figs 7 and 9 show a certain tendency this is mainly due to the unit costs in fossil fuels and their availability and available solar radiation in the periods therefore to determine the sources of thermal load in the src the model mainly used the unit cost of coal the lowest value and then the solar radiation for july period the highest value notice that the unit cost of the solar collector is lower than the unit costs of gasoline and natural gas finally the thermal load provided by natural gas and gasoline are used scenarios b and c show that the produced electricity in the src takes two options the first one the src produces enough electricity to run the pumping units and to the desalination plant this way it reduces the consumption of external electrical energy to the system thus the desalination plant provides large quantities of desalinated seawater to the system which reduces the consumption of underground water the second one the src produces large amounts of electricity to feed the desalination plant supplying enough desalinated seawater to the system and reduces the external electricity consumption the excess of electricity is sent for sales reducing the total annual cost nevertheless for both scenarios the total cost of the src increases significantly finally the piping cost of scenario b is 60 higher than scenarios a and c scenario b presents src cost 35 5 lower than scenario c scenarios a and c show desalination plant costs 63 4 and 65 3 lower than scenario b respectively scenario b presents savings of us 69 271 313 y because the desalination plant does not consume external electric power as well as income by us 217 620 00 y these sum us 286 891 31 y it is 36 lower than scenario c for the same concepts us 450 855 91 y the total net cost of scenarios a and c are 59 and 32 lower than scenario b respectively this way scenario a shows the lowest total annual cost scenario b presents the lowest groundwater consumption and scenario c provides the highest savings and income by electricity production therefore the decision maker can choose anyone of these solutions and the optimal one depends on the specific requirements stated for the decision maker 5 conclusions a multi objective multi period optimization model has been formulated to design an optimal agricultural water distribution network where a desalination process has been incorporated to reduce the groundwater consumption from aquifers the proposed model seeks to satisfy the electric power and irrigation water requirements and simultaneously considers the minimization of the groundwater consumption and total annual cost for the case study presented in this paper results show that the maximum saving for groundwater consumption is about 66 12 and for external electrical power is 86 2 additionally results have demonstrated that the total annual cost is mainly influenced by the desalination plant the seawater and electricity consumption and its feasibility depend mainly on the location of the desalinization plant with respect to the sea and the specific conditions of the aquifer given in each country such as concessions and availability and src capital costs the proposed approach also determines the optimal usage and distribution of external energy sources solar and fossil fuels pareto solutions are produced to enable tradeoffs among the economic and environmental objectives the results have shown that the designed configurations yield attractive solutions from the sustainability points of view the results show that important economic benefits can be achieved for the implementation of the proposed methodology satisfying the groundwater availability furthermore the results show attractive solutions that can be considered for the decision makers i e producers or governments finally the proposed optimization approach is a mixed integer nonlinear and it can be applied to other case studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
