15400,fenton sludge generated from the fenton process contains a large number of ferric species and organic pollutants which need to be properly treated before discharge in this study fenton sludge as an fe iii source for dissimilatory iron reduction dir was continuously added with increasing dosage into an anaerobic digester to enhance the treatment results showed continuously feeding fenton sludge to the anaerobic digester did not deteriorate the performance and increased methane production and cod removal rate by 2 2 folds and 14 0 respectively the fe content of sludge in the digester increased from 40 25 mg g dry weight to 131 53 mg g after continuously feeding for 77days and then declined to 109 17 mg g when the feeding was stopped mass balance analysis showed that 20 5 to 48 4 of fe in the fenton sludge was released to the effluent after experiment the ratio of reducible fe species to the total fe was 75 1 which maintained the high activity in dir microbial community analysis showed that iron reducing bacteria were enriched with the addition of fenton sludge and the sludge in the digester had a higher conductivity and capacitance to strengthen the electron transfer of dir all results suggested that feeding fenton sludge into anaerobic digesters was a feasible method to dispose of fenton sludge as well as to enhance the performance of anaerobic digestion

introduction fenton process an advanced oxidative reaction between fe2 and h2o2 under low ph values 3 4 to generate strong oxidizing radicals oh is widely used to treat refractory organic wastewaters bautista et al 2008 however fenton sludge involving a large amount of fe iii and residual organic pollutants are formed in the flocculation of fe3 when adjusting the effluent to a neutral ph range neyens and baeyens 2003 fenton sludge is classified as a hazardous waste that requires to be disposed of appropriately before discharge benatti et al 2009 traditional disposal methods such as landfill combustion and cement stabilization need extra energy or reagent input that cost a fortune and easily result in pollutant transfer to soil and atmosphere rodríguez et al 2016 kishimoto et al 2013 more economically and environmentally friendly manners are warranted dissimilatory iron reduction dir driven by iron reducing bacteria irb that are capable of using fe iii as an electron acceptor to oxidize organic matter has been widely applied in anaerobic systems to enhance organic matter decomposition baek et al 2015 2014 kato et al 2012 lovley and phillips 1988 recently it was reported that supplementation of fenton sludge in the anaerobic digester could induce dir to accelerate the mineralization of organic matter both in the anaerobic digester itself and in the fenton sludge wang et al 2019a 2018 in addition irb e g geobacter enriched by dir is able to directly transport electrons generated from organic matter oxidation to methanosaeata or methanosarcina via electrically conductive pili or outer surface c type cytochromes the direct interspecies electron transfer diet between irbs and methanogens can accelerate the conversion of organic matter into methane to enhance anaerobic digestion cruz viggi et al 2014 storck et al 2016 yamada et al 2015 at low concentrations of organic matter dir also competes for electrons with methanogens to inhibit methanogenesis which however benefits the removal of organic matter lovley and phillips 1987 furthermore the humic substance involved in the fenton sludge served as an electron mediator to further enhance the extracellular electron transfer of irb during dir shimizu et al 2013 stern et al 2018 in general anaerobic digestion provides a new perspective for the recycling of fenton sludge with adding fenton sludge to the anaerobic system fe ii produced from dir and the residual fe iii may gradually be accumulated in the anaerobic sludge through chelation and adsorption hansel et al 2005 such accumulation of fe ii induces the transformation of amorphous iron species to more crystalline forms which may reduce the dir activity on the other hand high concentration of fe may affect the cytoactive of microorganism for example bodegom et al 2004 demonstrated a direct inhibition of methanogenesis by amorphous fe oh 3 10 mm at pure cultures of methanogens which was attributed to the inactivation of coenzymes f420 by the excessive fe iii our previous study found that adding 2 to 8 g l fenton sludge dry powder to anaerobic digesters could improve methane production and tcod removal by 12 6 21 0 and 4 6 11 4 respectively at the end of the experiment the fe remained in the reactor reached the highest concentration of 2678 11 mg l nearly 44 1 of the total fe iii in fenton sludge was reduced to fe ii wang et al 2018 however the study was conducted in a batch mode with a single addition of fenton sludge the feasibility of this method in practice depends on the tolerance of anaerobic digestion to the iron accumulation under the continuous dosing of fenton sludge the iron accumulated in the anaerobic sludge may destroy the physical structure and chemical composition of anaerobic sludge thus affecting the performance of anaerobic digestion zhang et al 2009 however no studies have been found that explore the continuous dosing of fenton sludge and its effects on anaerobic digestion in addition fe involved in fenton sludge usually exists as fe oh 3 with poorly crystalline structure it is thermodynamically unstable and easily transforms into more stable crystalline iron minerals after a long time operation boland et al 2014 considering that fe oh 3 has a loose structure and large specific surface area as well as a higher redox potential 0 10 to 0 10 v than crystalline iron oxides e g magnetite 0 31 v such transformation may slowdown the dir efficiency which should also be considered in practice on basis of the above consideration fenton sludge was added into an anaerobic reactor that was operated in a continuous flow mode different feeding strategies single feeding feeding each two day and feeding every day were conducted to investigate the feasibility of the continuous feeding of fenton sludge to the anaerobic digestion system the changes of fe species in fenton sludge were determined to evaluate the potential to drive dir we expect to develop a new strategy for disposing of fenton sludge via the recycling manner 2 material and methods 2 1 fenton sludge the fenton sludge used in this study was derived from a fenton process that treated an aging leachate 8 10 years with a cod of 5708 33 134 63 mg l guangxi china 40 mmol l feso4 7h2o was used as the fe ii source and the molar ratio of h2o2 to fe ii was 3 1 after 2 h of fenton reaction at ph of 3 the effluent ph was adjusted to 7 then precipitated for 12 h the fenton sludge was harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 8000 rpm then stored at 4 c for use the main fe forms involved in fenton sludge existed as fe oh 3 and part of them was complexed with organic matter to present the organic bonding state other characteristics of the fenton sludge are displayed in table 1 2 2 anaerobic experiment two cylindrical glass uasb reactors each with a working volume of 1 l internal diameter of 76 mm and height of 220 mm were used for the anaerobic experiment each reactor received 250 ml of seed sludge as inoculum and 750 ml of artificial wastewater as feed substances the initial seed sludge ts 6 5 vs 4 9 was obtained from an anaerobic digester of a municipal sludge treatment plant in dalian china the composition per liter of the artificial wastewater was as follows 1 50 g glucose 0 48 g yeast extract 2 00 g milk powder wandashan taobao com china 0 10 g nh4cl 0 10 g kh2po4 4 00 g nahco3 and 10 ml trace elements the reactors were operated with a continuous flow model under hrt of 20 h and maintained the temperature of 30 c differently one of the reactors received a certain amount of fenton sludge referred to as r fs the other one was set as a control reactor without the addition of fenton sludge referred to as r c the experiment was divided into four stages with different dosages of fenton sludge to investigate its continuous treatment in anaerobic digestion in stage 1st 0 50 d 40 g fenton sludge was added in r fs at one time in this stage the influent cod gradually increased from 5000 mg l 0 20 d to 6700 mg l 21 40 d and 8000 mg l 41 50 d in stage 2nd 51 70 d 10 g fenton sludge was added into r fs every two days in stage 3rd 71 77 d 10 g fenton sludge was added into r fs every day in stage 4th 78 95 d no fenton sludge was added to only consume the residual fenton sludge added previously 2 3 chemical analysis the effluent of the anaerobic reactors was analyzed daily the supernatant samples of effluent were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 8000 rpm ts vs and cod were analyzed by the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater ferrous and ferric iron in effluent were analyzed by an adaptation of the ferrozine technique cooper et al 2000 the total iron contained in the sludge was determined by inductively coupled plasma icp avio 220 perkinelmer the biogas was collected with a gas sampling bag equipped on top of the reactor and the volume of biogas was measured with a 100 ml glass syringe the content of biogas was measured with a gas chromatograph tianmei gc 7900 china with a thermal conductivity detector tcd zhao et al 2015 the morphology and species of iron were measured by the sequential extraction method according to our previous study wang et al 2022 the extracellular polymers eps were extracted by the method of frølund et al using 732 cation exchange resin as the extractant frølund et al 1996 proteins of eps were measured by bradford s method bradford 1976 the fulvic acid and humic acid of the sample were extracted according to the method proposed by yakimenko 2001 2 4 electrochemical analysis after 95 days experiment 50 ml sludge was taken from the bottom of each reactor to analyze its electrochemical properties all electrochemical analysis were conducted with an electrochemical workstation zhenhua chi1030c china the conductivity of the sludge was measured by the method of three probe electrical conductance measurement before measurement the sludge samples were centrifugated at 8000 rpm for 10 min and washed three times with 0 1 m nacl solution then the treated sludge was placed on the two platinum electrodes separated by a 0 50 mm non conductive gap a voltage ramp of 0 2 to 0 2 v across split electrodes in steps of 25 mv was applied on the working electrode to obtain transient current change data then the conductivity was calculated according to the method of malvankar et al 2011 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was analyzed at a constant potential of 0 00 v vs ag agcl over a frequency range of 1 105 to 0 01 hz with a sinusoidal perturbation amplitude of 10 mv redox capacity was determined by cyclic voltammetry cv measurements the working electrode was replaced by a sludge immobilized vitreous carbon electrode the immobilized method was operated according to a report by yuan et al 2018 the scan rate of the cyclic voltammogram was 50 mv s in the potential range of 0 6 v to 0 6 v vs she 2 5 microbial community structure analysis after experiments 5 ml of sludge samples were collected from two reactors to analyze microbial communities and functional genes via high throughput 16s rrna pyrosequencing zhao et al 2016 the detailed methods of dna extraction pcr and sequencing are provided in the support information 3 results and discussion 3 1 anaerobic digestion with adding fenton sludge the addition of fenton sludge enhanced the stability of anaerobic digestion during the domestication stage 1 0 50 d fig 1 under the influent cod of 5000 mg l day 0 20 the average value of effluent cod of the two reactors were 1038 17 mg l r fs and 1230 79 mg l r c respectively when gradually increasing the influent cod to 6700 mg l and 8000 mg l the effluent cod of r fs remained stable and even decreased to about 100 130 mg l with a cod removal rate of 99 5 while the effluent cod of r c raised to about 1000 1500 mg l with a cod removal rate of 85 5 higher methane production was also observed in r fs under the influent cod of 8000 mg l day 41 50 the average methane production of r fs was 300 23 ml g cod which was 2 2 folds that of r c 135 84 ml g cod it should be mentioned that fenton sludge contains organic matter at around 213 37 mg cod g which also might contribute to methane production assuming that all cod of fenton sludge was converted into methane the maximum methane production from fenton sludge was 2985 5 ml in stage 1 according to the stoichiometric relationship between cod and methane of 350 ml g cod see table 2 after subtracting this part of methane production methane production of r fs in stage 1 was 292 31 ml g codinfluent which was still higher than that of r c it further confirmed that the fenton sludge stimulated dir to promote methane production during anaerobic digestion the results were in agreement with wang et al 2019a who found that cod removal and methane production of anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge were enhanced with the addition of fenton sludge to investigate the effects of continuously adding fenton sludge on anaerobic digestion 10 g of fenton sludge was added every two days stage 2 51 70 d and then every day stage 3 day 71 77 as shown in fig 1b the cod removal with the addition of fenton sludge averaged 97 3 for stage 2 and 96 9 for stage 3 which were still higher than those without fenton sludge 88 4 for stage 2 and 91 3 for stage 3 methane production of r fs in stage 2 and stage 3 averaged 327 48 and 303 62 ml g cod respectively which were 1 8 2 0 times that of r c 168 11 ml g cod when subtracting the cod of fenton sludge methane production of r fs in stage 2 and stage 3 changed to 288 58 and 225 83 ml g codinfluent which was still 1 3 1 7 times that of r c it meant that the continuous addition of fenton sludge still enhanced the anaerobic digestion remarkedly the average methane production of r fs with adding fenton sludge every day during day 71 77 stage 3 significantly fluctuated which was related to the frequent addition of fenton sludge it caused the competition between dir and methanogenesis for electron donors to affect methane production since fe oh 3 was thermodynamically superior to co2 in capturing electrons lovley et al 2000 however the competition benefited the mineralization of organic matter resulting in the higher cod removal after 77 days of operation with adding fenton sludge the fe content of sludge in the digester increased from the initial 40 25 mg g dry weight to 131 53 mg g under such high iron content the performances of the digesters were maintained well with the cod removal of above 95 to avoid the adverse outcome due to the overhigh fe content we suspended the feeding after day 77 namely 20 days of every two days feed and 7 days of daily feed of fenton sludge afterwards the fe content in the sludge declined to 109 17 mg g in the next 17 days meanwhile the cod removal and methane production were maintained well during days 77 95 the above results were further confirmed in a repeated experiment for 20 days that the two anaerobic digesters were restarted up and operated with or without addition of fenton sludge 10 g d see support information the results suggested that the daily feeding fenton sludge indeed enhanced the performance of ad and the system could be operated in the steady state 3 2 mass balance of fe during the operation accompanied with dir of fenton sludge fe ii was released to the effluent as shown in fig 2 a the effluent fe ii of r fs averaged 1 04 mg l during the first 20 days while fe ii was almost undetectable in r c with increasing the influent cod to 6700 mg l and 8000 mg l the effluent fe ii of r fs fluctuated to an average of 4 89 mg l raising organic load augmented organic acid formation of r c to likely dissolve the background fe involved in the seed sludge 40 25 mg fe g dry weight as shown in fig s1 the ph of r c ranged from 6 93 to 7 50 average 7 27 while r fs ranged from 7 17 to 8 24 average 7 71 as a result the lower ph of r c led to a comparable fe ii amount to that of r fs even though the total fe amount of r c was quite lower than that of r fs considering the 40 g fenton sludge added with the increase of fenton sludge addition from day 51 the effluent fe ii of r fs ranged from 0 74 to 9 67 mg l average 4 87 mg l fe iii was also detected in the effluent of r fs and ranged from 5 75 to 40 02 mg l average 20 17 mg l on days 51 77 stage 2 and 3 the calculation showed that fe ii and fe iii sum of the dissolved fe ii fe iii of each day dissolved in the effluent accounted for 2 48 and 10 26 of the total fe amount from the added fenton sludge 100 g for stage 2 and 70 g for stage 3 during days 51 77 respectively the mass balance of fe was calculated at the end of each stage as shown in fig 2c the amount of background fe of the seed sludge inoculated in the reactor contained 660 17 mg i e fe amount in r c after feeding 40 g fenton sludge 37 48 mg g fs in the first stage the theoretical total fe sum of fe content in previous stage and increased fe content by addition of fenton sludge in the sludge of r fs was 2159 37 mg while the actual fe detected in the sludge of r fs on day 50 was only 1113 43 mg which meant that 48 4 of total fe was released to the effluent along with the continuously feeding fenton sludge the fe content in the sludge of r fs further increased to 2936 44 mg on day 70 and 4439 29 mg on day 77 accordingly the released fe in the effluent decreased from 48 4 day 50 to 39 6 day 70 and 20 5 day 77 respectively which meant the accumulation of fe in the reactor during the operation of stage 3 the fe concentration in the sludge of r fs reached 131 53 mg g on day 77 which approached that of fresh fenton sludge 141 70 mg g dry weight under such high iron content the performances of the digesters were maintained well with the cod removal of above 95 fig 1b as mentioned above the slight decrease of methane production during the daily dosage of fenton sludge day 71 77 was related to the competition for electron donor with dir under the increased fenton sludge dosage to avoid potential damage the feed was suspended it suggested that the feeding intensity of 10 g l d of fenton sludge exceeded the capacity of the reactor and should be reduced it is worth mentioned that when stopping the addition of fenton sludge on day 78 95 the fe content in the reactor decreased from 4439 29 to 3411 66 mg it suggested that the fe content in the reactor could decrease after the operation without adding fenton sludge after 95 days of the experiment the vs and ts of sludge in r fs increased to 5 8 and 12 5 compared to 4 9 and 6 5 of the initial sludge respectively which resulted from the biomass proliferation to ensure the stability of operation under the high content of fe in addition to the part of release to the effluent the fe in the sludge could be maintained at a controllable content via stopping the feeding or reducing the dosage 3 3 compostion and changes of fe species in sludge at the initial and end of the experiment day 0 and 95 a mixture sludge sample taken from the r fs reactor was analyzed with the sequential extraction to investigate the composition of fe species as shown in fig 3 on day 0 of sludge after adding 40 g fenton sludge the fe existed mainly in the easily reducible state with ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite as the main species which accounted for 48 7 of the total fe after 95 days the easily reducible fe species content still remained at 53 8 the ratio of reducible fe species sum of exchangeable organic bonding and easily reducible to the total fe had a slightly changed from 78 4 to 75 1 during 95 days experiment on the other hand the relative content of high crystalline e g magnetite increased from 3 2 to 13 8 after 95 days of operation due to the second mineralization of iron oxides it was ascribed that dir generated fe ii covering on the surface of fe iii induced the electron exchange between the adsorbed fe ii and the core of active fe iii oxides to reborn new fe minerals hansel et al 2005 compared to the easily reducible fe oxides such as fe oh 3 in the initial fenton sludge the high crystalline magnetite is uneasy to be reduced for directly oxidizing organic substances during dir due to the lower redox potential 0 31 v bird et al 2011 but however may enhance diet as conductive materials to mediate extracellular electron transfer of irb humic substance largely existing in the landfill leachate that was used to prepare fenton sludge in this study was mostly transported into fenton sludge during the ph adjusted flocculation following the fenton reaction moravia et al 2013 it was reported that humic substance was able to chelate or complex with fe iii to restrain the adsorption of fe ii on the surface of fe iii then relieved the passivation and the second mineralization of iron oxides wang et al 2022 tang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 in this study humic substance was also detected with a concentration of 6 34 mg g fenton sludge humic acid 4 56 mg g fulvic acid 1 78 mg g which might be the reason why the easily reducible fe species remained a relatively high content in r fs reactor after the operation it suggested that fenton sludge was a potentially high quality fe iii source to proceed with dir and enhance anaerobic digestion performance 3 4 potential mechanism of fenton sludge on enhancing ad performance to investigate the effect of fenton sludge on enhancing ad performance sludge samples were taken from both r fs and r c reactors on day 95 to analyze the electrochemical properties eps on the biofilm played a key role in mediating electron and mass transfer between microorganism and extracellular environment shi et al 2016 protein a main component of eps is responsible for electron transfer wang et al 2019a as shown in fig 4 a the protein content of eps in r fs was 25 44 mg g vss which was 53 43 higher than those of r c 16 85 mg g vss some specific proteins e g cytochrome c contained in eps could participate in extracellular electron transfer which was beneficial for the fe iii reduction coupled with organic matter decomposition similarly ye et al have found that exposure of biofilms to fe iii promoted eps excretion and increased the concentration of protein and humic substance ye et al 2018 it was ascribed that fe iii acted as a crucial element to maintain the enzyme activity of microorganism or as an enzyme activator to improve the efficiency of enzymatic reactions jang et al 2001 another two sludge samples were taken from r fs and r c reactors to test their conductivity as shown in fig 4b the conductivity of sludge of r fs was 5 00 μs cm which was approximately 4 4 folds higher than that of r c reactor 1 13 μs cm while the conductivity of a mixture of seed sludge and the fresh fenton sludge was only 0 10 μs cm indicating that the increase in conductivity was not because of the fenton sludge itself in agreement li et al also proved that the increase in the sludge conductivity was not caused by the addition of fe oh 3 itself but by the enhancement of electron transfer of dir li et al 2017 shrestha et al further suggested that the increase in the sludge conductivity was due to the enrichment of some irbs equipped with conductive pili shrestha et al 2014 as a result it promoted electron transfer among the microorganism involved in the sludge aggregate electrochemical impedance spectroscopy fig 4c further showed that the resistance of sludge in r fs reactor 132 50 ω was less than that of r c reactor 168 10 ω which benefited the electron transfer of microorganisms fig 4d showed the cv curve of the sludge taken from the two reactors on day 95 the integral area of the cv curve represented capacitance of sludge the capacitance of r c and r fs was 8 87 μf and 17 90 μf respectively meaning that addition of fs increased the charge discharge ability of sludge by 101 8 different from the conductivity of sludge the charge discharge ability of sludge originated from the redox active substances of sludge such as redox protein and humic acid and served as electron shuttle to enhance dir klüpfel et al 2014 3 5 microbial community analysis microbial community structure was analyzed to gain insight into the microbial factors linked to the performances fig 5 for bacteria communities the dominant genus in r fs was anaerolinea 14 9 which is a type of irbs that was capable of extracellular electron transfer to electrodes or fe iii zheng et al 2021 together with other irbs detected in the reactor e g longilinea comamonas clostridium desulfovibrio and bacteroides xia et al 2019 giordani et al 2019 li et al 2019 wu et al 2010 the total abundance of irbs in r fs reached 29 3 while the abundance of these bacteria in r c only accounted for 19 0 it suggested that fenton sludge could effectively enrich the irbs it was well known that using fe iii as an electron acceptor irbs were capable of oxidizing substrates including simple and complex organic matter such as polysaccharide aromatic hydrocarbon lovley et al 2000 which was in agreement with the improved performance of r fs reactor for archaea communities methanobacterium and methanothrix wre the dominant genus in both r c and r fs reactors methanobacterium a well known hydrogen utilizing methanogens morita et al 2011 accounted for about 28 5 of total archaea communities in r c reactor but accounted for more than 51 2 in r fs reactor the significant increase in the abundance of methanobacterium might be related that the addition of fenton sludge accelerated the decomposition of complex organics to increase hydrogen generation then enhanced methane production via hydrogen utilizing methanogenenesis methanothrix a typical acetate utilizing methanogen accounted for 65 4 in r c and 46 1 in r fs respectively it was reported that methanothrix was capable of accepting electrons from irb geobacter via diet to produce methane rotaru et al 2014 3 6 implication the disposal of hazardous fenton sludge costs up to 35 50 of the total cost of wastewater treatment of fenton process which greatly hinders the application of fenton process ma et al 2022 traditional disposal methods e g landfill combustion and cement stabilization costs a fortune and easily result in pollutant transfer to soil and atmosphere our previous study demonstrated that the organic matter including aromatic substances and chlorinated organics in fenton sludge could be effectively degraded and transformed into methane during anaerobic digestion wang et al 2018 in this study it was also found that fe iii in fenton sludge had an excellent potential to drive dir and enhance anaerobic digestion the results showed that the continuous addition of fenton sludge in the anaerobic system was feasible to reuse this hazardous material and simultaneously enhance anaerobic digestion with the continuous addition of fenton sludge the fe content of sludge in digester gradually increased to 131 5 mg g but the system could still maintain efficient operation without damage to the performance the fe content in sludge decreased when the dosage was stopped or reduced although adding fenton sludge may increase the procedure of anaerobic process it could effectively improve the performance of anaerobic digestion especially it saves the cost of treating fenton sludge besides the fe released to the effluent can be used as a flocculant in the subsequent wastewater processes and organic pollutants in fenton sludge are converted into methane as energy via anaerobic digestion which further subsidizes operating expenses wang et al 2019b it indicated that anaerobic digestion is a feasible method of recycling fenton sludge on one hand fe iii mainly exists in the form of fe oh 3 in fenton sludge with a loose structure and large specific surface area which exposed more reaction sites for dir besides fe oh 3 had a higher dir capacity than crystalline iron oxides e g magnetite 0 31 v due to its higher redox potential 0 10 to 0 10 v zachara et al reported that the reduction extent of amorphous fe oh 3 was 5 times and 3 times that of crystallized hematite and goethite respectively zachara et al 1998 on the other hand humic substance involved in fenton sludge played a significant role on driving dir previous studies demonstrated humic substance served as electron shuttle to enhance the electron transfer between irbs and iron oxides via its quinone hydroquinone groups shimizu et al 2013 stern et al 2018 humic substance was also reported to be complexed with iron oxides to relieve the passivation and second mineralization of iron oxides which maintained the dir activity wang et al 2022 karlsson and persson 2012 shimizu et al 2013 the similar results were also proved in a fenton sludge induced dir environment in this study however whether the complex of hs with fe iii decreased the dissolution of fe in the liquid phase and flowing out along with the effluent should be further considered despite of the advantages mentioned above the feeding dosage of fenton sludge should be carefully optimized to balance the supplement and consumption of fe since superfluous fe iii may destroy the structure and composition of microbial aggregates of anaerobic systems even if the negative effects were not obvious in this study 4 conclusion the study presented here demonstrated that continuously feeding fenton sludge to an anaerobic digester was a feasible method to dispose of this hazardous waste as well as to reuse fe iii involved in fenton sludge for enhancing anaerobic digestion performance continuous addition of fenton sludge increased the fe content of sludge but the system could still perform well without damage to the digestion the dir activity of the fe iii was maintained after 95 days of operation it was found that dir induced by fenton sludge not only enriched irbs to enhance the degradation of organics but also increase the electron transfer capacity of microorganisms to facilitate syntrophic methanogenesis when stopping the feed the fe content of the sludge declined the study also suggested that the amount and frequency of feeding fenton sludge influenced the accumulation of fe in the digester and further affected the performance of anaerobic digestion which should be carefully considered in practical application supporting information method of dna extraction pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing the changes of ph of reactors

an fe iii source for dissimilatory iron reduction dir was continuously added with increasing dosage into an anaerobic digester to enhance the treatment results showed continuously feeding fenton

increased from 40 25 mg g dry weight to 131 53 mg g after continuously feeding for 77days and then declined to 109 17 mg g when the feeding was stopped mass balance analysis showed that 20 5 to 48 4 of fe in the fenton sludge was released to the effluent after experiment the ratio of reducible fe species to the total fe was 75 1 which maintained the high activity in dir microbial community analysis showed that iron reducing bacteria were enriched with the addition of fenton sludge and the sludge in the digester had a higher conductivity and capacitance to strengthen the electron

2019a 2018 in addition irb e g geobacter enriched by dir is able to directly transport electrons generated from organic matter oxidation to methanosaeata or methanosarcina via electrically conductive pili or outer surface c type cytochromes the direct interspecies electron transfer diet between irbs and methanogens can accelerate the conversion of organic matter into methane to enhance anaerobic digestion cruz viggi et al 2014 storck et al 2016 yamada et al 2015 at low concentrations of organic matter dir also competes for electrons with methanogens to inhibit methanogenesis which however benefits the removal of organic matter lovley and phillips 1987 furthermore the humic substance involved in the fenton sludge served as an electron mediator to further enhance the extracellular electron transfer of irb during dir shimizu et al 2013 stern et al 2018 in general anaerobic digestion provides a new perspective for the recycling of fenton sludge with adding fenton sludge to the anaerobic system fe ii produced from dir and the residual fe iii may gradually be accumulated in the anaerobic sludge through chelation and adsorption hansel et al 2005 such accumulation of fe ii induces the transformation of amorphous iron species to more crystalline forms which may reduce the dir activity on the other hand high concentration of fe may affect the cytoactive of microorganism for example bodegom et al 2004 demonstrated a direct inhibition of methanogenesis by amorphous fe oh 3 10 mm at pure cultures of methanogens which was attributed to the inactivation of coenzymes f420 by the excessive fe iii our previous study found that adding 2 to 8 g l fenton sludge dry powder to anaerobic digesters could improve methane production and tcod removal by 12 6 21 0 and 4 6 11 4 respectively at the end of the experiment the fe remained in the reactor reached the highest concentration of 2678 11 mg l nearly 44 1 of the total fe iii in fenton sludge was reduced to fe ii wang et al 2018 however the study was conducted in a batch mode with a single addition of fenton sludge the feasibility of this method in practice depends on the tolerance of anaerobic digestion to the iron accumulation under the continuous dosing of fenton sludge the iron accumulated in the anaerobic sludge may destroy the physical structure and chemical composition of anaerobic sludge thus affecting the performance of anaerobic digestion zhang et al 2009 however no studies have been found that explore the continuous dosing of fenton sludge and its effects on anaerobic digestion in addition fe involved in fenton sludge usually exists as fe oh 3 with poorly crystalline structure it is thermodynamically unstable and easily transforms into more stable crystalline iron minerals after a long time operation boland et al 2014 considering that fe oh 3 has a loose structure and large specific surface area as well as a higher redox potential 0 10 to 0 10 v than crystalline iron oxides e g magnetite 0 31 v such transformation may slowdown the dir efficiency which should also be considered in practice on basis of the above consideration fenton sludge was added into an anaerobic reactor that was operated in a continuous flow mode different feeding strategies single feeding feeding each two day and feeding every day were conducted to investigate the feasibility of the continuous feeding of fenton sludge to the anaerobic digestion system the changes of fe species in fenton sludge were determined to evaluate the potential to drive dir we expect to develop a new strategy for disposing of fenton sludge via the recycling manner 2 material and methods 2 1 fenton sludge the fenton sludge used in this study was derived from a fenton process that treated an aging leachate 8 10 years with a cod of 5708 33 134 63 mg l guangxi china 40 mmol l feso4 7h2o was used as the fe ii source and the molar ratio of h2o2 to fe ii was 3 1 after 2 h of fenton reaction at ph of 3 the effluent ph was adjusted to 7 then precipitated for 12 h the fenton sludge was harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 8000 rpm then stored at 4 c for use the main fe forms involved in fenton sludge existed as fe oh 3 and part of them was complexed with organic matter to present the organic bonding state other characteristics of the fenton sludge are displayed in table 1 2 2 anaerobic experiment two cylindrical glass uasb reactors each with a working volume of 1 l internal diameter of 76 mm and height of 220 mm were used for the anaerobic experiment each reactor received 250 ml of seed sludge as inoculum and 750 ml of artificial wastewater as feed substances the initial seed sludge ts 6 5 vs 4 9 was obtained from an anaerobic digester of a municipal sludge treatment plant in dalian china the composition per liter of the artificial wastewater was as follows 1 50 g glucose 0 48 g yeast extract 2 00 g milk powder wandashan taobao com china 0 10 g nh4cl 0 10 g kh2po4 4 00 g nahco3 and 10 ml trace elements the reactors were operated with a continuous flow model under hrt of 20 h and maintained the temperature of 30 c differently one of the reactors received a certain amount of fenton sludge referred to as r fs the other one was set as a control reactor without the addition of fenton sludge referred to as r c the experiment was divided into four stages with different dosages of fenton sludge to investigate its continuous treatment in anaerobic digestion in stage 1st 0 50 d 40 g fenton sludge was added in r fs at one time in this stage the influent cod gradually increased from 5000 mg l 0 20 d to 6700 mg l 21 40 d and 8000 mg l 41 50 d in stage 2nd 51 70 d 10 g fenton sludge was added into r fs every two days in stage 3rd 71 77 d 10 g fenton sludge was added into r fs every day in stage 4th 78 95 d no fenton sludge was added to only consume the residual fenton sludge added previously 2 3 chemical analysis the effluent of the anaerobic reactors was analyzed daily the supernatant samples of effluent were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 8000 rpm ts vs and cod were analyzed by the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater ferrous and ferric iron in effluent were analyzed by an adaptation of the ferrozine technique cooper et al 2000 the total iron contained in the sludge was determined by inductively coupled plasma icp avio 220 perkinelmer the biogas was collected with a gas sampling bag equipped on top of the reactor and the volume of biogas was measured with a 100 ml glass syringe the content of biogas was measured with a gas chromatograph tianmei gc 7900 china with a thermal conductivity detector tcd zhao et al 2015 the morphology and species of iron were measured by the sequential extraction method according to our previous study wang et al 2022 the extracellular polymers eps were extracted by the method of frølund et al using 732 cation exchange resin as the extractant frølund et al 1996 proteins of eps were measured by bradford s method bradford 1976 the fulvic acid and humic acid of the sample were extracted according to the method proposed by yakimenko 2001 2 4 electrochemical analysis after 95 days experiment 50 ml sludge was taken from the bottom of each reactor to analyze its electrochemical properties all electrochemical analysis were conducted with an electrochemical workstation zhenhua chi1030c china the conductivity of the sludge was measured by the method of three probe electrical conductance measurement before measurement the sludge samples were centrifugated at 8000 rpm for 10 min and washed three times with 0 1 m nacl solution then the treated sludge was placed on the two platinum electrodes separated by a 0 50 mm non conductive gap a voltage ramp of 0 2 to 0 2 v across split electrodes in steps of 25 mv was applied on the working electrode to obtain transient current change data then the conductivity was calculated according to the method of malvankar et al 2011 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was analyzed at a constant potential of 0 00 v vs ag agcl over a frequency range of 1 105 to 0 01 hz with a sinusoidal perturbation amplitude of 10 mv redox capacity was determined by cyclic voltammetry cv measurements the working electrode was replaced by a sludge immobilized vitreous carbon electrode the immobilized method was operated according to a report by yuan et al 2018 the scan rate of the cyclic voltammogram was 50 mv s in the potential range of 0 6 v to 0 6 v vs she 2 5 microbial community structure analysis after experiments 5 ml of sludge samples were collected from two reactors to analyze microbial communities and functional genes via high throughput 16s rrna pyrosequencing zhao et al 2016 the detailed methods of dna extraction pcr and sequencing are provided in the support information 3 results and discussion 3 1 anaerobic digestion with adding fenton sludge the addition of fenton sludge enhanced the stability of anaerobic digestion during the domestication stage 1 0 50 d fig 1 under the influent cod of 5000 mg l day 0 20 the average value of effluent cod of the two reactors were 1038 17 mg l r fs and 1230 79 mg l r c respectively when gradually increasing the influent cod to 6700 mg l and 8000 mg l the effluent cod of r fs remained stable and even decreased to about 100 130 mg l with a cod removal rate of 99 5 while the effluent cod of r c raised to about 1000 1500 mg l with a cod removal rate of 85 5 higher methane production was also observed in r fs under the influent cod of 8000 mg l day 41 50 the average methane production of r fs was 300 23 ml g cod which was 2 2 folds that of r c 135 84 ml g cod it should be mentioned that fenton sludge contains organic matter at around 213 37 mg cod g which also might contribute to methane production assuming that all cod of fenton sludge was converted into methane the maximum methane production from fenton sludge was 2985 5 ml in stage 1 according to the stoichiometric relationship between cod and methane of 350 ml g cod see table 2 after subtracting this part of methane production methane production of r fs in stage 1 was 292 31 ml g codinfluent which was still higher than that of r c it further confirmed that the fenton sludge stimulated dir to promote methane production during anaerobic digestion the results were in agreement with wang et al 2019a who found that cod removal and methane production of anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge were enhanced with the addition of fenton sludge to investigate the effects of continuously adding fenton sludge on anaerobic digestion 10 g of fenton sludge was added every two days stage 2 51 70 d and then every day stage 3 day 71 77 as shown in fig 1b the cod removal with the addition of fenton sludge averaged 97 3 for stage 2 and 96 9 for stage 3 which were still higher than those without fenton sludge 88 4 for stage 2 and 91 3 for stage 3 methane production of r fs in stage 2 and stage 3 averaged 327 48 and 303 62 ml g cod respectively which were 1 8 2 0 times that of r c 168 11 ml g cod when subtracting the cod of fenton sludge methane production of r fs in stage 2 and stage 3 changed to 288 58 and 225 83 ml g codinfluent which was still 1 3 1 7 times that of r c it meant that the continuous addition of fenton sludge still enhanced the anaerobic digestion remarkedly the average methane production of r fs with adding fenton sludge every day during day 71 77 stage 3 significantly fluctuated which was related to the frequent addition of fenton sludge it caused the competition between dir and methanogenesis for electron donors to affect methane production since fe oh 3 was thermodynamically superior to co2 in capturing electrons lovley et al 2000 however the competition benefited the mineralization of organic matter resulting in the higher cod removal after 77 days of operation with adding fenton sludge the fe content of sludge in the digester increased from the initial 40 25 mg g dry weight to 131 53 mg g under such high iron content the performances of the digesters were maintained well with the cod removal of above 95 to avoid the adverse outcome due to the overhigh fe content we suspended the feeding after day 77 namely 20 days of every two days feed and 7 days of daily feed of fenton sludge afterwards the fe content in the sludge declined to 109 17 mg g in the next 17 days meanwhile the cod removal and methane production were maintained well during days 77 95 the above results were further confirmed in a repeated experiment for 20 days that the two anaerobic digesters were restarted up and operated with or without addition of fenton sludge 10 g d see support information the results suggested that the daily feeding fenton sludge indeed enhanced the performance of ad and the system could be operated in the steady state 3 2 mass balance of fe during the operation accompanied with dir of fenton sludge fe ii was released to the effluent as shown in fig 2 a the effluent fe ii of r fs averaged 1 04 mg l during the first 20 days while fe ii was almost undetectable in r c with increasing the influent cod to 6700 mg l and 8000 mg l the effluent fe ii of r fs fluctuated to an average of 4 89 mg l raising organic load augmented organic acid formation of r c to likely dissolve the background fe involved in the seed sludge 40 25 mg fe g dry weight as shown in fig s1 the ph of r c ranged from 6 93 to 7 50 average 7 27 while r fs ranged from 7 17 to 8 24 average 7 71 as a result the lower ph of r c led to a comparable fe ii amount to that of r fs even though the total fe amount of r c was quite lower than that of r fs considering the 40 g fenton sludge added with the increase of fenton sludge addition from day 51 the effluent fe ii of r fs ranged from 0 74 to 9 67 mg l average 4 87 mg l fe iii was also detected in the effluent of r fs and ranged from 5 75 to 40 02 mg l average 20 17 mg l on days 51 77 stage 2 and 3 the calculation showed that fe ii and fe iii sum of the dissolved fe ii fe iii of each day dissolved in the effluent accounted for 2 48 and 10 26 of the total fe amount from the added fenton sludge 100 g for stage 2 and 70 g for stage 3 during days 51 77 respectively the mass balance of fe was calculated at the end of each stage as shown in fig 2c the amount of background fe of the seed sludge inoculated in the reactor contained 660 17 mg i e fe amount in r c after feeding 40 g fenton sludge 37 48 mg g fs in the first stage the theoretical total fe sum of fe content in previous stage and increased fe content by addition of fenton sludge in the sludge of r fs was 2159 37 mg while the actual fe detected in the sludge of r fs on day 50 was only 1113 43 mg which meant that 48 4 of total fe was released to the effluent along with the continuously feeding fenton sludge the fe content in the sludge of r fs further increased to 2936 44 mg on day 70 and 4439 29 mg on day 77 accordingly the released fe in the effluent decreased from 48 4 day 50 to 39 6 day 70 and 20 5 day 77 respectively which meant the accumulation of fe in the reactor during the operation of stage 3 the fe concentration in the sludge of r fs reached 131 53 mg g on day 77 which approached that of fresh fenton sludge 141 70 mg g dry weight under such high iron content the performances of the digesters were maintained well with the cod removal of above 95 fig 1b as mentioned above the slight decrease of methane production during the daily dosage of fenton sludge day 71 77 was related to the competition for electron donor with dir under the increased fenton sludge dosage to avoid potential damage the feed was suspended it suggested that the feeding intensity of 10 g l d of fenton sludge exceeded the capacity of the reactor and should be reduced it is worth mentioned that when stopping the addition of fenton sludge on day 78 95 the fe content in the reactor decreased from 4439 29 to 3411 66 mg it suggested that the fe content in the reactor could decrease after the operation without adding fenton sludge after 95 days of the experiment the vs and ts of sludge in r fs increased to 5 8 and 12 5 compared to 4 9 and 6 5 of the initial sludge respectively which resulted from the biomass proliferation to ensure the stability of operation under the high content of fe in addition to the part of release to the effluent the fe in the sludge could be maintained at a controllable content via stopping the feeding or reducing the dosage 3 3 compostion and changes of fe species in sludge at the initial and end of the experiment day 0 and 95 a mixture sludge sample taken from the r fs reactor was analyzed with the sequential extraction to investigate the composition of fe species as shown in fig 3 on day 0 of sludge after adding 40 g fenton sludge the fe existed mainly in the easily reducible state with ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite as the main species which accounted for 48 7 of the total fe after 95 days the easily reducible fe species content still remained at 53 8 the ratio of reducible fe species sum of exchangeable organic bonding and easily reducible to the total fe had a slightly changed from 78 4 to 75 1 during 95 days experiment on the other hand the relative content of high crystalline e g magnetite increased from 3 2 to 13 8 after 95 days of operation due to the second mineralization of iron oxides it was ascribed that dir generated fe ii covering on the surface of fe iii induced the electron exchange between the adsorbed fe ii and the core of active fe iii oxides to reborn new fe minerals hansel et al 2005 compared to the easily reducible fe oxides such as fe oh 3 in the initial fenton sludge the high crystalline magnetite is uneasy to be reduced for directly oxidizing organic substances during dir due to the lower redox potential 0 31 v bird et al 2011 but however may enhance diet as conductive materials to mediate extracellular electron transfer of irb humic substance largely existing in the landfill leachate that was used to prepare fenton sludge in this study was mostly transported into fenton sludge during the ph adjusted flocculation following the fenton reaction moravia et al 2013 it was reported that humic substance was able to chelate or complex with fe iii to restrain the adsorption of fe ii on the surface of fe iii then relieved the passivation and the second mineralization of iron oxides wang et al 2022 tang et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 in this study humic substance was also detected with a concentration of 6 34 mg g fenton sludge humic acid 4 56 mg g fulvic acid 1 78 mg g which might be the reason why the easily reducible fe species remained a relatively high content in r fs reactor after the operation it suggested that fenton sludge was a potentially high quality fe iii source to proceed with dir and enhance anaerobic digestion performance 3 4 potential mechanism of fenton sludge on enhancing ad performance to investigate the effect of fenton sludge on enhancing ad performance sludge samples were taken from both r fs and r c reactors on day 95 to analyze the electrochemical properties eps on the biofilm played a key role in mediating electron and mass transfer between microorganism and extracellular environment shi et al 2016 protein a main component of eps is responsible for electron transfer wang et al 2019a as shown in fig 4 a the protein content of eps in r fs was 25 44 mg g vss which was 53 43 higher than those of r c 16 85 mg g vss some specific proteins e g cytochrome c contained in eps could participate in extracellular electron transfer which was beneficial for the fe iii reduction coupled with organic matter decomposition similarly ye et al have found that exposure of biofilms to fe iii promoted eps excretion and increased the concentration of protein and humic substance ye et al 2018 it was ascribed that fe iii acted as a crucial element to maintain the enzyme activity of microorganism or as an enzyme activator to improve the efficiency of enzymatic reactions jang et al 2001 another two sludge samples were taken from r fs and r c reactors to test their conductivity as shown in fig 4b the conductivity of sludge of r fs was 5 00 μs cm which was approximately 4 4 folds higher than that of r c reactor 1 13 μs cm while the conductivity of a mixture of seed sludge and the fresh fenton sludge was only 0 10 μs cm indicating that the increase in conductivity was not because of the fenton sludge itself in agreement li et al also proved that the increase in the sludge conductivity was not caused by the addition of fe oh 3 itself but by the enhancement of electron transfer of dir li et al 2017 shrestha et al further suggested that the increase in the sludge conductivity was due to the enrichment of some irbs equipped with conductive pili shrestha et al 2014 as a result it promoted electron transfer among the microorganism involved in the sludge aggregate electrochemical impedance spectroscopy fig 4c further showed that the resistance of sludge in r fs reactor 132 50 ω was less than that of r c reactor 168 10 ω which benefited the electron transfer of microorganisms fig 4d showed the cv curve of the sludge taken from the two reactors on day 95 the integral area of the cv curve represented capacitance of sludge the capacitance of r c and r fs was 8 87 μf and 17 90 μf respectively meaning that addition of fs increased the charge discharge ability of sludge by 101 8 different from the conductivity of sludge the charge discharge ability of sludge originated from the redox active substances of sludge such as redox protein and humic acid and served as electron shuttle to enhance dir klüpfel et al 2014 3 5 microbial community analysis microbial community structure was analyzed to gain insight into the microbial factors linked to the performances fig 5 for bacteria communities the dominant genus in r fs was anaerolinea 14 9 which is a type of irbs that was capable of extracellular electron transfer to electrodes or fe iii zheng et al 2021 together with other irbs detected in the reactor e g longilinea comamonas clostridium desulfovibrio and bacteroides xia et al 2019 giordani et al 2019 li et al 2019 wu et al 2010 the total abundance of irbs in r fs reached 29 3 while the abundance of these bacteria in r c only accounted for 19 0 it suggested that fenton sludge could effectively enrich the irbs it was well known that using fe iii as an electron acceptor irbs were capable of oxidizing substrates including simple and complex organic matter such as polysaccharide aromatic hydrocarbon lovley et al 2000 which was in agreement with the improved performance of r fs reactor for archaea communities methanobacterium and methanothrix wre the dominant genus in both r c and r fs reactors methanobacterium a well known hydrogen utilizing methanogens morita et al 2011 accounted for about 28 5 of total archaea communities in r c reactor but accounted for more than 51 2 in r fs reactor the significant increase in the abundance of methanobacterium might be related that the addition of fenton sludge accelerated the decomposition of complex organics to increase hydrogen generation then enhanced methane production via hydrogen utilizing methanogenenesis methanothrix a typical acetate utilizing methanogen accounted for 65 4 in r c and 46 1 in r fs respectively it was reported that methanothrix was capable of accepting electrons from irb geobacter via diet to produce methane rotaru et al 2014 3 6 implication the disposal of hazardous fenton sludge costs up to 35 50 of the total cost of wastewater treatment of fenton process which greatly hinders the application of fenton process ma et al 2022 traditional disposal methods e g landfill combustion and cement stabilization costs a fortune and easily result in pollutant transfer to soil and atmosphere our previous study demonstrated that the organic matter including aromatic substances and chlorinated organics in fenton sludge could be effectively degraded and transformed into methane during anaerobic digestion wang et al 2018 in this study it was also found that fe iii in fenton sludge had an excellent potential to drive dir and enhance anaerobic digestion the results showed that the continuous addition of fenton sludge in the anaerobic system was feasible to reuse this hazardous material and simultaneously enhance anaerobic digestion with the continuous addition of fenton sludge the fe content of sludge in digester gradually increased to 131 5 mg g but the system could still maintain efficient operation without damage to the performance the fe content in sludge decreased when the dosage was stopped or reduced although adding fenton sludge may increase the procedure of anaerobic process it could effectively improve the performance of anaerobic digestion especially it saves the cost of treating fenton sludge besides the fe released to the effluent can be used as a flocculant in the subsequent wastewater processes and organic pollutants in fenton sludge are converted into methane as energy via anaerobic digestion which further subsidizes operating expenses wang et al 2019b it indicated that anaerobic digestion is a feasible method of recycling fenton sludge on one hand fe iii mainly exists in the form of fe oh 3 in fenton sludge with a loose structure and large specific surface area which exposed more reaction sites for dir besides fe oh 3 had a higher dir capacity than crystalline iron oxides e g magnetite 0 31 v due to its higher redox potential 0 10 to 0 10 v zachara et al reported that the reduction extent of amorphous fe oh 3 was 5 times and 3 times that of crystallized hematite and goethite respectively zachara et al 1998 on the other hand humic substance involved in fenton sludge played a significant role on driving dir previous studies demonstrated humic substance served as electron shuttle to enhance the electron transfer between irbs and iron oxides via its quinone hydroquinone groups shimizu et al 2013 stern et al 2018 humic substance was also reported to be complexed with iron oxides to relieve the passivation and second mineralization of iron oxides which maintained the dir activity wang et al 2022 karlsson and persson 2012 shimizu et al 2013 the similar results were also proved in a fenton sludge induced dir environment in this study however whether the complex of hs with fe iii decreased the dissolution of fe in the liquid phase and flowing out along with the effluent should be further considered despite of the advantages mentioned above the feeding dosage of fenton sludge should be carefully optimized to balance the supplement and consumption of fe since superfluous fe iii may destroy the structure and composition of microbial aggregates of anaerobic systems even if the negative effects were not obvious in this study 4 conclusion the study presented here demonstrated that continuously feeding fenton sludge to an anaerobic digester was a feasible method to dispose of this hazardous waste as well as to reuse fe iii involved in fenton sludge for enhancing anaerobic digestion performance continuous addition of fenton sludge increased the fe content of sludge but the system could still perform well without damage to the digestion the dir activity of the fe iii was maintained after 95 days of operation it was found that dir induced by fenton sludge not only enriched irbs to enhance the degradation of organics but also increase the electron transfer capacity of microorganisms to facilitate syntrophic methanogenesis when stopping the feed the fe content of the sludge declined the study also suggested that the amount and frequency of feeding fenton sludge influenced the accumulation of fe in the digester and further affected the performance of anaerobic digestion which should be carefully considered in practical application supporting information method of dna extraction pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing the changes of ph of reactors

15401,in this study four typical recycled agricultural wastes aws corn cob wheat straw sawdust and walnut shells named aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 respectively were selected as external solid carbon sources to enhance the removal of nitrogen in wastewater and specifically the driving mechanism was thoroughly investigated the leaching experiments showed that the dissolved organic carbon doc release capacity followed the order of aw1 aw2 aw3 aw4 ranging from 6 21 to 31 92 mg g doc released from aws mainly consisted of protein like substances fulvic acid like substances and humic like substances aw1 and aw2 achieved comparable nox n removal performance with a liquid carbon source of sodium acetate sa during the long term denitrification experiments 94 2 but not for the other two aws only 16 8 38 1 denitrification performance relied on doc released from aws at the beginning while the enrichment of the functional cazymes including glycoside hydrolase and carbohydrate esterase involved in cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition of aws and functional genes gapdh gap 2 pk etc related to glycolysis were the inner driving force which guaranteed the continuous supply of electron donors for denitrification the relatively high abundances of napab narghi nirks norbc and nosz which encode nitrate reductase nitrite reductase no reductase and n2o reductase assured the better denitrification performance in the sa aw1 and aw2 groups in addition to denitrification related functional genes the relative abundances of nirbd and nrfah associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction were much higher in aw1 and aw2 groups than in sa group implying that the nitrogen removal mechanism should be different in liquid carbon source and aw based solid carbon source systems in addition glu gltbd and glna which participate in ammonia assimilation were the highest in the aw2 group resulting in a large amount of organic nitrogen accumulation peak concentration of approximately 24 5 mg l and this finally ruled it out as an alternative external carbon source the abovementioned microbial mechanism was verified based on the correlation analysis of nutrient removal and functional genes combined with host bacterial analysis our study can provide valuable information for understanding the mechanism of using aws as alternative external carbon sources to promote the removal of nitrogen in wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrification nitrogen removal agricultural wastes solid carbon source wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to control the eutrophication of water bodies as a point source of contaminants an increasing stringent discharge of standards is chosen for wastewater treatment plants wwtps especially for total nitrogen tn fang et al 2022 wang et al 2020 currently the class a level of the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wwtps gb18918 2002 is widely adopted in most districts of china thus the effluent tn concentration should be below 15 mg l wang et al 2021 for conventional complete nitrification and denitrification nitrogen removal processes tn removal largely depends on the carbon to nitrogen c n ratio of wastewater generally to achieve a good removal efficiency of tn the c n ratio should be greater than 5 xiong et al 2020 nevertheless the actual c n ratio in the influent of wwtps in china is usually below 4 or 5 especially in wwtps located in southern china jia et al 2019 ma et al 2020 to overcome the problem of the deficiency of carbon sources for conventional nitrogen removal processes several novel biological nitrogen removal processes have been developed including anaerobic ammonia oxidation simultaneous nitrification and denitrification and short cut nitrification denitrification xiong et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a however due to the complexity of the operational conditions for the above novel nitrogen removal processes the complete nitrification and denitrification process is still widely used in china therefore it is a realistic problem that to satisfy the high discharge standard of tn external carbon sources should be added during the nitrogen removal process in wwtps especially for denitrification processes to meet the requirement of the c n ratio for the denitrification process liquid carbon sources including sodium acetate sa glucose and methanol are widely used in wwtps jia et al 2019 although the addition of liquid carbon sources has the advantage of achieving a high denitrification rate and good denitrification performance it also has some disadvantages for example liquid carbon sources can be easily decomposed the control system is sophisticated and there is a relatively high cost of transportation and operation zhang et al 2021a as an alternative solid carbon sources are attracting increasing attention among the solid carbon sources synthetic ploymers such as polycaprolactone polybutylene succinate and polylactic acid have relatively high denitrification performance while high treatment costs restrict their wide application yang et al 2020b zhang et al 2020 2021b in contrast natural cellulose rich materials also called agricultural wastes aws with porous structures and reactive groups straw rice husks wood chips corn cobs etc are very cheap and easily obtained previous studies indicated that aws used as solid denitrifiers showed excellent carbon release capacity and displayed a promising denitrification potential of 105 3 140 1 mg no3 n d xiong et al 2020 yang et al 2015 sun et al 2019 used alkali pretreated corn cobs as a solid carbon source to promote denitrification in coking wastewater and found that 90 of nitrate was removed in the system jia et al 2019 reported that a high tn removal efficiency of 66 8 93 7 was achieved after the addition of aws apricot pits walnut shells etc in the intermittent aeration constructed wetlands although the denitrification efficacy of aws as solid carbon sources has been widely confirmed in different systems the mechanism is not yet well understood yang et al 2021 reported that in addition to dissolved organic carbon doc released from aws large amounts of adenosine triphosphate atp and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh generated from glycolysis of lignocellulose in aws can also act as electron donors and energy sources for denitrification due to the complexity composition of aws the glycolysis pathway and involved functional genes have not been thoroughly investigated microbial community analysis was also conducted using conventional molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for attempting to reveal the mechanism of nitrogen metabolism in aw based systems however the obtained information was insufficient to clarify the microbial mechanism during nitrogen metabolism therefore although aws used as solid carbon sources to enhance nitrogen removal are feasible the mechanism still needs to be thoroughly investigated in this study four typical recycled aws corn cob wheat straw sawdust and walnut shells named aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 respectively were selected as external solid carbon sources for improving nitrogen removal in wastewater and the removal mechanism was emphasized first leaching experiments were conducted to investigate the doc release behavior and its compositions were further quantitatively analyzed via parallel factor analysis parafac of a fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem second denitrification experiments were carried out to comprehensively assess the potential of using aws as external carbon sources by comparing with the conditions of using a liquid carbon source of sa third the related microbial mechanism was clarified based on metagenomic sequencing by analyzing the microbial community lignocellulosic decomposition glycolysis and nitrogen metabolism functional genes and pathways finally the abovementioned microbial mechanism was verified based on the correlation analysis of nutrient removal and functional genes combined with host bacterial analysis our study can provide valuable information on using aws as alternative solid carbon sources to enhance the removal of nitrogen in wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and aw materials the aws used in this study including aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 were collected from rural areas near lanzhou city china fig s1 the four chosen aws are easily to obtain renewable and very cheap in northwest region of china in addition to achieve a high denitrification performance and avoid nitrogen loading caused by aws during the wastewater treatment the four aws all had the characteristics of high carbon content 44 5 47 2 and low nitrogen content 0 35 1 04 the collected aws were handled as follows first washed with deionized water three times then air dried and cut into small fractions afterward sieved into desired sizes 1 2 cm and finally stored in a dryer before use potassium nitrate kno3 used as a nitrogen source during the denitrification experiments was purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china reagents for determining wastewater parameters and other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co shanghai china 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 leaching experiments of aws the leaching experiments were conducted to investigate organic carbon released from aws and nitrogen loading caused by aws to exclude the decomposition of aws by microorganisms all erlenmeyer flasks were sterilized t 121 c for 30 min before starting the experiments five grams of dried aw was individually added into a 500 ml sterilized erlenmeyer flask with a working volume of 250 ml the erlenmeyer flasks were sealed using rubber stoppers and placed into a rotary shaker dky ii shanghai duke automation equipment co ltd china for reaction at 25 c and 100 rpm the whole leaching experiments lasted for 15 days and every aw corresponded to 36 erlenmeyer flasks for 12 samplings at 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 11 13 and 15 d three replicates aliquots of 20 ml of supernatant were taken at the set sampling time and an erlenmeyer flask was abandoned after sampling once then the collected supernatants were filtered through a glass fiber filter gf f 0 45 μm for doc tn and eem analysis to explore the carbon release behavior of the four selected aws a kinetics study was conducted specifically the second order and rigter peppas kinetics were used here to calculate the carbon release rate and carbon release capacity of aws eqs 1 and 2 1 second order kinetics t q t t 1 2 q m t q m 2 rigter peppas kinetics q t q k

experiments using different carbon sources to evaluate the feasibility of using aws as solid carbon sources to achieve a high rate of nitrogen removal denitrification experiments were conducted and a conventional liquid carbon source was also adopted for comparison the denitrification experiments were carried out using a set of 1 5 l reactors with a working volume of 1 4 l activated sludge was collected from the anoxic tank of one wwtp located in songjiang district shanghai china and it was washed thrice using tap water to remove unnecessary impurities then it was added to the reactors and the mixed liquor suspended solid in every reactor was controlled at 3100 90 mg l twelve grams of solid carbon source aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 was added to the reactor individually and sa chemical oxygen demand cod 175 25 mg l was selected as a typical liquid carbon source as a reference and the intended c n ratio was around 5 0 kno3 was used as a nitrogen source and other nutrients including phosphate and trace elements were supplemented according to our previous study wang et al 2014 the reactors were capped and the headspace was purged with n2 for 20 min after filling to guarantee anaerobic conditions the denitrification experiments were operated in a semi continuous flow model and one cycle was fixed as 24 h 22 h for reaction and 2 h for sedimentation aliquots of 15 ml of supernatant were taken and filtered through a glass fiber filter gf f 0 45 μm for cod no3 n no2 n nh4 n and tn concentration analysis after completing the abovementioned wastewater parameters analysis different amount of kno3 depending on denitrification performance under different carbon source conditions was supplied to keep the no3 n concentration in the system was approximately 35 0 mg l for the next run of denitrification experiment the whole denitrification experiments lasted for 30 days after which activated sludge was taken from the reactors to conduct metagenomic sequencing analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 doc and its components analysis the concentration of doc released from aws during the leaching experiments was determined by a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan the components of doc were further analyzed using a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer agilent technologies usa the eem spectra were determined using a 1 cm quartz cuvette and they were obtained by scanning the excitation wavelengths and emission wavelengths of 200 550 nm with increases of 2 nm and 10 nm respectively the scanning speed was fixed at 1200 nm min using excitation and emission bandwidths of 5 nm then parafac analysis was performed on the eem dataset based on the domfluor toolbox using matlab r2021a mathworks usa software jia et al 2019 stedmon and bro 2008 2 3 2 metagenomic sequencing analyses the metagenomic sequencing analyses were carried out using illumina hiseq xten illumina usa dna was extracted from each sample using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedical solon oh usa and a metagenomics sequence library was constructed by major bio inc shanghai china data quality control metagenome assembly and gene prediction were conducted in accordance with our previous studies ping et al 2020 2022 nr species annotation was conducted using diamond http www diamondsearch org index php version 0 8 35 the cazy http www cazy org annotation result was generated by dbcan http csbl bmb uga edu dbcan the kegg functional annotation was performed using diamond http www diamondsearch org index php version 0 8 35 the contribution analysis between species and functions was performed by perl script 2 3 3 other analysis wastewater parameters were determined in accordance with standard methods apha 2012 specifically cod no2 n no3 n nh4 n and tn were analyzed using open reflux method colorimetric method ultraviolet spectrophotometric screening method phenate method and persulfate method respectively the contents of lignocellulose were quantified using the van soest method van soest et al 1991 the surface morphology of the aw materials before and after leaching experiments was obtained by scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su8010 japan the nitrogen functional forms in the aws before and after the denitrification experiments were conducted by a thermo scientific k alpha x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps system the pairwise spearman s correlation matrix of nutrient removal efficiencies cod tn and no3 n and functional genes associated with nitrogen metabolism were analyzed using the ggcor package in r version 4 1 2 zeng et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon release performance of aws during leaching experiments 3 1 1 dynamics of doc released from aws the variations of doc released from different aws during the leaching experiments are shown in fig 1 a the results showed that the four kinds of aws exhibited a similar release trend doc was released quickly within the first few days and then released slowly afterward correspondingly the doc release rates of aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 sharply decreased from 20 85 0 09 9 02 0 35 2 43 0 01 and 2 99 0 37 mg g d on the first day to 0 75 0 01 0 49 0 04 0 37 0 03 and 0 21 0 01 mg g d on the seventh day respectively afterward the release rates were relatively stable 0 11 0 52 mg g d table s1 in addition to the doc release rate the doc release capacity also varied greatly and followed the order of aw1 aw2 aw3 aw4 the cumulative doc concentration within 15 d was 31 92 15 68 7 31 and 6 21 mg g for aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 respectively the objective of this study was to assess the potential of using aws to improve the denitrification process thus in addition to carbon release capacity nitrogen loading caused by aws themselves should also be considered and the results are shown in fig 1 b compared to doc the nitrogen concentration released from aws was much lower the average tn concentrations released from aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 were only 0 44 0 28 0 11 and 0 08 mg g respectively this means that nitrogen released from the aws selected in this study during the leaching process could not cause significant nitrogen loading during the wastewater treatment 3 1 2 kinetics of doc released from aws second order kinetics and rigter peppas kinetics were used to describe the carbon release process of aws and the results are shown in table 1 the maximum carbon release capacity qm obtained from second order kinetics for aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 was 32 02 15 97 7 54 and 6 71 mg g respectively which agreed with the ultimate cumulative doc concentration obtained by the leaching experiments 15 d fig 1 a the t1 2 value and the carbon release rate constant k obtained from the second order and rigter peppas kinetics for aw1 were 0 67 and 0 6664 respectively which implied that aw1 had the fastest release rate among the four selected aws this was an advantage of using aw1 as solid carbon source because doc released from it was the main electron donors at the initial stage of denitrification processes xiong et al 2020 indicated that the k value obtained from rigter peppas kinetics suggested interfacial mass transfer resistance which finally influenced the carbon release rate of the solid carbon source in this study corn cob aw1 had a porous structure thus the interface mass transfer resistance was the lowest which facilitated the leaching of organic carbon this was confirmed by sem analysis fig s2 conversely the surface of sawdust aw3 was relatively compact which was inconvenient for the leaching of organic carbon resulting in the slowest release rate the results were consistent with the t1 2 values obtained from the second order kinetics 0 67 and 3 67 d for aw1 and aw3 respectively aw2 and aw4 had medium porous structures and their t1 2 values were also in the middle level 1 03 2 18 d in addition the n values of the aws obtained by rigter peppas kinetics were all less than 0 45 which demonstrated that doc release into solution was due to the diffusion mechanism but not the decomposition mechanism peppas and sahlin 1989 zhang et al 2021b moreover the basic carbon skeleton structure of the four aws did not collapse before and after the leaching experiments suggesting their sustainable carbon release characteristics the above leaching experiments and kinetics study implied that the four chosen aws all had carbon release potential and aw1 showed the highest carbon release capacity and fastest release rate 3 1 3 components of doc released from aws doc composition was studied using the parafac model and three to five component models were established fig s3 the results showed that compared to 3 components the sum of squared residuals of 4 components are obviously improved while for 5 components the improvement is not evident according to the principle of the highest data variance with the minimum component number 4 components were then selected a detailed description of the 4 components is shown in table 2 by comparison with previous studies the doc compositions were identified component 1 with two peak excitation wavelengths at 240 320 nm and peak emission wavelengths at 436 nm was described as a fulvic acid like and humic like substance chai et al 2019 niloy et al 2021 these substances are considered to be microbially transformable and are widely detected in ecosystems chai et al 2019 jia et al 2019 component 2 was characterized by peak excitation emission wavelengths at 270 nm and 340 nm which were confirmed to be typical protein like substances such as tryptophan like acid chen et al 2003 guo et al 2012 component 3 was described as protein like substances including tyrosine like and tryptophan like substances with two peak excitation wavelengths at 230 290 nm and a peak emission wavelength at 358 nm murphy et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 component 4 was identified as protein like organic compounds related to microbial byproducts with two peak excitation wavelengths at 230 270 nm and a peak emission wavelength at 322 nm murphy et al 2011 niloy et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 among the four components components 2 3 and 4 are all associated with protein like substances and their amounts are positively related to bioavailability zhang et al 2016 therefore the release of soluble protein during the leaching experiments of using different aws was quantified fig 1 c the results showed that the release of soluble protein mainly proceeded in the first two days and the peak release concentration followed the order of aw3 0 56 mg g aw1 0 21 mg g aw4 0 20 mg g aw2 0 12 mg g compared to that of doc soluble protein concentration released during the leaching process was minor the variations in the relative distribution of eem parafac components during the leaching experiments are shown in figs 2 and s4 the results showed that protein like substances were dominant in the doc composition among the four aws components 2 4 3 and 4 had the highest doc released from aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 respectively with average relative contributions of 38 5 41 9 60 8 and 60 7 respectively in addition for aw1 and aw2 in addition to protein like substances such as component 2 and component 4 component 1 was also much high which were fulvic acid like and humic like substances chai et al 2019 niloy et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 this might also be one reason why aw1 and aw2 showed a relatively excellent denitrification performance in the following denitrification experiments compared with the other two aws as fulvic acid like and humic like substances are easier to utilize by microorganisms ping et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 3 2 sustainable nitrogen removal performance during denitrification experiments to assess the sustainable nitrogen removal performance of aws denitrification experiments were conducted and sa was selected as a conventional liquid carbon source for comparison fig 3 for the sa group the average cod concentration in the effluent was only 2 6 mg l which meant that sa was well adopted during the denitrification process however for the aw groups cod residues existed in the effluent to some extent for aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 cod concentrations in the effluent ranged from 10 8 to 50 6 mg l 5 7 105 3 mg l 5 1 29 2 mg l and 3 1 14 7 mg l respectively with average concentrations of 35 6 mg l 59 9 mg l 16 8 mg l and 6 6 mg l respectively on the first few days 1 6 d the cod residue for aw1 was higher than that for the other three aws the results were consistent with leaching experiments in which the released doc concentration was much higher for aw1 fig 1 a however the cod residue for the aw2 group increased significantly afterward 7 30 d at the beginning the carbon source adopted from denitrification mainly relied on doc released from aws while the decomposition of aws occurred afterward and their byproducts such as lignocellulose became the main carbon source for denitrification zhang et al 2021a it is well known that lignocellulose includes cellulose hemicellulose and lignin among of them cellulose and hemicellulose are readily hydrolyzed and can be adopted by microorganisms while lignin is refractory zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 thus the components of different aws were further determined table s2 the results showed that cellulose and hemicellulose were the main components for aw1 and aw2 which accounted for 62 7 65 0 of the total biomass in contrast lignin was the main constituent for aw3 and aw4 which was greater than 30 of the total biomass lignin is an aromatic polymer derived from the structural units of phenoxyisopropanol or its derivatives zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 and a high content of lignin inhibits the decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose jia et al 2019 this could well explain why a low cod concentration existed in the effluent and why poor denitrification performance occurred in the aw3 and aw4 groups the components in cod residuals were then analyzed using eem fig s5 it can be seen that there were two main peaks at ex em of 280 nm 330 nm and ex em of 340 360 nm 410 450 nm were detected in the effluent when sa was used as carbon source they were described as protein like substances and humic like substances respectively a clear peak at ex em of 320 375 nm 400 460 nm associated with humic acid like substances was detected when aw1 was used as carbon source and its fluorescence intensity was higher than sa for other three aws protein like substances and humic like substances were also the main components in cod residuals the results of leaching experiments confirmed that in addition to protein like substances humic like substances was also high in aws groups especially for aw1 and aw2 groups table 2 and fig 2 the fluorescence peak intensity of protein like substances was low in the effluent indicating that the protein like substances leached from the aws was degraded during the denitrification experiments on the contrary the intensity of humic like substances was relatively high in the effluent it might due to the decay of the aws during the denitrification process ping et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 in addition to cod the nox n sum of no3 n and no2 n nh4 n and tn concentrations in the effluent were also traced figs 3 b and s6 the results showed that denitrification proceeded well in the sa aw1 and aw2 groups but not in the aw3 and aw4 groups the average removal efficiency of nox n was 99 2 97 5 94 2 38 1 and 16 8 for the sa aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 groups respectively in addition distinct from the sa group tn accumulated in the groups using aws as solid carbon sources the peak accumulation concentrations of tn were 13 3 mg l 24 5 mg l 38 2 mg l and 40 5 mg l for the aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 groups respectively fig s6 a additionally the nitrogen functional forms in the aws before and after the denitrification experiments were conducted by xps analysis fig s7 the resolution of the n1s peaks can be divided into protein nitrogen protein n and pyrrole nitrogen pyrrole n with the binding energy of 399 6 ev and 400 4 ev respectively zhang et al 2013 before the denitrification experiments the protein n accounted for 89 53 85 88 93 95 and 88 52 in aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 respectively correspondingly pyrrole n accounted for 10 47 14 12 6 05 and 11 48 respectively after the denitrification experiments the percentage of protein n in aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 slightly reduced to 85 88 80 71 89 79 84 75 respectively the xps results were consistent with leaching experiments fig 1 c furthermore although aw2 was used as a carbon source achieved good denitrification it might not be suitable as an alternative carbon source the reason was that high organic nitrogen accumulation occurred when aw2 was used for denitrification fig s6 b in summary the leaching and denitrification experiments confirmed that aw1 was suitable for use as a solid carbon source because it achieved denitrification performance comparable to that of sa and tn in the effluent could reach the class a level of china gb18918 2002 3 3 microbial structure and metabolic pathway analysis 3 3 1 microbial community structure a total of 2 78 108 raw reads and 4 19 1010 raw bases were obtained from sa aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 by metagenome sequencing table s3 after quality control more than 96 5 of the clean reads and 96 1 of the clean bases were retained the results showed that the sequence after quality control can effectively reflect the dna genetic information and ensure the accuracy of subsequent analysis the main phyla relative abundance 1 and genera relative abundance 2 in the systems using different carbon sources were analyzed fig s8 the results showed that although the top five phyla using different carbon sources were the same including proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes actinobacteria and acidobacteria their relative abundances varied in different systems these microorganisms are all considered responsible for promoting nitrogen utilization in activated sludge based systems wang et al 2021 proteobacteria widely exist in activated sludge and play a crucial role in nutrient adoption karanasios et al 2010 the relative abundance of proteobacteria was 50 5 49 9 46 8 41 1 and 41 9 in the sa aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 groups respectively which was consistent with their denitrification performances in addition to nitrogen utilization bacteroidetes and chloroflexi are reported to have the ability to decompose macromolecular substances such as lignocellulose and thus to improve their biodegradabilities yang et al 2021 the relative abundances of bacteroidetes and chloroflexi in aw1 31 3 and aw2 37 1 exceeded those in the other groups 23 9 26 3 implying that aws decomposition proceeded well in these two groups this could explain why the effluent cod concentration was highest in the aw2 group than in the other groups fig 3 a the average effluent cod concentration in the aw2 group 59 9 mg l was higher than aw1 35 6 mg l and other groups 6 6 16 8 mg l in addition ignavibacteriae existed in the systems which are admitted as dissimilatory nitrate reduction bacteria wang et al 2022 its relative abundances in the sa aw1 and aw2 groups 1 2 1 7 were much higher than those in the aw3 and aw4 groups 0 3 0 6 implying that in addition to denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction also proceeded in the system the compositions of the microbial community at the genus level in the systems are shown in fig s8 b rhodocyclales unclassified p bacteroidetes unclassified c betaproteobacteria and thauera were the main genera in the systems while they varied in different systems thauera 5 0 was only enriched in the sa group but not in the aw groups thauera are considered heterotrophic nitrification denitrification bacteria responsible for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite tan et al 2021 conversely the other three main genera were enriched in the aw groups especially the aw1 and aw2 groups the relative abundances of these three genera in the aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 groups were 18 5 17 9 8 2 and 7 9 respectively chu and wang 2016 and yang et al 2021 reported that unclassified p bacteroidetes belongs to bacteroidetes and unclassified c betaproteobacteria belongs to betaproteobacteria which are widely recognized denitrifying bacteria that can degrade lignocellulose from solid carbon sources in addition hydrogenophaga is also reported to have the ability of heterotrophic nitrification denitrification tan et al 2021 and its relative abundance was much higher in the aw1 and aw2 groups 3 0 and 2 7 respectively the high relative abundances of the above microorganisms in aw1 and aw2 guaranteed excellent denitrification performance which was comparable with the sa group 3 3 2 glycolysis pathways and related functional genes during the denitrification process using aws as a solid carbon source in addition to the leached doc electron donors mainly came from the decomposition of lignocellulose by microorganisms yang et al 2021 thus the functional cazy family involved in lignocellulosic decomposition was thoroughly investigated and the results are shown in table 3 cellulose is commonly composed of glucan and its degradation is mainly involved in three processes wang et al 2016 i the cellulose chain is cleaved under the action of endoglucanase ii then cellobiose is released under the attack of cellobiohydrolase and iii finally glucose is formed from cello oligosaccharide and cellobiose under the role of β glucosidase genes encoding these cellulases are mainly from the glycoside hydrolase gh family involving gh1 gh3 gh5 gh6 gh8 gh9 gh44 gh48 and gh74 the total abundance of the above coding genes related to cellulose decomposition followed the order aw2 38 954 hits aw1 38 170 hits aw3 37 344 hits aw4 32 082 hits the main components of hemicellulose are xylan mannan galactan and arabinan which are decomposed mainly by endoxylanase β xylosidase α glucuronidase arabinofuron glycosidase galactosidase and acetylxylan esterase the coding genes of enzymes for hemicellulose decomposition are mainly gh and carbohydrate esterase ce family including gh10 gh11 gh27 gh35 gh36 gh39 gh43 gh51 gh52 gh62 gh67 gh127 ce1 ce3 ce4 and ce7 the total abundance of the above coding genes was in the order aw2 133 442 hits aw1 127 606 hits aw3 117 590 hits aw4 85 620 hits the above results implied that the coding genes for cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition in the aw1 and aw2 groups were much higher than those in the aw3 and aw4 groups which was consistent with the better denitrification achieved when using aw1 and aw2 as solid carbon sources fig 3 b moreover the relatively higher coding genes for cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition in the aw2 172 396 hits group than in the aw1 165 776 hits group could explain why cod in the effluent was much higher in the aw2 group than in the aw1 group fig 3 a in addition lignin decomposition is mainly associated with auxiliary oxidoreductase enzymes aas of which the main encoding genes are aa1 and aa2 lignin is composed of a highly complex aromatic heteropolymer covalently cross linked with polysaccharide fibers through covalent bonds thus it is difficult to decompose the abundances genes encoding lignin decomposition in aws were significantly lower than those of cellulose and hemicellulose indicating that lignin decomposition was weak in the system after the decomposition of lignocellulose sugar enters the glycolysis process and large amounts of atp and nadh are generated to provide electron donors for denitrification cao et al 2021 thus the encoding genes related to glycolysis and the schematic diagram of the glycolytic pathway were further analyzed and the results are shown in fig 4 the results of the hierarchical clustering heatmaps based on the euclidean distance algorithm showed that the aw1 and aw2 groups were different from the aw3 group and far from the aw4 group fig 4 a glycolysis starts from glucose to glucose 6 phosphate yang et al 2021 and the related enzymes involved in this process are polyphosphate glucokinase ppgk hexokinase hk glucokinase gck and adp dependent glucokinase adpgk the abundances of these functional genes under different solid carbon source conditions followed the order of aw2 aw1 aw3 aw4 then glucose 6 phosphate was converted to fructose 6 phosphate under the action of glucose 6 phosphate isomerase gpi and its abundance was similar to the former step next fructose 1 6 diphosphate and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate were formed by pfkc pfk9 fructose bisphosphate aldolase aldo and triose phosphate isomerase tpi respectively these functional genes under different solid carbon source conditions were in the order of aw1 aw2 aw3 aw4 subsequently the key step of glycolysis was from glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate to 3 phosphoglycerate which was under the action of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh gap2 gapn and gapor and phosphoglycerate kinase pgk li et al 2016 and yang et al 2021 confirmed that gapdh and gap 2 can catalyze the conversion of 3 phosphoglyceraldehyde to 3 phosphoglycerate in glycolysis and generate nadh as an electron donor for denitrification the highest gene abundances of gapdh and gap 2 appeared in the aw1 group finally pyruvate was formed from 3 phosphoglycerate under the catalysis of pgam gpml eno and pyruvate kinase pk among these genes pk is a key enzyme that can catalyze the generation of atp yang et al 2020a the above analysis showed that all main functional genes related to glycolysis process were enriched in the aw1 and aw2 groups which guaranteed better denitrification performance under these two solid carbon source conditions 3 3 3 nitrogen metabolism pathways and related functional genes nitrogen metabolism including ammonification ammonia assimilation nitrification denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction assimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrogen fixation occurs under the catalysis of functional enzymes that are synthesized by nitrifiers and denitrifiers to obtain comprehensive knowledge of nitrogen metabolism under different carbon source conditions functional genes related to nitrogen metabolism pathways were analyzed and the results are shown in fig 5 the results showed that the relative abundances of nitrogen metabolism related functional genes varied when using liquid and solid carbon sources fig 5 a the relative abundances of nira nasab narghi gudb nr and hao were much higher in the sa group while these genes were relatively low in the aw group conversely gltbd nosz nirks napab and nirbd were much higher in the aw1 and aw2 groups but not in the sa group in addition these functional genes were all relatively low in the aw3 and aw4 groups which was consistent with the weak nitrogen metabolism in these two groups fig 5 b shows that ammonia assimilation denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction were the main nitrogen metabolism pathways in the present system and other pathways were minor tan et al 2021 indicated that gudb is involved in single step ammonification and that glu gltbd and glna participate in two step ammonia assimilation in this study the relative abundances of glu gltbd and glna were much higher in the aw2 group than in the other groups suggesting that the process of ammonia assimilation to organic nitrogen accelerated in the aw2 group this was consistent with the abovementioned results that high organic nitrogen accumulation occurred when aw2 was used for carbon source figs 3 b and s6 the total abundances of nasab narghi and napab coding for nitrate reductase zeng et al 2021 nirks coding for nitrite reductase norbc coding for no reductase and nosz coding for n2o reductase were also much higher confirming that denitrification was the main nitrogen metabolism pathway compared to assimilatory nitrate reduction dissimilatory nitrate reduction was more active under anaerobic conditions as the relative abundances of nirbd and nrfah were slightly higher than that of nira in addition nitrogen fixation and nitrification were not prevalent as the abundances of related genes including nifdkh hcp amocab and hao were not high to elucidate the relationship between functional genes and denitrifiers the host bacteria of the main functional genes napab narghi nirks norbc and nosz in the denitrification pathway were further analyzed fig 5 c the results showed that betaproteobacteria is the main host for the above denitrification related functional genes betaproteobacteria was the main microorganism in the system and its relative abundance of in the sa aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 groups was 25 7 28 2 22 9 14 4 and 15 3 respectively studies have shown that most betaproteobacteria are considered to be rhoclocyclaceae and are reported to be denitrifiners chu and wang 2016 yang et al 2020a furthermore flavobacteriia was the host of napab in the sa group but not in the aw groups in addition gammaproteobacteria was also the host of nirks and norbc but not nosz indicating that grammaproteobacteria hardly can reduce n2o the above results showed that denitrification related genes and their hosts enriched in the sa aw1 and aw2 groups were the inner driving force for better denitrification achieved in these three groups 3 4 correlation of nutrient removal and functional genes cod removal was positively correlated with napab nirks norbc gltbd and glna r 0 6 p 0 05 figs 6 and s9 napab nirks and norbc are the main functional genes associated with denitrification tan et al 2021 implying that good denitrification performance was due to the sufficient adoption of a carbon source gltbd and glna are the main genes involved in organic nitrogen generation during ammonification and the high relative abundance of these two genes in the aw2 group suggested that the accumulation of organic nitrogen occurred with the decomposition of aws in addition fig 6 also shows that cod removal was negatively correlated with amocab r 0 6 p 0 05 the species contribution results suggested that proteobacteria and unclassified d bacteria were the main hosts for amocab and its deficiency in aw2 group caused the cod accumulation level to be much higher than that in the other groups fig 3 a the correlation of nitrate removal with functional genes was similar to that of cod removal and nosz appeared to be significantly correlated with functional genes nosz is an important gene for converting n2o to n2 during denitrification and proteobacteria bacteroides and chloroflexi are the main hosts fig s10 the contributions of these three microorganisms accounted for more than 88 in the sa aw1 and aw2 groups conversely the correlation tn removal and functional genes contrasted with that between tn removal and nitrate removal the above analysis further confirmed that cod removal and denitrification performance were correlated with nitrogen metabolic functional genes and their hosts their high relative abundances in the sa aw1 and aw2 groups guaranteed good denitrification performance under these three carbon source conditions 4 conclusion the leaching experiments showed that the doc release capacity followed the order of aw1 aw2 aw3 aw4 ranging from 6 21 to 31 92 mg g eem parafac analysis showed that doc released from aws mainly consisted of protein like substances fulvic acid like substances and humic like substances aw1 and aw2 achieved nox n removal performance comparable to that of sa during the long term denitrification experiments 94 2 but not for the other two aws when aws were used as external solid carbon sources denitrification performance relied on doc released from aws at the beginning while the enrichment of the functional cazy family including ghs and ces associated with cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition and functional genes gapdh gap 2 pk etc related to glycolysis were the inner forces that guaranteed the continuous supply of electron donors for denitrification the nitrogen removal mechanism should be different in liquid carbon source and aw based carbon source systems because in addition to functional genes associated with denitrification the relative abundances of nirbd and nrfah associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction were much higher in the aw1 and aw2 groups than in the sa group in addition glu gltbd and glna which participate in ammonia assimilation were the highest in the aw2 group resulting in a large amount of organic nitrogen accumulation and this finally ruled out it as an alternative external carbon source the abovementioned microbial mechanism was verified based on the correlation analysis of nutrient removal and functional genes combined with host bacterial analysis our study can provide valuable information for understanding the mechanism of using aws as alternative external carbon sources to promote the

15401,in this study four typical recycled agricultural wastes aws corn cob wheat straw sawdust and walnut shells named aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 respectively were selected as external solid carbon sources to enhance the removal of nitrogen in wastewater and specifically the driving mechanism was thoroughly investigated the leaching experiments showed that the dissolved organic carbon doc release capacity followed the order of aw1 aw2 aw3 aw4 ranging from 6 21 to 31 92 mg g doc released from aws mainly consisted of protein like substances fulvic acid like substances and humic like substances aw1 and aw2 achieved comparable nox n removal performance with a liquid carbon source of sodium acetate sa during the long term denitrification experiments 94 2 but not for the other two aws only 16 8 38 1 denitrification performance relied on doc released from aws at the beginning while the enrichment of the functional cazymes including glycoside hydrolase and carbohydrate esterase involved in cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition of aws and functional genes gapdh gap 2 pk etc related to glycolysis were the inner driving force which guaranteed the continuous supply of electron donors for denitrification the relatively high abundances of napab narghi nirks norbc and nosz which encode nitrate reductase nitrite reductase no reductase and n2o reductase assured the better denitrification performance in the sa aw1 and aw2 groups in addition to denitrification related functional genes the relative abundances of nirbd and nrfah associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction were much higher in aw1 and aw2 groups than in sa group implying that the nitrogen removal mechanism should be different in liquid carbon source and aw based solid carbon source systems in addition glu gltbd and glna which participate in ammonia assimilation were the highest in the aw2 group resulting in a large amount of organic nitrogen accumulation peak concentration of approximately 24 5 mg l and this finally ruled it out as an alternative external carbon source the abovementioned microbial mechanism was verified based on the correlation analysis of nutrient removal and functional genes combined with host bacterial analysis our study can provide valuable information for understanding the mechanism of using aws as alternative external carbon sources to promote the removal of nitrogen in wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrification nitrogen removal agricultural wastes solid carbon source wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to control the eutrophication of water bodies as a point source of contaminants an increasing stringent discharge of standards is chosen for wastewater treatment plants wwtps especially for total nitrogen tn fang et al 2022 wang et al 2020 currently the class a level of the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wwtps gb18918 2002 is widely adopted in most districts of china thus the effluent tn concentration should be below 15 mg l wang et al 2021 for conventional complete nitrification and denitrification nitrogen removal processes tn removal largely depends on the carbon to nitrogen c n ratio of wastewater generally to achieve a good removal efficiency of tn the c n ratio should be greater than 5 xiong et al 2020 nevertheless the actual c n ratio in the influent of wwtps in china is usually below 4 or 5 especially in wwtps located in southern china jia et al 2019 ma et al 2020 to overcome the problem of the deficiency of carbon sources for conventional nitrogen removal processes several novel biological nitrogen removal processes have been developed including anaerobic ammonia oxidation simultaneous nitrification and denitrification and short cut nitrification denitrification xiong et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a however due to the complexity of the operational conditions for the above novel nitrogen removal processes the complete nitrification and denitrification process is still widely used in china therefore it is a realistic problem that to satisfy the high discharge standard of tn external carbon sources should be added during the nitrogen removal process in wwtps especially for denitrification processes to meet the requirement of the c n ratio for the denitrification process liquid carbon sources including sodium acetate sa glucose and methanol are widely used in wwtps jia et al 2019 although the addition of liquid carbon sources has the advantage of achieving a high denitrification rate and good denitrification performance it also has some disadvantages for example liquid carbon sources can be easily decomposed the control system is sophisticated and there is a relatively high cost of transportation and operation zhang et al 2021a as an alternative solid carbon sources are attracting increasing attention among the solid carbon sources synthetic ploymers such as polycaprolactone polybutylene succinate and polylactic acid have relatively high denitrification performance while high treatment costs restrict their wide application yang et al 2020b zhang et al 2020 2021b in contrast natural cellulose rich materials also called agricultural wastes aws with porous structures and reactive groups straw rice husks wood chips corn cobs etc are very cheap and easily obtained previous studies indicated that aws used as solid denitrifiers showed excellent carbon release capacity and displayed a promising denitrification potential of 105 3 140 1 mg no3 n d xiong et al 2020 yang et al 2015 sun et al 2019 used alkali pretreated corn cobs as a solid carbon source to promote denitrification in coking wastewater and found that 90 of nitrate was removed in the system jia et al 2019 reported that a high tn removal efficiency of 66 8 93 7 was achieved after the addition of aws apricot pits walnut shells etc in the intermittent aeration constructed wetlands although the denitrification efficacy of aws as solid carbon sources has been widely confirmed in different systems the mechanism is not yet well understood yang et al 2021 reported that in addition to dissolved organic carbon doc released from aws large amounts of adenosine triphosphate atp and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh generated from glycolysis of lignocellulose in aws can also act as electron donors and energy sources for denitrification due to the complexity composition of aws the glycolysis pathway and involved functional genes have not been thoroughly investigated microbial community analysis was also conducted using conventional molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for attempting to reveal the mechanism of nitrogen metabolism in aw based systems however the obtained information was insufficient to clarify the microbial mechanism during nitrogen metabolism therefore although aws used as solid carbon sources to enhance nitrogen removal are feasible the mechanism still needs to be thoroughly investigated in this study four typical recycled aws corn cob wheat straw sawdust and walnut shells named aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 respectively were selected as external solid carbon sources for improving nitrogen removal in wastewater and the removal mechanism was emphasized first leaching experiments were conducted to investigate the doc release behavior and its compositions were further quantitatively analyzed via parallel factor analysis parafac of a fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem second denitrification experiments were carried out to comprehensively assess the potential of using aws as external carbon sources by comparing with the conditions of using a liquid carbon source of sa third the related microbial mechanism was clarified based on metagenomic sequencing by analyzing the microbial community lignocellulosic decomposition glycolysis and nitrogen metabolism functional genes and pathways finally the abovementioned microbial mechanism was verified based on the correlation analysis of nutrient removal and functional genes combined with host bacterial analysis our study can provide valuable information on using aws as alternative solid carbon sources to enhance the removal of nitrogen in wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and aw materials the aws used in this study including aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 were collected from rural areas near lanzhou city china fig s1 the four chosen aws are easily to obtain renewable and very cheap in northwest region of china in addition to achieve a high denitrification performance and avoid nitrogen loading caused by aws during the wastewater treatment the four aws all had the characteristics of high carbon content 44 5 47 2 and low nitrogen content 0 35 1 04 the collected aws were handled as follows first washed with deionized water three times then air dried and cut into small fractions afterward sieved into desired sizes 1 2 cm and finally stored in a dryer before use potassium nitrate kno3 used as a nitrogen source during the denitrification experiments was purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china reagents for determining wastewater parameters and other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co shanghai china 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 leaching experiments of aws the leaching experiments were conducted to investigate organic carbon released from aws and nitrogen loading caused by aws to exclude the decomposition of aws by microorganisms all erlenmeyer flasks were sterilized t 121 c for 30 min before starting the experiments five grams of dried aw was individually added into a 500 ml sterilized erlenmeyer flask with a working volume of 250 ml the erlenmeyer flasks were sealed using rubber stoppers and placed into a rotary shaker dky ii shanghai duke automation equipment co ltd china for reaction at 25 c and 100 rpm the whole leaching experiments lasted for 15 days and every aw corresponded to 36 erlenmeyer flasks for 12 samplings at 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 11 13 and 15 d three replicates aliquots of 20 ml of supernatant were taken at the set sampling time and an erlenmeyer flask was abandoned after sampling once then the collected supernatants were filtered through a glass fiber filter gf f 0 45 μm for doc tn and eem analysis to explore the carbon release behavior of the four selected aws a kinetics study was conducted specifically the second order and rigter peppas kinetics were used here to calculate the carbon release rate and carbon release capacity of aws eqs 1 and 2 1 second order kinetics t q t t 1 2 q m t q m 2 rigter peppas kinetics q t q k t n where q t is the released amount of doc per unit mass of aw at time t mg g q m is the maximum released amount of doc per unit mass of aw mg g q is the ultimate released amount of doc per unit mass of aw mg g t 1 2 represents the time when the doc release amount is half of its maximum release amount d k is the carbon release rate constant and n is the carbon release index 2 2 2 denitrification experiments using different carbon sources to evaluate the feasibility of using aws as solid carbon sources to achieve a high rate of nitrogen removal denitrification experiments were conducted and a conventional liquid carbon source was also adopted for comparison the denitrification experiments were carried out using a set of 1 5 l reactors with a working volume of 1 4 l activated sludge was collected from the anoxic tank of one wwtp located in songjiang district shanghai china and it was washed thrice using tap water to remove unnecessary impurities then it was added to the reactors and the mixed liquor suspended solid in every reactor was controlled at 3100 90 mg l twelve grams of solid carbon source aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 was added to the reactor individually and sa chemical oxygen demand cod 175 25 mg l was selected as a typical liquid carbon source as a reference and the intended c n ratio was around 5 0 kno3 was used as a nitrogen source and other nutrients including phosphate and trace elements were supplemented according to our previous study wang et al 2014 the reactors were capped and the headspace was purged with n2 for 20 min after filling to guarantee anaerobic conditions the denitrification experiments were operated in a semi continuous flow model and one cycle was fixed as 24 h 22 h for reaction and 2 h for sedimentation aliquots of 15 ml of supernatant were taken and filtered through a glass fiber filter gf f 0 45 μm for cod no3 n no2 n nh4 n and tn concentration analysis after completing the abovementioned wastewater parameters analysis different amount of kno3 depending on denitrification performance under different carbon source conditions was supplied to keep the no3 n concentration in the system was approximately 35 0 mg l for the next run of denitrification experiment the whole denitrification experiments lasted for 30 days after which activated sludge was taken from the reactors to conduct metagenomic sequencing analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 doc and its components analysis the concentration of doc released from aws during the leaching experiments was determined by a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan the components of doc were further analyzed using a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer agilent technologies usa the eem spectra were determined using a 1 cm quartz cuvette and they were obtained by scanning the excitation wavelengths and emission wavelengths of 200 550 nm with increases of 2 nm and 10 nm respectively the scanning speed was fixed at 1200 nm min using excitation and emission bandwidths of 5 nm then parafac analysis was performed on the eem dataset based on the domfluor toolbox using matlab r2021a mathworks usa software jia et al 2019 stedmon and bro 2008 2 3 2 metagenomic sequencing analyses the metagenomic sequencing analyses were carried out using illumina hiseq xten illumina usa dna was extracted from each sample using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedical solon oh usa and a metagenomics sequence library was constructed by major bio inc shanghai china data quality control metagenome assembly and gene prediction were conducted in

result was generated by dbcan http csbl bmb uga edu dbcan the kegg functional annotation was performed using diamond http www diamondsearch org index php version 0 8 35 the contribution analysis between species and functions was performed by perl script 2 3 3 other analysis wastewater parameters were determined in accordance with standard methods apha 2012 specifically cod no2 n no3 n nh4 n and tn were analyzed using open reflux method colorimetric method ultraviolet spectrophotometric screening method phenate method and persulfate method respectively the contents of lignocellulose were quantified using the van soest method van soest et al 1991 the surface morphology of the aw materials before and after leaching experiments was obtained by scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su8010 japan the nitrogen functional forms in the aws before and after the denitrification experiments were conducted by a thermo scientific k alpha x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps system the pairwise spearman s correlation matrix of nutrient removal efficiencies cod tn and no3 n and functional genes associated with nitrogen metabolism were analyzed using the ggcor package in r version 4 1 2 zeng et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon release performance of aws during leaching experiments 3 1 1 dynamics of doc released from aws the variations of doc released from different aws during the leaching experiments are shown in fig 1 a the results showed that the four kinds of aws exhibited a similar release trend doc was released quickly within the first few days and then released slowly afterward correspondingly the doc release rates of aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 sharply decreased from 20 85 0 09 9 02 0 35 2 43 0 01 and 2 99 0 37 mg g d on the first day to 0 75 0 01 0 49 0 04 0 37 0 03 and 0 21 0 01 mg g d on the seventh day respectively afterward the release rates were relatively stable 0 11 0 52 mg g d table s1 in addition to the doc release rate the doc release capacity also varied greatly and followed the order of aw1 aw2 aw3 aw4 the cumulative doc concentration within 15 d was 31 92 15 68 7 31 and 6 21 mg g for aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 respectively the objective of this study was to assess the potential of using aws to improve the denitrification process thus in addition to carbon release capacity nitrogen loading caused by aws themselves should also be considered and the results are shown in fig 1 b compared to doc the nitrogen concentration released from aws was much lower the average tn concentrations released from aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 were only 0 44 0 28 0 11 and 0 08 mg g respectively this means that nitrogen released from the aws selected in this study during the leaching process could not cause significant nitrogen loading during the wastewater treatment 3 1 2 kinetics of doc released from aws second order kinetics and rigter peppas kinetics were used to describe the carbon release process of aws and the results are shown in table 1 the maximum carbon release capacity qm obtained from second order kinetics for aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 was 32 02 15 97 7 54 and 6 71 mg g respectively which agreed with the ultimate cumulative doc concentration obtained by the leaching experiments 15 d fig 1 a the t1 2 value and the carbon release rate constant k obtained from the second order and rigter peppas kinetics for aw1 were 0 67 and 0 6664 respectively which implied that aw1 had the fastest release rate among the four selected aws this was an advantage of using aw1 as solid carbon source because doc released from it was the main electron donors at the initial stage of denitrification processes xiong et al 2020 indicated that the k value obtained from rigter peppas kinetics suggested interfacial mass transfer resistance which finally influenced the carbon release rate of the solid carbon source in this study corn cob aw1 had a porous structure thus the interface mass transfer resistance was the lowest which facilitated the leaching of organic carbon this was confirmed by sem analysis fig s2 conversely the surface of sawdust aw3 was relatively compact which was inconvenient for the leaching of organic carbon resulting in the slowest release rate the results were consistent with the t1 2 values obtained from the second order kinetics 0 67 and 3 67 d for aw1 and aw3 respectively aw2 and aw4 had medium porous structures and their t1 2 values were also in the middle level 1 03 2 18 d in addition the n values of the aws obtained by rigter peppas kinetics were all less than 0 45 which demonstrated that doc release into solution was due to the diffusion mechanism but not the decomposition mechanism peppas and sahlin 1989 zhang et al 2021b moreover the basic carbon skeleton structure of the four aws did not collapse before and after the leaching experiments suggesting their sustainable carbon release characteristics the above leaching experiments and kinetics study implied that the four chosen aws all had carbon release potential and aw1 showed the highest carbon release capacity and fastest release rate 3 1 3 components of doc released from aws doc composition was studied using the parafac model and three to five component models were established fig s3 the results showed that compared to 3 components the sum of squared residuals of 4 components are obviously improved while for 5 components the improvement is not evident according to the principle of the highest data variance with the minimum component number 4 components were then selected a detailed description of the 4 components is shown in table 2 by comparison with previous studies the doc compositions were identified component 1 with two peak excitation wavelengths at 240 320 nm and peak emission wavelengths at 436 nm was described as a fulvic acid like and humic like substance chai et al 2019 niloy et al 2021 these substances are considered to be microbially transformable and are widely detected in ecosystems chai et al 2019 jia et al 2019 component 2 was characterized by peak excitation emission wavelengths at 270 nm and 340 nm which were confirmed to be typical protein like substances such as tryptophan like acid chen et al 2003 guo et al 2012 component 3 was described as protein like substances including tyrosine like and tryptophan like substances with two peak excitation wavelengths at 230 290 nm and a peak emission wavelength at 358 nm murphy et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 component 4 was identified as protein like organic compounds related to microbial byproducts with two peak excitation wavelengths at 230 270 nm and a peak emission wavelength at 322 nm murphy et al 2011 niloy et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 among the four components components 2 3 and 4 are all associated with protein like substances and their amounts are positively related to bioavailability zhang et al 2016 therefore the release of soluble protein during the leaching experiments of using different aws was quantified fig 1 c the results showed that the release of soluble protein mainly proceeded in the first two days and the peak release concentration followed the order of aw3 0 56 mg g aw1 0 21 mg g aw4 0 20 mg g aw2 0 12 mg g compared to that of doc soluble protein concentration released during the leaching process was minor the variations in the relative distribution of eem parafac components during the leaching experiments are shown in figs 2 and s4 the results showed that protein like substances were dominant in the doc composition among the four aws components 2 4 3 and 4 had the highest doc released from aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 respectively with average relative contributions of 38 5 41 9 60 8 and 60 7 respectively in addition for aw1 and aw2 in addition to protein like substances such as component 2 and component 4 component 1 was also much high which were fulvic acid like and humic like substances chai et al 2019 niloy et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 this might also be one reason why aw1 and aw2 showed a relatively excellent denitrification performance in the following denitrification experiments compared with the other two aws as fulvic acid like and humic like substances are easier to utilize by microorganisms ping et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 3 2 sustainable nitrogen removal performance during denitrification experiments to assess the sustainable nitrogen removal performance of aws denitrification experiments were conducted and sa was selected as a conventional liquid carbon source for comparison fig 3 for the sa group the average cod concentration in the effluent was only 2 6 mg l which meant that sa was well adopted during the denitrification process however for the aw groups cod residues existed in the effluent to some extent for aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 cod concentrations in the effluent ranged from 10 8 to 50 6 mg l 5 7 105 3 mg l 5 1 29 2 mg l and 3 1 14 7 mg l respectively with average concentrations of 35 6 mg l 59 9 mg l 16 8 mg l and 6 6 mg l respectively on the first few days 1 6 d the cod residue for aw1 was higher than that for the other three aws the results were consistent with leaching experiments in which the released doc concentration was much higher for aw1 fig 1 a however the cod residue for the aw2 group increased significantly afterward 7 30 d at the beginning the carbon source adopted from denitrification mainly relied on doc released from aws while the decomposition of aws occurred afterward and their byproducts such as lignocellulose became the main carbon source for denitrification zhang et al 2021a it is well known that lignocellulose includes cellulose hemicellulose and lignin among of them cellulose and hemicellulose are readily hydrolyzed and can be adopted by microorganisms while lignin is refractory zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 thus the components of different aws were further determined table s2 the results showed that cellulose and hemicellulose were the main components for aw1 and aw2 which accounted for 62 7 65 0 of the total biomass in contrast lignin was the main constituent for aw3 and aw4 which was greater than 30 of the total biomass lignin is an aromatic polymer derived from the structural units of phenoxyisopropanol or its derivatives zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 and a high content of lignin inhibits the decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose jia et al 2019 this could well explain why a low cod concentration existed in the effluent and why poor denitrification performance occurred in the aw3 and aw4 groups the components in cod residuals were then analyzed using eem fig s5 it can be seen that there were two main peaks at ex em of 280 nm 330 nm and ex em of 340 360 nm 410 450 nm were detected in the effluent when sa was used as carbon source they were described as protein like substances and humic like substances respectively a clear peak at ex em of 320 375 nm 400 460 nm associated with humic acid like substances was detected when aw1 was used as carbon source and its fluorescence intensity was higher than sa for other three aws protein like substances and humic like substances were also the main components in cod residuals the results of leaching experiments confirmed that in addition to protein like substances humic like substances was also high in aws groups especially for aw1 and aw2 groups table 2 and fig 2 the fluorescence peak intensity of protein like substances was low in the effluent indicating that the protein like substances leached from the aws was degraded during the denitrification experiments on the contrary the intensity of humic like substances was relatively high in the effluent it might due to the decay of the aws during the denitrification process ping et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 in addition to cod the nox n sum of no3 n and no2 n nh4 n and tn concentrations in the effluent were also traced figs 3 b and s6 the results showed that denitrification proceeded well in the sa aw1 and aw2 groups but not in the aw3 and aw4 groups the average removal efficiency of nox n was 99 2 97 5 94 2 38 1 and 16 8 for the sa aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 groups respectively in addition distinct from the sa group tn accumulated in the groups using aws as solid carbon sources the peak accumulation concentrations of tn were 13 3 mg l 24 5 mg l 38 2 mg l and 40 5 mg l for the aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 groups respectively fig s6 a additionally the nitrogen functional forms in the aws before and after the denitrification experiments were conducted by xps analysis fig s7 the resolution of the n1s peaks can be divided into protein nitrogen protein n and pyrrole nitrogen pyrrole n with the binding energy of 399 6 ev and 400 4 ev respectively zhang et al 2013 before the denitrification experiments the protein n accounted for 89 53 85 88 93 95 and 88 52 in aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 respectively correspondingly pyrrole n accounted for 10 47 14 12 6 05 and 11 48 respectively after the denitrification experiments the percentage of protein n in aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 slightly reduced to 85 88 80 71 89 79 84 75 respectively the xps results were consistent with leaching experiments fig 1 c furthermore although aw2 was used as a carbon source achieved good denitrification it might not be suitable as an alternative carbon source the reason was that high organic nitrogen accumulation occurred when aw2 was used for denitrification fig s6 b in summary the leaching and denitrification experiments confirmed that aw1 was suitable for use as a solid carbon source because it achieved denitrification performance comparable to that of sa and tn in the effluent could reach the class a level of china gb18918 2002 3 3 microbial structure and metabolic pathway analysis 3 3 1 microbial community structure a total of 2 78 108 raw reads and 4 19 1010 raw bases were obtained from sa aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 by metagenome sequencing table s3 after quality control more than 96 5 of the clean reads and 96 1 of the clean bases were retained the results showed that the sequence after quality control can effectively reflect the dna genetic information and ensure the accuracy of subsequent analysis the main phyla relative abundance 1 and genera relative abundance 2 in the systems using different carbon sources were analyzed fig s8 the results showed that although the top five phyla using different carbon sources were the same including proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes actinobacteria and acidobacteria their relative abundances varied in different systems these microorganisms are all considered responsible for promoting nitrogen utilization in activated sludge based systems wang et al 2021 proteobacteria widely exist in activated sludge and play a crucial role in nutrient adoption karanasios et al 2010 the relative abundance of proteobacteria was 50 5 49 9 46 8 41 1 and 41 9 in the sa aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 groups respectively which was consistent with their denitrification performances in addition to nitrogen utilization bacteroidetes and chloroflexi are reported to have the ability to decompose macromolecular substances such as lignocellulose and thus to improve their biodegradabilities yang et al 2021 the relative abundances of bacteroidetes and chloroflexi in aw1 31 3 and aw2 37 1 exceeded those in the other groups 23 9 26 3 implying that aws decomposition proceeded well in these two groups this could explain why the effluent cod concentration was highest in the aw2 group than in the other groups fig 3 a the average effluent cod concentration in the aw2 group 59 9 mg l was higher than aw1 35 6 mg l and other groups 6 6 16 8 mg l in addition ignavibacteriae existed in the systems which are admitted as dissimilatory nitrate reduction bacteria wang et al 2022 its relative abundances in the sa aw1 and aw2 groups 1 2 1 7 were much higher than those in the aw3 and aw4 groups 0 3 0 6 implying that in addition to denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction also proceeded in the system the compositions of the microbial community at the genus level in the systems are shown in fig s8 b rhodocyclales unclassified p bacteroidetes unclassified c betaproteobacteria and thauera were the main genera in the systems while they varied in different systems thauera 5 0 was only enriched in the sa group but not in the aw groups thauera are considered heterotrophic nitrification denitrification bacteria responsible for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite tan et al 2021 conversely the other three main genera were enriched in the aw groups especially the aw1 and aw2 groups the relative abundances of these three genera in the aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 groups were 18 5 17 9 8 2 and 7 9 respectively chu and wang 2016 and yang et al 2021 reported that unclassified p bacteroidetes belongs to bacteroidetes and unclassified c betaproteobacteria belongs to betaproteobacteria which are widely recognized denitrifying bacteria that can degrade lignocellulose from solid carbon sources in addition hydrogenophaga is also reported to have the ability of heterotrophic nitrification denitrification tan et al 2021 and its relative abundance was much higher in the aw1 and aw2 groups 3 0 and 2 7 respectively the high relative abundances of the above microorganisms in aw1 and aw2 guaranteed excellent denitrification performance which was comparable with the sa group 3 3 2 glycolysis pathways and related functional genes during the denitrification process using aws as a solid carbon source in addition to the leached doc electron donors mainly came from the decomposition of lignocellulose by microorganisms yang et al 2021 thus the functional cazy family involved in lignocellulosic decomposition was thoroughly investigated and the results are shown in table 3 cellulose is commonly composed of glucan and its degradation is mainly involved in three processes wang et al 2016 i the cellulose chain is cleaved under the action of endoglucanase ii then cellobiose is released under the attack of cellobiohydrolase and iii finally glucose is formed from cello oligosaccharide and cellobiose under the role of β glucosidase genes encoding these cellulases are mainly from the glycoside hydrolase gh family involving gh1 gh3 gh5 gh6 gh8 gh9 gh44 gh48 and gh74 the total abundance of the above coding genes related to cellulose decomposition followed the order aw2 38 954 hits aw1 38 170 hits aw3 37 344 hits aw4 32 082 hits the main components of hemicellulose are xylan mannan galactan and arabinan which are decomposed mainly by endoxylanase β xylosidase α glucuronidase arabinofuron glycosidase galactosidase and acetylxylan esterase the coding genes of enzymes for hemicellulose decomposition are mainly gh and carbohydrate esterase ce family including gh10 gh11 gh27 gh35 gh36 gh39 gh43 gh51 gh52 gh62 gh67 gh127 ce1 ce3 ce4 and ce7 the total abundance of the above coding genes was in the order aw2 133 442 hits aw1 127 606 hits aw3 117 590 hits aw4 85 620 hits the above results implied that the coding genes for cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition in the aw1 and aw2 groups were much higher than those in the aw3 and aw4 groups which was consistent with the better denitrification achieved when using aw1 and aw2 as solid carbon sources fig 3 b moreover the relatively higher coding genes for cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition in the aw2 172 396 hits group than in the aw1 165 776 hits group could explain why cod in the effluent was much higher in the aw2 group than in the aw1 group fig 3 a in addition lignin decomposition is mainly associated with auxiliary oxidoreductase enzymes aas of which the main encoding genes are aa1 and aa2 lignin is composed of a highly complex aromatic heteropolymer covalently cross linked with polysaccharide fibers through covalent bonds thus it is difficult to decompose the abundances genes encoding lignin decomposition in aws were significantly lower than those of cellulose and hemicellulose indicating that lignin decomposition was weak in the system after the decomposition of lignocellulose sugar enters the glycolysis process and large amounts of atp and nadh are generated to provide electron donors for denitrification cao et al 2021 thus the encoding genes related to glycolysis and the schematic diagram of the glycolytic pathway were further analyzed and the results are shown in fig 4 the results of the hierarchical clustering heatmaps based on the euclidean distance algorithm showed that the aw1 and aw2 groups were different from the aw3 group and far from the aw4 group fig 4 a glycolysis starts from glucose to glucose 6 phosphate yang et al 2021 and the related enzymes involved in this process are polyphosphate glucokinase ppgk hexokinase hk glucokinase gck and adp dependent glucokinase adpgk the abundances of these functional genes under different solid carbon source conditions followed the order of aw2 aw1 aw3 aw4 then glucose 6 phosphate was converted to fructose 6 phosphate under the action of glucose 6 phosphate isomerase gpi and its abundance was similar to the former step next fructose 1 6 diphosphate and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate were formed by pfkc pfk9 fructose bisphosphate aldolase aldo and triose phosphate isomerase tpi respectively these functional genes under different solid carbon source conditions were in the order of aw1 aw2 aw3 aw4 subsequently the key step of glycolysis was from glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate to 3 phosphoglycerate which was under the action of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh gap2 gapn and gapor and phosphoglycerate kinase pgk li et al 2016 and yang et al 2021 confirmed that gapdh and gap 2 can catalyze the conversion of 3 phosphoglyceraldehyde to 3 phosphoglycerate in glycolysis and generate nadh as an electron donor for denitrification the highest gene abundances of gapdh and gap 2 appeared in the aw1 group finally pyruvate was formed from 3 phosphoglycerate under the catalysis of pgam gpml eno and pyruvate kinase pk among these genes pk is a key enzyme that can catalyze the generation of atp yang et al 2020a the above analysis showed that all main functional genes related to glycolysis process were enriched in the aw1 and aw2 groups which guaranteed better denitrification performance under these two solid carbon source conditions 3 3 3 nitrogen metabolism pathways and related functional genes nitrogen metabolism including ammonification ammonia assimilation nitrification denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction assimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrogen fixation occurs under the catalysis of functional enzymes that are synthesized by nitrifiers and denitrifiers to obtain comprehensive knowledge of nitrogen metabolism under different carbon source conditions functional genes related to nitrogen metabolism pathways were analyzed and the results are shown in fig 5 the results showed that the relative abundances of nitrogen metabolism related functional genes varied when using liquid and solid carbon sources fig 5 a the relative abundances of nira nasab narghi gudb nr and hao were much higher in the sa group while these genes were relatively low in the aw group conversely gltbd nosz nirks napab and nirbd were much higher in the aw1 and aw2 groups but not in the sa group in addition these functional genes were all relatively low in the aw3 and aw4 groups which was consistent with the weak nitrogen metabolism in these two groups fig 5 b shows that ammonia assimilation denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction were the main nitrogen metabolism pathways in the present system and other pathways were minor tan et al 2021 indicated that gudb is involved in single step ammonification and that glu gltbd and glna participate in two step ammonia assimilation in this study the relative abundances of glu gltbd and glna were much higher in the aw2 group than in the other groups suggesting that the process of ammonia assimilation to organic nitrogen accelerated in the aw2 group this was consistent with the abovementioned results that high organic nitrogen accumulation occurred when aw2 was used for carbon source figs 3 b and s6 the total abundances of nasab narghi and napab coding for nitrate reductase zeng et al 2021 nirks coding for nitrite reductase norbc coding for no reductase and nosz coding for n2o reductase were also much higher confirming that denitrification was the main nitrogen metabolism pathway compared to assimilatory nitrate reduction dissimilatory nitrate reduction was more active under anaerobic conditions as the relative abundances of nirbd and nrfah were slightly higher than that of nira in addition nitrogen fixation and nitrification were not prevalent as the abundances of related genes including nifdkh hcp amocab and hao were not high to elucidate the relationship between functional genes and denitrifiers the host bacteria of the main functional genes napab narghi nirks norbc and nosz in the denitrification pathway were further analyzed fig 5 c the results showed that betaproteobacteria is the main host for the above denitrification related functional genes betaproteobacteria was the main microorganism in the system and its relative abundance of in the sa aw1 aw2 aw3 and aw4 groups was 25 7 28 2 22 9 14 4 and 15 3 respectively studies have shown that most betaproteobacteria are considered to be rhoclocyclaceae and are reported to be denitrifiners chu and wang 2016 yang et al 2020a furthermore flavobacteriia was the host of napab in the sa group but not in the aw groups in addition gammaproteobacteria was also the host of nirks and norbc but not nosz indicating that grammaproteobacteria hardly can reduce n2o the above results showed that denitrification related genes and their hosts enriched in the sa aw1 and aw2 groups were the inner driving force for better denitrification achieved in these three groups 3 4 correlation of nutrient removal and functional genes cod removal was positively correlated with napab nirks norbc gltbd and glna r 0 6 p 0 05 figs 6 and s9 napab nirks and norbc are the main functional genes associated with denitrification tan et al 2021 implying that good denitrification performance was due to the sufficient adoption of a carbon source gltbd and glna are the main genes involved in organic nitrogen generation during ammonification and the high relative abundance of these two genes in the aw2 group suggested that the accumulation of organic nitrogen occurred with the decomposition of aws in addition fig 6 also shows that cod removal was negatively correlated with amocab r 0 6 p 0 05 the species contribution results suggested that proteobacteria and unclassified d bacteria were the main hosts for amocab and its deficiency in aw2 group caused the cod accumulation level to be much higher than that in the other groups fig 3 a the correlation of nitrate removal with functional genes was similar to that of cod removal and nosz appeared to be significantly correlated with functional genes nosz is an important gene for converting n2o to n2 during denitrification and proteobacteria bacteroides and chloroflexi are the main hosts fig s10 the contributions of these three microorganisms accounted for more than 88 in the sa aw1 and aw2 groups conversely the correlation tn removal and functional genes contrasted with that between tn removal and nitrate removal the above analysis further confirmed that cod removal and denitrification performance were correlated with nitrogen metabolic functional genes and their hosts their high relative abundances in the sa aw1 and aw2 groups guaranteed good denitrification performance under these three carbon source conditions 4 conclusion the leaching experiments showed that the doc release capacity followed the order of aw1 aw2 aw3 aw4 ranging from 6 21 to 31 92 mg g eem parafac analysis showed that doc released from aws mainly consisted of protein like substances fulvic acid like substances and humic like substances aw1 and aw2 achieved nox n removal performance comparable to that of sa during the long term denitrification experiments 94 2 but not for the other two aws when aws were used as external solid carbon sources denitrification performance relied on doc released from aws at the beginning while the enrichment of the functional cazy family including ghs and ces associated with cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition and functional genes gapdh gap 2 pk etc related to glycolysis were the inner forces that guaranteed the continuous supply of electron donors for denitrification the nitrogen removal mechanism should be different in liquid carbon source and aw based carbon source systems because in addition to functional genes associated with denitrification the relative abundances of nirbd and nrfah associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction were much higher in the aw1 and aw2 groups than in the sa group in addition glu gltbd and glna which participate in ammonia assimilation were the highest in the aw2 group resulting in a large amount of organic nitrogen accumulation and this finally ruled out it as an alternative external carbon source the abovementioned microbial mechanism was verified based on the correlation analysis of nutrient removal and functional genes combined with host bacterial analysis our study can provide valuable information for understanding the mechanism of using aws as alternative external carbon sources to promote the removal of nitrogen in wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

15402,interplays between microalgae and clay minerals enhance biologically mediated flocculation thereby affecting the sedimentation and transportation of suspended particulate matter spm in water and benthic environments this interaction forms larger flocs with a higher settling velocity and enhances spm sinking the aim of this study was to investigate the flocculation kinetics of microalgae and clay in suspension and to elucidate the mechanisms associated with such interactions standard jar test experiments were conducted using various mixtures of kaolinite and microalgal samples from batch cultures chlorella vulgaris to estimate biologically mediated flocculation kinetics the organic matter om composition secreted by the microalgae was characterized using a liquid chromatography organic carbon detection system and quantitative analysis of transparent exopolymer particles was conducted separately a two class flocculation kinetic model based on the interaction between flocculi and flocs was also adopted to quantitatively analyze the experimental data from flocculation results from the flocculation kinetic tests and om analyses in association with other data analyses i e floc size distribution and flocculation kinetic model showed that flocculation increased with om concentration during the growth phase 10 20 d however on day 23 during the early stationary phase flocculation kinetics started decreasing and substantially declined on day 30 even though the amount of om mainly biopolymers continued to increase our results indicate that an adequate quantity of biopolymers produced by the microalgal cells in the growth phase enhanced floc to floc attachment and hence flocculation kinetics in contrast an excessive quantity of biopolymers and humic substances in the stationary phase enhanced the formation of polymeric backbone structures and flocculation via scavenging particles but simultaneously increased steric stabilization with the production of a

is a complex physicochemical process involving the aggregation and breakage of suspended particulate matter spm in water environments aggregation induces floc formation from mineral and organic particles while breakage disaggregates large flocs into smaller flocs or primary particles lee et al 2012a maggi 2005 the flocculation rate depends on spm concentration turbulence and the presence of organic matter in the water column among other ambient conditions mietta et al 2009 winterwerp 1998 flocculation determines the structure density and settling velocity of flocs and thus the overall fate of the spm therefore flocculation also affects spm transport in many practical applications e g siltation of navigation channels pollutant and nutrient transport and geomorphological evolution maggi 2009 climate change population increase industrialization and agribusiness development are serious stressors of aquatic systems these stressors contribute to excess nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorous and clay minerals from various point and nonpoint sources discharging into aquatic environments which creates favorable conditions for eutrophication preisner et al 2021 the resulting eutrophication causes intense algal blooms worldwide and turbid waters diaz and rosenberg 2008 in addition to long term trends imposed by land use and climate change a modification in flocculation patterns may alter spm dynamics and budgets in pelagic and benthic systems thereby potentially influencing the carbon cycle engel et al 2004 it has become clear that microalgae may interact with clay to enhance flocculation neumann et al 2019 such biologically mediated flocculation is expected to affect hydrological biochemical and ecological fluxes in aquatic environments understanding the interactions between microalgae and clay minerals may eventually lead to innovative solutions for the management of freshwater estuaries and coastal systems clay minerals which have cohesive properties manning et al 2011 participate in flocculation and are a major component of flocs in aquatic environments spencer et al 2021 the most abundant clay minerals e g chlorite montmorillonite kaolinite and illite in aquatic environments are sourced from the crust of the earth surface sionneau et al 2008 these minerals are eroded by rainfall river flow melting ice or wind and are eventually discharged into aquatic environments fagel 2007 their cohesive properties result from attractive physicochemical forces i e van der waals and electrostatic forces they are tightly bound in small dense flocculi a word composed of flocs and nuclei through electrostatic attraction flocculi may further aggregate to form large fluffy flocs through the gluing action of extracellular polymeric substances epss and mucus produced by microalgae partheniades 2009 this stepwise growth from clay minerals to flocculi and then to flocs tends to accelerate under aggregation favorable conditions with a high clay concentration and moderate turbulence partheniades 2009 the interactive processes between flocculi and flocs are characterized by the bimodality of the particle floc size distribution lee et al 2012a and are mathematically formulated as a two class population flocculation kinetic model lee et al 2011 the presence of microalgae promotes aggregation of spm in aquatic environments because microalgae can secrete substantial amounts of dissolved sticky polysaccharides epss some of which are precursors to transparent exopolymer particles tep xiao and zheng 2016 the highest concentrations of eps are usually associated with microalgal blooms passow 2002 highly viscous and sticky epss can facilitate flocculation by combining many components including solid non sticky particles cells detritus and dissolved substances chin et al 1998 passow 2002 villacorte et al 2009 walch et al 2022 clay and microalgae are abundant fine particles prevalent in many water and benthic environments dallmann et al 2020 drummond et al 2014 therefore they are commonly found in floc structures and govern the fate and transportation of spm in aquatic environments clay and microalgae interact with each other and control flocculation and transportation mediating biological and physicochemical processes in aquatic environments avnimelech and coworkers demonstrated that if the clay content is sufficiently high microalgae will form flocs with clay particles and sink to the bottom enhancing the clarity of water avnimelech and menzel 1984 avnimelech et al 1982 the aggregation of microalgae and clay increases the settling velocity of the resulting flocs thereby removing spm detritus and microalgae from the water column to the bed layer avnimelech et al 1982 verspagen et al 2006 depicted the flocculation of clay and buoyant cyanobacteria and the sedimentation of biomineral flocs biologically mediated flocculation has been often reported to enhances sedimentation in microalgal and clay containing suspensions deng 2022 deng et al 2019 fettweis et al 2022 liu et al 2016 kiørboe et al 1990 1994 determined if a specific microalgae type or species was responsible for this phenomenon through in situ observations that diatoms could aggregate with clay minerals and form large biomineral flocs in the danish ise fjord similarly de lucas pardo et al 2015 investigated the flocculation potential between cohesive sediment and different species of cyanobacteria and found that aphanotece yielded larger biomineral flocs in microalgal and clay containing suspensions than aphanizomenon did however the detailed mechanisms of biogeochemical flocculation mediated by microalgae and clay minerals are highly complex and remain poorly understood in pelagic and benthic systems therefore more attention and efforts are necessary to investigate the mechanisms and kinetics of the interaction between microalgae and clay and the resulting flocculation clay minerals or composites e g montmorillonite kaolinite local red soil and chitosan clay composites can be utilized for the removal and harvesting of harmful microalgae via biologically mediated flocculation the interaction between microalgae and clay enhances the formation of large biomineral flocs with densities higher than that of water resulting in the removal of buoyant microalgae from water bodies kim et al 2016 nakayama et al 2004 sengco and anderson 2004 shemesh et al 2021 verspagen et al 2006 wei et al 2020 yin et al 2022 for instance wei et al 2020 applied montmorillonite modified cationic starch to enhance sedimentation of chlorella vulgaris which increased the settling velocity of the formed biomineral flocs by 2 34 fold clay modified cation starch has also been applied to enhance the removal of other microalgae species such as microcystis aeruginosa shi et al 2016 shemesh et al 2021 used iron coated clays i e red clays to promote the formation of biomineral flocs and increase the sedimentation and removal of cyanobacteria this produced large biomineral flocs with a mean size of 600 µm and a 73 higher sedimentation rate shemesh et al 2021 thus biologically mediated flocculation of microalgae and clay minerals is beneficial for controlling algal blooms or the removal and harvesting of microalgae in water bodies and mass production systems previous studies have demonstrated the occurrence and practical use of biologically mediated flocculation of microalgae and clays under specific conditions however the mechanism and kinetics of biologically mediated flocculation in continuum of the microbial population and biochemical dynamics remained unknown therefore this study aimed to investigate the mechanism and kinetics of the biochemical flocculation by maintaining a well controlled microalgae batch culture and performing flocculation kinetic tests with microalgae and clay containing suspensions in different phases of microalgal growth to the best of our knowledge little or no consideration has been given to the role of om more specifically eps and humic substances on flocculation kinetics in batch cultures during the growth phase of microalgae in this study we monitored the microalgal growth phase and organic matter composition of a microalgal batch culture we investigated their effects on flocculation kinetics and the mechanisms occurring in microalgae and clay containing suspensions in addition a flocculation kinetic model and bayesian calibration were applied to estimate the flocculation kinetics of microalgae and clay containing suspensions at various microalgae growth phases the findings of this study on biologically mediated flocculation may eventually help to predict the fate and transport of spm in coupled pelagic benthic systems enhance microalgae removal in water bodies and improve harvest in mass production systems in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgal culture c vulgaris is a well characterized species of microalgae that is often involved in algal blooms jacquet et al 2005 c vulgaris is also known to release sticky biopolymers i e eps babiak and krzemińska 2021 hence it was selected as a model species to investigate flocculation kinetics and mechanisms in microalgae and clay containing suspensions c vulgaris was provided by the nakdonggang national institute of biological resources nnibr sangju korea cultivation of microalgae was performed in a 5 l bioreactor with bold s basal medium sigma aldrich usa the temperature and light intensity of the bioreactor were maintained at room temperature 20 2 c and 3000 lux respectively the microalgae bioreactor was sealed with a glass fiber filter gf c 1 2 µm hyundai micro korea to prevent contamination and gently stirred to minimize the formation of microalgal aggregates and precipitates microalgal samples were regularly collected from the bioreactor to perform flocculation kinetic tests in each sample the microalgal biomass weight was measured as the retained dry weight dw chioccioli et al 2014 on a glass filter gf c 1 2 µm hyundai micro korea after drying the sample at temperature 105 c for 2 h us environmental protection agency 2001 the optical density at 600 nm od600 was measured by dr 3900 hach usa as an indicator of the microbial growth state 600 nm light source minimizes unexpected cell damage and growth stevenson et al 2016 2 2 flocculation kinetic test flocculation kinetic tests were performed by mixing a microalgae sample with a clay containing suspension in a standard 2 l jar tester phipps and bird usa fig 1 kaolinite purchased from sigma aldrich st louis usa was used as a model clay for the flocculation kinetic tests particle size was 0 1 4 µm right before the flocculation kinetic test 10 ml from the kaolinite stock solution 10 g l was added to 2 l of deionized water di to produce a final kaolinite concentration of 0 05 g l in the test jar the ionic strength and ph of the suspension were adjusted to 0 01 mol l nacl and ph 7 respectively after adding 10 ml of the microalgal sample to the suspension the microalgae and kaolinite containing suspension was homogenized with rapid mixing at 200 rpm g 250 s for 10 min and gently stirred at 80 rpm g 85 s afterwards until the change in floc size reached equilibrium the suspension was continuously delivered from the test jar to a lisst 200x particle size analyzer sequoia scientific inc bellevue usa through a 6 mm diameter tube using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 100 ml min mietta et al 2009 the lisst 200x instrument monitored the change in floc size distribution fsd during the test period and the fsd data collected from the instrument were used for further analysis of flocculation kinetics 2 3 decomposition of the subordinate peaks of a floc size distribution the fsd of a microalgae and clay containing suspensions is generally multimodal with superposition of subordinate lognormal fsds because of hierarchical floc formation with mineralogical and biological components lee et al 2012a the fsds in this study mostly displayed multimodal peaks and were subjected to further numerical analysis of the fsd peak decomposition multimodal fsds were assumed to be formed by the overlapping of three unimodal log normal psds of primary particles flocculi and flocs fig 2 lee et al 2012a van leussen 1994 these fsd data were input to the in house computer program which performed the curve fitting analysis and decomposition of the observed fsd into subordinate log normal fsds eq 1 hussein 2005 whitby 1967 1 d v d d i 1 3 v i 2 π

primary particles flocculi and flocs were estimated and the best quality psd was found at the minimum error between the simulated and measured fsds hussein 2005 whitby 1967 2 4 estimation of the settling velocity of flocs the settling velocity ws of flocs was estimated as a proxy for the sedimentation and removal rate of fsd containing various size classes of biomineral flocs based on the modified stokes equation with floc fractal dimensions winterwerp 1998 the mean settling velocity was calculated by dividing the sum of the mass weighted settling velocity of each size class by the total mass of the fsd lee et al 2012a 2 w s i m i m t 1 18 ρ s ρ w g μ d p 3 n f d i n f 1 1 0 15 r e i 0 687 in eq 2 mi is the mass of each size class of fsd obtained from the lisst instrument total

organic carbon detector lc ocd an lc ocd system doc labor dr huber karlsruhe germany was used to characterize the dissolved om dom composition in the microalgal samples with respect to the molecular size distribution this system involves chromatographic columns with organic carbon and ultraviolet uv detectors ocd and uvd a mobile phase including phosphate buffer of ph 6 85 was used and the flow rate was maintained at 1 1 ml min an aliquot 1 ml of the sample was injected into the instrument and filtered through a 0 45 μm in line polyethersulfone filter sartorius germany prior to chromatographic separation and detection for dissolved organic carbon doc and uv absorbance at 254 nm for molecular mass calibration suwannee river humic acid srha and fulvic acid srfa were obtained

method of passow and alldredge and nosaka nosaka et al 2017 passow and alldredge 1995 as an indicator of bio polymeric substances eps a sample from the microalgal bioreactor was filtered through a whatman 0 45 µm nucleopore filter sigma aldrich usa and the teps on the filter were stained with alcian blue sigma aldrich usa the filter was then rinsed with di water and stored in petri dishes at 20 c on the day of the chemical analysis the stored filter papers were transferred from petri dishes to brown bottles of concentrated 80 sulfuric acid and the bottles were then shaken on an orbital table shaker daihan korea the amount of alcian blue ab released from the teps on a filter paper was quantified using a dr 3900 hach spectrophotometer hach usa in terms of absorption at 787 nm the stained particles were related to an anion density weight equivalent to that of tep and were standardized using xanthan gum mg xg l xantham gum xg has been widely used as a proxy for tep because of its polysaccharidic structure and presence of reactive anionic groups for ab staining and better replicability passow and alldredge 1995 villacorte et al 2015 the standard curve consisted of a series of known amounts of xanthan gum sigma aldrich usa the detailed procedures for creating a standard curve can be found in earlier studies which are shown in the supplementary document 2 6 flocculation kinetic model and parameter estimation 2 6 1 flocculation kinetic model two class population balance equation a flocculation kinetic model and bayesian calibration were applied to evaluate the flocculation kinetics of microalgae and clay containing suspensions in each flocculation kinetic test because the fsds formed by biologically mediated flocculation in water and benthic environments have been mostly recognized to be bimodal with flocculi and flocs fractions fettweis and baeye 2015 we adopted a two class population balance equation tcpbe that consists of size fixed flocculi and size varying flocs lee et al 2011 the tcpbe incorporates three coupled differential equations describing the time rate of change in the concentration of flocculi dnp dt eq 3 the concentration of flocs dnf dt eq 4 and the total concentration of flocculi bound to flocs dnt dt nt nc nf eq 5 the number of flocculi bound in a floc nc was used as an index of floc size in the tcpbe the aggregation and breakage kernels for the collision frequency factor β and breakage kinetic function a were formulated using the shear and size dependent breakage kinetics functions eqs 6 and 7 burd and jackson 2002

function p and q and the mass fraction of microflocs generated by the breakage of macroflocs f were selected as parameters to be estimated by bayesian calibration each set of best fit parameters in the flocculation kinetic test was used as an index to diagnose the flocculation kinetics of the microalgae and clay containing suspensions 2 6 2 bayesian calibration for parameter estimation the notable stochastic calibration method is bayesian inference the purpose of which is to learn about unknowns such as calibration parameters from measured or observed data gep and tiao 1973 the bayesian framework can infer a posterior distribution of unknowns based on the known data eq 8 this procedure of bayesian calibration ensures that the nonlinear or linear relations are explained and the matching uncertainties are measured both of which cannot be easily recognized manually beckers et al 2020 therefore bayesian calibration was applied to estimate the best fit simulation and model parameters which were used to estimate the flocculation kinetics of the microalgae and clay containing suspensions in this study 8 p x y p x l x y the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream software package vrugt et al 2009 which is based on a bayesian inference was used to estimate the best fit model parameters for each flocculation kinetics test the outcome of bayesian calibration is the posterior probability distribution of the model parameters for the measurement data reflecting the uncertainty of the different parameters the posterior distribution is calculated from the prior distribution of the parameters table 1 and the likelihood function of the parameters considering the measured data floc diameter df and flocs volumetric fraction vf the dream software package estimated not only the best fit model parameters but also the posterior distribution of the model parameters vrugt et al 2009 explained the dream algorithm and mathematical formulation in detail vrugt et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 microalgal culture the dw and od600 of the microalgal suspension obtained from the bioreactor tended to increase during the incubation period showing three typical phases the initial lag exponential growth and stationary phases fig 3 during the lag phase 0 8 d increases in dw and od600 were insignificant as dw increased to 30 mg l and od600 increased to 0 094 afterwards dw and od600 increased substantially during the exponential growth phase 8 23 d up to 756 mg l and 1 7 respectively the increase in dw and od600 was mitigated during the stationary phase 23 30 d higher concentrations of microalgal cells denoted by higher dw and od600 during both the exponential growth and stationary phases are expected to increase the chance of collision and attachment between cells and other particles giorgi et al 2019 tang 2016 in addition microalgae have been reported to produce a larger amount of sticky biopolymers e g eps which enhance flocculation kinetics during the exponential growth and stationary phases nguyen et al 2005 villacorte 2014 the effect of om composition on flocculation kinetics will be discussed in later sections 3 2 organic matter composition in different microalgal growth phases the tep and doc concentrations of the microalgal suspension obtained from the microalgal batch culture were monitored throughout the during the entire incubation period fig 4 a the tep concentration continuously increased from 0 4 to 57 0 mg l as the equivalent xg concentration increased and the doc concentration increased from 16 3 to 49 4 mg l during the growth phase a doc production rate was estimated at 0 18 mg l h similar to the 0 24 mg l h of an earlier study nguyen et al 2005 as the number of cells in the microalgal batch culture increases extracellular organic carbon is generated and accumulates due to cell lysis and direct exudation ducklow 1993 nagata 2000 nguyen et al 2005 villacorte 2014 such release of extracellular organic carbon from healthy or stressed cells is a common physiological process of some phytoplankton species fogg 1977 sharp 1977 the change in the dom fractions measured with the lc ocd system indicated that the hs fraction decreased from 65 to 55 during the incubation period but the hs concentration increased from 10 6 to 27 1 mg l fig 4b the hs of the microalgal samples was characterized as aquagenic fulvic acid fa which is produced by aquagenic microorganisms based on the measurement of its molecularity and aromaticity huber et al 2011 lee et al 2017 in contrast biopolymers were almost absent in the initial lag phase but they increased gradually in the exponential growth and stationary phases up to 8 8 mg l concentration and 18 mass fraction out of the total doc concentration fig 4b because biopolymers are the precursors of sticky and aggregation prone tep a higher concentration and fraction of biopolymers is supposed to enhance the flocculation potential of the algae and clay containing suspension villacorte 2014 3 3 floc size distributions in the flocculation kinetic tests inspection of the fsds of the microalgae and clay containing suspensions obtained from the flocculation kinetic tests revealed that the fsds were generally superimposed with three distinct peaks of primary particles flocculi and flocs in the respective size ranges of 1 2 5 µm 3 8 µm and 10 100 µm fig 5 based on the two class flocculation theory 28 primary particles and flocculi form the building blocks of flocs so that they are integrated into a single group of flocculi for data analysis and flocculation kinetic models alldredge and silver 1988 lee et al 2012a van leussen 1994 in each flocculation kinetic test the size and volumetric fraction of flocs i e the position and area of the peak increased with time whereas the volumetric fraction of flocculi decreased while maintaining a narrow size range i e 1 8 µm higher concentrations of sticky biopolymers were expected to increase the size and volume of flocs i e flocculation potential through the inclusion of flocculi into the flocs the floc size and volumetric fraction reached equilibrium at the end of the flocculation kinetics test the equilibrium floc size and volumetric fraction measured at the end of each flocculation test gradually increased during the growth phase 10 13 and 20 d see the last panels of fig 5a c but changed little in the stationary phase 23 and 30 d see the last panels of fig 5d e notably the fsds at 30 d were different from those during the earlier days of incubation the flocculation kinetics at 30 d was quick to develop an apparent peak of flocs at a very early time there was a distinct peak of flocs of 90 µm and 18 volumetric fraction at 2000 s see the first panel of fig 5e the peak of flocs continued to increase its volumetric fraction from 18 to 63 while approaching the equilibrium state however a large fraction 37 of flocculi the peak at approximately 8 µm remained intact and stabilized in the microalgae and clay containing suspensions at the equilibrium see the last panel of fig 5e this observation indicates that not all flocculi were subject to flocculation but more remained present at 30 d than after shorter incubation periods 3 4 parameter estimation with the two class flocculation kinetic model fig 6 shows the time series of the floc size df and the flocs volumetric fraction vf obtained from the flocculation kinetic tests at 10 13 18 20 23 and 30 d of microalgal incubation the best fit simulation was also indicated by p 0 05 df at the equilibrium and the speed to reach equilibrium increased in the 10 20 d period and then started decreasing at 23 d fig 6a df at 30 d did not show a clear trend in floc size growth but flocs were scattered in the range of 50 to 90 µm fig 6a vf at equilibrium and the speed to reach equilibrium were similar for the tests at 10 13 18 and 20 d fig 6b vf reached equilibrium within 2000 s however vf at equilibrium and the speed to reach equilibrium decreased in the 23 30 d period in fact the flocculation kinetics of the microalgae and clay containing suspensions increased as the microalgal incubation time increased but started decreasing at 23 d this behavior of flocculation kinetics seems to correspond to the change in the om composition in different microalgal growth phases see section 3 2 the aggregation and breakage parameters were estimated using bayesian calibration fig 7 these parameters clearly indicate a transition in flocculation kinetics from 23 d the collision efficiency factors of flocculi and flocs αpp and αff respectively as the indices of flocculation potential increased during the 10 13 d period remained high in the 13 20 d period and decreased in the 23 30 d period the empirical breakage parameters p q remained constant during the 10 20 d period during the 23 30 d period p decreased but q increased this behavior of p and q indicates that the breakage of flocs become more vulnerable to floc size df and shear rate g based on the mathematical formulae presented in eqs 3 to 7 in other words flocs in the 23 30 d period were more fragile than those in the earlier period of the microalgal growth phase fig 7c illustrates the variation in the size and settling velocity of the biomineral flocs at the equilibrium of each flocculation kinetic test as a function of the incubation period the floc size increased sharply at the beginning and reached a plateau however the settling velocity reached a peak and afterward decreased gradually the floc size reached a plateau 63 65 µm at day 20 whereas the settling velocity started to decrease at the same time a further decrease of the settling velocity to 0 094 mm s was observed at day 30 the remaining volume fraction of flocculi rightmost images in figs 5c e was unsettled and reduced the overall settling velocity of the biomineral flocs in the batch this result shows that to maximize microalgae removal or harvest clay should be applied during the growth phase the results from the flocculation kinetic tests in the growth phase 10 20 d indicated a typical flocculation mechanism based on floc to floc collision and attachment fig 8 is an example of flocculation kinetics in the growth phase after 13 d of microalgal incubation time although the floc volumetric fraction vf reached its maximum within 1000 s fig 8b the floc size df increased gradually and reached equilibrium in 8000 s fig 8a the respective peaks of flocculi and flocs in the best fit simulation also matched those of the experimental data fig 8c it is important to note that df i e the second peak gradually increased from 10 µm at 500 s to 17 µm at 1000 s 33 µm at 2000 s and 45 µm at 4000 s in other words the peak of the flocs i e the right peak in fig 8c gradually moved from left to right continuous floc to floc aggregation might induce this gradual increase in df in which flocs might collide and attach to each other and generate larger flocs in series fig 10 the flocculation kinetics of the microalgae and clay containing suspensions were found to change drastically during the stationary phase i e 23 30 d in particular the flocculation kinetics at 30 d was unique without indication of a gradual floc size increase fig 9 large flocs 90 µm had already emerged at the beginning of the test with a substantial volumetric fraction 18 and afterwards they maintained their large size in the range of 60 to 90 µm fig 9a the volumetric fraction of flocs vf gradually increased and ended up at 63 at equilibrium indicating that a substantial fraction of flocculi 37 remained intact at equilibrium fig 9b see also fig 5e at 30 d of incubation sturdy and shear resistant microbial backbone structures appeared to exist initially and they scavenged and trapped smaller flocculi in their backbone structures as time increased simultaneously steric stabilization of flocculi caused by an excessive number of biopolymers and humic substances might also be a prominent reason for retaining a large amount 37 of intact flocculi at equilibrium 3 5 implications a conceptual model is proposed to interpret flocculation and stabilization occurring in a microalgae and clay containing suspension with respect to the microalgal growth phases fig 10 this conceptual model suggests two distinct mechanisms for biologically mediated flocculation and stabilization first floc to floc collision and attachment might be the governing flocculation mechanism in the microalgal growth phase i e flocculation kinetic tests at 10 20 d an adequate quantity of biopolymers produced by the microalgal cells in the growth phase might enhance floc to floc collision and attachment avnimelech et al 1982 droppo 2001 and therefore cause a gradual increase in floc size and volumetric fraction as the flocculation test proceeds in this case the intact fraction of flocculi at equilibrium is smaller than 20 second the particle scavenging mechanism of the microbial backbones might govern the flocculation kinetic tests in the stationary phase i e 30 d of microalgal incubation time an excessive quantity of biopolymers produced by the microalgal cells in the stationary phase might produce many microbial and polymeric backbones and cause fast flocculation kinetics initially however accumulation of an excessive quantity of biopolymers and hs in the stationary phase might enhance stabilization of flocculi leading to the retention of a large amount 37 of intact flocculi at equilibrium biopolymers can be attributed to the formation of large aggregation prone backbone structures within algal cells however simultaneously the accumulation of biopolymers and hs might enhance stabilization because of steric stabilization in that adsorbed polymeric layers on the particle surfaces provide additional repulsive force between particles healy and mer 1962 lee et al 2012b biologically mediated flocculation of microalgae and clay minerals depends on physicochemical characteristics of water such as ph and salinity mietta et al 2009 sengco and anderson 2004 abundant protons in low acidic ph conditions can accumulate on the surfaces of clay mineral platelets and neutralize the surface charge and electrostatic repulsion the ph also controls protolytic reactions at the hydroxyl functional sites on the edges of clay minerals thus changing the surface charge and electrostatic property of particles flocs and determining the flocculation potential of microalgae and clays tombácz and szekeres 2006 salinity also affects the flocculation potential as high salinity decreases the surface charge and repulsive force of particles flocs thereby enhancing flocculation mietta et al 2009 however the effects of ph and salinity on flocculation are highly complex under various aquatic environments eisma et al 1991 van leussen 1999 this study was initiated at ph and salinity of 7 and 0 01 m nacl respectively as a proxy for terrestrial water therefore follow up studies should apply a wide range of ph and salinity conditions replicating the terrestrial brackish and saline water environments to investigate the effect of ph and salinity on the biologically mediated flocculation of microalgae and clays 4 conclusions the results of this study elucidate the flocculation kinetics of microalgae and clay containing suspensions our results indicate that the microalgae growth phase om composition and flocculation potential are closely related the findings of this study are summarized as follows 1 the fsds of the microalgae and clay containing suspensions showed typical two class flocculation kinetics in which the size and volumetric fraction of flocs df and vf increased with time whereas the volumetric fraction of flocculi vp decreased while maintaining a narrow size range 2 flocculation kinetics were found to depend on the quantity of different om fractions e g biopolymers hs produced by microalgae an adequate quantity of biopolymer in the algal growth phase promoted floc to floc attachment and enhanced the flocculation kinetics of the microalgae and clay containing suspensions in contrast an excessive quantity of biopolymers and hs in the stationary phase promoted sweeping flocculation with large polymeric backbone structures but simultaneously enhanced steric stabilization by increasing the repulsive force of the biopolymer and hs attachment on the particle surfaces 3 the two class flocculation kinetic model with bayesian calibration could further demonstrate the distinct flocculation and stabilization mechanisms 1 floc to floc collision and attachment in the microalgae growth phase and 2 backbone induced sweeping

15402,interplays between microalgae and clay minerals enhance biologically mediated flocculation thereby affecting the sedimentation and transportation of suspended particulate matter spm in water and benthic environments this interaction forms larger flocs with a higher settling velocity and enhances spm sinking the aim of this study was to investigate the flocculation kinetics of microalgae and clay in suspension and to elucidate the mechanisms associated with such interactions standard jar test experiments were conducted using various mixtures of kaolinite and microalgal samples from batch cultures chlorella vulgaris to estimate biologically mediated flocculation kinetics the organic matter om composition secreted by the microalgae was characterized using a liquid chromatography organic carbon detection system and quantitative analysis of transparent exopolymer particles was conducted separately a two class flocculation kinetic model based on the interaction between flocculi and flocs was also adopted to quantitatively analyze the experimental data from flocculation results from the flocculation kinetic tests and om analyses in association with other data analyses i e floc size distribution and flocculation kinetic model showed that flocculation increased with om concentration during the growth phase 10 20 d however on day 23 during the early stationary phase flocculation kinetics started decreasing and substantially declined on day 30 even though the amount of om mainly biopolymers continued to increase our results indicate that an adequate quantity of biopolymers produced by the microalgal cells in the growth phase enhanced floc to floc attachment and hence flocculation kinetics in contrast an excessive quantity of biopolymers and humic substances in the stationary phase enhanced the formation of polymeric backbone structures and flocculation via scavenging particles but simultaneously increased steric stabilization with the production of a

is a complex physicochemical process involving the aggregation and breakage of suspended particulate matter spm in water environments aggregation induces floc formation from mineral and organic particles while breakage disaggregates large flocs into smaller flocs or primary particles lee et al 2012a maggi 2005 the flocculation rate depends on spm concentration turbulence and the presence of organic matter in the water column among other ambient conditions mietta et al 2009 winterwerp 1998 flocculation determines the structure density and settling velocity of flocs and thus the overall fate of the spm therefore flocculation also affects spm transport in many practical applications e g siltation of navigation channels pollutant and nutrient transport and geomorphological evolution maggi 2009 climate change population increase industrialization and agribusiness development are serious stressors of aquatic systems these stressors contribute to excess nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorous and clay minerals from various point and nonpoint sources discharging into aquatic environments which creates favorable conditions for eutrophication preisner et al 2021 the resulting eutrophication causes intense algal blooms worldwide and turbid waters diaz and rosenberg 2008 in addition to long term trends imposed by land use and climate change a modification in flocculation patterns may alter spm dynamics and budgets in pelagic and benthic systems thereby potentially influencing the carbon cycle engel et al 2004 it has become clear that microalgae may interact with clay to enhance flocculation neumann et al 2019 such biologically mediated flocculation is expected to affect hydrological biochemical and ecological fluxes in aquatic environments understanding the interactions between microalgae and clay minerals may eventually lead to innovative solutions for the management of freshwater estuaries and coastal systems clay minerals which have cohesive properties manning et al 2011 participate in flocculation and are a major component of flocs in aquatic environments spencer et al 2021 the most abundant clay minerals e g chlorite montmorillonite kaolinite and illite in aquatic environments are sourced from the crust of the earth surface sionneau et al 2008 these minerals are eroded by rainfall river flow melting ice or wind and are eventually discharged into aquatic environments fagel 2007 their cohesive properties result from attractive physicochemical forces i e van der waals and electrostatic forces they are tightly bound in small dense flocculi a word composed of flocs and nuclei through electrostatic attraction flocculi may further aggregate to form large fluffy flocs through the gluing action of extracellular polymeric substances epss and mucus produced by microalgae partheniades 2009 this stepwise growth from clay minerals to flocculi and then to flocs tends to accelerate under aggregation favorable conditions with a high clay concentration and moderate turbulence partheniades 2009 the interactive processes between flocculi and flocs are characterized by the bimodality of the particle floc size distribution lee et al 2012a and are mathematically formulated as a two class population flocculation kinetic model lee et al 2011 the presence of microalgae promotes aggregation of spm in aquatic environments because microalgae can secrete substantial amounts of dissolved sticky polysaccharides epss some of which are precursors to transparent exopolymer particles tep xiao and zheng 2016 the highest concentrations of eps are usually associated with microalgal blooms passow 2002 highly viscous and sticky epss can facilitate flocculation by combining many components including solid non sticky particles cells detritus and dissolved substances chin et al 1998 passow 2002 villacorte et al 2009 walch et al 2022 clay and microalgae are abundant fine particles prevalent in many water and benthic environments dallmann et al 2020 drummond et al 2014 therefore they are commonly found in floc structures and govern the fate and transportation of spm in aquatic environments clay and microalgae interact with each other and control flocculation and transportation mediating biological and physicochemical processes in aquatic environments avnimelech and coworkers demonstrated that if the clay content is sufficiently high microalgae will form flocs with clay particles and sink to the bottom enhancing the clarity of water avnimelech and menzel 1984 avnimelech et al 1982 the aggregation of microalgae and clay increases the settling velocity of the resulting flocs thereby removing spm detritus and microalgae from the water column to the bed layer avnimelech et al 1982 verspagen et al 2006 depicted the flocculation of clay and buoyant cyanobacteria and the sedimentation of biomineral flocs biologically mediated flocculation has been often reported to enhances sedimentation in microalgal and clay containing suspensions deng 2022 deng et al 2019 fettweis et al 2022 liu et al 2016 kiørboe et al 1990 1994 determined if a specific microalgae type or species was responsible for this phenomenon through in situ observations that diatoms could aggregate with clay minerals and form large biomineral flocs in the danish ise fjord similarly de lucas pardo et al 2015 investigated the flocculation potential between cohesive sediment and different species of cyanobacteria and found that aphanotece yielded larger biomineral flocs in microalgal and clay containing suspensions than aphanizomenon did however the detailed mechanisms of biogeochemical flocculation mediated by microalgae and clay minerals are highly complex and remain poorly understood in pelagic and benthic systems therefore more attention and efforts are necessary to investigate the mechanisms and kinetics of the interaction between microalgae and clay and the resulting flocculation clay minerals or composites e g montmorillonite kaolinite local red soil and chitosan clay composites can be utilized for the removal and harvesting of harmful microalgae via biologically mediated flocculation the interaction between microalgae and clay enhances the formation of large biomineral flocs with densities higher than that of water resulting in the removal of buoyant microalgae from water bodies kim et al 2016 nakayama et al 2004 sengco and anderson 2004 shemesh et al 2021 verspagen et al 2006 wei et al 2020 yin et al 2022 for instance wei et al 2020 applied montmorillonite modified cationic starch to enhance sedimentation of chlorella vulgaris which increased the settling velocity of the formed biomineral flocs by 2 34 fold clay modified cation starch has also been applied to enhance the removal of other microalgae species such as microcystis aeruginosa shi et al 2016 shemesh et al 2021 used iron coated clays i e red clays to promote the formation of biomineral flocs and increase the sedimentation and removal of cyanobacteria this produced large biomineral flocs with a mean size of 600 µm and a 73 higher sedimentation rate shemesh et al 2021 thus biologically mediated flocculation of microalgae and clay minerals is beneficial for controlling algal blooms or the removal and harvesting of microalgae in water bodies and mass production systems previous studies have demonstrated the occurrence and practical use of biologically mediated flocculation of microalgae and clays under specific conditions however the mechanism and kinetics of biologically mediated flocculation in continuum of the microbial population and biochemical dynamics remained unknown therefore this study aimed to investigate the mechanism and kinetics of the biochemical flocculation by maintaining a well controlled microalgae batch culture and performing flocculation kinetic tests with microalgae and clay containing suspensions in different phases of microalgal growth to the best of our knowledge little or no consideration has been given to the role of om more specifically eps and humic substances on flocculation kinetics in batch cultures during the growth phase of microalgae in this study we monitored the microalgal growth phase and organic matter composition of a microalgal batch culture we investigated their effects on flocculation kinetics and the mechanisms occurring in microalgae and clay containing suspensions in addition a flocculation kinetic model and bayesian calibration were applied to estimate the flocculation kinetics of microalgae and clay containing suspensions at various microalgae growth phases the findings of this study on biologically mediated flocculation may eventually help to predict the fate and transport of spm in coupled pelagic benthic systems enhance microalgae removal in water bodies and improve harvest in mass production systems in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgal culture c vulgaris is a well characterized species of microalgae that is often involved in algal blooms jacquet et al 2005 c vulgaris is also known to release sticky biopolymers i e eps babiak and krzemińska 2021 hence it was selected as a model species to investigate flocculation kinetics and mechanisms in microalgae and clay containing suspensions c vulgaris was provided by the nakdonggang national institute of biological resources nnibr sangju korea cultivation of microalgae was performed in a 5 l bioreactor with bold s basal medium sigma aldrich usa the temperature and light intensity of the bioreactor were maintained at room temperature 20 2 c and 3000 lux respectively the microalgae bioreactor was sealed with a glass fiber filter gf c 1 2 µm hyundai micro korea to prevent contamination and gently stirred to minimize the formation of microalgal aggregates and precipitates microalgal samples were regularly collected from the bioreactor to perform flocculation kinetic tests in each sample the microalgal biomass weight was measured

flocculation kinetic test flocculation kinetic tests were performed by mixing a microalgae sample with a clay containing suspension in a standard 2 l jar tester phipps and bird usa fig 1 kaolinite purchased from sigma aldrich st louis usa was used as a model clay for the flocculation kinetic tests particle size was 0 1 4 µm right before the flocculation kinetic test 10 ml from the kaolinite stock solution 10 g l was added to 2 l of deionized water di to produce a final kaolinite concentration of 0 05 g l in the test jar the ionic strength and ph of the suspension were adjusted to 0 01 mol l nacl and ph 7 respectively after adding 10 ml of the microalgal sample to the suspension the microalgae and kaolinite containing suspension was homogenized with rapid mixing at 200 rpm g 250 s for 10 min and gently stirred at 80 rpm g 85 s afterwards until the change in floc size reached equilibrium the suspension was continuously delivered from the test jar to a lisst 200x particle size analyzer sequoia scientific inc bellevue usa through a 6 mm diameter tube using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 100 ml min mietta et al 2009 the lisst 200x instrument monitored the change in floc size distribution fsd during the test period and the fsd data collected from the instrument were used for further analysis of flocculation kinetics 2 3 decomposition of the subordinate peaks of a floc size distribution the fsd of a microalgae and clay containing suspensions is generally multimodal with superposition of subordinate lognormal fsds because of hierarchical floc formation with mineralogical and biological components lee et al 2012a the fsds in this study mostly displayed multimodal peaks and were subjected to further numerical analysis of the fsd peak decomposition multimodal fsds were assumed to be formed by the overlapping of three unimodal log normal psds of primary particles flocculi and flocs fig 2 lee et al 2012a van leussen 1994 these fsd data were input to the in house computer program which performed the curve fitting analysis and decomposition of the observed fsd into subordinate log normal fsds eq 1 hussein 2005 whitby 1967 1 d v d d i 1 3 v i 2 π

primary particles flocculi and flocs were estimated and the best quality psd was found at the minimum error between the simulated and measured fsds hussein 2005 whitby 1967 2 4 estimation of the settling velocity of flocs the settling velocity ws of flocs was estimated as a proxy for the sedimentation and removal rate of fsd containing various size classes of biomineral flocs based on the modified stokes equation with floc fractal dimensions winterwerp 1998 the mean settling velocity was calculated by dividing the sum of the mass weighted settling velocity of each size class by the total mass of the fsd lee et al 2012a 2 w s i m i m t 1 18 ρ s ρ w g μ d p 3 n f d i n f 1 1 0 15 r e i 0 687 in eq 2 mi is the mass of each size class of fsd obtained from the lisst instrument total

method of passow and alldredge and nosaka nosaka et al 2017 passow and alldredge 1995 as an indicator of bio polymeric substances eps a sample from the microalgal bioreactor was filtered through a whatman 0 45 µm nucleopore filter sigma aldrich usa and the teps on the filter were stained with alcian blue sigma aldrich usa the filter was then rinsed with di water and stored in petri dishes at 20

particles were related to an anion density weight equivalent to that of tep and were standardized using xanthan gum mg xg l xantham gum xg has been widely used as a proxy for tep because of its polysaccharidic structure and presence of reactive anionic groups for ab staining and better replicability passow and alldredge 1995 villacorte et al 2015 the standard curve consisted of a series of known amounts of xanthan gum sigma aldrich usa the detailed procedures for creating a standard curve can be found in earlier studies which are shown in the supplementary document 2 6 flocculation kinetic model and parameter estimation 2 6 1 flocculation kinetic model two class population balance equation a flocculation kinetic model and bayesian calibration were applied to evaluate the flocculation kinetics of microalgae and clay containing suspensions in each flocculation kinetic test because the fsds formed by biologically mediated flocculation in water and benthic environments have been mostly recognized to be bimodal with flocculi and flocs fractions fettweis and baeye 2015 we adopted a two class population balance equation tcpbe that consists of size fixed flocculi and size varying flocs lee et al 2011 the tcpbe incorporates three coupled differential equations describing the time rate of change in the concentration of flocculi dnp dt eq 3 the concentration of flocs dnf dt eq 4 and the total concentration of flocculi bound to flocs dnt dt nt nc nf eq 5 the number of flocculi bound in a floc nc was used as an index of floc size in the tcpbe the aggregation and breakage kernels for the collision frequency factor β and breakage kinetic function a were formulated using the shear and size dependent breakage kinetics functions eqs 6 and 7 burd and jackson 2002

the flocculation kinetic test was used as an index to diagnose the flocculation kinetics of the microalgae and clay containing suspensions 2 6 2 bayesian calibration for parameter estimation the notable stochastic calibration method is bayesian inference the purpose of which is to learn about unknowns such as calibration parameters from measured or observed data gep and tiao 1973 the bayesian framework can infer a posterior distribution of unknowns based on the known data eq 8 this procedure of bayesian calibration ensures that the nonlinear or linear relations are explained and the matching uncertainties are measured both of which cannot be easily recognized manually beckers et al 2020 therefore bayesian calibration was applied to estimate the best fit simulation and model parameters which were used to estimate the flocculation kinetics of the microalgae and clay containing suspensions in this study 8 p x y p x l x y the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream software package vrugt et al 2009 which is based on a bayesian inference was used to estimate the best fit model parameters for each flocculation kinetics test the outcome of bayesian calibration is the posterior probability distribution of the model parameters for the measurement data reflecting the uncertainty of the different parameters the posterior distribution is calculated from the prior distribution of the parameters table 1 and the likelihood function of the parameters considering the measured data floc diameter df and flocs volumetric fraction vf the dream software package estimated not only the best fit model parameters but also the posterior distribution of the model parameters vrugt et al 2009 explained the dream algorithm and mathematical formulation in detail vrugt et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 microalgal culture the dw and od600 of the microalgal suspension obtained from the bioreactor tended to increase during the incubation period showing three typical phases the initial lag exponential growth and stationary phases fig 3 during the lag phase 0 8 d increases in dw and od600 were insignificant as dw increased to 30 mg l and od600 increased to 0 094 afterwards dw and od600 increased substantially during the exponential growth phase 8 23 d up to 756 mg l and 1 7 respectively the increase in dw and od600 was mitigated during the stationary phase 23 30 d higher concentrations of microalgal cells denoted by higher dw and od600 during both the exponential growth and stationary phases are expected to increase the chance of collision and attachment between cells and other particles giorgi et al 2019 tang 2016 in addition microalgae have been reported to produce a larger amount of sticky biopolymers e g eps which enhance flocculation kinetics during the exponential growth and stationary phases nguyen et al 2005 villacorte 2014 the effect of om composition on flocculation kinetics will be discussed in later sections 3 2 organic matter composition in different microalgal growth phases the tep and doc concentrations of the microalgal suspension obtained from the microalgal batch culture were monitored throughout the during the entire incubation period fig 4 a the tep concentration continuously increased from 0 4 to 57 0 mg l as the equivalent xg concentration increased and the doc concentration increased from 16 3 to 49 4 mg l during the growth phase a doc production rate was estimated at 0 18 mg l h similar to the 0 24 mg l h of an earlier study nguyen et al 2005 as the number of cells in the microalgal batch culture increases extracellular organic carbon is generated and accumulates due to cell lysis and direct exudation ducklow 1993 nagata 2000 nguyen et al 2005 villacorte 2014 such release of extracellular organic carbon from healthy or stressed cells is a common physiological process of some phytoplankton species fogg 1977 sharp 1977 the change in the dom fractions measured with the lc ocd system indicated that the hs fraction decreased from 65 to 55 during the incubation period but the hs concentration increased from 10 6 to 27 1 mg l fig 4b the hs of the microalgal samples was characterized as aquagenic fulvic acid fa which is produced by aquagenic microorganisms based on the measurement of its molecularity and aromaticity huber et al 2011 lee et al 2017 in contrast biopolymers were almost absent in the initial lag phase but they increased gradually in the exponential growth and stationary phases up to 8 8 mg l concentration and 18 mass fraction out of the total doc concentration fig 4b because biopolymers are the precursors of sticky and aggregation prone tep a higher concentration and fraction of biopolymers is supposed to enhance the flocculation potential of the algae and clay containing suspension villacorte 2014 3 3 floc size distributions in the flocculation kinetic tests inspection of the fsds of the microalgae and clay containing suspensions obtained from the flocculation kinetic tests revealed that the fsds were generally superimposed with three distinct peaks of primary particles flocculi and flocs in the respective size ranges of 1 2 5 µm 3 8 µm and 10 100 µm fig 5 based on the two class flocculation theory 28 primary particles and flocculi form the building blocks of flocs so that they are integrated into a single group of flocculi for data analysis and flocculation kinetic models alldredge and silver 1988 lee et al 2012a van leussen 1994 in each flocculation kinetic test the size and volumetric fraction of flocs i e the position and area of the peak increased with time whereas the volumetric fraction of flocculi decreased while maintaining a narrow size range i e 1 8 µm higher concentrations of sticky biopolymers were expected to increase the size and volume of flocs i e flocculation potential through the inclusion of flocculi into the flocs the floc size and volumetric fraction reached equilibrium at the end of the flocculation kinetics test the equilibrium floc size and volumetric fraction measured at the end of each flocculation test gradually increased during the growth phase 10 13 and 20 d see the last panels of fig 5a c but changed little in the stationary phase 23 and 30 d see the last panels of fig 5d e notably the fsds at 30 d were different from those during the earlier days of incubation the flocculation kinetics at 30 d was quick to develop an apparent peak of flocs at a very early time there was a distinct peak of flocs of 90 µm and 18 volumetric fraction at 2000 s see the first panel of fig 5e the peak of flocs continued to increase its volumetric fraction from 18 to 63 while approaching the equilibrium state however a large fraction 37 of flocculi the peak at approximately 8 µm remained intact and stabilized in the microalgae and clay containing suspensions at the equilibrium see the last panel of fig 5e this observation indicates that not all flocculi were subject to flocculation but more remained present at 30 d than after shorter incubation periods 3 4 parameter estimation with the two class flocculation kinetic model fig 6 shows the time series of the floc size df and the flocs volumetric fraction vf obtained from the flocculation kinetic tests at 10 13 18 20 23 and 30 d of microalgal incubation the best fit simulation was also indicated by p 0 05 df at the equilibrium and the speed to reach equilibrium increased in the 10 20 d period and then started decreasing at 23 d fig 6a df at 30 d did not show a clear trend in floc size growth but flocs were scattered in the range of 50 to 90 µm fig 6a vf at equilibrium and the speed to reach equilibrium were similar for the tests at 10 13 18 and 20 d fig 6b vf reached equilibrium within 2000 s however vf at equilibrium and the speed to reach equilibrium decreased in the 23 30 d period in fact the flocculation kinetics of the microalgae and clay containing suspensions increased as the microalgal incubation time increased but started decreasing at 23 d this behavior of flocculation kinetics seems to correspond to the change in the om composition in different microalgal growth phases see section 3 2 the aggregation and breakage parameters were estimated using bayesian calibration fig 7 these parameters clearly indicate a transition in flocculation kinetics from 23 d the collision efficiency factors of flocculi and flocs αpp and αff respectively as the indices of flocculation potential increased during the 10 13 d period remained high in the 13 20 d period and decreased in the 23 30 d period the empirical breakage parameters p q remained constant during the 10 20 d period during the 23 30 d period p decreased but q increased this behavior of p and q indicates that the breakage of flocs become more vulnerable to floc size df and shear rate g based on the mathematical formulae presented in eqs 3 to 7 in other words flocs in the 23 30 d period were more fragile than those in the earlier period of the microalgal growth phase fig 7c illustrates the variation in the size and settling velocity of the biomineral flocs at the equilibrium of each flocculation kinetic test as a function of the incubation period the floc size increased sharply at the beginning and reached a plateau however the settling velocity reached a peak and afterward decreased gradually the floc size reached a plateau 63 65 µm at day 20 whereas the settling velocity started to decrease at the same time a further decrease of the settling velocity to 0 094 mm s was observed at day 30 the remaining volume fraction of flocculi rightmost images in figs 5c e was unsettled and reduced the overall settling velocity of the biomineral flocs in the batch this result shows that to maximize microalgae removal or harvest clay should be applied during the growth phase the results from the flocculation kinetic tests in the growth phase 10 20 d indicated a typical flocculation mechanism based on floc to floc collision and attachment fig 8 is an example of flocculation kinetics in the growth phase after 13 d of microalgal incubation time although the floc volumetric fraction vf reached its maximum within 1000 s fig 8b the floc size df increased gradually and reached equilibrium in 8000 s fig 8a the respective peaks of flocculi and flocs in the best fit simulation also matched those of the experimental data fig 8c it is important to note that df i e the second peak gradually increased from 10 µm at 500 s to 17 µm at 1000 s 33 µm at 2000 s and 45 µm at 4000 s in other words the peak of the flocs i e the right peak in fig 8c gradually moved from left to right continuous floc to floc aggregation might induce this gradual increase in df in which flocs might collide and attach to each other and generate larger flocs in series fig 10 the flocculation kinetics of the microalgae and clay containing suspensions were found to change drastically during the stationary phase i e 23 30 d in particular the flocculation kinetics at 30 d was unique without indication of a gradual floc size increase fig 9 large flocs 90 µm had already emerged at the beginning of the test with a substantial volumetric fraction 18 and afterwards they maintained their large size in the range of 60 to 90 µm fig 9a the volumetric fraction of flocs vf gradually increased and ended up at 63 at equilibrium indicating that a substantial fraction of flocculi 37 remained intact at equilibrium fig 9b see also fig 5e at 30 d of incubation sturdy and shear resistant microbial backbone structures appeared to exist initially and they scavenged and trapped smaller flocculi in their backbone structures as time increased simultaneously steric stabilization of flocculi caused by an excessive number of biopolymers and humic substances might also be a prominent reason for retaining a large amount 37 of intact flocculi at equilibrium 3 5 implications a conceptual model is proposed to interpret flocculation and stabilization occurring in a microalgae and clay containing suspension with respect to the microalgal growth phases fig 10 this conceptual model suggests two distinct mechanisms for biologically mediated flocculation and stabilization first floc to floc collision and attachment might be the governing flocculation mechanism in the microalgal growth phase i e flocculation kinetic tests at 10 20 d an adequate quantity of biopolymers produced by the microalgal cells in the growth phase might enhance floc to floc collision and attachment avnimelech et al 1982 droppo 2001 and therefore cause a gradual increase in floc size and volumetric fraction as the flocculation test proceeds in this case the intact fraction of flocculi at equilibrium is smaller than 20 second the particle scavenging mechanism of the microbial backbones might govern the flocculation kinetic tests in the stationary phase i e 30 d of microalgal incubation time an excessive quantity of biopolymers produced by the microalgal cells in the stationary phase might produce many microbial and polymeric backbones and cause fast flocculation kinetics initially however accumulation of an excessive quantity of biopolymers and hs in the stationary phase might enhance stabilization of flocculi leading to the retention of a large amount 37 of intact flocculi at equilibrium biopolymers can be attributed to the formation of large aggregation prone backbone structures within algal cells however simultaneously the accumulation of biopolymers and hs might enhance stabilization because of steric stabilization in that adsorbed polymeric layers on the particle surfaces provide additional repulsive force between particles healy and mer 1962 lee et al 2012b biologically mediated flocculation of microalgae and clay minerals depends on physicochemical characteristics of water such as ph and salinity mietta et al 2009 sengco and anderson 2004 abundant protons in low acidic ph conditions can accumulate on the surfaces of clay mineral platelets and neutralize the surface charge and electrostatic repulsion the ph also controls protolytic reactions at the hydroxyl functional sites on the edges of clay minerals thus changing the surface charge and electrostatic property of particles flocs and determining the flocculation potential of microalgae and clays tombácz and szekeres 2006 salinity also affects the flocculation potential as high salinity decreases the surface charge and repulsive force of particles flocs thereby enhancing flocculation mietta et al 2009 however the effects of ph and salinity on flocculation are highly complex under various aquatic environments eisma et al 1991 van leussen 1999 this study was initiated at ph and salinity of 7 and 0 01 m nacl respectively as a proxy for terrestrial water therefore follow up studies should apply a wide range of ph and salinity conditions replicating the terrestrial brackish and saline water environments to investigate the effect of ph and salinity on the biologically mediated flocculation of microalgae and clays 4 conclusions the results of this study elucidate the flocculation kinetics of microalgae and clay containing suspensions our results indicate that the microalgae growth phase om composition and flocculation potential are closely related the findings of this study are summarized as follows 1 the fsds of the microalgae and clay containing suspensions showed typical two class flocculation kinetics in which the size and volumetric fraction of flocs df and vf increased with time whereas the volumetric fraction of flocculi vp decreased while maintaining a narrow size range 2 flocculation kinetics were found to depend on the quantity of different om fractions e g biopolymers hs produced by microalgae an adequate quantity of biopolymer in the algal growth phase promoted floc to floc attachment and enhanced the flocculation kinetics of the microalgae and clay containing suspensions in contrast an excessive quantity of biopolymers and hs in the stationary phase promoted sweeping flocculation with large polymeric backbone structures but simultaneously enhanced steric stabilization by increasing the repulsive force of the biopolymer and hs attachment on the particle surfaces 3 the two class flocculation kinetic model with bayesian calibration could further demonstrate the distinct flocculation and stabilization mechanisms 1 floc to floc collision and attachment in the microalgae growth phase and 2 backbone induced sweeping

15403,microplastics mps are emerging pollutants that have been widely detected in the atmosphere hydrosphere lithosphere and biosphere such wide spread of mps indicates that the effective control in different environmental sectors is in an urgent need and the first step in meeting this need is to identify the occurrence of mps in the relevant environment however research on mps in septic tanks has not been reported so far this study investigated the distribution characteristics of mps in septic tanks with a size detection limit of as low as 20 μm detected by laser direct infrared spectroscopy results showed that the number of mps in the septic tank was reached 2803 1489 4816 particles g dry sludge and the amount detected in the sediments was one order of magnitude higher than that in the scums a total of 36 types of mps were found in the septic tank and 26 types were found in both sediments and scums but the type in the scums was 21 higher than that in the sediments the size was mostly 20 100 μm accounting for 86 3 and 91 2 in the sediments and scums respectively four shapes of mps were detected in the septic tank namely fiber bead granule and fragment our study revealed that septic tanks are both sinks and sources of mps which are reflected in the fact that mps are not only large in number but also abundant in types thus significant attention should be paid

packaging technology constructions and other industries the omnipresence of plastic production in all aspects means that humans are inevitably exposed to plastics on daily life an increasing number of researchers has carried out related work since the mps which was defined as those less than 5 mm in size was reported by thompson et al 2004 at present the distribution of mps has shown a global trend and traces have been found in the marine environment eriksen et al 2014 two level glaciers barnes et al 2010 cózar et al 2017 inshore waters manbohi et al 2021 freshwater bodies eo et al 2019 agricultural soils ding et al 2020 atmosphere dris et al 2016 and human body amato lourenço et al 2021 leslie et al 2022 such wide spread of mps indicates that the effective control in different environmental sectors is in an urgent need and the first step in meeting this need is to identify the occurrence of mps in the relevant environment septic tanks are considered an effective and permanent solution for rural domestic sewage treatment septic tank sludge and sewage are encouraged to be used in agriculture as fertilizers and organic soil amendments tan et al 2021 the fundamental goal of a septic tank which is a primary transitional living treatment structure is to remove suspended organic matter in fecal sewage by sedimentation and anaerobic fermentation de lemos chernicharo 2007 the solids which include parasite eggs in fecal sewage settle down to form a sediment under the influence of gravity while lighter substances such as oil float up to form a paste like scum and the middle consists of a relatively clear liquid anaerobic fermentation allows for the preliminary treatment of manure by destroying parasite eggs and pathogens while also partially degrading organic matter such as protein to produce ammonia and other substances mengqi et al 2021 considering the inadequate of sewage treatment facilities septic tank systems are widely used in developing regions particularly in the areas of south asia and africa for the treatment of blackwater generated from toilet flushing chaggu et al 2002 in developed countries septic tank systems receive both blackwater and graywater and are utilized in recreational areas and remote communities eawag 2008 ho 2005 currently more than 350 million tons of plastics are produced annually around the world up to 94 of which is eventually released into the environment through various means alimi et al 2018 our daily life is strongly reliant on plastic products and the plastic wastes produced from human activities accumulate in septic tanks through drain pipes thus becoming a huge reservoir of plastic wastes plastic wastes in the septic tank may be negatively affected by the anaerobic fermentation environment such as microbial deterioration beal et al 2005 which can cause plastic to break down into mps at present no relevant research has focused on the characteristics of mps in the septic tank in response to the gap in this field this study applied laser direct infrared ldir spectroscopy for the identification and characterization of mps to analyze the occurrence characteristics of mps in the septic tank ldir a novel automated technology for detecting mps was launched in 2018 and it has been used in various investigations of the microplastic contamination of groundwater aquifers samandra et al 2022 urban rivers fan et al 2022 coastal areas scircle et al 2020 atmospheric dust fall liu et al 2022 fish gut tissue lopez rosales et al 2022 and agriculture soil li et al 2021 nonetheless no published studies are available about the use of ldir to identify mps in septic tanks in this study we employed ldir for the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the distribution characteristics of mps in the septic tank 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and pretreatment in this study a septic tank in a village in fangshan district beijing china was sampled the septic tank gathers domestic sewage including blackwater and graywater from the entire village during the production operation and this village has a population of roughly 1500 the septic tank is in the shape of a cube and is cleaned every three or four months sampling was conducted on december 30 2020 more than three months after the previous cleaning glass containers 2 5 l were used to collect scum or sediment samples five spots 10 cm from the four walls and the center were chosen for scum sampling after scraping off the 5 cm thick material from the scum s surface by using a stainless steel spoon similarly the scum layer was removed and five locations were chosen for sediment sampling that are 5 cm from the tank s bottom the collected samples were immediately sealed with aluminum foil and transported directly to the laboratory the samples collected at five spots in the scum layer were stirred and mixed and then 500 ml of the mixed samples was taken for freeze drying lgj 12d sihuan qihang technology co ltd beijing the same operation was performed for the sediment samples 2 2 microplastic extraction four steps were involved in the extraction of mps from septic tank samples as shown in fig s1 for the first step fenton s reagent was used as described by yan et al 2020 with some modification briefly lyophilized samples 2 g were obtained for the experiment fenton s reagent was used to digest most of the organic matters and the digestion process lasted for 3 h at 38 c after hno3 65 digestion the solution was diluted with ultrapure water and vacuum filtered through a metal filtered membrane 10 μm pore size 50 mm diameter the filtered membrane was transferred to a beaker containing absolute ethanol and the beaker was shaken at low frequency by using an ultrasonic machine then the filtered membrane was rinsed thrice with absolute ethanol and finally it was removed the removed filtered membrane was checked under a microscope to observe the suspected mps remaining on it to reduce errors nitrogen gas was used to blow dry the absolute ethanol in the beaker in the second step nai solution 7 5 mol l density of 1 8 g cm3 was used for the extraction process substances in the beaker were transferred into a 50 ml ptfe centrifuge tube by adding nai solution the tube was placed in the shaker zqpz 115 china at 150 rpm for 30 min at room temperature and then ran in the centrifuge velocity 18r pro china at 6000 rpm for 20 min after three repetitions of the above nai extraction process the centrifugal liquid was collected into a beaker diluted with ultrapure water vacuum filtered and blown dry with nitrogen for the next step in the third step about 30 ml of h2o2 30 was used to digest the residual organic matters in a water bath 60 c for 2 h the digestion solution was diluted thrice with ultrapure water vacuum filtered through a metal filtered membrane 10 μm and blown dry with nitrogen in the fourth step saturated nacl density 1 2 g cm3 and 7 5 mol l nai solution were used in sequence to remove the residual inorganic substances saturated nacl solution was added to the beaker and the extraction step was the same as the density separation step in the second step notably the solid after the centrifugation of nacl solution was directly used in the extraction experiment of nai solution to maximize the amount of microplastic extracted after all operations the extracted mps were soaked in absolute ethanol hplc grade 99 8 and then vacuum filtered two sizes 10 and 500 μm of metal filtered membrane were used and superimposed on top of each other during vacuum filtration mps retained by 500 μm filtered membrane were transferred to the sample box by using tweezers under a stereomicroscope xtz a soif china for later microplastic identification agilent bottle was used to keep all mps that the 10 μm filtered membrane had captured for subsequent microplastic identification 2 3 microplastic identification mps retained by 500 μm metal filtered membrane were identified by atr ftir v70 bruker germany and observed under stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su 8010 hitachi high technologies corp japan the stereomicroscope was equipped with a digital camera which was connected to a computer with the software iscapture installed and the software image j was used to calculate the area of the mps photographed the area was converted to an equivalent diameter size of mps which was calculated using the formula a pi diameter2 4 mps retained by 10 μm metal filtered membrane were analyzed by ldir 8700 ldir agilent usa ldir was used by dropping 200 μl of absolute ethanol containing mps with a glass dropper onto the standard microscope slides kevley agilent the slides were placed in a dust free environment until the ethanol evaporated and then placed in the sample base the base was placed on the sample stage and the stage automatically moved to the sample compartment when the software clarity was initiated clarity scanned the selected area quickly and accurately with a fixed wave number of 1800 cm 1 it automatically completed the identification positioning and image acquisition of mps in the target test area when adding the microplastic standard test method to the software clarity automatically selected the particle free area as the background spectrum collected the infrared spectra of all the identified particles and then obtained a full spectrum in the mid ir range 1800 cm 1 975 cm 1 finally qualitative search of the spectra was conducted the data exported from clarity and obtained from atr ftir was processed using python 3 8 software three functions were realized by editing the code in python namely quantity statistics size distribution and shape classification source codes are presented in the supplementary materials notably when data statistics were processed the statistics of the abundance type dimension and shape of microplastic in this study were obtained from all mps that were retained by the two sizes of metal filtered membrane 2 4 shape classification of mps ldir is endowed with rapid and automatic particle identification but its disadvantage is that it produces white and black image various parameters of the particle shape were displayed by ldir in which the shape cannot be determined directly given that spectroscopic measurement relies on light projection and absorption the detected mps were divided into four categories namely fiber bead granule and fragment the three shapes of fiber bead and fragment were determined according to scircle et al 2020 and based on this definition of granule was proposed in this study for the first time the terms shape and roundness are not synonymous wadell 1932 but roundness can be used as a parameter to characterize shape with an increase in roundness circularity also increases takashimizu and iiyoshi 2016 cheung and dawson 2002 pointed out that roundness greater than 0 6 is considered as high roundness therefore the shape of the granule was defined with circularity between 0 6 and 0 9 in general the definition of the four shapes is as follows mps with aspect ratio width height of three or more are classified as fibers mps with circularity 0 9 are beads mps with circularity between 0 6 and 0 9 are granules and the remaining mps are classified as fragments a single microplastic only satisfied one shape category according to statistical findings thus there was no intersection between the four categorized shapes indicating that the four categorized shapes were deemed accurate and satisfied the actual requirements hudson 1983 2 5 quality control the containers used in experiments were all glass vessels to avoid cross contamination and the glass vessels were rinsed with ultrapure water more than three times before use and then wrapped with aluminum foil immediately cotton and nitrile gloves and cotton clothes were used during the experiment freeze dried samples sediments or scums from the septic tank were performed in triplicate and three blank control groups to which no samples were added were established concurrently with the septic tank samples to evaluate the foreign mps all extraction processes were consistent with the septic tank samples some mps mainly composed of pet and pa were found in the blank control groups after experiment which were much lower than those detected in the septic tank samples the results of blank samples were subtracted in the statistics 3 results 3 1 abundance of mps in sediments and scums the abundance of mps in sediment and scum samples from the septic tank is shown in fig 1 mps were present in the sediments in abundance at 2302 1256 3918 particles g dry sludge and in the scums at 501 233 898 particles g dry sludge mps retained by 500 μm metal filtered membrane accounted for about 0 1 which was recognized by atr ftir some typical spectra of mps identified by atr ftir are shown in fig s2 the remaining mps 99 9 of the overall quantity were identified by ldir most of the microplastic spectra presented in fig s3 were acquired using ldir which provided information about the chemical composition of the mps at present some studies believe that the matching degree obtained through ldir should be greater than 65 cheng et al 2021 huang et al 2022 the results of this study showed that the minimum matching degree of mps was 58 and the abundance included the mps with the minimum matching degree the proportion of the mps in sediments with a matching degree of less than 65 was 21 and that in scums was 25 fig s5 3 2 chemical component of mps in sediments and scums as shown in fig 2 28 types of mps in sediments and 34 types of mps in scums were detected of which 26 types were found in both sediment and scum samples including general purpose plastics pe pp pvc and ps biodegradable plastics pla pva and pcl and commonly used synthetic fibers pet pa and ac eaa pvb and sbs were only detected in scum samples while pms and ahr were only detected in sediment samples two types of resin and four kinds of rubber were detected in scum samples and all of which were classified as resin and rubber fig s4 only one type of resin and one type of rubber were found in sediments mps that made up more than 5 of the total were pa pet pe av pu and ab in sediments in scums mps that accounted for more than 5 were pet pvc pu pa ac pp ptfe and pe pa was the most abundant 22 7 in sediments but ranked fourth in scums 8 3 and it was worth noting that natural pa had been removed in the statistics pet was present in sediments at a remarkably higher abundance 21 than it was in scum samples 17 1 although it had the largest fraction in scums the fraction of most mps in the sediments and scums was small the abundance mean range of different types of mps is shown in table s1 3 3 dimension and color of mps in sediments and scums fig 3 shows the color of the mps detected in the septic tank mps retained by the 500 μm metal filtered membrane seven different colors of mps were found in the sediment samples in which transparent accounted for 31 of the total black and yellow both accounted for 20 white and milky white both accounted for 11 and light blue and dark green both accounted for 3 the color of mps in the scum samples was plainly monotonous with only black yellow and transparent mps being detected compared with the color diversity in the sediment samples the majority of mps were yellow 41 followed by transparent 31 and black 28 in the scum samples the results showed that the smallest size of mp detected in the septic tank was 20 μm while no mps larger than 2000 μm were found the largest size found was 1963 μm in sediments and 1778 μm in scums based on ldir detection the average particle size d50 of mps in the septic tank is shown in fig 4 the size distribution of mps is 35 20 1963 μm in the sediments and 33 20 1778 μm in the scums furthermore four particle size ranges 20 100 100 500 500 1000 and 1000 5000 μm were structured to observe the particle size distribution of mps in the septic tank the proportions of the four ranges in sediments were 86 3 12 7 0 7 and 0 3 respectively and that in scums was 91 2 7 9 0 9 and 0 respectively fig 5 mps larger than 1000 μm in sediments were pe pp pet pu pvc pc and silicone whereas that in scums was only pe table s2 shows the size distribution of different mps in sediments and scums 3 4 morphology of mps in sediments and scums as shown in fig 6 four shapes of mps were detected in the septic tank namely fibers beads granules and fragments four shapes were observed in sediments and three shapes no bead were observed in scums fibers accounted for 5 granules accounted for 23 and fragments accounted for 72 in the sediments the proportion of bead was extremely small just only one bead was detected in one sediment sample three shapes were detected in the scums including fibers 10 granules 20 and fragments 70 fiber shaped mps ranged in size from 20 to 610 μm in scums to 20 691 μm in sediments granule shaped mps ranged in size from 20 to 163 μm in scums to 20 1730 μm in sediments the size range of fragment shaped mps was wide with values of 20 1778 μm in scums and 20 1963 μm in sediments detailed information on the size distribution of the four shapes in sediments and scums is shown in table s3 in the sediments and scums morphology of mps with the same shape and type were characterized by sem as shown in fig 7 the surface of the pet in the same shape of fiber was firm but the surface in the sediment had breaks the surface of the pvc in the sediments was firm but partially shattered and the surface in the scums was uneven with numerous small particles stuck into it the surface of the pp in the same shape of fragment was smooth and firm but the edge of the pp in the scums was torn 4 discussions 4 1 abundance of mps in the septic tank this study investigated the occurrence of mps in the septic tank the results showed that the abundance of mps in the sediments was an order of magnitude higher than that in the scums the analyses of particle density size and morphology indicated a certain influence on the abundance distribution of mps in the sediments and scums the difference in the abundance of mps between sediments and scums might be caused by these facts first nearly half of the mps were pa and pet which greatly contributes to the number of mps in the sediments the densities of pa and pet are both greater than 1 g cm3 sun et al 2021 and the larger sized particles could easily settle down to the bottom of the septic tank smaller sized particles are likely to be suspended in the scum layer because of their larger surface to volume ratio zhao et al 2015 second various types of mps were found in the sediments with a size greater than 1000 μm pe pp pet pu pvc pc and silicone and gravity sedimentation accounted for the ease of sinking of denser particles such as pet and pu for slightly buoyant particles such as pe and pp biofouling was assumed to be the cause of the increase in particle density and sinking chubarenko et al 2016 fazey and ryan 2016 in reality various interactions occur between low density mps and living or non living creatures including phagocytosis attachment filming and agglomeration which exacerbate the vertical movement of low density mps in water bodies zhao et al 2018 only five particles with a size larger than 500 μm were observed in the scums possibly because the larger particles of mps were co suspended by adhering to organic matter such as feces similar to how plastic particles interact with plant debris in rivers möhlenkamp et al 2018 a comparison of our results with compost and agricultural soil revealed that the septic tank may contain more mps than compost or agricultural soil which was necessary to completely comprehend microplastic pollution in the ecosystem the concentration of mps in rural compost was studied by gui et al 2021 and the samples had 2 4 0 4 items g dw with a minimum detection size of 50 μm however our results showed that the concentration of mps larger than 50 μm in the septic tank was three to four orders of magnitude greater than that in the compost moreover compared with a recent report schwinghammer et al 2021 our results showed that the amount of mps in the septic tank was one to two orders of magnitude higher than that in compost when the minimum size detected was 1000 μm accordingly the mps accumulated in the septic tank were over one order of magnitude higher than that observed in the compost the concentration of mps in agricultural soils did not exceed 100 particles g dw corradini et al 2019 ding et al 2020 nizzetto et al 2016 van den berg et al 2020 and the mps in the septic tank were more than two orders of magnitude higher than those in the agricultural soil table 1 although the differences in the abundance of mps could also be related to different sampling regions and various detect methods considering the high concentrations of mps the septic tank can be regarded as a vital source of microplastic release into the environment and strategies for minimizing the presence of mps in the sediments and scums are needed 4 2 types of mps in the septic tank the types of mps in the scums were more abundant than those in the sediments according to our study of the chemical composition of mps in the septic tank the features of 26 different types of mps found in both sediments and scums were analyzed in conjunction with the shape and color of the mps 1 the proportion of low density mps steadily decreased from scums to sediments which may have resulted from gravity sedimentation consequently mps with higher density gathered in the sediments 2 the proportion of fiber shaped mps in the scums was substantially greater than that in the sediments while the proportion of other three shapes were higher in the sediments which may be related to the particle shape factor the shorter the shape the smaller the resistance of the spheroidal particles to the water and the easier the settling is the longer the shape the greater the resistance of the flaky particles to the water and the easier the floating is yan et al 2022 3 the colors of mps in the sediments were more diverse which may be related to the abundance of mps in the sediment the greater the abundance the more likely the color is richer the types of mps found only in the scums were much higher than those detected only in the sediments phenol formaldehyde and phenolic epoxy resin have been used to prepare surface coatings and are easily broken into smaller particles ganeshram and achudhan 2013 a large number of av used in coatings has been detected in human sputum by huang et al 2022 fluororubbers have been widely used in household appliances and automobiles as a sealing material due to their excellent properties ghosh et al 2001 resin and rubber are the main contributors to the difference in the types of sediments and scums this work was the first to systematically analyze mps in the septic tank mps in the septic tank were elucidated by analyzing mps in sediments and scums resulting in the detection of 36 types of mps mps exist in different forms and they are all counted as one type for example pe comes in the forms of chlorinated polyethylene linear pe pe 80 and uhmwpe whereas pc and pmma come in the forms of pc asa and pmma asa at present more than 30 types of mps have been detected in influent and effluent of waste water treatment plants wwtps sun et al 2019 and these types are a synthesis of many reports in different wwtps for example li et al 2018 found polyolefin acrylic fibers alkyd resin ps and pa in wwtps in china hdpe pvc pe pet and pp were detected in ireland mahon et al 2017 and pe pp pa and ps were detected in germany mintenig et al 2017 the primary mps found in other environmental matrices such as farmland soil and compost are shown to be present in the septic tank mps found in agricultural soil include pa pe pp ps pvc and pet chen et al 2020 pe pp pet pvc pa and pu were detected in the compost weithmann et al 2018 all common types of mps were detected in the septic tank including thermoplastics and thermosets and the majority of these types were linked to common plastic products lares et al 2018 mintenig et al 2017 indicating that septic tanks may act as a sink for mps 4 3 implications of mps in the septic tank there were obvious size distribution characteristics of mps in the septic tank from scums to sediments the particle size gradually increased septic tank is a complicated environment where floating microplastics may serve as habitats for microbes to reproduce quickly or where micromaterials such as humus may accumulate and add weight to microplastics thus increasing the particle density and decreasing buoyancy lin et al 2018 the size distribution of mps in the septic tank showed that most mps in the septic tank were small which was consistent with the proportion of size in the previous study in which 84 of mps are smaller than 100 μm scircle et al 2020 simon et al 2018 showed that mps smaller than 25 μm were abundant in sewage and the size smaller than 40 μm in the atlantic ocean has a large proportion of 64 enders et al 2015 studies have revealed that the particles are fractured resulting in decreased particle size after prolonged weathering ultraviolet irradiation physical wear and the action of microorganisms in the environment as a result the number of tiny mps is steadily growing until it reaches the nanoscale and nanoscale plastic particles are more dangerous and directly poisonous horton et al 2017 mps are difficult to degrade as emerging pollutants and will cause different hazards due to the different components and particle sizes the addition of hdpe decreases soil ph while the addition of pla do not change significantly boots et al 2019 pet 0 4 decreases soil fertility de souza machado et al 2019 a remarkably increased soil microbial activity is achieved using 28 pp kim and an 2019 nanoscale ps has broad inhibitory effects on soil microbial communities and enzymes awet et al 2018 ps with a particle size of 1 μm is more toxic than 5 μm lei et al 2018 as the size decreases the effects on the biota may become more obvious and switch from physical to chemical effects yang et al 2017 nanoscale ps can be directly absorbed by plants thus reducing the stem to root biomass ratio of wheat seedlings lian et al 2020 ps 50 nm can be internalized by crops thereby inducing oxidative stress in the body giorgetti et al 2020 mps in the septic tank that enter the soil environment via composting can affect soil physicochemical properties reduce fertility and even change the microbial community these changes can affect soil quality and nutrient cycling awet et al 2018 de souza machado et al 2018 organic fertilizer from composting serves as a vehicle for the entry of mps into the environment weithmann et al 2018 the concentrations of mps in the corresponding soils and the content of mps in the corresponding earthworms are remarkably different after the application of various levels of sludge composted organic fertilizers bläsing and amelung 2018 zhang et al 2020 the direct application of septic tank sludge via compost to cultivated soil is a typical mode of operation for organic fertilizers tran et al 2020 hence the organic fertilizer can directly introduce the mps of the septic tank into the soil the data from this study can be used to roughly estimate that this septic tank releases 140 840 billion microplastic particles average particle size 35 μm into the soil annually in the form of composting therefore the relationships between mps in the septic tank and in the agricultural soil need to be further investigated in future 5 conclusions mps seem to be ubiquitous and they are receiving increasing concern from the scientific community our study focuses on mps in a widely used septic tank mps in the septic tank have obvious vertical distribution characteristics the number of mps in the sediments is substantially higher than that in the scums while more diverse types are present in the scums overall septic tanks are a huge source and sink which bring together various mps generated during human production activities and may serve as a potential source of mps in terrestrial systems this work covers a knowledge gap about the presence of mps in the septic tank and offers basic data for further research on mps in the environment future research may focus on the presence of mps in various types of septic tanks and the changes of mps during the application of septic tank sludge to agricultural soil by composting or

15403,microplastics mps are emerging pollutants that have been widely detected in the atmosphere hydrosphere lithosphere and biosphere such wide spread of mps indicates that the effective control in different environmental sectors is in an urgent need and the first step in meeting this need is to identify the occurrence of mps in the relevant environment however research on mps in septic tanks has not been reported so far this study investigated the distribution characteristics of mps in septic tanks with a size detection limit of as low as 20 μm detected by laser direct infrared spectroscopy results showed that the number of mps in the septic tank was reached 2803 1489 4816 particles g dry sludge and the amount detected in the sediments was one order of magnitude higher than that in the scums a total of 36 types of mps were found in the septic tank and 26 types were found in both sediments and scums but the type in the scums was 21 higher than that in the sediments the size was mostly 20 100 μm accounting for 86 3 and 91 2 in the sediments and scums respectively four shapes of mps were detected in the septic tank namely fiber bead granule and fragment our study revealed that septic tanks are both sinks and sources of mps which are reflected in the fact that mps are not only large in number but also abundant in types thus significant attention should be paid

packaging technology constructions and other industries the omnipresence of plastic production in all aspects means that humans are inevitably exposed to plastics on daily life an increasing number of researchers has carried out related work since the mps which was defined as those less than 5 mm in size was reported by thompson et al 2004 at present the distribution of mps has shown a global trend and traces have been found in the marine environment eriksen et al 2014 two level glaciers barnes et al 2010 cózar et al 2017 inshore waters manbohi et al 2021 freshwater bodies eo et al 2019 agricultural soils ding et al 2020 atmosphere dris et al 2016 and human body amato lourenço et al 2021 leslie et al 2022 such wide spread of mps indicates that the effective control in different environmental sectors is in an urgent need and the first step in meeting this need is to identify the occurrence of mps in the relevant environment septic tanks are considered an effective and permanent solution for rural domestic sewage treatment septic tank sludge and sewage are encouraged to be used in agriculture as fertilizers and organic soil amendments tan et al 2021 the fundamental goal of a septic tank which is a primary transitional living treatment structure is to remove suspended organic matter in fecal sewage by sedimentation and anaerobic fermentation de lemos chernicharo 2007 the solids which include parasite eggs in fecal sewage settle down to form a sediment under the influence of gravity while lighter substances such as oil float up to form a paste like scum and the middle consists of a relatively clear liquid anaerobic fermentation allows for the preliminary treatment of manure by destroying parasite eggs and pathogens while also partially degrading organic matter such as protein to produce ammonia and other substances mengqi et al 2021 considering the inadequate of sewage treatment facilities septic tank systems are widely used in developing regions particularly in the areas of south asia and africa for the treatment of blackwater generated from toilet flushing chaggu et al 2002 in developed countries septic tank systems receive both blackwater and graywater and are utilized in recreational areas and remote communities eawag 2008 ho 2005 currently more than 350 million tons of plastics are produced annually around the world up to 94 of which is eventually released into the environment through various means alimi et al 2018 our daily life is strongly reliant on plastic products and the plastic wastes produced from human activities accumulate in septic tanks through drain pipes thus becoming a huge reservoir of plastic wastes plastic wastes in the septic tank may be negatively affected by the anaerobic fermentation environment such as microbial deterioration beal et al 2005 which can cause plastic to break down into mps at present no relevant research has focused on the characteristics of mps in the septic tank in response to the gap in this field this study applied laser direct infrared ldir spectroscopy for the identification and characterization of mps to analyze the occurrence characteristics of mps in the septic tank ldir a novel automated technology for detecting mps was launched in 2018 and it has been used in various investigations of the microplastic contamination of groundwater aquifers samandra et al 2022 urban rivers fan et al 2022 coastal areas scircle et al 2020 atmospheric dust fall liu et al 2022 fish gut tissue lopez rosales et al 2022 and agriculture soil li et al 2021 nonetheless no published studies are available about the use of ldir to identify mps in septic tanks in this study we employed ldir for the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the distribution characteristics of mps in the septic tank 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and pretreatment in this study a septic tank in a village in fangshan district beijing china was sampled the septic tank gathers domestic sewage including blackwater and graywater from the entire village during the production operation and this village has a population of roughly 1500 the septic tank is in the shape of a cube and is cleaned every three or four months sampling was conducted on december 30 2020 more than three months after the previous cleaning glass containers 2 5 l were used to collect scum or sediment samples five spots 10 cm from the four walls and the center were chosen for scum sampling after scraping off the 5 cm thick material from the scum s surface by using a stainless steel spoon similarly the scum layer was removed and five locations were chosen for sediment sampling that are 5 cm from the tank s bottom the collected samples were immediately sealed with aluminum foil and transported directly to the laboratory the samples collected at five spots in the scum layer were stirred and mixed and then 500 ml of the mixed samples was taken for freeze drying lgj 12d sihuan qihang technology co ltd beijing the same operation was performed for the sediment samples 2 2 microplastic extraction four steps were involved in the extraction of mps from septic tank samples as shown in fig s1 for the first step fenton s reagent was used as described by yan et al 2020 with some modification briefly lyophilized samples 2 g were obtained for the experiment fenton s reagent was used to digest most of the organic matters and the digestion process lasted for 3 h at 38 c after hno3 65 digestion the solution was diluted with ultrapure water and vacuum filtered through a metal filtered membrane 10 μm pore size 50 mm diameter the filtered membrane was transferred to a beaker containing absolute ethanol and the beaker was shaken at low frequency by using an ultrasonic machine then the filtered membrane was rinsed thrice with absolute ethanol and finally it was removed the removed filtered membrane was checked under a microscope to observe the suspected mps remaining on it to reduce errors nitrogen gas was used to blow dry the absolute ethanol in the beaker in the second step nai solution 7 5 mol l density of 1 8 g cm3 was used for the extraction process substances in the beaker were transferred into a 50 ml ptfe centrifuge tube by adding nai solution the tube was placed in the shaker zqpz 115 china at 150 rpm for 30 min at room temperature and then ran in the centrifuge velocity 18r pro china at 6000 rpm for 20 min after three repetitions of the above nai extraction process the centrifugal liquid was collected into a beaker diluted with ultrapure water vacuum filtered and blown dry with nitrogen for the next step in the third step about 30 ml of h2o2 30 was used to digest the residual organic matters in a water bath 60 c for 2 h the digestion solution was diluted thrice with ultrapure water vacuum filtered through a metal filtered membrane 10 μm and blown dry with nitrogen in the fourth step saturated nacl density 1 2 g cm3 and 7 5 mol l nai solution were used in sequence to remove the residual inorganic substances saturated nacl solution was added to the beaker and the extraction step was the same as the density separation step in the second step notably the solid after the centrifugation of nacl solution was directly used in the extraction experiment of nai solution to maximize the amount of microplastic extracted after all operations the extracted mps were soaked in absolute ethanol hplc grade 99 8 and then vacuum filtered two sizes 10 and 500 μm of metal filtered membrane were used and superimposed on top of each other during vacuum filtration mps retained by 500 μm filtered membrane were transferred to the sample box by using tweezers under a stereomicroscope xtz a soif china for later microplastic identification agilent bottle was used to keep all mps that the 10 μm filtered membrane had captured for subsequent microplastic identification 2 3 microplastic identification mps retained by 500 μm metal filtered membrane were identified by atr ftir v70 bruker germany and observed under stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su 8010 hitachi high technologies corp japan the stereomicroscope was equipped with a digital camera which was connected to a computer with the software iscapture installed and the software image j was used to calculate the area of the mps photographed the area was converted to an equivalent diameter size of mps which was calculated using the formula a pi diameter2 4 mps retained by 10 μm metal filtered membrane were analyzed by ldir 8700 ldir agilent usa ldir was used by dropping 200 μl of absolute ethanol containing mps with a glass dropper onto the standard microscope slides kevley agilent the slides were placed in a dust free environment until the ethanol evaporated and then placed in the sample base the base was placed on the sample stage and the stage automatically moved to the sample compartment when the software clarity was initiated clarity scanned the selected area quickly and accurately with a fixed wave number of 1800 cm 1 it automatically completed the identification positioning and image acquisition of mps in the target test area when adding the microplastic standard test method to the software clarity automatically selected the particle free area as the background spectrum collected the infrared spectra of all the identified particles and then obtained a full spectrum in the mid ir range 1800 cm 1 975 cm 1 finally qualitative search of the spectra was conducted the data exported from clarity and obtained from atr ftir was processed using python 3 8 software three functions were realized by editing the code in python namely quantity statistics size distribution and shape classification source codes are presented in the supplementary materials notably when data statistics were processed the statistics of the abundance type dimension and shape of microplastic in this study were obtained from all mps that were retained by the two sizes of metal filtered membrane 2 4 shape classification of mps ldir is endowed with rapid and automatic particle identification but its disadvantage is that it produces white and black image various parameters of the particle shape were displayed by ldir in which the shape cannot be determined directly given that spectroscopic measurement relies on light projection and absorption the detected mps were divided into four categories namely fiber bead granule and fragment the three shapes of fiber bead and fragment were determined according to scircle et al 2020 and based on this definition of granule was proposed in this study for the first time the terms shape and roundness are not synonymous wadell 1932 but roundness can be used as a parameter to characterize shape with an increase in roundness circularity also increases takashimizu and iiyoshi 2016 cheung and dawson 2002 pointed out that roundness greater than 0 6 is considered as high roundness therefore the shape of the granule was defined with circularity between 0 6 and 0 9 in general the definition of the four shapes is as follows mps with aspect ratio width height of three or more are classified as fibers mps with circularity 0 9 are beads mps with circularity between 0 6 and 0 9 are granules and the remaining mps are classified as fragments a single microplastic only satisfied one shape category according to statistical findings thus there was no intersection between the four categorized shapes indicating that the four categorized shapes were deemed accurate and satisfied the actual requirements hudson 1983 2 5 quality control the containers used in experiments were all glass vessels to avoid cross contamination and the glass vessels were rinsed with ultrapure water more than three times before use and then wrapped with aluminum foil immediately cotton and nitrile gloves and cotton clothes were used during the experiment freeze dried samples sediments or scums from the septic tank were performed in triplicate and three blank control groups to which no samples were added were established concurrently with the septic tank samples to evaluate the foreign mps all extraction processes were consistent with the septic tank samples some mps mainly composed of pet and pa were found in the blank control groups after experiment which were much lower than those detected in the septic tank samples the results of blank samples were subtracted in the statistics 3 results 3 1 abundance of mps in sediments and scums the abundance of mps in sediment and scum samples from the septic tank is shown in fig 1 mps were present in the sediments in abundance at 2302 1256 3918 particles g dry sludge and in the scums at 501 233 898 particles g dry sludge mps retained by 500 μm metal filtered membrane accounted for about 0 1 which was recognized by atr ftir some typical spectra of mps identified by atr ftir are shown in fig s2 the remaining mps 99 9 of the overall quantity were identified by ldir most of the microplastic spectra presented in fig s3 were acquired using ldir which provided information about the chemical composition of the mps at present some studies believe that the matching degree obtained through ldir should be greater than 65 cheng et al 2021 huang et al 2022 the results of this study showed that the minimum matching degree of mps was 58 and the abundance included the mps with the minimum matching degree the proportion of the mps in sediments with a matching degree of less than 65 was 21 and that in scums was 25 fig s5 3 2 chemical component of mps in sediments and scums as shown in fig 2 28 types of mps in sediments and 34 types of mps in scums were detected of which 26 types were found in both sediment and scum samples including general purpose plastics pe pp pvc and ps biodegradable plastics pla pva and pcl and commonly used synthetic fibers pet pa and ac eaa pvb and sbs were only detected in scum samples while pms and ahr were only detected in sediment samples two types of resin and four kinds of rubber were detected in scum samples and all of which were classified as resin and rubber fig s4 only one type of resin and one type of rubber were found in sediments mps that made up more than 5 of the total were pa pet pe av pu and ab in sediments in scums mps that accounted for more than 5 were pet pvc pu pa ac pp ptfe and pe pa was the most abundant 22 7 in sediments but ranked fourth in scums 8 3 and it was worth noting that natural pa had been removed in the statistics pet was present in sediments at a remarkably higher abundance 21 than it was in scum samples 17 1 although it had the largest fraction in scums the fraction of most mps in the sediments and scums was small the abundance mean range of different types of mps is shown in table s1 3 3 dimension and color of mps in sediments and scums fig 3 shows the color of the mps detected in the septic tank mps retained by the 500 μm metal filtered membrane seven different colors of mps were found in the sediment samples in which transparent accounted for 31 of the total black and yellow both accounted for 20 white and milky white both accounted for 11 and light blue and dark green both accounted for 3 the color of mps in the scum samples was plainly monotonous with only black yellow and transparent mps being detected compared with the color diversity in the sediment samples the majority of mps were yellow 41 followed by transparent 31 and black 28 in the scum samples the results showed that the smallest size of mp detected in the septic tank was 20 μm while no mps larger than 2000 μm were found the largest size found was 1963 μm in sediments and 1778 μm in scums based on ldir detection the average particle size d50 of mps in the septic tank is shown in fig 4 the size distribution of mps is 35 20 1963 μm in the sediments and 33 20 1778 μm in the scums furthermore four particle size ranges 20 100 100 500 500 1000 and 1000 5000 μm were structured to observe the particle size distribution of mps in the septic tank the proportions of the four ranges in sediments were 86 3 12 7 0 7 and 0 3 respectively and that in scums was 91 2 7 9 0 9 and 0 respectively fig 5 mps larger than 1000 μm in sediments were pe pp pet pu pvc pc and silicone whereas that in scums was only pe table s2 shows the size distribution of different mps in sediments and scums 3 4 morphology of mps in sediments and scums as shown in fig 6 four shapes of mps were detected in the septic tank namely fibers beads granules and fragments four shapes were observed in sediments and three shapes no bead were observed in scums fibers accounted for 5 granules accounted for 23 and fragments accounted for 72 in the sediments the proportion of bead was extremely small just only one bead was detected in one sediment sample three shapes were detected in the scums including fibers 10 granules 20 and fragments 70 fiber shaped mps ranged in size from 20 to 610 μm in scums to 20 691 μm in sediments granule shaped mps ranged in size from 20 to 163 μm in scums to 20 1730 μm in sediments the size range of fragment shaped mps was wide with values of 20 1778 μm in scums and 20 1963 μm in sediments detailed information on the size distribution of the four shapes in sediments and scums is shown in table s3 in the sediments and scums morphology of mps with the same shape and type were characterized by sem as shown in fig 7 the surface of the pet in the same shape of fiber was firm but the surface in the sediment had breaks the surface of the pvc in the sediments was firm but partially shattered and the surface in the scums was uneven with numerous small particles stuck into it the surface of the pp in the same shape of fragment was smooth and firm but the edge of the pp in the scums was torn 4 discussions 4 1 abundance of mps in the septic tank this study investigated the occurrence of mps in the septic tank the results showed that the abundance of mps in the sediments was an order of magnitude higher than that in the scums the analyses of particle density size and morphology indicated a certain influence on the abundance distribution of mps in the sediments and scums the difference in the abundance of mps between sediments and scums might be caused by these facts first nearly half of the mps were pa and pet which greatly contributes to the number of mps in the sediments the densities of pa and pet are both greater than 1 g cm3 sun et al 2021 and the larger sized particles could easily settle down to the bottom of the septic tank smaller sized particles are likely to be suspended in the scum layer because of their larger surface to volume ratio zhao et al 2015 second various types of mps were found in the sediments with a size greater than 1000 μm pe pp pet pu pvc pc and silicone and gravity sedimentation accounted for the ease of sinking of denser particles such as pet and pu for slightly buoyant particles such as pe and pp biofouling was assumed to be the cause of the increase in particle density and sinking chubarenko et al 2016 fazey and ryan 2016 in reality various interactions occur between low density mps and living or non living creatures including phagocytosis attachment filming and agglomeration which exacerbate the vertical movement of low density mps in water bodies zhao et al 2018 only five particles with a size larger than 500 μm were observed in the scums possibly because the larger particles of mps were co suspended by adhering to organic matter such as feces similar to how plastic particles interact with plant debris in rivers möhlenkamp et al 2018 a comparison of our results with compost and agricultural soil revealed that the septic tank may contain more mps than compost or agricultural soil which was necessary to completely comprehend microplastic pollution in the ecosystem the concentration of mps in rural compost was studied by gui et al 2021 and the samples had 2 4 0 4 items g dw with a minimum detection size of 50 μm however our results showed that the concentration of mps larger than 50 μm in the septic tank was three to four orders of magnitude greater than that in the compost moreover compared with a recent report schwinghammer et al 2021 our results showed that the amount of mps in the septic tank was one to two orders of magnitude higher than that in compost when the minimum size detected was 1000 μm accordingly the mps accumulated in the septic tank were over one order of magnitude higher than that observed in the compost the concentration of mps in agricultural soils did not exceed 100 particles g dw corradini et al 2019 ding et al 2020 nizzetto et al 2016 van den berg et al 2020 and the mps in the septic tank were more than two orders of magnitude higher than those in the agricultural soil table 1 although the differences in the abundance of mps could also be related to different sampling regions and various detect methods considering the high concentrations of mps the septic tank can be regarded as a vital source of microplastic release into the environment and strategies for minimizing the presence of mps in the sediments and scums are needed 4 2 types of mps in the septic tank the types of mps in the scums were more abundant than those in the sediments according to our study of the chemical composition of mps in the septic tank the features of 26 different types of mps found in both sediments and scums were analyzed in conjunction with the shape and color of the mps 1 the proportion of low density mps steadily decreased from scums to sediments which may have resulted from gravity sedimentation consequently mps with higher density gathered in the sediments 2 the proportion of fiber shaped mps in the scums was substantially greater than that in the sediments while the proportion of other three shapes were higher in the sediments which may be related to the particle shape factor the shorter the shape the smaller the resistance of the spheroidal particles to the water and the easier the settling is the longer the shape the greater the resistance of the flaky particles to the water and the easier the floating is yan et al 2022 3 the colors of mps in the sediments were more diverse which may be related to the abundance of mps in the sediment the greater the abundance the more likely the color is richer the types of mps found only in the scums were much higher than those detected only in the sediments phenol formaldehyde and phenolic epoxy resin have been used to prepare surface coatings and are easily broken into smaller particles ganeshram and achudhan 2013 a large number of av used in coatings has been detected in human sputum by huang et al 2022 fluororubbers have been widely used in household appliances and automobiles as a sealing material due to their excellent properties ghosh et al 2001 resin and rubber are the main contributors to the difference in the types of sediments and scums this work was the first to systematically analyze mps in the septic tank mps in the septic tank were elucidated by analyzing mps in sediments and scums resulting in the detection of 36 types of mps mps exist in different forms and they are all counted as one type for example pe comes in the forms of chlorinated polyethylene linear pe pe 80 and uhmwpe whereas pc and pmma come in the forms of pc asa and pmma asa at present more than 30 types of mps have been detected in influent and effluent of waste water treatment plants wwtps sun et al 2019 and these types are a synthesis of many reports in different wwtps for example li et al 2018 found polyolefin acrylic fibers alkyd resin ps and pa in wwtps in china hdpe pvc pe pet and pp were detected in ireland mahon et al 2017 and pe pp pa and ps were detected in germany mintenig et al 2017 the primary mps found in other environmental matrices such as farmland soil and compost are shown to be present in the septic tank mps found in agricultural soil include pa pe pp ps pvc and pet chen et al 2020 pe pp pet pvc pa and pu were detected in the compost weithmann et al 2018 all common types of mps were detected in the septic tank including thermoplastics and thermosets and the majority of these types were linked to common plastic products lares et al 2018 mintenig et al 2017 indicating that septic tanks may act as a sink for mps 4 3 implications of mps in the septic tank there were obvious size distribution characteristics of mps in the septic tank from scums to sediments the particle size gradually increased septic tank is a complicated environment where floating microplastics may serve as habitats for microbes to reproduce quickly or where micromaterials such as humus may accumulate and add weight to microplastics thus increasing the particle density and decreasing buoyancy lin et al 2018 the size distribution of mps in the septic tank showed that most mps in the septic tank were small which was consistent with the proportion of size in the previous study in which 84 of mps are smaller than 100 μm scircle et al 2020 simon et al 2018 showed that mps smaller than 25 μm were abundant in sewage and the size smaller than 40 μm in the atlantic ocean has a large proportion of 64 enders et al 2015 studies have revealed that the particles are fractured resulting in decreased particle size after prolonged weathering ultraviolet irradiation physical wear and the action of microorganisms in the environment as a result the number of tiny mps is steadily growing until it reaches the nanoscale and nanoscale plastic particles are more dangerous and directly poisonous horton et al 2017 mps are difficult to degrade as emerging pollutants and will cause different hazards due to the different components and particle sizes the addition of hdpe decreases soil ph while the addition of pla do not change significantly boots et al 2019 pet 0 4 decreases soil fertility de souza machado et al 2019 a remarkably increased soil microbial activity is achieved using 28 pp kim and an 2019 nanoscale ps has broad inhibitory effects on soil microbial communities and enzymes awet et al 2018 ps with a particle size of 1 μm is more toxic than 5 μm lei et al 2018 as the size decreases the effects on the biota may become more obvious and switch from physical to chemical effects yang et al 2017 nanoscale ps can be directly absorbed by plants thus reducing the stem to root biomass ratio of wheat seedlings lian et al 2020 ps 50 nm can be internalized by crops thereby inducing oxidative stress in the body giorgetti et al 2020 mps in the septic tank that enter the soil environment via composting can affect soil physicochemical properties reduce fertility and even change the microbial community these changes can affect soil quality and nutrient cycling awet et al 2018 de souza machado et al 2018 organic fertilizer from composting serves as a vehicle for the entry of mps into the environment weithmann et al 2018 the concentrations of mps in the corresponding soils and the content of mps in the corresponding earthworms are remarkably different after the application of various levels of sludge composted organic fertilizers bläsing and amelung 2018 zhang et al 2020 the direct application of septic tank sludge via compost to cultivated soil is a typical mode of operation for organic fertilizers tran et al 2020 hence the organic fertilizer can directly introduce the mps of the septic tank into the soil the data from this study can be used to roughly estimate that this septic tank releases 140 840 billion microplastic particles average particle size 35 μm into the soil annually in the form of composting therefore the relationships between mps in the septic tank and in the agricultural soil need to be further investigated in future 5 conclusions mps seem to be ubiquitous and they are receiving increasing concern from the scientific community our study focuses on mps in a widely used septic tank mps in the septic tank have obvious vertical distribution characteristics the number of mps in the sediments is substantially higher than that in the scums while more diverse types are present in the scums overall septic tanks are a huge source and sink which bring together various mps generated during human production activities and may serve as a potential source of mps in terrestrial systems this work covers a knowledge gap about the presence of mps in the septic tank and offers basic data for further research on mps in the environment future research may focus on the presence of mps in various types of septic tanks and the changes of mps during the application of septic tank sludge to agricultural soil by composting or

minimization stabilization and security concurrently this study demonstrated the synergic effect of potassium ferrate pf and nitrite on prompting was solubilisation and acidogenic fermentation toward harvesting volatile fatty acids vfas the results indicated the pf nano2 co pretreatment boosted 7 44 times and 1 32 times higher was solubilisation peak soluble chemical oxygen demand scod of 2680 52

compared with the single pretreatment nitrite and pf fermentations afterwards the was dewaterability was improved simultaneously after acidogenic fermentation moreover a schematic diagram was established for illustrating mechanisms of the co pretreatment of pf and nitrite for enhancing the vfas generation via increasing key hydrolytic enzymes metabolic functional genes expression shifting microbial biotransformation pathways and elevating abundances of key microbes in acidogenic fermentation furthermore the mechanistic investigations suggested that the pf addition was conducive to form a relatively conductive fermentation environment for enhancing electron transfer et efficiency which contributed to the vfas biotransformation positively this study provided an effective strategy for enhancing the biodegradation bioconversion efficiency of was organic matters with potential profitable economic returns graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords potassium ferrate waste

been attracted extensive attention because of its strong oxidation effectiveness and green harmlessness ye et al found that the pf was capable to decompose the was extracellular polymeric substance eps structure and promote the dissolution of particulate organic matters with a result of 32 solubilisation after adding 0 81 g k2feo4 g ts meanwhile no toxic by products were formed with the generations of fe ⅲ fe oh 3 fe oh 3 could be used as a coagulant in the process of wastewater treatment ye et al 2012b wu et al found a 69 was disintegration efficiency could be reached with 500 mg l k2feo4 addition wu et al 2015 wen et al verified that the dose of 0 06 g fe vi g tss for was pre oxidization was capable to produce a vfas peak value of 3698 2 118 98 mg cod g vs with reaching a 32 39 recovery efficiency of vivianite resource finally wen et al 2022 nevertheless the relatively high cost and instability under acidic conditions of pf inhibited its further application hu et al 2020 thereby some auxiliary measurements e g effective assistance of freezing hu et al 2021 were necessary for further enhancing biosolids biotransformation effectiveness of was via acidogenic fermentation moreover the nitrite was proven to be capable to crack the microbial wall in sludge solids effectively for boosting hydrolysis efficiency and then enhancing anaerobic fermentation of was li et al 2016a wu et al 2018 nitrite generally existed in the form of free nitrite acid fna under acidic conditions and in its own form under neutral or alkaline conditions lu et al 2019 lu et al revealed the effects of fna and nitrite on the anaerobic fermentation of was both nitrite and fna could promote the solubilisation of was but the former was more conducive to vfas accumulation lu et al 2019 wang et al found that an optimal value of 1007 7 mg l scod could be produced after a 0 2 g no2 n g vss pretreatment which accelerated the disintegration disruption of tightly bound tb eps for soluble protein release wang et al 2019e furthermore the addition of nitrite had an effective impact on microorganisms cells cracking death leading to was solubilisation for scod increase wu et al 2020 the percentage of damaged bacterial cells in was depended largely upon the concentration of nitrite added during the pretreatment process which played a more important role in harming sludge cells as compared with the fna zahedi et al 2018 similarly the nitrite pretreatment was capable to achieve nearly equal methane bio production yield but more cost saving as compared with the fna for enhancing anaerobic fermentation of waste sludge romero guiza et al 2019 additionally the nitrite presented an effective effect on the lysis death of sludge microbial cells accelerating the disintegration disruption of tight binding tb eps with soluble protein release leading to the solubilisation of was and scod increase wang et al 2020 thus the nitrite might be more beneficial for assisting pf for enhancing was solubilisation and acidogenic fermentation comparatively with a relatively lower cost level accordingly as compared with other combined pretreatments e g biosurfactant microwave xiao et al 2017 cao2 thermal liu et al 2019 and naoh ultrasonic yan et al 2010 the pf nitrite was expected to present numerous merits for prompting was solubilisition and anaerobic acidogenesis in terms of relatively shorter treatment time higher vfas production efficiency and larger sludge biosolids reduction nonetheless neither the was solubilisation acidogenesis effectiveness and microbial cooperations nor mechanisms on enhancing was biosolids biodegradation bioconversion into vfas through pf nitrite co pretreatment have been revealed previously based on the aforesaid the main purpose of this study was to reveal the synergic effect of pf nitrite on was disintegration and acidogenic fermentation for vfas production on one hand the was solubilisation dewaterbility characteristics

was measured by sludge laser particle size analyzer ntt6100c china the distribution spread index dsi is usually used to characterize the filtration performance of was the formula for calculating dsi is as follows dsi d90 d10 2 d50 the d90 and d10 represented the diameters corresponding to less than 90 and 10 of the cumulative size respectively while d50 stood for the median diameter xin et al 2016 the concentration of iron was determined by 1 10 phenanthroline method tian et al 2022 the cyclic voltammetry cv measurement of fresh was supernatant and co pretreated was fermentation liquid was conducted via an electrochemical workstation chi660 chenhua china as reported previously xu et al 2019 2 5 microbial community analysis the fermentative was sample was centrifuged at 10 000 r min for

kegg database with using 16s rrna based software of picrust quagliariello et al 2018 2 6 electron transfer efficiency and pscod the electron transfer et efficiency in each anaerobic fermenter with ratio of different substances to pf and nitrite was calculated using eq 1 luo et al 2022 1 et efficiency total vfas mmol e fermentation substrates mmol e 100 where the number of electrons contained in the substrates i e was and total vfas i e acetate propionate butyrate and valerate are 8 8 14 20 and 26 respectively the vfas conversion efficiency during the was acidogenic fermentation could be calculated according to the eq 2 2 p scod vf a af vf a 0 sco d 0 sco d af where pscod was the vfas conversion efficiency the vfaaf was the vfa concentration after was acidogenic fermentation while the vfa0 was the initial vfas content in fresh was supernatant the scod0 stood for the initial scod content in fresh was supernatant while scodaf was the scod content after was acidogenic fermentation 2 7 statistical analysis origin 8 5 and spss 20 0 software were used for statistical analysis all results are the arithmetic mean of three parallel tests the standard deviation is represented by origin 8 5 by the estimator with the highest reliability in describing the statistical process spss 20 0 statistical software was used for analysis of variance anova one way anova was used to evaluate the significant difference test between samples and the confidence interval was 95 3 results and discussion 3 1 was co pretreatment solubilisation 3 1 1 was solubilisation the was solubilisation widely played a rate limiting role in sludge anaerobic fermentation for realizing high efficiency of acidogenesis vfas bioconversion wang et al 2019c soluble organic substances release from was solid phase were triggered by the pf nitrite co pretreatment shown in fig 1 the scod increased dramatically in the first 16 h with reaching a maximum increment of 2680 110 8 mg l by the co pretreatment of pf nitrite 1 3 no 7 in table 1 which was 7 44 times and 1 32 times higher than that by the single nitrite and pf pretreatment respectively fig 1a meanwhile a peak soluble protein concentration of 398 10 10 5 mg l was observed in the was supernatant after 25 h in pf nitrite 1 3 co pretreatment obviously fig 1b such results suggested that the co pretreatment of pf nitrite was capable to release considerably organic matters by promoting effectively the sludge disintegration solubilisation because of the strong oxidation of pf for destroying the structure and cracking integrity of was flocs wang et al 2020 moreover the nitrite damaged was cell membrane by inducing lipid peroxidation wu et al 2020 subsequently such coupling effect was capable to cause a large amount of was biosolids to be released into the liquid phase which was responsible for the increase of scod soluble protein supported previously she et al 2021 after 30 h of the co pretreatment both scod and soluble protein decreased simultaneously which might be resulted from the mineralization by the strong oxidation of fe ⅵ besides the reactive product of fe oh 3 was capable to flocculate the soluble organic matters into the solid phase ultimately yates et al 2014 fig 1c showed the 3d eem spectrum comparative analysis of organic matters in was supernatant after 48h co pretreatment pf nitrite 1 3 two main peaks of peak a ex em 200 240 nm 320 390 nm and peak b ex em 260 280 nm 330 380 nm were detected in the spectra the peak a represented non biodegradable substances such as fulvic acid humic acid etc while peak b mainly stood for the soluble microbial metabolites such as protein peptides etc cho et al 2014 the protein polypeptides represented by peak b were generally considered to be highly biodegradable and could be consumed by microbial growth and metabolism he et al 2011 the intensities of such two peaks after the co pretreatment were significantly higher than that in the blank test the co pretreatment pf nitrite 1 3 displayed a relatively high fluorescence intensity in peak b 5272 vs 102 6 in blank test the results inferred that such co pretreatment boosted the release of biodegradable substances from sludge solid phase which was ready sufficiently for the bioprocess of acidogenesis in the following anaerobic fermentation 3 1 2 was dewaterability changes capillary sunction time cst was popularly used to evaluate the filtration and dewatering property of was li et al 2016b fig 2 a depicted the cst test results of pretreated co pretreated was after 48h operation time the cst of pretreated was by single pf was significantly higher than the blank test which greatly deteriorated the dewatering property of was previous studies indicated that the protein was enriched in loosely bound eps lb eps layer which affected effectively the flocculation sedimentation and dehydration of sludge ding et al 2021 the strong oxidizability of pf contributed positively to was floc structure disintegration eps crack and solid organic matters solubilisation which increased the viscosity of was and worsened the dewatering traits of was supported previously w li et al 2019 moreover the increase in was particle size after anaerobic fermentation could be attributed to the broken sludge flocculation by fe iii feng et al 2017 meanwhile some was particles could be further decreased into small molecules during acidogenic fermentation which greatly reduced the viscosity of was and contributed to the cst values decrease of the fermented was he et al 2018 fig 2b indicating that the acidogenic fermentation had a positive impact in prompting dewatering and filtration capacity of was this point was consistent with wu et al s study wu et al 2019a meanwhile the particle size played an important role in affecting sludge dewatering capacity wang and li 2016a from the particle size distribution shifts in fig 2c it could be seen that the d50 value decreased from 27 95 μm in the blank test to 25 97 μm in the co pretreatment of pf nitrite 1 3 while it decreased to 26 56 μm in the single pf pretreatment the small particles were conducive to lead to was solubilisation audrey et al 2011 the co pretreatment with pf significantly reduced the particle size of was flocs which might be resulted from the higher crushing degree of sludge structure and promoting was solubilization by the strong oxidation of pf consistent with a previous study he et al 2018 such co pretreatment caused a more obvious decrease of d50 which indicated that the combination of nitrite and pf had a synergistic effect on reducing sludge particle diameter which contributed to the deterioration of sludge filtration characteristics and cst increase fig 2a additionally the dsi value decreased from 0 774 to 0 747 after the co pretreatment table 2 which led to the deteriorations of sludge dewatering and sedimentation it might be occurred by the flocculation of fe3 produced from pf oxidation via gathering the broken sludge particles and inhibiting sludge dehydration and sedimentation ye et al 2012a wu et al 2015 from the particle size distribution of fermented was fig 2d it could be seen that after acidogenic fermentation of the co pretreated was the sludge particle size became larger with small particles decreasing p 0 001 moreover the dsi of fermented sludge increased table 2 indicating that its dehydration and sedimentation were improved after fermentation and contributed positively to solid liquid separation she et al 2021 3 1 3 nitrite variations and ftir characteristics during was co pretreatment during the co pretreatment pf nitrite the nitrite content fluctuated slightly in the initial 16 h with a constant concentration range from 676 61 mg l to 663 96 mg l fig 3 a which was a period of concurrent rapid growth of scod and soluble protein in the was supernatant shown in fig 1 nevertheless the nitrite could be consumed by the denitrification reaction by the actions of denitrifying bacteria lu et al 2020 wu et al 2020 figs 3b and c were the infrared spectra comparison of was samples before after co pretreatment and acidogenic fermentation respectively the infrared peak near the wavelength of 3435 cm 1 corresponded to the tensile vibration of oh and nh in organic matter groups which was associated with the fatty acids proteins polysaccharides peptides alcohols and other organic matters in sludge grubel et al 2014 after the co pretreatment fig 3b both the absorption peak at 3435 cm 1 and the corresponding peak strength decreased simultaneously which indicated that the macromolecular organic matters such as carbohydrates and proteins in sludge solid phase were decomposed and responsible for the increase of scod soluble protein the peak near the wavelength of 2930 cm 1 mainly belonged to the stretching vibration of ch which stood for the aliphatic methylene peng et al 2018 in the infrared spectrum the absorption peaks at 1660 and 1027 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of c o and co p respectively which represented a variety of small molecular substances carboxylate phosphatidylic acid and alcohol as the main components of microbial cell wall and cell membrane grubel and machnicka 2014 peng et al 2018 the intensities of these peaks were significantly weakened after co pretreatment inferring the destruction of microbial cell wall and flowed into the liquid phase moreover the infrared peaks of the fermented was at 3435 2930 1660 and 1027 cm 1 increased clearly fig 3c but lower than those of unfermented was this indicated that macromolecular organic matters e g proteins polysaccharides etc and small organic molecules e g carboxylic esters phosphatidylic acids alcohols etc were dissolved from the was solid phase during the fermentation 3 2 acidogenic fermentation of co pretreated was 3 2 1 vfas production all pretreatment co pretreatments promoted vfas production obviously in the was acidogenic fermentation as shown in fig 4 the single pf and nitrite pretreatment led to an optimal vfas production after 4 d fermentation with reaching 1273 16 22 mg cod l and 1676 95 51 mg cod l respectively consistent with previous studies yan et al 2010 wan et al 2020 she et al 2021 in the co pretreated was fermentation the pf nitrite triggered a maximum vfas production with a peak vfas of 3536 25 115 mg cod l on day 6 which was 4 28 times 2 77 times and 2 11 times higher than that in blank pf and nitrite pretreatment fermentation respectively fig 4a this suggested the co pretreatment of pf nitrite boosted anaerobic acidogenesis of was biosolids with improving vfas bioconversion efficiency confirmed by previous studies lu et al 2014 ma et al 2019 compared with the vfas composition as shown in fig 4b the acetic acid propionic acid and isovaleric acid were accumulated dominantly in all pretreatment co pretreatment sludge fermentations in the co pretreatment of pf nitrite 1 3 the acetic acid 50 64 and propionic acid 10 06 were two major vfa compounds which could be used as external carbon sources for improving the removal efficiency of n and p wang et al 2019b moreover the simple small molecule fatty acids e g acetic propionic acids could be directly produced from the metabolism of soluble polysaccharides and small molecule proteins via acidogenic microorganisms xiong et al 2012 while the macromolecular fatty acids e g n valeric isovaleric acid were mainly generated by the reduction deamination of amino acids through stickland reaction hao et al 2015 therefore it could be seen that pf nitrite co pretreatment was capable to trigger the was organic solids solubilisation for soluble proteins polysaccharides release and contributed to the high efficient generation of acetic and propionic acid supported previously she et al 2021 3 2 2 key enzymes related to anaerobic fermentation the hydrolysis stage played essential roles on sludge anaerobic fermentation for vfas bioconversion gao et al 2020 macromolecular organics i e soluble proteins and carbohydrates were hydrolyzed into bioabsorbable small molecule organics by hydrolytic enzymes secreted by microorganisms in sludge fermentation system lin et al 2018 while the protease and α glucosidase executed crucial effect for soluble organics decomposition during sludge fermentation feng et al 2014 whose activities were shown in fig 5 in this study the co pretreatment of pf nitrite improved the activity of hydrolase obviously the protease activity 204 05 on day 2 in the co pretreatment pf nitrite 1 3 presented 104 05 53 45 and 80 97 higher than that in blank test single pf and nitrite pretreatment respectively meanwhile the α glucosidase activity remained at a relatively high level during the sludge fermentation with reaching 221 67 212 50 and 223 07 as compared with the control test on day 2 day 4 and day 6 respectively in general hydrolase activity was closely related to sludge hydrolysis process determining the acidification efficiency and vfas production directly hao and wang 2015 the high enzyme activities were supposed to be attributed to the stimulation by the fe ion release from pf during was solubilisation it was reported that fe had obvious effect on key microbes and even was an essential constituent of enzyme producing microbes e g fe was a key element of the pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase por enzyme liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 on the other hand the released high concentration of soluble organic matters also contributed to the high enzyme activities pang et al 2020 thus the co pretreatment of pf nitrite was capable to lead was to produce large amount of soluble organic matters which most effectively improved the activities of hydrolases for accelerating the bioconversion of macromolecular carbohydrates proteins via acidogenic microorganisms into vfas consistent with a previous study he et al 2018 3 2 3 microbial community diversity and profiles in anaerobic fermentation the microbial alpha diversity indices in pretreated co pretreated was fermentation was described in table 3 as compared with the blank test the microbial richness and diversity in the co pretreated was fermentation were clearly reduced as follows richness index decrease from 2544 to 1692 shannon index decrease from 6 17 to 3 69 and simpson index increase from 0 009 to 0 122 the co pretreatment of pf nitrite was capable to shift the microbial diversity in sludge fermentation system in which the growth of some microorganisms were inhibited even arriving to death fragmentation wang et al 2019e wu et al 2020 but it was conducive to the enrichment of functional flora and microbial community succession distribution toward enhancing acidogenesis shown in fig 6 and supported previously he et al 2019 wang et al 2019b fig 6a depicted the relative abundance of fermentative microorganisms at phylum level the dominant phyla contained proteobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes and bacteroidetes which accounted for 78 57 82 52 80 12 and 93 95 of total microbial abundance in correspondence with the blank test pf nitrite and co pretreatment pf nitrite 1 3 fermentations respectively in the co pretreatment pf nitrite 1 3 the abundance of firmicutes from 1 24 to 50 43 and bacteroidetes from 11 99 to 16 77 increased obviously while the abundance of proteobacteria from 46 20 in blank test to 11 84 decreased clearly the firmicutes was capable to hydrolyze and convert complex macromoleculars into small moleculars which was beneficial for vfas production ping et al 2018 the bacteroidetes was a protein hydrolyzing bacterium for vfas production tang et al 2016 proteobacteria was mostly reported as a vfas consuming phylum luo et al 2016 yang et al 2017 overall the co pretreatment pf nitrite 1 3 increased the abundance of hydrolysis bacteria of firmicutes and acidogenic bacteria of bacteroidetes in the was fermentation system while decreased the vfas consumer of proteobacteria abundance which promoted the accumulation of vfas effectively comparatively the microbial community composition shifted greatly in co pretreated was fermentation at genus level fig 6b the anaerolineaceae 45 63 and saprospiraceae 22 78 dominated in control test but them arrived to 23 66 and 22 17 in the co pretreated pf nitrite 1 3 was fermentation meanwhile the pseudomonas 0 23 0 35 in control test to 1 31 33 01 erysipelothrix 0 19 0 22 in control test to 4 36 32 63 alkaliflexus 0 01 0 05 in control test to 0 03 4 00 proteiniclasticum 0 008 0 07 in control test to 1 02 5 68 alkaliphilus 0 02 0 08 in control test to 0 06 4 06 acinetobacter 0 01 0 11 in control test to 0 45 1 75 paenisporosarcina 0 04 0 10 in control test to 0 69 9 81 and macellibacteroides 0 01 0 04 in control test to 0 02 4 05 were the main contributors responsible for vfas production moreover the pseudomonas and erysipelothrix reached peak abundances of 33 01 and 15 39 the genera of anaerolineaceae and saprospiraceae were capable to degrade carbohydrates proteins or other complex macromolecular organics in was anaerobic fermentation for vfas generation mcllroy et al 2017 song et al 2020 the pseudomonas could convert pyruvate into acetate through phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase under anaerobic conditions schreiber et al 2006 the erysipelothrix was a common vfas producing bacterium jin et al 2016 macellibacteroides was a main producer of vfas by converting polysaccharide hydrolysates into acetic acid and butyric acid he et al 2019 comprehensively the abundance of hydrolytic bacteria of anaerolineaceae and saprospiraceae decreased while vfas producing members of pseudomonas and erysipelothrix were accumulated in the first 6 d during the fermentation period on day 8 the abundance of pseudomonas decreased rapidly to 1 32 responsible for the decline of vfas the paenisporosarcina from 0 69 increased to 9 82 was reported as a succinate producing bacterium and contributed for propionic acid production krishnamurthi et al 2009 the alkaliflexus was capable to ferment succinic acid into propionate through methylmalonyl coa decarboxylase detkova et al 2009 besides the proteiniclasticum was usually related to amino acid metabolism for acetate propionate and isobutyrate production zhang et al 2010 huang et al 2016 the alkaliphilus was a common acetic acid producing bacterium liu et al 2020 while the acinetobacter could provide enough metabolites for vfas producing bacteria by degrading cellulose and other organic substances wang et al 2019d accordingly the co pretreatment of pf nitrite reshaped microbial community diversity profiles with the dominant genera enrichment of pseudomonas erysipelothrix alkaliflexus macellibacteroides proteiniclasticum alkaliphilus acinetobacter and paenisporosarcina whose interactive cooperations contributed to vfas production positively shown in fig 7 3 3 mechanism of co pretreatment of pf nitrite for prompting was acidogenic fermentation the relative frequency of microbial functional genes for demonstrating the differences in was fermentation process by different pretreatments with using 16s rrna based software of picrust quagliariello et al 2018 was shown in table 4 comparatively the relative frequency of functional genes in co pretreated was fermentation related to carbohydrate metabolism 12 73 13 08 in blank test 12 73 13 48 in pf was fermentation 12 40 13 15 in nitrite was fermentation and 13 23 14 11 in co pretreatment was fermentation exhibited a relatively higher expression degree moreover other gene functions associated with organics bioconversion into vfas in co pretreatment was fermentation e g amino acid metabolism 1 97 on day 8 lipid metabolism 6 46 on day 2 and 6 91 on day 6 exogenous biodegradation and metabolism 6 01 6 37 day 2 to day 6 cell movement 3 94 on day 6 membrane transport and nucleotide metabolism were roughly higher than those in single pretreatment was fermentations the carbohydrate metabolism exogenous biodegradation and metabolism were related to the degradation of various organic substances deng et al 2021 ai et al 2022 besides amino acid metabolic pathways mainly were linked with proteins and amino acids bioconversion toward vfas production in sludge fermentation xia et al 2019 xin et al 2021 the lipid metabolism cell movement membrane transport and nucleotide metabolism were conducive to promote cell lysis ai et al 2022 these results inferred that the co pretreatment of pf nitrite was capable to increase the relative frequency of functional genes expression and enhance the metabolic activity of fermentative microbial members zhang et al 2019 which contributed to promoting the production of vfas from sludge fermentation based on the above results figs 4 6 tables 3 4 a schematic diagram for indicating the vfas bioconversion and microbial interactive cooperations in was fermentation process enhanced by pf nitrite co pretreatment was proposed in fig 7 the strong oxidation of fe ⅵ of pf was capable to destroy the sludge flocs structure microbial cell wall wen et al 2022 while the lipid peroxidation induced by nitrite could lead to cell membrane damage wu et al 2020 such two cooperative effect could sufficiently result in was flocs disintegration partial solids solubilisation moreover some sludge particles could be flocculated again due to the coagulation of fe oh 3 produced by fe ⅵ oxidation wu et al 2015 w li et al 2019 with resulting in the deterioration of dehydration verified in fig 2 furthermore the co pretreatment of pf nitrite was capable to boost activities of hydrolases e g protease and α glucosidase generated from hydrolytic bacteria of anaerolineaceae saprospiraceae and acinetobacter in this study which played positive role in decomposing sludge solid organic matters into biodegradable small molecular organic mattes e g amino acids monosaccharides etc for vfas generation mcllroy et al 2017 wang et al 2019d song et al 2020 meanwhile microbial members of vfas producers e g pseudomonas erysipelothrix alkaliflexus macellibacteroides proteiniclasticum alkaliphilus acinetobacter and paenisporosarcina were enriched by the co pretreatment of pf nitrite in was fermentation system schreiber et al 2006 detkova et al 2009 krishnamurthi et al 2009 huang et al 2016 jin et al 2016 he et al 2019 the anaerolineaceae and saprospiraceae were hydrolytic bacterium in sludge fermentation process which contributed for complex macromolecular organics degradation mcllroy et al 2017 song et al 2020 the pseudomonas could use pyruvic acid for acetate fermentation under anaerobic conditions schreiber et al 2006 macellibacteroides can convert polysaccharide hydrolysates into acetic acid and butyric acid he et al 2019 paenisporosarcina has been reported as a succinate producing bacterium as a substrate for propionic acid production krishnamurthi et al 2009 the alkaliflexus could ferment into propionate through succinic acid fermentation detkova et al 2009 while the proteiniclasticum was usually related to amino acid metabolism for acetate propionate and isobutyrate production zhang et al 2010 huang et al 2016 the alkaliphilus was also a common acetic acid producing bacterium liu et al 2020 in terms of was reduction the was solids decreased obviously with ts reduction efficiency of 12 07 and vs of 16 94 while 2680 52 mg l scod was released into liquid phase after a 12d fermentation the ts decrease efficiency reached ca 22 30 with vs reduction of 29 58 accordingly a peak accumulation of vfas arrived to a 3536 25 115 mg cod l level during the fermentation process biodegradable organics in the liquid phase were used to be converted into vfas through different metabolic pathways shown in fig 8 feng et al 2009 the organic matters e g protein and polysaccharide etc were released from was biosolids by the co attacking actions of pf and nitrite shown in fig 7 the protein could be decomposed into amino acids from polypeptide and dipeptide decomposition via extracellular hydrolases e g protease α glucosidase while the polysaccharide was degraded into small molecular monosaccharides amino acids could be deaminated into acetyl coa by the enzyme catalyzed catabolism or form pyruvate an intermediate product for the transformation into acetyl coa the acetyl coa could be further converted into acetic acid through acetylphosphate with the catalyzing effect of phosphotransacetylase and acetic acid kinase feng et al 2009 such metabolic pathway of acetic acid formation may be completed by the genera of pseudomonas alkaliflexus alkaliphilus proteiniclasticum schreiber et al 2006 detkova et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 in this study meanwhile acetyl coa could be transformed into butyric acid through butyryl coa butyryl phosphate and other intermediates by the genera of macellibacteroides and proteiniclasticum in this study the monosaccharides could be converted into pyruvate after glycolysis process then the pyruvate entered the tricarboxylic acid cycle for the success transformations of oxalic acid acetic acid malic acid fumarate and succinic acid feng et al 2009 this pathway may be related to the cellular metabolic activities of paenisporosarcina krishnamurthi et al 2009 conversion process of succinic acid was mainly completed by microbial strains alkaliflexus and proteiniclasticum detkova et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 huang et al 2016 some pyruvate would produce lactic acid under the actions of lactate dehydrogenase ldh carried out by erysipelothrix jin et al 2016 it could be concluded that pf nitrite pretreatment could not only enhance the dissolution of organic matters via was dissolution but also improve obviously the abundance and microbial diversity for prompting hydrolysis acidogenesis in sludge fermentation process through enhancing microbial metabolism the main dominant members involved in fermentative microbial community associated their functions were concluded as follows pseudomonas and alkaliphilus were responsible for acetic acid generation while alkaliflexus contributed to concurrent generation of acetic and propionic acids supported previously detkova et al 2009 the proteiniclasticum was related to acetic propionic and butyric acids production zhang et al 2010 huang et al 2016 the macellibacteroides was associated with acetic acid and butyric acid production afterwards the paenisporosarcina was linked with succinic acid production krishnamurthi et al 2009 the concentrations of soluble iron during was fermentation enhanced by pf nitrite for peak vfas production were determined i e fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ the concentration of soluble iron was nearly zero both in blank test and the nano2 pretreated was fermentation the fe oh 3 and no3 under alkaline conditions could be generated through chemical reactions of k2feo4 with no2 formulas 3 and 4 hu et al 2020 thus a small amount of soluble iron fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ could be dissolved shown in fig 9 a 3 4feo 4 2 10 h 2 o 4 fe oh 3 8 o h 3 o 2 4 2 feo 4 2 3 no 2 5 h 2 o 2 fe oh 3 3 no 3 4 o h however such slight soluble fe ⅱ ca 0 35 0 96 mg l and fe ⅲ ca 2 54 4 13 mg l executed contributive roles in boosting vfas bioconversion efficiency through their valence conversion for completing electron transfer et process shown in fig 9b the et efficiency increased obviously from 2 60 blank test to 41 15 in co pretreated was fermentation pf nano2 1 3 indicating that the pf nitrite addition was capable to elevate the total et efficiency for vfas bioconversion during the sludge fermentation the et occurrence was mainly depended upon the valence shifting actions of mediators i e iron ion in this study from fe ⅵ to fe ⅲ together with the redox cycles between fe ⅲ and fe ⅱ which mediated the et between microbial cells and contributed to sludge acidogenesis positively wen et al 2022 this finding was also supported by the vfas conversion efficiency pscod variations fig 9c the optimal vfas conversion efficiency of 62 32 was observed in the co pretreatment of pf nano2 1 3 was fermentation which was 3 95 times higher than that in blank test the results showed that the co pretreatment of pf nano2 not only triggered the was disintegration solubilisation for increasing fermentation substrates but also provided redox mediators fe ii and fe iii serving as an electron shuttle to conduct et for enhancing vfas production in anaerobic systems supported by luo et al s study luo et al 2022 and the linear fitting result fig 9d which indicated that a positive correlation emerged between et efficiency and pscod furthermore the cv profile fig 9e also suggested that an obvious increase of redox property emerged in co pretreated pf nitrite was fermentation system such observation indicated the microbial fe oxidation reduction occurred through the redox cycle of fe ii and fe iii in figs 9a and b which might act as electron shuttles for enhancing et and contributing to vfas production also supported previously luo et al 2022 li et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 the redox cycle of fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ from pf got involved in the acidogenic fermentation system through mediating et for enhancing vfas bioconversion which was a novelty finding for deepening the mechanism understanding of prompting vfas generation from was biosolids thus this study verified the feasibility of pf nitrite co pretreatment for boosting vfas production from was sufficiently which provided an effective strategy to strengthen the was into value added products efficiency 3 4 economic analysis the economic feasibility of the pf nitrite and pf nitrite pretreatment was fermentation systems were analyzed table 5 in the pf pretreatment was fermentation the input cost was evaluated at ca 1 98 10 3 g ts according to the market price of industrial k2feo4 of around 10 000 ton while it shifted at ca 1 03 10 4 g ts based on the industrial nano2 price of ca 1 500 ton in the nitrite pretreatment was fermentation system the input cost number changed to ca 2 29 10 3 g ts in the co pretreatment pf nano2 1 3 was fermentation in terms of vfas production the peak vfas production arrived to 1273 16 1676 95 and 3536 25 mg cod l in correspondence with pf pretreatment nitrite pretreatment and co pretreatment pf nano2 1 3 was fermentations respectively according to the individual vfa proportion in fig 4b the potential output profit could be evaluated at 9 70 10 4 1 07 10 3 2 37 10 3 g ts respectively based on the market price of vfas products i e 6200 t for hac 11 700 t for hpr 14 500 t for n hbu 16 000 t for isohbu 27 000 t for n hva and 36 000 t for isohva she et al 2021 thus it could be concluded the potential net profit was positive both in the nano2 pretreatment and co pretreatment pf nano2 was fermentations while it was negative in the single pf pretreatment was fermentation system further comparative calculations indicated that the net profits of pf nano2 co pretreatment apparently superior to other hybrid pretreatments of biosurfactant microwave xiao et al 2017 cao2 thermal liu et al 2019 and naoh ultrasonic yan et al 2010 slightly lower than nitrous acid freezing wu et al 2019b and k2feo4 fa zhang et al 2021 as showed in table 5 given the excellent merits of relatively better ts reduction efficiency and higher vfas bioconversion efficiency the pf nano2 co pretreatment for enhancing concurrent was treatment and resource recovery exhibited huge applicative prospects in terms of bioprocess transformation efficiency and potential profitable returns 4 conclusion this study demonstrated the synergic effect of pf and nitrite on enhancing concurrent was solubilisation and acidogenic fermentation the oxidation of fe ⅵ of pf and the lipid peroxidation induced by nitrite led to an obvious was solubilization and vfa production meanwhile the was dewaterability was improved with particle size enlarging after fermentation moreover the activities of hydrolase were boosted for superior biosolids solubilisation by co pretreatment of pf nano2 the enrichment of main vfas producers of pseudomonas erysipelothrix alkaliflexus macellibacteroides proteiniclasticum alkaliphilus acinetobacter and paenisporosarcina cooperated toward enhancing microbial acidogenic functions assisted by pf nitrite co pretreatment furthermore the conductivity improvement by pf addition might play an important role in strengthening vfas production efficiency in anaerobic fermentation which facilitated sludge substrates biodegradation bioconversion through the improvement of et efficiency declaration of competing interest the

15404,enhancing anaerobic treatment efficiency of waste activated sludge was toward preferable resource recovery would be an important requirement for achieving carbon emission reduction biosolids minimization stabilization and security concurrently this study demonstrated the synergic effect of potassium ferrate pf and nitrite on prompting was solubilisation and acidogenic fermentation toward harvesting volatile fatty acids vfas the results indicated the pf nano2 co pretreatment boosted 7 44 times and 1 32 times higher was solubilisation peak soluble chemical oxygen demand scod of 2680 52 mg l than that by the single nitrite and pf pretreatment respectively while about 2 77 times and 2 11 times higher vfas production were achieved maximum vfas accumulation of 3536 25 115 24 mg cod l as compared with the single pretreatment nitrite and pf fermentations afterwards the was dewaterability was improved simultaneously after acidogenic fermentation moreover a schematic diagram was established for illustrating mechanisms of the co pretreatment of pf and nitrite for enhancing the vfas generation via increasing key hydrolytic enzymes metabolic functional genes expression shifting microbial biotransformation pathways and elevating abundances of key microbes in acidogenic fermentation furthermore the mechanistic investigations suggested that the pf addition was conducive to form a relatively conductive fermentation environment for enhancing electron transfer et efficiency which contributed to the vfas biotransformation positively this study provided an effective strategy for enhancing the biodegradation bioconversion efficiency of was organic matters with potential profitable economic returns graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords potassium ferrate waste

disintegration solubilisation due to the high efficiency of chemical actions e g oh or so4 as compared with other pretreatments wang and li 2016a niu et al 2020 recently the potassium ferrate pf has been attracted extensive attention because of its strong oxidation effectiveness and green harmlessness ye et al found that the pf was capable to decompose the was extracellular polymeric substance eps structure and promote the dissolution of particulate organic matters with a result of 32 solubilisation after adding 0 81 g k2feo4 g ts meanwhile no toxic by products were formed with the generations of fe ⅲ fe oh 3 fe oh 3 could be used as a coagulant in the process of wastewater treatment ye et al 2012b wu et al found a 69 was disintegration efficiency could be reached with 500 mg l k2feo4 addition wu et al 2015 wen et al verified that the dose of 0 06 g fe vi g tss for was pre oxidization was capable to produce a vfas peak value of 3698 2 118 98 mg cod g vs with reaching a 32 39 recovery efficiency of vivianite resource finally wen et al 2022 nevertheless the relatively high cost and instability under acidic conditions of pf inhibited its further application hu et al 2020 thereby some auxiliary measurements e g effective assistance of freezing hu et al 2021 were necessary for further enhancing biosolids biotransformation effectiveness of was via acidogenic fermentation moreover the nitrite was proven to be capable to crack the microbial wall in sludge solids effectively for boosting hydrolysis efficiency and then enhancing anaerobic fermentation of was li et al 2016a wu et al 2018 nitrite generally existed in the form of free nitrite acid fna under acidic conditions and in its own form under neutral or alkaline conditions lu et al 2019 lu et al revealed the effects of fna and nitrite on the anaerobic fermentation of was both nitrite and fna could promote the solubilisation of was but the former was more conducive to vfas accumulation lu et al 2019 wang et al found that an optimal value of 1007 7 mg l scod could be produced after a 0 2 g no2 n g vss pretreatment which accelerated the disintegration disruption of tightly bound tb eps for soluble protein release wang et al 2019e furthermore the addition of nitrite had an effective impact on microorganisms cells cracking death leading to was solubilisation for scod increase wu et al 2020 the percentage of damaged bacterial cells in was depended largely upon the concentration of nitrite added during the pretreatment process which played a more important role in harming sludge cells as compared with the fna zahedi et al 2018 similarly the nitrite pretreatment was capable to achieve nearly equal methane bio production yield but more cost saving as compared with the fna for enhancing anaerobic fermentation of waste sludge romero guiza et al 2019 additionally the nitrite presented an effective effect on the lysis death of sludge microbial cells accelerating the disintegration disruption of tight binding tb eps with soluble protein release leading to the solubilisation of was and scod increase wang et al 2020 thus the nitrite might be more beneficial for assisting pf for enhancing was solubilisation and acidogenic fermentation comparatively with a relatively lower cost level accordingly as compared with other combined pretreatments e g biosurfactant microwave xiao et al 2017 cao2 thermal liu et al 2019 and naoh ultrasonic yan et al 2010 the pf nitrite was expected to present numerous merits for prompting was solubilisition and anaerobic acidogenesis in terms of relatively shorter treatment time higher vfas production efficiency and larger sludge biosolids reduction nonetheless neither the was solubilisation acidogenesis effectiveness and microbial cooperations nor mechanisms on enhancing was biosolids biodegradation bioconversion into vfas through pf nitrite co pretreatment have been revealed previously based on the aforesaid the main purpose of this study was to reveal the synergic effect of pf nitrite on was disintegration and acidogenic fermentation for vfas production on one hand the was solubilisation dewaterbility characteristics capillary sunction time cst particle size characteristics ftir spectra etc and key enzymes activities related to hydrolysis were elucidated sufficiently on the other hand the mechanism investigations of pf nitrite for enhancing acidogenic fermentation and vfas production from was were clarified comprehensively 2 materials and methods 2 1 was source and characteristics the was used in this study

30 min before the sludge sample addition the dewatering traits of pretreated fermentative was samples were evaluated by sludge capillary suction time cst tester triton uk the particle size of sludge was measured by sludge laser particle size analyzer ntt6100c china the distribution spread index dsi is usually used to characterize the filtration performance of was the formula for calculating dsi is as follows dsi d90 d10 2 d50 the d90 and d10 represented the diameters corresponding to less than 90 and 10 of the cumulative size respectively while d50 stood for the median diameter xin et al 2016 the concentration of iron was determined by 1 10 phenanthroline method tian et al 2022 the cyclic voltammetry cv measurement of fresh was supernatant and co pretreated was fermentation liquid was conducted via an electrochemical workstation chi660 chenhua china as reported previously xu et al 2019 2 5 microbial community analysis the fermentative was sample was centrifuged at 10 000 r min for 10 min for obtaining the sediments then a fast dna kit mobio usa was used to extract the genomic dna of fermentative sludge samples the qubit 3 0 dna detection kit mobio usa was used to accurately quantify the genomic dna for the genomic dna determination prior to the polymerase chain reaction pcr process subsequently the v3 v4 region of 16s rdna of fermentative was was amplified by pcr using primers bar pcr primer 341f ccctacacgacgctcttccgatctg barcode cctacgggnggcwgcag and primer 805r gactggagttccttggcacccgagaattccagactachvgggtatctaatcc the amplified pcr products were purified by using

rdp database as classification standard http rdp cme msu edu misc resources jsp including family and genus levels the microbial diversity of each sample was calculated by mothur software http www mothur org wiki schloss sop alpha diversity including chao1 index richness index shannon index the relative abundance of functional genes was predicted based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database with using 16s rrna based software of picrust quagliariello et al 2018 2 6 electron transfer efficiency and pscod the electron transfer et efficiency in each anaerobic fermenter with ratio of different substances to pf and nitrite was calculated using eq 1 luo et al 2022 1 et efficiency total vfas mmol e fermentation substrates mmol e 100 where the number of electrons contained in the substrates i e was and total vfas i e acetate propionate butyrate and valerate are 8 8 14 20 and 26 respectively the vfas conversion efficiency during the was acidogenic fermentation could be calculated according to the eq 2 2 p scod vf a af vf a 0 sco d 0 sco d af where pscod was the vfas conversion efficiency the vfaaf was the vfa concentration after was acidogenic fermentation while the vfa0 was the initial vfas content in fresh was supernatant the scod0 stood for the initial scod content in fresh was supernatant while scodaf was the scod content after was acidogenic fermentation 2 7 statistical analysis origin 8 5 and spss 20 0 software were used for statistical analysis all results are the arithmetic mean of three parallel tests the standard deviation is represented by origin 8 5 by the estimator with the highest reliability in describing the statistical process spss 20 0 statistical software was used for analysis of variance anova one way anova was used to evaluate the significant difference test between samples and the confidence interval was 95 3 results and discussion 3 1 was co pretreatment solubilisation 3 1 1 was solubilisation the was solubilisation widely played a rate limiting role in sludge anaerobic fermentation for realizing high efficiency of acidogenesis vfas bioconversion wang et al 2019c soluble organic substances release from was solid phase were triggered by the pf nitrite co pretreatment shown in fig 1 the scod increased dramatically in the first 16 h with reaching a maximum increment of 2680 110 8 mg l by the co pretreatment of pf nitrite 1 3 no 7 in table 1 which was 7 44 times and 1 32 times higher than that by the single nitrite and pf pretreatment respectively fig 1a meanwhile a peak soluble protein concentration of 398 10 10 5 mg l was observed in the was supernatant after 25 h in pf nitrite 1 3 co pretreatment obviously fig 1b such results suggested that the co pretreatment of pf nitrite was capable to release considerably organic matters by promoting effectively the sludge disintegration solubilisation because of the strong oxidation of pf for destroying the structure and cracking integrity of was flocs wang et al 2020 moreover the nitrite damaged was cell membrane by inducing lipid peroxidation wu et al 2020 subsequently such coupling effect was capable to cause a large amount of was biosolids to be released into the liquid phase which was responsible for the increase of scod soluble protein supported previously she et al 2021 after 30 h of the co pretreatment both scod and soluble protein decreased simultaneously which might be resulted from the mineralization by the strong oxidation of fe ⅵ besides the reactive product of fe oh 3 was capable to flocculate the soluble organic matters into the solid phase ultimately yates et al 2014 fig 1c showed the 3d eem spectrum comparative analysis of organic matters in was supernatant after 48h co pretreatment pf nitrite 1 3 two main peaks of peak a ex em 200 240 nm 320 390 nm and peak b ex em 260 280 nm 330 380 nm were detected in the spectra the peak a represented non biodegradable substances such as fulvic acid humic acid etc while peak b mainly stood for the soluble microbial metabolites such as protein peptides etc cho et al 2014 the protein polypeptides represented by peak b were generally considered to be highly biodegradable and could be consumed by microbial growth and metabolism he et al 2011 the intensities of such two peaks after the co pretreatment were significantly higher than that in the blank test the co pretreatment pf nitrite 1 3 displayed a relatively high fluorescence intensity in peak b 5272 vs 102 6 in blank test the results inferred that such co pretreatment boosted the release of biodegradable substances from sludge solid phase which was ready sufficiently for the bioprocess of acidogenesis in the following anaerobic fermentation 3 1 2 was dewaterability changes capillary sunction time cst was popularly used to evaluate the filtration and dewatering property of was li et al 2016b fig 2 a depicted the cst test results of pretreated co pretreated was after 48h operation time the cst of pretreated was by single pf was significantly higher than the blank test which greatly deteriorated the dewatering property of was previous studies indicated that the protein was enriched in loosely bound eps lb eps layer which affected effectively the flocculation sedimentation and dehydration of sludge ding et al 2021 the strong oxidizability of pf contributed positively to was floc structure disintegration eps crack and solid organic matters solubilisation which increased the viscosity of was and worsened the dewatering traits of was supported previously w li et al 2019 moreover the increase in was particle size after anaerobic fermentation could be attributed to the broken sludge flocculation by fe iii feng et al 2017 meanwhile some was particles could be further decreased into small molecules during acidogenic fermentation which greatly reduced the viscosity of was and contributed to the cst values decrease of the fermented was he et al 2018 fig 2b indicating that the acidogenic fermentation had a positive impact in prompting dewatering and filtration capacity of was this point was consistent with wu et al s study wu et al 2019a meanwhile the particle size played an important role in affecting sludge dewatering capacity wang and li 2016a from the particle size distribution shifts in fig 2c it could be seen that the d50 value decreased from 27 95 μm in the blank test to 25 97 μm in the co pretreatment of pf nitrite 1 3 while it decreased to 26 56 μm in the single pf pretreatment the small particles were conducive to lead to was solubilisation audrey et al 2011 the co pretreatment with pf significantly reduced the particle size of was flocs which might be resulted from the higher crushing degree of sludge structure and promoting was solubilization by the strong oxidation of pf consistent with a previous study he et al 2018 such co pretreatment caused a more obvious decrease of d50 which indicated that the combination of nitrite and pf had a synergistic effect on reducing sludge particle diameter which contributed to the deterioration of sludge filtration characteristics and cst increase fig 2a additionally the dsi value decreased from 0 774 to 0 747 after the co pretreatment table 2 which led to the deteriorations of sludge dewatering and sedimentation it might be occurred by the flocculation of fe3 produced from pf oxidation via gathering the broken sludge particles and inhibiting sludge dehydration and sedimentation ye et al 2012a wu et al 2015 from the particle size distribution of fermented was fig 2d it could be seen that after acidogenic fermentation of the co pretreated was the sludge particle size became larger with small particles decreasing p 0 001 moreover the dsi of fermented sludge increased table 2 indicating that its dehydration and sedimentation were improved after fermentation and contributed positively to solid liquid separation she et al 2021 3 1 3 nitrite variations and ftir characteristics during was co pretreatment during the co pretreatment pf nitrite the nitrite content fluctuated slightly in the initial 16 h with a constant concentration range from 676 61 mg l to 663 96 mg l fig 3 a which was a period of concurrent rapid growth of scod and soluble protein in the was supernatant shown in fig 1 nevertheless the nitrite could be consumed by the denitrification reaction by the actions of denitrifying bacteria lu et al 2020 wu et al 2020 figs 3b and c were the infrared spectra comparison of was samples before after co pretreatment and acidogenic fermentation respectively the infrared peak near the wavelength of 3435 cm 1 corresponded to the tensile vibration of oh and nh in organic matter groups which was associated with the fatty acids proteins polysaccharides peptides alcohols and other organic matters in sludge grubel et al 2014 after the co pretreatment fig 3b both the absorption peak at 3435 cm 1 and the corresponding peak strength decreased simultaneously which indicated that the macromolecular organic matters such as carbohydrates and proteins in sludge solid phase were decomposed and responsible for the increase of scod soluble protein the peak near the wavelength of 2930 cm 1 mainly belonged to the stretching vibration of ch which stood for the aliphatic methylene peng et al 2018 in the infrared spectrum the absorption peaks at 1660 and 1027 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of c o and co p respectively which represented a variety of small molecular substances carboxylate phosphatidylic acid and alcohol as the main components of microbial cell wall and cell membrane grubel and machnicka 2014 peng et al 2018 the intensities of these peaks were significantly weakened after co pretreatment inferring the destruction of microbial cell wall and flowed into the liquid phase moreover the infrared peaks of the fermented was at 3435 2930 1660 and 1027 cm 1 increased clearly fig 3c but lower than those of unfermented was this indicated that macromolecular organic matters e g proteins polysaccharides etc and small organic molecules e g carboxylic esters phosphatidylic acids alcohols etc were dissolved from the was solid phase during the fermentation 3 2 acidogenic fermentation of co pretreated was 3 2 1 vfas production all pretreatment co pretreatments promoted vfas production obviously in the was acidogenic fermentation as shown in fig 4 the single pf and nitrite pretreatment led to an optimal vfas production after 4 d fermentation with reaching 1273 16 22 mg cod l and 1676 95 51 mg cod l respectively consistent with previous studies yan et al 2010 wan et al 2020 she et al 2021 in the co pretreated was fermentation the pf nitrite triggered a maximum vfas production with a peak vfas of 3536 25 115 mg cod l on day 6 which was 4 28 times 2 77 times and 2 11 times higher than that in blank pf and nitrite pretreatment fermentation respectively fig 4a this suggested the co pretreatment of pf nitrite boosted anaerobic acidogenesis of was biosolids with improving vfas bioconversion efficiency confirmed by previous studies lu et al 2014 ma et al 2019 compared with the vfas composition as shown in fig 4b the acetic acid propionic acid and isovaleric acid were accumulated dominantly in all pretreatment co pretreatment sludge fermentations in the co pretreatment of pf nitrite 1 3 the acetic acid 50 64 and propionic acid 10 06 were two major vfa compounds which could be used as external carbon sources for improving the removal efficiency of n and p wang et al 2019b moreover the simple small molecule fatty acids e g acetic propionic acids could be directly produced from the metabolism of soluble polysaccharides and small molecule proteins via acidogenic microorganisms xiong et al 2012 while the macromolecular fatty acids e g n valeric isovaleric acid were mainly generated by the reduction deamination of amino acids through stickland reaction hao et al 2015 therefore it could be seen that pf nitrite co pretreatment was capable to trigger the was organic solids solubilisation for soluble proteins polysaccharides release and contributed to the high efficient generation of acetic and propionic acid supported previously she et al 2021 3 2 2 key enzymes related to anaerobic fermentation the hydrolysis stage played essential roles on sludge anaerobic fermentation for vfas bioconversion gao et al 2020 macromolecular organics i e soluble proteins and carbohydrates were hydrolyzed into bioabsorbable small molecule organics by hydrolytic enzymes secreted by microorganisms in sludge fermentation system lin et al 2018 while the protease and α glucosidase executed crucial effect for soluble organics decomposition during sludge fermentation feng et al 2014 whose activities were shown in fig 5 in this study the co pretreatment of pf nitrite improved the activity of hydrolase obviously the protease activity 204 05 on day 2 in the co pretreatment pf nitrite 1 3 presented 104 05 53 45 and 80 97 higher than that in blank test single pf and nitrite pretreatment respectively meanwhile the α glucosidase activity remained at a relatively high level during the sludge fermentation with reaching 221 67 212 50 and 223 07 as compared with the control test on day 2 day 4 and day 6 respectively in general hydrolase activity was closely related to sludge hydrolysis process determining the acidification efficiency and vfas production directly hao and wang 2015 the high enzyme activities were supposed to be attributed to the stimulation by the fe ion release from pf during was solubilisation it was reported that fe had obvious effect on key microbes and even was an essential constituent of enzyme producing microbes e g fe was a key element of the pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase por enzyme liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 on the other hand the released high concentration of soluble organic matters also contributed to the high enzyme activities pang et al 2020 thus the co pretreatment of pf nitrite was capable to lead was to produce large amount of soluble organic matters which most effectively improved the activities of hydrolases for accelerating the bioconversion of macromolecular carbohydrates proteins via acidogenic microorganisms into vfas consistent with a previous study he et al 2018 3 2 3 microbial community diversity and profiles in anaerobic fermentation the microbial alpha diversity indices in pretreated co pretreated was fermentation was described in table 3 as compared with the blank test the microbial richness and diversity in the co pretreated was fermentation were clearly reduced as follows richness index decrease from 2544 to 1692 shannon index decrease from 6 17 to 3 69 and simpson index increase from 0 009 to 0 122 the co pretreatment of pf nitrite was capable to shift the microbial diversity in sludge fermentation system in which the growth of some microorganisms were inhibited even arriving to death fragmentation wang et al 2019e wu et al 2020 but it was conducive to the enrichment of functional flora and microbial community succession distribution toward enhancing acidogenesis shown in fig 6 and supported previously he et al 2019 wang et al 2019b fig 6a depicted the relative abundance of fermentative microorganisms at phylum level the dominant phyla contained proteobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes and bacteroidetes which accounted for 78 57 82 52 80 12 and 93 95 of total microbial abundance in correspondence with the blank test pf nitrite and co pretreatment pf nitrite 1 3 fermentations respectively in the co pretreatment pf nitrite 1 3 the abundance of firmicutes from 1 24 to 50 43 and bacteroidetes from 11 99 to 16 77 increased obviously while the abundance of proteobacteria from 46 20 in blank test to 11 84 decreased clearly the firmicutes was capable to hydrolyze and convert complex macromoleculars into small moleculars which was beneficial for vfas production ping et al 2018 the bacteroidetes was a protein hydrolyzing bacterium for vfas production tang et al 2016 proteobacteria was mostly reported as a vfas consuming phylum luo et al 2016 yang et al 2017 overall the co pretreatment pf nitrite 1 3 increased the abundance of hydrolysis bacteria of firmicutes and acidogenic bacteria of bacteroidetes in the was fermentation system while decreased the vfas consumer of proteobacteria abundance which promoted the accumulation of vfas effectively comparatively the microbial community composition shifted greatly in co pretreated was fermentation at genus level fig 6b the anaerolineaceae 45 63 and saprospiraceae 22 78 dominated in control test but them arrived to 23 66 and 22 17 in the co pretreated pf nitrite 1 3 was fermentation meanwhile the pseudomonas 0 23 0 35 in control test to 1 31 33 01 erysipelothrix 0 19 0 22 in control test to 4 36 32 63 alkaliflexus 0 01 0 05 in control test to 0 03 4 00 proteiniclasticum 0 008 0 07 in control test to 1 02 5 68 alkaliphilus 0 02 0 08 in control test to 0 06 4 06 acinetobacter 0 01 0 11 in control test to 0 45 1 75 paenisporosarcina 0 04 0 10 in control test to 0 69 9 81 and macellibacteroides 0 01 0 04 in control test to 0 02 4 05 were the main contributors responsible for vfas production moreover the pseudomonas and erysipelothrix reached peak abundances of 33 01 and 15 39 the genera of anaerolineaceae and saprospiraceae were capable to degrade carbohydrates proteins or other complex macromolecular organics in was anaerobic fermentation for vfas generation mcllroy et al 2017 song et al 2020 the pseudomonas could convert pyruvate into acetate through phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase under anaerobic conditions schreiber et al 2006 the erysipelothrix was a common vfas producing bacterium jin et al 2016 macellibacteroides was a main producer of vfas by converting polysaccharide hydrolysates into acetic acid and butyric acid he et al 2019 comprehensively the abundance of hydrolytic bacteria of anaerolineaceae and saprospiraceae decreased while vfas producing members of pseudomonas and erysipelothrix were accumulated in the first 6 d during the fermentation period on day 8 the abundance of pseudomonas decreased rapidly to 1 32 responsible for the decline of vfas the paenisporosarcina from 0 69 increased to 9 82 was reported as a succinate producing bacterium and contributed for propionic acid production krishnamurthi et al 2009 the alkaliflexus was capable to ferment succinic acid into propionate through methylmalonyl coa decarboxylase detkova et al 2009 besides the proteiniclasticum was usually related to amino acid metabolism for acetate propionate and isobutyrate production zhang et al 2010 huang et al 2016 the alkaliphilus was a common acetic acid producing bacterium liu et al 2020 while the acinetobacter could provide enough metabolites for vfas producing bacteria by degrading cellulose and other organic substances wang et al 2019d accordingly the co pretreatment of pf nitrite reshaped microbial community diversity profiles with the dominant genera enrichment of pseudomonas erysipelothrix alkaliflexus macellibacteroides proteiniclasticum alkaliphilus acinetobacter and paenisporosarcina whose interactive cooperations contributed to vfas production positively shown in fig 7 3 3 mechanism of co pretreatment of pf nitrite for prompting was acidogenic fermentation the relative frequency of microbial functional genes for demonstrating the differences in was fermentation process by different pretreatments with using 16s rrna based software of picrust quagliariello et al 2018 was shown in table 4 comparatively the relative frequency of functional genes in co pretreated was fermentation related to carbohydrate metabolism 12 73 13 08 in blank test 12 73 13 48 in pf was fermentation 12 40 13 15 in nitrite was fermentation and 13 23 14 11 in co pretreatment was fermentation exhibited a relatively higher expression degree moreover other gene functions associated with organics bioconversion into vfas in co pretreatment was fermentation e g amino acid metabolism 1 97 on day 8 lipid metabolism 6 46 on day 2 and 6 91 on day 6 exogenous biodegradation and metabolism 6 01 6 37 day 2 to day 6 cell movement 3 94 on day 6 membrane transport and nucleotide metabolism were roughly higher than those in single pretreatment was fermentations the carbohydrate metabolism exogenous biodegradation and metabolism were related to the degradation of various organic substances deng et al 2021 ai et al 2022 besides amino acid metabolic pathways mainly were linked with proteins and amino acids bioconversion toward vfas production in sludge fermentation xia et al 2019 xin et al 2021 the lipid metabolism cell movement membrane transport and nucleotide metabolism were conducive to promote cell lysis ai et al 2022 these results inferred that the co pretreatment of pf nitrite was capable to increase the relative frequency of functional genes expression and enhance the metabolic activity of fermentative microbial members zhang et al 2019 which contributed to promoting the production of vfas from sludge fermentation based on the above results figs 4 6 tables 3 4 a schematic diagram for indicating the vfas bioconversion and microbial interactive cooperations in was fermentation process enhanced by pf nitrite co pretreatment was proposed in fig 7 the strong oxidation of fe ⅵ of pf was capable to destroy the sludge flocs structure microbial cell wall wen et al 2022 while the lipid peroxidation induced by nitrite could lead to cell membrane damage wu et al 2020 such two cooperative effect could sufficiently result in was flocs disintegration partial solids solubilisation moreover some sludge particles could be flocculated again due to the coagulation of fe oh 3 produced by fe ⅵ oxidation wu et al 2015 w li et al 2019 with resulting in the deterioration of dehydration verified in fig 2 furthermore the co pretreatment of pf nitrite was capable to boost activities of hydrolases e g protease and α glucosidase generated from hydrolytic bacteria of anaerolineaceae saprospiraceae and acinetobacter in this study which played positive role in decomposing sludge solid organic matters into biodegradable small molecular organic mattes e g amino acids monosaccharides etc for vfas generation mcllroy et al 2017 wang et al 2019d song et al 2020 meanwhile microbial members of vfas producers e g pseudomonas erysipelothrix alkaliflexus macellibacteroides proteiniclasticum alkaliphilus acinetobacter and paenisporosarcina were enriched by the co pretreatment of pf nitrite in was fermentation system schreiber et al 2006 detkova et al 2009 krishnamurthi et al 2009 huang et al 2016 jin et al 2016 he et al 2019 the anaerolineaceae and saprospiraceae were hydrolytic bacterium in sludge fermentation process which contributed for complex macromolecular organics degradation mcllroy et al 2017 song et al 2020 the pseudomonas could use pyruvic acid for acetate fermentation under anaerobic conditions schreiber et al 2006 macellibacteroides can convert polysaccharide hydrolysates into acetic acid and butyric acid he et al 2019 paenisporosarcina has been reported as a succinate producing bacterium as a substrate for propionic acid production krishnamurthi et al 2009 the alkaliflexus could ferment into propionate through succinic acid fermentation detkova et al 2009 while the proteiniclasticum was usually related to amino acid metabolism for acetate propionate and isobutyrate production zhang et al 2010 huang et al 2016 the alkaliphilus was also a common acetic acid producing bacterium liu et al 2020 in terms of was reduction the was solids decreased obviously with ts reduction efficiency of 12 07 and vs of 16 94 while 2680 52 mg l scod was released into liquid phase after a 12d fermentation the ts decrease efficiency reached ca 22 30 with vs reduction of 29 58 accordingly a peak accumulation of vfas arrived to a 3536 25 115 mg cod l level during the fermentation process biodegradable organics in the liquid phase were used to be converted into vfas through different metabolic pathways shown in fig 8 feng et al 2009 the organic matters e g protein and polysaccharide etc were released from was biosolids by the co attacking actions of pf and nitrite shown in fig 7 the protein could be decomposed into amino acids from polypeptide and dipeptide decomposition via extracellular hydrolases e g protease α glucosidase while the polysaccharide was degraded into small molecular monosaccharides amino acids could be deaminated into acetyl coa by the enzyme catalyzed catabolism or form pyruvate an intermediate product for the transformation into acetyl coa the acetyl coa could be further converted into acetic acid through acetylphosphate with the catalyzing effect of phosphotransacetylase and acetic acid kinase feng et al 2009 such metabolic pathway of acetic acid formation may be completed by the genera of pseudomonas alkaliflexus alkaliphilus proteiniclasticum schreiber et al 2006 detkova et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 in this study meanwhile acetyl coa could be transformed into butyric acid through butyryl coa butyryl phosphate and other intermediates by the genera of macellibacteroides and proteiniclasticum in this study the monosaccharides could be converted into pyruvate after glycolysis process then the pyruvate entered the tricarboxylic acid cycle for the success transformations of oxalic acid acetic acid malic acid fumarate and succinic acid feng et al 2009 this pathway may be related to the cellular metabolic activities of paenisporosarcina krishnamurthi et al 2009 conversion process of succinic acid was mainly completed by microbial strains alkaliflexus and proteiniclasticum detkova et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 huang et al 2016 some pyruvate would produce lactic acid under the actions of lactate dehydrogenase ldh carried out by erysipelothrix jin et al 2016 it could be concluded that pf nitrite pretreatment could not only enhance the dissolution of organic matters via was dissolution but also improve obviously the abundance and microbial diversity for prompting hydrolysis acidogenesis in sludge fermentation process through enhancing microbial metabolism the main dominant members involved in fermentative microbial community associated their functions were concluded as follows pseudomonas and alkaliphilus were responsible for acetic acid generation while alkaliflexus contributed to concurrent generation of acetic and propionic acids supported previously detkova et al 2009 the proteiniclasticum was related to acetic propionic and butyric acids production zhang et al 2010 huang et al 2016 the macellibacteroides was associated with acetic acid and butyric acid production afterwards the paenisporosarcina was linked with succinic acid production krishnamurthi et al 2009 the concentrations of soluble iron during was fermentation enhanced by pf nitrite for peak vfas production were determined i e fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ the concentration of soluble iron was nearly zero both in blank test and the nano2 pretreated was fermentation the fe oh 3 and no3 under alkaline conditions could be generated through chemical reactions of k2feo4 with no2 formulas 3 and 4 hu et al 2020 thus a small amount of soluble iron fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ could be dissolved shown in fig 9 a 3 4feo 4 2 10 h 2 o 4 fe oh 3 8 o h 3 o 2 4 2 feo 4 2 3 no 2 5 h 2 o 2 fe oh 3 3 no 3 4 o h however such slight soluble fe ⅱ ca 0 35 0 96 mg l and fe ⅲ ca 2 54 4 13 mg l executed contributive roles in boosting vfas bioconversion efficiency through their valence conversion for completing electron transfer et process shown in fig 9b the et efficiency increased obviously from 2 60 blank test to 41 15 in co pretreated was fermentation pf nano2 1 3 indicating that the pf nitrite addition was capable to elevate the total et efficiency for vfas bioconversion during the sludge fermentation the et occurrence was mainly depended upon the valence shifting actions of mediators i e iron ion in this study from fe ⅵ to fe ⅲ together with the redox cycles between fe ⅲ and fe ⅱ which mediated the et between microbial cells and contributed to sludge acidogenesis positively wen et al 2022 this finding was also supported by the vfas conversion efficiency pscod variations fig 9c the optimal vfas conversion efficiency of 62 32 was observed in the co pretreatment of pf nano2 1 3 was fermentation which was 3 95 times higher than that in blank test the results showed that the co pretreatment of pf nano2 not only triggered the was disintegration solubilisation for increasing fermentation substrates but also provided redox mediators fe ii and fe iii serving as an electron shuttle to conduct et for enhancing vfas production in anaerobic systems supported by luo et al s study luo et al 2022 and the linear fitting result fig 9d which indicated that a positive correlation emerged between et efficiency and pscod furthermore the cv profile fig 9e also suggested that an obvious increase of redox property emerged in co pretreated pf nitrite was fermentation system such observation indicated the microbial fe oxidation reduction occurred through the redox cycle of fe ii and fe iii in figs 9a and b which might act as electron shuttles for enhancing et and contributing to vfas production also supported previously luo et al 2022 li et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 the redox cycle of fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ from pf got involved in the acidogenic fermentation system through mediating et for enhancing vfas bioconversion which was a novelty finding for deepening the mechanism understanding of prompting vfas generation from was biosolids thus this study verified the feasibility of pf nitrite co pretreatment for boosting vfas production from was sufficiently which provided an effective strategy to strengthen the was into value added products efficiency 3 4 economic analysis the economic feasibility of the pf nitrite and pf nitrite pretreatment was fermentation systems were analyzed table 5 in the pf pretreatment was fermentation the input cost was evaluated at ca 1 98 10 3 g ts according to the market price of industrial k2feo4 of around 10 000 ton while it shifted at ca 1 03 10 4 g ts based on the industrial nano2 price of ca 1 500 ton in the nitrite pretreatment was fermentation system the input cost number changed to ca 2 29 10 3 g ts in the co pretreatment pf nano2 1 3 was fermentation in terms of vfas production the peak vfas production arrived to 1273 16 1676 95 and 3536 25 mg cod l in correspondence with pf pretreatment nitrite pretreatment and co pretreatment pf nano2 1 3 was fermentations respectively according to the individual vfa proportion in fig 4b the potential output profit could be evaluated at 9 70 10 4 1 07 10 3 2 37 10 3 g ts respectively based on the market price of vfas products i e 6200 t for hac 11 700 t for hpr 14 500 t for n hbu 16 000 t for isohbu 27 000 t for n hva and 36 000 t for isohva she et al 2021 thus it could be concluded the potential net profit was positive both in the nano2 pretreatment and co pretreatment pf nano2 was fermentations while it was negative in the single pf pretreatment was fermentation system further comparative calculations indicated that the net profits of pf nano2 co pretreatment apparently superior to other hybrid pretreatments of biosurfactant microwave xiao et al 2017 cao2 thermal liu et al 2019 and naoh ultrasonic yan et al 2010 slightly lower than nitrous acid freezing wu et al 2019b and k2feo4 fa zhang et al 2021 as showed in table 5 given the excellent merits of relatively better ts reduction efficiency and higher vfas bioconversion efficiency the pf nano2 co pretreatment for enhancing concurrent was treatment and resource recovery exhibited huge applicative prospects in terms of bioprocess transformation efficiency and potential profitable returns 4 conclusion this study demonstrated the synergic effect of pf and nitrite on enhancing concurrent was solubilisation and acidogenic fermentation the oxidation of fe ⅵ of pf and the lipid peroxidation induced by nitrite led to an obvious was solubilization and vfa production meanwhile the was dewaterability was improved with particle size enlarging after fermentation moreover the activities of hydrolase were boosted for superior biosolids solubilisation by co pretreatment of pf nano2 the enrichment of main vfas producers of pseudomonas erysipelothrix alkaliflexus macellibacteroides proteiniclasticum alkaliphilus acinetobacter and paenisporosarcina cooperated toward enhancing microbial acidogenic functions assisted by pf nitrite co pretreatment furthermore the conductivity improvement by pf addition might play an important role in strengthening vfas production efficiency in anaerobic fermentation which facilitated sludge substrates biodegradation bioconversion through the improvement of et efficiency declaration of competing interest the
