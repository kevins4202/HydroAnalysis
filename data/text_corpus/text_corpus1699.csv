the deccan traps with major soil types being black soils alluvium red and mixed soils study focus in the present study swat has been used to investigate the potential impacts of climate change on the water resources of the krishna basin the simulations were carried out with the observed historical and future climate data of various climate models and the results were evaluated the calibration and validation of the model was carried out using the sufi 2 algorithm in swat cup analysis of rainfall extremes and available water resources were determined under future climate scenarios new hydrological insights for the region extension of monsoon rainfall even up to october a shift in the maximum amount of long term mean ismr and surface runoff increasing trend of rainfall in the months of october november and few extreme rainfall events other than monsoon season was observed under future with different climate models the climate model cnrm cm5 projected that 7 5 and 25 of the events were falling under excess rainfall 25 extreme rainfall 50 and moderate drought events respectively under rcp 4 5 scenario as against 17 10 and 17 respectively in the case of rcp 8 5 scenario keywords climate change ismr krishna river basin extreme rainfall events swat model 1 introduction water plays a vital role in the survival of human beings and other living things it is an essential commodity for economic growth development of agriculture activities and industries however it has become a scarce resource because of increasing population and industrialization prajnya and tuppad 2016 to overcome the future water stress sustainable water resources management is essential from the regional to national scales shrestha and htut 2016 vu et al 2016 further changes in climate events and weather extremes have had a significant impact on natural water resources various studies indicate climate extreme events are increasing in the future because of changes in intense rainfall events and abruptly high and low temperatures easterling et al 2000 mukherjee et al 2018 therefore the changes in the frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts or floods could affect the water availability human health quality of water resources agricultural production and environmental conditions jiang et al 2007 karl 2008 mishra et al 2016 thus investigating these impacts on the hydrological regime is crucial for mitigating the adverse effects of extreme weather events hydrological models have been used to evaluate the climate change impacts on the hydrological regimes these tools help to estimate various hydrological parameters such as runoff evapotranspiration et potential evapotranspiration pet and water yield etc in its regime estimation of these parameters and selection of models are crucial for evaluating the impact of present and future climate mishra et al 2008 swat model has been selected for quantifying the hydrological parameters under present and future climate at basin scale arnell and reynard 1996 devkota and gyawali 2015 fujihara et al 2008 gosain et al 2006 2011 guo et al 2002 iskender and sajikumar 2016 mishra and lilhare 2016 molina navarro et al 2016 singh and gosain 2012 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2006 2015 zierl and bugmann 2005 the krishna river basin india was selected as study area due to its semi arid nature and vulnerability to climate change owing to the erratic distribution of rainfall along with warmer climatic conditions few studies have been conducted to analyse the climate change impact on water resources of the krishna river basin however these studies use the greenhouse gas ghg and special report on emissions scenarios sres scenarios which carry an enormous uncertainty in the assumption of factors such as economic development population growth and developed technology soro et al 2017 for instance using the ghg scenario gosain et al 2006 concluded the krishna basin to experience regular or seasonal water stressed conditions in future due to a decrease of precipitation and water yield kulkarni et al 2014 projected an increasing trend in annual precipitation surface runoff water yield and actual evapotranspiration in future 2041 70 displaying no significant changes in these parameters in the early century 2011 40 using the sres scenario in both these studies a single gcm data was used without any bias correction while performing calibration at the only one gauge station mishra and lilhare 2016 projected an increasing trend of water balance components along with rainfall and air temperature in krishna river basin under future climate scenarions cmip5 models with rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios unlike previous studies gosain et al 2006 kulkarni et al 2014 emphasizes on climate model selection based on the performance of the model with reference to observed data in this study the rainfall extremes under future climate scenarios of the krishna river basin india were analysed downscaled and bias corrected climate models with medium rcp 4 5 and high emission rcp 8 5 scenarios were used to improve future predictions and the model performance which was carried out by multi gauge calibration 2 research methodology the methodology follows as 1 selection of climate model 2 hydrological modeling of krishna river basin with multi gauge calibration and validation 3 assessment

telangana and maharashtra covering a total geographic area of 2 58 948 km2 and flows over a length of 1400 km a major part of this basin lies on basaltic and crystalline rocks having low yield potentials while the delta regions have alluvium sediments having high yield potential the major soil types are black soils alluvium red soils mixed soils saline and alkaline soils and laterite soils most of the area in this basin belongs to a semi arid region with agricultural land covering about 76 of the total area nraa 2011 the annual average rainfall of the basin is about 780 mm and 90 of it occurs during monsoon june october some parts of andhra pradesh karnataka and maharashtra are drought prone areas whereas the delta region is subjected to flooding http india wris nrsc gov in 2 2 soil

the variable storage method and priestley taylor methods were used for flow routing and estimation of potential evapotranspiration in the model the model setup is shown in fig 2 2 3 input data 2 3 1 geospatial data the topography details soil characteristics and land use land cover lulc maps were required for the hydrological modeling setup the topographic details of the study area were provided in swat as dem shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem of 90 m resolution was used which was obtained from the cgiar consortium for spatial information cgiar csi http srtm csi cgiar org the required soil and lulc maps of the study area are obtained from water base http www waterbase org and prepared as per swat model fig 2 2 3 2 weather data the rainfall data 0 25 0 25 and minimum and maximum temperatures 0 5 0 5 were used as weather inputs for the model obtained from indian meteorological department imd pune india pai et al 2014 the other required data such as solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were autogenerated by the swat in build weather generator the climate data for the historic 1970 2005 and future scenarios 2006 2100 were obtained from earth system grid federation esgf https esg dn1 nsc liu se i e cordex south asia database mishra et al 2014 reported that due to low bias and uncertainty best gcms may perform better than cordex rcms and their host gcms in hydrological applications which are attributed to intermodal variations thus for using rcms bias correction has to be carried out for regional studies or hydrological applications brown et al 2008 mishra et al 2014 teutschbein and seibert 2012 however in western ghat regions the cordex rcms may perform better than cmip5 models because of their ability to resolve orographic and topographic precipitation mishra et al 2014 since the krishna river basin receives ample amount of rainfall from western ghat regions average annual rainfall over 2500 mm gumma et al 2011 in this study cordex rcms were used instead of cmip5 models data from six climate models iches ec earth noaa gfdl gfdl esm2m miroc miroc5 ncc noresm1 m ipsl cm5a mr and cnrm cerfacs cnrm cm5 were used comprising of high resolution 0 5 0 5 climate data with rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios stabilize the radiative force at 4 5 and 8 5 w m2 based on assumptions of economic activities population growth energy sources and social economic factors it also includes global long term greenhouse gas emissions and land use land cover lulc changes in the global economic framework thomson et al 2011 as a part of mitigation strategy the expansion of forest is also considered in rcp 4 5 2 4 calibration and validation swat cup swat calibration uncertainty programme was developed for calibration and validation of swat model abbaspour et al 2015 to minimize the uncertainty associated with model predictions the calibration and validation of the model were carried out based on the observed streamflow data by using the sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup abbaspour et al 2015 ghoraba 2015 yang et al 2008 the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were also carried out to get the better correlation between simulated and observed data the multi gauge calibration and validation of the model were carried out the observed streamflow data at various gauge stations of krishna basin were collected from the central water commission goi hyderabad and analysed the variation of observed average monthly discharge in the krishna river basin over a period of 31 years 1984 2013 is shown in fig 3 the large streamflows occurred in july august and september in kurundwad and huvinhedigi gauge stations were due to heavy rainfall in the western ghats in the months of june july august as vijayawada gauge station lies near the outlet of the krishna basin it receives heavy flows in months of july august and september the presence of reservoirs may cause the delay in the flows in this gauge station from the available streamflow data the model was calibrated for a period of 22 years 1983 2004 and validated for a period of 8 years 2006 2013 at the gauge stations of wadakbal wadenapally keesar yadgir matralayam and t ramapuram due to data limitation at the gauge station of malkhed the calibration and validation periods were chosen as 1990 2007 and 2008 2013 respectively fig 1 sub stream wise calibration was carried out first the model was calibrated at wadkabal gauge station followed by malkhed and yadgir gauge stations the model was then calibrated at t r puram gauge station followed by mantralayam and keesar gauge stations finally the model was calibrated at wadenapally which is on the main stream of the krishna river basin 2 5 selection criteria of climate model the rainfall analysis of krishna river basin was carried out using both observed and historical climate model data of ten available climate models from cordex south asia data base compared mean ismr of historical data of these ten models with observed data imd based on their relative error top six models miroc miroc5 noaa gfdl gfdl esm2m cnrm cerfacs cnrm cm5 ncc noresm1 m ipsl cm5a mr and iches ec earth were selected for further analysis fig a1 the use of rcms driven by gcms in regional studies is known as dynamic downscaling trzaska and schnarr 2014 the rcms are able to represent atmospheric and landscape processes better than gcms because of its higher resolutions however bias correction of these models is needed in regional studies brown et al 2008 because of dynamical downscaling assumptions and caveats thus distribution mapping bias correction method was used to reduce the uncertainty associated with the climate model data as it can cope up with non stationary conditions teutschbein et al 2012 this method matches the distribution functions of observations and rcm simulated climate model values by correcting the distribution function of rcm simulated climate model values using transfer function gamma distribution function eq 1 with shape factor α and scale factor β are used for the precipitation during bias correction the shape factor α controls the profile distribution and scale factor β determines the dispersion of gamma distribution thom 1958 2 f γ x α β x α 1 1 β α γ α e x β x 0 α β 0 the gaussian distribution cramér 2016 with location parameter μ and scale parameter α is used for temperature time series eq 2 the detailed description of this method was given by teutschbein and seibert 2012 3 f n x μ σ 2 x α 1 1 σ 2 π ⅇ x μ 2 2 σ 2 x r during the months of june to october were selected for further analysis based on their contribution to total rainfall 86 the model was selection based on the following criteria 2 5 1 taylor diagram it is used to graphically quantify the similarity between two patterns observed and modelled data in terms of their correlation centered root mean square difference rms and amplitude of their variations standard deviations taylor 2001 statistics of six climate models were computed and the closeness of the model simulated rainfall and observed rainfall was seen fig a2 2 5 2 statistical performance of the models statistical parameters such as the root mean square error rmse mean error me mean absolute error mae mean square error mse correlation coefficient r percent bias pbias standard deviation ratio rsr kling gupta efficiency kge and relative error were used in the model selection as reported in table 1 2 5 3 extreme event analysis the five climate models were used to compare the historical rainfall data with observed data for the number of extreme events the rainfall events were classified as severe drought deficiency of ismr more than 50 moderate drought deficiency of ismr between 26 50 dry years deficiency of ismr between 15 25 normal years ismr between 15 to 15 wet years excess of ismr between 15 25 excess rainfall excess of ismr between 26 50 extreme rainfall excess of ismr more than 50 the extreme events are defined as those events which come in the categories of severe drought moderate drought excess rainfall and extreme rainfall 3 results and discussions 3 1 climate model selection the six climate models iches ec earth noaa gfdl gfdl esm2m miroc miroc5 ncc noresm1 m ipsl cm5a mr and cnrm cerfacs cnrm cm5 projected the mean annual rainfall of historic climate data 1981 2005 to vary from 641 to 1022 mm as against the observed rainfall value of 744 mm similarly the mean ismr june to october rainfall of the historic climate data was projected to be between 460 620 mm as against observed value of 647 mm hence bias correction was adopted which reduced the projected mean annual rainfall to 787 853 mm and mean ismr to 681 741 mm respectively indicating a significant reduction in the model bias from the taylor diagram the model cnrm cm5 showed a better statistical relationship with the observed data than the other models as evident by the pattern correlation centered root mean square rms difference and standard deviation values of 0 179 240 and 183 respectively fig a2 in terms of statistical performance cnrm cm5 and noresm 1 m models showed a better performance with the observed data in comparison to the other models table 1 as far as the extreme events is concerned the model cnrm cm5 projected similar results as of the observed data table 2 from the above results it was evident that the models cnrm cm5 and noresm1m gave closer predictions to the observed data however the model noresm 1m was unable to capture the extreme events as observed therefore the cnrm cm5 climate model was selected for further analysis in this study however to understand the uncertainty in the projected future climate multi model projections were considered in this study 3 2 temperature analysis the actual mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 27 32 97 and 21 06 c respectively over krishna basin 1984 2013 were closely projected by the cnrm cm5 model as 27 32 93 and 21 1 c respectively after bias correction similarly the actual mean monthly minimum and maximum temperatures of 15 65 and 38 96 c respectively were closely projected by the cnrm cm5 model as 15 53 and 39 c the climate model cnrm cm5 projected an increasing trend in the mean monthly minimum and maximum temperatures of the krishna river basin under future scenarios an increase of 1 67 and 1 53 c under rcp 4 5 scenario and of 2 57 and 2 5 c under rcp 8 5 scenario for the same was projected with reference to the baseline scenario by the end of 21st century the climate model also projected an increasing trend in the average annual temperature in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios an increase of 0 5 1 05 1 44 c with reference to the baseline under rcp 4 5 scenario for the early mid and end centuries respectively while rcp 8 5 scenario the increase was 0 61 1 48 2 6 c respectively fig 4 3 3 calibration and validation of the model sensitivity analysis was performed by using latin hypercube and one factor at a time lh oat sampling methods van griensven and meixner 2006 in swat cup to identify the sensitive parameters that can significantly influence the model output setegn et al 2008 in this study 15 were parameters were considered for the sensitivity analysis and the model was run for 1000 iterations at each gauge station during calibration the larger absolute t stat and lower p value indicate higher sensitivity the t stat identifies the relative significance while p value determines the significance of sensitivity based on sensitivity analysis twelve parameters were identified as effective cn2 rchrg dp gwrevap sol k gwdelay ch k2 ch n2 alpha bnk revapmn alpha bf gwqmn and esco as shown in fig 5 the initial values of ch k2 ch n2 and alpha bnk were 0 0 014 and 0 and final values were 11 74 0 082 and 0 26 respectively initial and final values of the other parameters corresponding to the particular land use land cover types were shown in table 3 to evaluate the accuracy of the model coefficient of regression r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used as objective functions r2 and nse values greater than 0 5 indicate satisfactory results ghoraba 2015 liew et al 2007 the r2 and nse values were found to vary from 0 6 0 8 and 0 58 0 79 respectively for calibration and from 0 69 0 83 and 0 54 0 84 respectively for validation table 4 indicating satisfactory results in all the gauge stations the influence of reservoirs and water storage structures were not considered which may be a limitation of this study it is also observed that the reservoirs were influencing the model calibration and validation results the gauge stations which are free from the reservoirs malkhed and keesar has better results than other gauge stations which are influenced by reservoirs wadkbal yadgir mantralayam t r puram and wadenapalli even though the statistical values were found to be within permissible limits the calibrated model was unable to capture a few peaks due to the detention and spilling of reservoirs at the gauge stations figs 6 and 7 the p factor and r factor are also used to quantify the model performance the p value closer to one and r value closer to zero indicates the best fit the p factor represents the percentage of measured data bracketed by 95ppu varies from zero to one the r factor is the ratio of average with of the band to the standard deviation of measured variables varies from zero to infinity the value of less than one is desirable abbaspour 2013 the values of p factor and r factor in table 4 indicates satisfactory results 3 4 analysis of water balance components under future scenarios the water balance components rainfall surface runoff evapotranspiration and water yield were quantified using swat model with the exception of rainfall data which was sourced from imd india baseline scenario historical climate data was considered as the reference for evaluation of future scenarios the cnrm cm5 model with rcp 4 5 scenario projected a 13 7 and 2 decrease in the long term mean ismr rainfall in the early 2009 2040 mid 2044 2070 and end centuries 2074 2100 respectively this decreasing trend of rainfall was not uniform for the entire season the long term mean rainfall values for the months of june july and september were projected to decrease by 47 59 and 44 mm respectively for the early mid and end centuries in contrast rainfall in the month of october was projected to increase by 22 45 and 17 mm respectively for the early mid and end centuries while using rcp 8 5 scenario the long term mean ismr was projected to decrease by 14 in the early century and increase by 6 5 and 22 for mid and end centuries overall individual rainfall was found to decrease more than the mean for the months from june to september whereas it was found to increase in the month of october 39 and 63 mm more than the mean for early and mid centuries respectively for the end century rainfall in the month of september was projected to decrease by 38 mm from the mean while it was projected to increase by 25 mm from the mean for the month of october an increasing trend of rainfall was projected for the month of november throughout the early mid and end centuries rcp 4 5 and 8 5 indicating that the variation of rainfall under future scenarios was non uniform varying on a monthly basis an increase in rainfall for the months of october and november and a shift in the occurrence of maximum surface runoff were the key projections from the model run while the maximum surface runoff was observed in the month of september as per the baseline scenario it was projected to occur in the month of august for the early and end centuries and in october for the mid century as per rcp 4 5 scenario rcp 8 5 scenario projected the maximum surface runoff to occur in the months of august october and june months for early mid and end centuries respectively figs 8 and 9 the shift in the occurrence of the maximum surface runoff can be attributed mainly due to the changes in the temporal variation of rainfall over the basin the timing and strength of monsoon depend mainly on the land sea thermal contrast which in turn affects the atmospheric moisture content indian sub continent sea surface temperature increased more rapidly than the land surface temperature thus reducing the land sea thermal contrast hence weakening the monsoon rainfall mishra et al 2012 rajeevan et al 2008 roxy 2017 this leads to a change in the atmospheric moisture content along with the timing and magnitude of rainfall over the region leading to early onset dates and delayed retreating days the lengthening of indian monsoon rainfall may be the reason behind the increasing rainfall in the months of october and november resulting in a decrease in rainfall in the monsoon season and a shift in maximum surface runoff under future scenarios these results indicate a varibility of rainfall and streamflow over the basin under future scenarios in this study water balance components such as the mean surface runoff water yield and et were projected to decrease by 6 8 11 and 9 respectively from the baseline under rcp 4 5 scenario and by 4 8 9 6 and 11 5 respectively under rcp 8 5 scenario for the early century for the mid century 2044 2070 the surface runoff and water yield were projected to increase by 20 and 6 8 respectively under rcp 4 5 scenario and by 39 and 29 respectively under 8 5 scenario no variations were projected for the et by rcp 4 5 scenario but a 1 increase was projected in the same using rcp 8 5 scenario for the end century the mean surface runoff water yield and et were projected to increase by 64 6 56 2 and 11 6 using rcp 8 5 scenario and by 22 4 10 and 7 3 under rcp 4 5 scenario table 5 these results indicate that the surface runoff and water yield were more sensitive to climate change i e changes in rainfall than evapotranspiration mishra and lilhare 2016 projected a contionous increasing trend of water balance components along with rainfall and air temperature in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios of cmip5 models in the krishna river basin rainfall increase of about 8 20 under rcp 4 5 and 10 40 in the case of rcp 8 5 by the end century similarly the surface runoff streamflow and et were projected increase of about 20 55 20 60 and 4 9 under rcp 4 5 and 35 120 40 120 and 2 8 in case rcp 8 5 by the end century 3 5 analysis of extreme events under future scenarios cnrm cm5 the hydrological regimes of the krishna river basin was found to be sensitive to climate change the maximum and minimum ismr over the krishna basin were 1440 mm and 360 mm respectively under rcp 4 5 scenario and 1353 mm and 320 mm for rcp 8 5 scenario respectively fig a3 the number of extreme events in both observed and historical data cnrm cm5 were almost similar to the early century predictions under rcp 4 5 scenario however in the mid and end centuries the number of normal years followed a decreasing trend and the extreme events especially moderate drought followed an increasing trend prediction using rcp 8 5 scenario showed different trends for each timeline in the early century the number of normal years was projected to decrease and the extreme events especially moderate drought were projected to increase 40 of the years in the early century were projected to be moderate drought years under rcp 8 5 scenario a severe drought in the year 2027 was also projected in the early century the mid century predictions followed a different scenario than that of the early century the number of normal years projected were almost similar to the historical data but the number of excess and extreme rainfall events were projected to increase the end century predictions revealed that excess and extreme rainfall events comprise 45 of the years table 6 rcp 8 5 scenario projected the occurrence of continuous excess and extreme rainfall events between 2088 2094 fig 10 attributed to an increasing atmospheric humidity and saturation water vapor pressure under a warmer climate it was evident that irrespective of the scenario there were significant changes in the extreme events in the future 3 6 multi model projections multi model projections were used to understand the uncertainties in the projected future climate the relative change between observed imd and historical climate models rainfall projections were between 8 17 fig 11 the cnrm cm5 projections were closer to the mean of six climate models except in the end century table 7 in the early century all models projected a decrease in rainfall and water balance components except ipsl cm5a mr and noresm 1 m fig 11 a and b with respective to their long term historical mean whereas in mid and end centuries the projections are vary with the models fig 11 the uncertainty range of these climate models are between gfdl esm 2 m and ipsl cm5a mr projections the gfdl esm2m projected a decrease in rainfall under future scenarios while ipsl cm5a mr projected an increase of rainfall fig 11 the figs 12 and 13 shows the changes in projected mean minimum and maximum along with outliers values of surface runoff and water yield for climate models with reference to historical data 3 6 1 extreme events under multi model projections the maximum and minimum ismr june to october over the krishna basin were 1981 mm with ipsl cm5a mr in 2099 and 124 mm with ichec ec earth in 2030 respectively under rcp 4 5 scenario fig a4 whereas rcp 8 5 scenario projected maximum of 2382 mm with ipsl cm5a mr in 2082 and minimum of 96 mm with gfdl esm 2 m in 2035 fig a5 the extreme events projected to increase in future scenarios the early century projected an increase of drought events due to a decrease of mean ismr in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scearios whereas an increase of wet events was projected in mid and end centuries especially the extreme rainfall events were projected to increse in end century under rcp 8 5 while in case of rcp 4 5 the drought and extreme rainfall events are likely to occur in equal probability figs 14 and 15 the maximum and minimum water yield june to october over the krishna basin was 1336 mm with ipsl cm5a mr in 2099 and 7 mm with noresm 1 m in 2044 respectively under rcp 4 5 scenario fig a6 whereas rcp 8 5 scenario projected maximum of 1705 mm with ipsl cm5a mr in 2082 and minimum of 14 mm with gfdl esm 2 m in 2035 fig a7 the mean water yield projected to decrese in early century in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scearios while in case of mid and end centuries the mean water yield was projected to increase there is an increase in the mean of about 1 5 times to the long term mean historical water yield by the end century under rcp 8 5 figs a6 and a7 4 conclusions in this study water balance components such as surface runoff water yield and evapotranspiration were simulated under future climate scenarios using both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the climate model cnrm cm5 projected a decreasing trend of rainfall under rcp 4 5 scenario whereas under rcp 8 5 scenario it predicts a decrease of rainfall in early century and increasing trend for the mid and end centuries for an early century the rainfall surface runoff water yield and et were followed a decreasing trend in both the scenarios rcp 4 5 and 8 5 for the mid century the surface runoff and water yield were projected to increase under 4 5 and 8 5 scenario no variations were projected for the et by rcp 4 5 scenario but a slight increase was projected in the same using rcp 8 5 scenario for the end century the mean annual surface runoff water yield and et were projected to increase in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the extension of monsoon rainfall even up to october shift in the occurrence of the maximum amount of long term mean ismr and maximum surface runoff along with an increasing trend of rainfall in the months of october and november were the key projections from the model run the increase in rainfall in the months of october november has adverse impact on kharif crops as it is a crop harvesting stage the climate model projected a few extreme rainfall events in a non monsoon season and also the frequencies of extreme weather events are more under the future climate scenarios finally siginificent changes were projected in the extreme events in all the scenarios in consideration of future projected climate changes it was necessary to change water management strategies in the basin for sustainable planning and management of water resources rainwater harvesting systems have to be implimented to tap the surplus runoff in the respective months and to supply for the need of demand because these months were crucial for kharif crops further the results may improve by including the effect of reservoirs and dynamic land changes on the basin conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

climate change ismr krishna river basin extreme rainfall events swat model 1 introduction water plays a vital role in the survival of human beings and other living things it is an essential commodity for economic growth development of agriculture activities and industries however it has become a scarce resource because of increasing population and industrialization prajnya and tuppad 2016 to overcome the future water stress sustainable water resources management is essential from the regional to national scales shrestha and htut 2016 vu et al 2016 further changes in climate events and weather extremes have had a significant impact on natural water resources various studies indicate climate extreme events are increasing in the future because of changes in intense rainfall events and abruptly high and low temperatures easterling et al 2000 mukherjee et al 2018 therefore the changes in the frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts or floods could affect the water availability human health quality of water resources agricultural production and environmental conditions jiang et al 2007 karl 2008 mishra et al 2016 thus investigating these impacts on the hydrological regime is crucial for mitigating the adverse effects of extreme weather events hydrological models have been used to evaluate the climate change impacts on the hydrological regimes these tools help to estimate various hydrological parameters such as runoff evapotranspiration et potential evapotranspiration pet and water yield etc in its regime estimation of these parameters and selection of models are crucial for evaluating the impact of present and future climate mishra et al 2008 swat model has been selected for quantifying the hydrological parameters under present and

navarro et al 2016 singh and gosain 2012 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2006 2015 zierl and bugmann 2005 the krishna river basin india was selected as study area due to its semi arid nature and vulnerability to climate change owing to the erratic distribution of rainfall along with warmer climatic conditions few studies have been conducted to analyse the climate change impact on water resources of the krishna river basin however these studies use the greenhouse gas ghg and special report on emissions scenarios sres scenarios which carry an enormous uncertainty in the assumption of factors such as economic development population growth and developed technology soro et al 2017 for instance using the ghg scenario gosain et al 2006 concluded the krishna basin to experience regular or seasonal water stressed conditions in future due to a decrease of precipitation and water yield kulkarni et al 2014 projected an increasing trend in annual precipitation surface runoff water yield and actual evapotranspiration in future 2041 70 displaying no significant changes in these parameters in the early century 2011 40 using the sres scenario in both these studies a single gcm data was used without any bias correction while performing calibration at the only one gauge station mishra and lilhare 2016 projected an increasing trend of water balance components along with rainfall and

model selection based on the performance of the model with reference to observed data in this study the rainfall extremes under future climate scenarios of the krishna river basin india were analysed downscaled and bias corrected climate models with medium rcp 4 5 and high emission rcp 8 5 scenarios were used to improve future predictions and the model performance which was carried out by multi

telangana and maharashtra covering a total geographic area of 2 58 948 km2 and flows over a length of 1400 km a major part of this basin lies on basaltic and crystalline rocks having low yield potentials while the delta regions have alluvium sediments having high yield potential the major soil types are black soils alluvium red soils mixed soils saline and alkaline soils and laterite soils most of the area in this basin belongs to a semi arid region with agricultural land covering about 76 of the total area nraa 2011 the annual average rainfall of the basin is about 780 mm and 90 of it occurs during monsoon june october some parts of andhra pradesh karnataka and maharashtra are drought prone areas whereas the delta region is subjected to flooding http india wris nrsc gov in 2 2 soil

and minimum and maximum temperatures 0 5 0 5 were used as weather inputs for the model obtained from indian meteorological department imd pune india pai et al 2014 the other required data such as solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were autogenerated by the swat in build weather generator the climate data for the historic 1970 2005 and future scenarios 2006 2100 were obtained from earth system grid federation esgf https esg dn1 nsc liu se i e cordex south asia database mishra et al 2014 reported that due to low bias and uncertainty best gcms may perform better than cordex rcms and their host gcms in hydrological applications which are attributed to intermodal variations thus for using rcms bias correction has to be carried out for regional studies or hydrological applications brown et al 2008 mishra et al 2014 teutschbein and seibert 2012 however in western ghat regions the cordex rcms may perform better than cmip5 models because of their ability to resolve orographic and topographic precipitation mishra et al 2014 since the krishna river basin receives ample amount of rainfall from western ghat regions average annual rainfall over 2500 mm gumma et al 2011 in this study cordex rcms were used instead of cmip5 models data from six climate models iches ec earth noaa gfdl gfdl esm2m miroc miroc5 ncc noresm1 m ipsl cm5a mr and cnrm cerfacs cnrm cm5 were used comprising of high resolution 0 5 0 5 climate data with rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios stabilize the radiative force at 4 5 and 8 5 w m2 based on assumptions of

developed for calibration and validation of swat model abbaspour et al 2015 to minimize the uncertainty associated with model predictions the calibration and validation of the model were carried out based on the observed streamflow data by using the sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup abbaspour et al 2015 ghoraba 2015 yang et al 2008 the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were also carried out to get the better correlation between simulated and observed data the multi gauge calibration and validation of the model were carried out the observed streamflow data at various gauge stations of krishna basin were collected from the central water commission goi hyderabad and analysed the variation of observed average monthly discharge in the krishna river basin over a period of 31 years 1984 2013 is shown in fig 3 the large streamflows occurred in july august and september in kurundwad and huvinhedigi gauge stations were due to heavy rainfall in the western ghats in the months of june july august as vijayawada gauge station lies near the outlet of the krishna basin it receives heavy flows in months of july august and september the presence of reservoirs may cause the delay in the flows in this gauge station from the available streamflow data the model was calibrated for a period of 22 years 1983 2004 and validated for a period of 8 years 2006 2013 at the gauge stations of wadakbal wadenapally keesar yadgir matralayam and t ramapuram due to data limitation at the gauge station of malkhed the calibration and validation periods were chosen as 1990 2007 and 2008 2013 respectively fig 1 sub stream wise calibration was carried out first the model was calibrated at wadkabal gauge station followed by malkhed and yadgir gauge stations the model was then calibrated at t r puram gauge station followed by mantralayam and keesar gauge stations finally the model was calibrated at wadenapally which is on the main stream of the krishna river basin 2 5 selection criteria of climate model the rainfall analysis of krishna river basin was carried out using both observed and historical climate model data of ten available climate models from cordex south asia data base compared mean ismr of historical data of these ten models with observed data imd based on their relative error top six models miroc miroc5 noaa gfdl gfdl esm2m cnrm cerfacs cnrm cm5 ncc noresm1 m ipsl cm5a mr and iches ec earth were selected for further analysis fig a1 the use of rcms driven by gcms in regional studies is known as dynamic downscaling trzaska and schnarr 2014 the rcms are able to represent atmospheric and landscape processes better than gcms because of its higher resolutions however bias correction of these models is needed in regional studies brown et al 2008 because of dynamical downscaling assumptions and caveats thus distribution mapping bias correction method was used to reduce the uncertainty associated with the climate model data as it can cope up with non stationary conditions teutschbein et al 2012 this method matches the distribution functions of observations and rcm simulated climate model values by correcting the distribution function of rcm simulated climate model values using transfer function gamma distribution function eq 1 with shape factor α and scale factor β are used for the precipitation during bias correction the shape factor α controls the profile distribution and scale factor β determines the dispersion of gamma distribution thom 1958 2 f γ x α β x α 1 1 β α γ α e x β x 0 α β 0 the gaussian distribution cramér 2016 with

2 2 σ 2 x r during the months of june to october were selected for further analysis based on their contribution to total rainfall 86 the model was selection based on the following criteria 2 5 1 taylor diagram it is used to graphically quantify the similarity between two patterns observed and modelled data in terms of their correlation centered root mean square difference rms and amplitude of their variations standard deviations taylor 2001 statistics of six climate models were computed and the closeness of the model simulated rainfall and observed rainfall was seen fig a2 2 5 2 statistical performance of the models statistical parameters such as the root mean square error rmse mean error me mean absolute error mae mean square error mse correlation coefficient r percent bias pbias standard deviation ratio rsr kling gupta efficiency kge and relative error were used in the model selection as reported in table 1 2 5 3 extreme event analysis the five climate models were used to compare the historical rainfall data with observed data for the number of extreme events the rainfall events were classified as severe drought deficiency of ismr more than 50 moderate drought deficiency of ismr between 26 50 dry years deficiency of ismr between 15 25 normal years ismr between 15 to 15 wet years excess of ismr between 15 25 excess rainfall excess of ismr between 26 50 extreme rainfall excess of ismr more than 50 the extreme events are defined as those events which come in the categories of severe drought moderate drought excess rainfall and extreme rainfall 3 results and discussions 3 1 climate model selection the six climate models iches ec earth noaa gfdl gfdl esm2m miroc miroc5 ncc noresm1 m ipsl cm5a mr and cnrm cerfacs cnrm cm5 projected the mean annual rainfall of historic climate data 1981 2005 to vary from 641 to 1022 mm as against the observed rainfall value of 744 mm similarly the mean ismr june to october rainfall of the historic climate data was projected to be between 460 620 mm as against observed value of 647 mm hence bias correction was adopted which reduced the projected mean annual rainfall to 787 853 mm and mean ismr to 681 741 mm respectively indicating a significant reduction in the model bias from the taylor diagram the model cnrm cm5 showed a better statistical relationship with the observed data than the other models as evident by the pattern correlation centered root mean square rms difference and standard deviation values of 0 179 240 and 183 respectively fig a2 in terms of statistical performance cnrm cm5 and noresm 1 m models showed a better performance with the observed data in comparison to the other models table 1 as far as the extreme events is concerned the model cnrm cm5 projected similar results as of the observed data table 2 from the above results it was evident that the models cnrm cm5 and noresm1m gave closer predictions to the observed data however the model noresm 1m was unable to capture the extreme events as observed therefore the cnrm cm5 climate model was selected for further analysis in this study however to understand the uncertainty in the projected future climate multi model projections were considered in this study 3 2 temperature analysis the actual mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 27 32 97 and 21 06 c respectively over krishna basin 1984 2013 were closely projected by the cnrm cm5 model as 27 32 93 and 21 1 c respectively after bias correction similarly the actual mean monthly minimum and maximum temperatures of 15 65 and 38 96 c respectively were closely projected by the cnrm cm5 model as 15 53 and 39 c the climate model cnrm cm5 projected an increasing trend in the mean monthly minimum and maximum temperatures of the krishna river basin under future scenarios an increase of 1 67 and 1 53 c under rcp 4 5 scenario and of 2 57 and 2 5 c under rcp 8 5 scenario for the same was projected with reference to the baseline scenario by the end of 21st century the climate model also projected an increasing trend in the average annual temperature in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios an increase of 0 5 1 05 1 44 c with reference to the baseline under rcp 4 5 scenario for the early mid and end centuries respectively while rcp 8 5 scenario the increase was 0 61 1 48 2 6 c respectively fig 4 3 3 calibration and validation of the model sensitivity analysis was performed by using latin hypercube and one factor at a time lh oat sampling methods van griensven and meixner 2006 in swat cup to identify the sensitive parameters that can significantly influence the model output setegn et al 2008 in this study 15 were parameters were considered for the sensitivity analysis and the model was run for 1000 iterations at each gauge station during calibration the larger absolute t stat and lower p value indicate higher sensitivity the t stat identifies the relative significance while p value determines the significance of sensitivity based on sensitivity analysis twelve parameters were identified as effective cn2 rchrg dp gwrevap sol k gwdelay ch k2 ch n2 alpha bnk revapmn alpha bf gwqmn and esco as shown in fig 5 the initial values of ch k2 ch n2 and alpha bnk were 0 0 014 and 0 and final values were 11 74 0 082 and 0 26 respectively initial and final values of the other parameters corresponding to the particular land use land cover types were shown in table 3 to evaluate the accuracy of the model coefficient of regression r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used as objective functions r2 and nse values greater than 0 5 indicate satisfactory results ghoraba 2015 liew et al 2007 the r2 and nse values were found to vary from 0 6 0 8 and 0 58 0 79 respectively for calibration and from 0 69 0 83 and 0 54 0 84 respectively for validation table 4 indicating satisfactory results in all the gauge stations the influence of reservoirs and water storage structures were not considered which may be a limitation of this study it is also observed that the reservoirs were influencing the model calibration and validation results the gauge stations which are free from the reservoirs malkhed and keesar has better results than other gauge stations which are influenced by reservoirs wadkbal yadgir mantralayam t r puram and wadenapalli even though the statistical values were found to be within permissible limits the calibrated model was unable to capture a few peaks due to the detention and spilling of reservoirs at the gauge stations figs 6 and 7 the p factor and r factor are also used to quantify the model performance the p value closer to one and r value closer to zero indicates the best fit the p factor represents the percentage of measured data bracketed by 95ppu varies from zero to one the r factor is the ratio of average with of the band to the standard deviation of measured variables varies from zero to infinity the value of less than one is desirable abbaspour 2013 the values of p factor and r factor in table 4 indicates satisfactory results 3 4 analysis of water balance components under future scenarios the water balance components rainfall surface runoff evapotranspiration and water yield were quantified using swat model with the exception of rainfall data which was sourced from imd india baseline scenario historical climate data was considered as the reference for evaluation of future scenarios the cnrm cm5 model with rcp 4 5 scenario projected a 13 7 and 2 decrease in the long term mean ismr rainfall in the early 2009 2040 mid 2044 2070 and end centuries 2074 2100 respectively this decreasing trend of rainfall was not uniform for the entire season the long term mean rainfall values for the months of june july and september were projected to decrease by 47 59 and 44 mm respectively for the early mid and end centuries in contrast rainfall in the month of october was projected to increase by 22 45 and 17 mm respectively for the early mid and end centuries while using rcp 8 5 scenario the long term mean ismr was projected to decrease by 14 in the early century and increase by 6 5 and 22 for mid and end centuries overall individual rainfall was found to decrease more than the mean for the months from june to september whereas it was found to increase in the month of october 39 and 63 mm more than the mean for early and mid centuries respectively for the end century rainfall in the month of september was projected to decrease by 38 mm from the mean while it was projected to increase by 25 mm from the mean for the month of october an increasing trend of rainfall was projected for the month of november throughout the early mid and end centuries rcp 4 5 and 8 5 indicating that the variation of rainfall under future scenarios was non uniform varying on a monthly basis an increase in rainfall for the months of october and november and a shift in the occurrence of maximum surface runoff were the key projections from the model run while the maximum surface runoff was observed in the month of september as per the baseline scenario it was projected to occur in the month of august for the early and end centuries and in october for the mid century as per rcp 4 5 scenario rcp 8 5 scenario projected the maximum surface runoff to occur in the months of august october and june months for early mid and end centuries respectively figs 8 and 9 the shift in the occurrence of the maximum surface runoff can be attributed mainly due to the changes in the temporal variation of rainfall over the basin the timing and strength of monsoon depend mainly on the land sea thermal contrast which in turn affects the atmospheric moisture content indian sub continent sea surface temperature increased more rapidly than the land surface temperature thus reducing the land sea thermal contrast hence weakening the monsoon rainfall mishra et al 2012 rajeevan et al 2008 roxy 2017 this leads to a change in the atmospheric moisture content along with the timing and magnitude of rainfall over the region leading to early onset dates and delayed retreating days the lengthening of indian monsoon rainfall may be the reason behind the increasing rainfall in the months of october and november resulting in a decrease in rainfall in the monsoon season and a shift in maximum surface runoff under future scenarios these results indicate a varibility of rainfall and streamflow over the basin under future scenarios in this study water balance components such as the mean surface runoff water yield and et were projected to decrease by 6 8 11 and 9 respectively from the baseline under rcp 4 5 scenario and by 4 8 9 6 and 11 5 respectively under rcp 8 5 scenario for the early century for the mid century 2044 2070 the surface runoff and water yield were projected to increase by 20 and 6 8 respectively under rcp 4 5 scenario and by 39 and 29 respectively under 8 5 scenario no variations were projected for the et by rcp 4 5 scenario but a 1 increase was projected in the same using rcp 8 5 scenario for the end century the mean surface runoff water yield and et were projected to increase by 64 6 56 2 and 11 6 using rcp 8 5 scenario and by 22 4 10 and 7 3 under rcp 4 5 scenario table 5 these results indicate that the surface runoff and water yield were more sensitive to climate change i e changes in rainfall than evapotranspiration mishra and lilhare 2016 projected a contionous increasing trend of water balance components along with rainfall and air temperature in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios of cmip5 models in the krishna river basin rainfall increase of about 8 20 under rcp 4 5 and 10 40 in the case of rcp 8 5 by the end century similarly the surface runoff streamflow and et were projected increase of about 20 55 20 60 and 4 9 under rcp 4 5 and 35 120 40 120 and 2 8 in case rcp 8 5 by the end century 3 5 analysis of extreme events under future scenarios cnrm cm5 the hydrological regimes of the krishna river basin was found to be sensitive to climate change the maximum and minimum ismr over the krishna basin were 1440 mm and 360 mm respectively under rcp 4 5 scenario and 1353 mm and 320 mm for rcp 8 5 scenario respectively fig a3 the number of extreme events in both observed and historical data cnrm cm5 were almost similar to the early century predictions under rcp 4 5 scenario however in the mid and end centuries the number of normal years followed a decreasing trend and the extreme events especially moderate drought followed an increasing trend prediction using rcp 8 5 scenario showed different trends for each timeline in the early century the number of normal years was projected to decrease and the extreme events especially moderate drought were projected to increase 40 of the years in the early century were projected to be moderate drought years under rcp 8 5 scenario a severe drought in the year 2027 was also projected in the early century the mid century predictions followed a different scenario than that of the early century the number of normal years projected were almost similar to the historical data but the number of excess and extreme rainfall events were projected to increase the end century predictions revealed that excess and extreme rainfall events comprise 45 of the years table 6 rcp 8 5 scenario projected the occurrence of continuous excess and extreme rainfall events between 2088 2094 fig 10 attributed to an increasing atmospheric humidity and saturation water vapor pressure under a warmer climate it was evident that irrespective of the scenario there were significant changes in the extreme events in the future 3 6 multi model projections multi model projections were used to understand the uncertainties in the projected future climate the relative change between observed imd and historical climate models rainfall projections were between 8 17 fig 11 the cnrm cm5 projections were closer to the mean of six climate models except in the end century table 7 in the early century all models projected a decrease in rainfall and water balance components except ipsl cm5a mr and noresm 1 m fig 11 a and b with respective to their long term historical mean whereas in mid and end centuries the projections are vary with the models fig 11 the uncertainty range of these climate models are between gfdl esm 2 m and ipsl cm5a mr projections the gfdl esm2m projected a decrease in rainfall under future scenarios while ipsl cm5a mr projected an increase of rainfall fig 11 the figs 12 and 13 shows the changes in projected mean minimum and maximum along with outliers values of surface runoff and water yield for climate models with reference to historical data 3 6 1 extreme events under multi model projections the maximum and minimum ismr june to october over the krishna basin were 1981 mm with ipsl cm5a mr in 2099 and 124 mm with ichec ec earth in 2030 respectively under rcp 4 5 scenario fig a4 whereas rcp 8 5 scenario projected maximum of 2382 mm with ipsl cm5a mr in 2082 and minimum of 96 mm with gfdl esm 2 m in 2035 fig a5 the extreme events projected to increase in future scenarios the early century projected an increase of drought events due to a decrease of mean ismr in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scearios whereas an increase of wet events was projected in mid and end centuries especially the extreme rainfall events were projected to increse in end century under rcp 8 5 while in case of rcp 4 5 the drought and extreme rainfall events are likely to occur in equal probability figs 14 and 15 the maximum and minimum water yield june to october over the krishna basin was 1336 mm with ipsl cm5a mr in 2099 and 7 mm with noresm 1 m in 2044 respectively under rcp 4 5 scenario fig a6 whereas rcp 8 5 scenario projected maximum of 1705 mm with ipsl cm5a mr in 2082 and minimum of 14 mm with gfdl esm 2 m in 2035 fig a7 the mean water yield projected to decrese in early century in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scearios while in case of mid and end centuries the mean water yield was projected to increase there is an increase in the mean of about 1 5 times to the long term mean historical water yield by the end century under rcp 8 5 figs a6 and a7 4 conclusions in this study water balance components such as surface runoff water yield and evapotranspiration were simulated under future climate scenarios using both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the climate model cnrm cm5 projected a decreasing trend of rainfall under rcp 4 5 scenario whereas under rcp 8 5 scenario it predicts a decrease of rainfall in early century and increasing trend for the mid and end centuries for an early century the rainfall surface runoff water yield and et were followed a decreasing trend in both the scenarios rcp 4 5 and 8 5 for the mid century the surface runoff and water yield were projected to increase under 4 5 and 8 5 scenario no variations were projected for the et by rcp 4 5 scenario but a slight increase was projected in the same using rcp 8 5 scenario for the end century the mean annual surface runoff water yield and et were projected to increase in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the extension of monsoon rainfall even up to october shift in the occurrence of the maximum amount of long term mean ismr and maximum surface runoff along with an increasing trend of rainfall in the months of october and november were the key projections from the model run the increase in rainfall in the months of october november has adverse impact on kharif crops as it is a crop harvesting stage the climate model projected a few extreme rainfall events in a non monsoon season and also the frequencies of extreme weather events are more under the future climate scenarios finally siginificent changes were projected in the extreme events in all the scenarios in consideration of future projected climate changes it was necessary to change water management strategies in the basin for sustainable planning and management of water resources rainwater harvesting systems have to be implimented to tap the surplus runoff in the respective months and to supply for the need of demand because these months were crucial for kharif crops further the results may improve by including the effect of reservoirs and dynamic land changes on the basin conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

8496,study region iguatu experimental basin located in the semi arid region of northeastern brazil study focus the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of rainfall characteristics on throughfall stemflow and interception loss in a deciduous forest of a tropical semi arid region from a data series of eight consecutive years the data were collected from 2010 to 2017 comprising a total of 225 events new hydrological insights for the region among the variables used to characterize rainfall the maximum 30 min intensity i30 best explained the interception losses which is also well correlated to rainfall depth and event average intensity the predominant events 67 of the total are characterised by low rainfall depth low i30 and higher interception loss 18 of the gross rainfall in addition there is a threshold between rainfall characteristics and the interception process for rainfall and i30 lower than 20 mm and 15 mm h respectively and rainfall duration lower than 100 min interception losses are usually higher than 30 reaching up to 74 for the remaining events interception losses are mostly within the range of 10 20 of rainfall the data and information on the interception process presented in this study helps the comprehension of the overall water balance in dry environments and improve the capacity for parameterization of hydrological models contributing to a more efficient water and environmental management keywords rainfall classification rainfall characteristics throughfall stemflow semi arid region 1 introduction seasonally dry tropical forests

evaporation and decreasing the amount of water available for infiltration li et al 2013 a complete understanding of the water balance in these environments is therefore essential zhang et al 2016 interception losses in the semi arid regions of the world represent from 6 9 to 27 2 of the total precipitation pressland 1973 návar and bryan 1990 návar et al 1999 carlyle moses 2004 wang et al 2005 medeiros et al 2009 izidio et al 2013 sadeghi et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 this variability is dependent on the characteristics of the rainfall event toba and ohta 2005 owens et al 2006 staelens et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 and vegetation zhang et al 2009 li et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 fathizadeh et al 2017 therefore it can present site specific characteristics a good understanding of the hydrological dynamics between the characteristics of the rainfall and vegetation is essential in studies of interception loss in semi arid regions especially in deciduous forests this vegetation is characterised by a complete loss of leaves during the dry season santos et al 2012 due to this at the start of the rainy season the vegetation is completely without leaves which results in small losses from rainfall interception the emergence of leaf mass has a significant effect on the interception process modifying both redistribution by the tree and the throughfall sadeghi et al 2017 2018 the water retained by the leaf mass of the trees is eventually evaporated into the atmosphere arcova et al 2003 moura et al 2009 sadeghi et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the intercepted rainfall reaches the soil as throughfall and stemflow contributing to maintaining water availability in the root zone of the plants this process favours infiltration and increases soil moisture and deep percolation liu et al 2016 especially in periods of less rain pinheiro et al 2013 studies that detail the effect of temporal variability of rainfall events on interception loss are still rare and the few that exist present a short data series thus the present study aimed to evaluate the influence of rainfall characteristics rainfall depth event duration and rainfall intensity on throughfall stemflow and interception loss in a deciduous forest of a tropical semi arid region from a data series of eight consecutive years 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study was developed in the iguatu experimental basin pereira júnior et al 2016 santos et al 2017 a sub basin of the alto jaguaribe river basin located in the semi arid region of northeastern brazil between 6 23 40 to 6 23 44 s and 39 15 23 to 39 15 27 w fig 1 at an average altitude of 217 m the area belongs to the federal institute of education science and technology of ceará ifce and has a predominant vegetation of woody caatinga under regeneration for 39 years sdtf fig 2 a and b the climate of the region according to the köppen classification is type bsw h hot semi arid with an average monthly temperature always above 18 c during the coldest month the thornthwaite aridity index thornthwaite 1948 is 0 48 classifying the region as semi arid the mean reference potential evapotranspiration from 1961 to 2017 is 1829 5 mm year 1 based on the penman monteith fao methodology the mean historical rainfall for the district of iguatu is 883 303 mm historical series from 1927 to 2017 the region is characterised by two seasons a rainy season from january to june and a dry season from july to december fig 3 of the total annual rainfall 84 is concentrated during the rainy season with 43 of the events occurring during march and april the driest months are from august to november with only 1 of the total annual rainfall highlighting the high temporal variability of the precipitation 2 2 measurement of the rainfall and interception loss rainfall events throughfall and stemflow were collected for a period of eight consecutive years january 2010 to december 2017 rainfall data were obtained from an automatic weather station equipped with a bascule rain gauge with data acquisition every 5 min fig 2c the values for mean intensity i mm h 1 of the monitored events was calculated as well as for the maximum intensity at intervals of 5 10 15 20 30 45 and 60 min i5 to i60 mm h 1 the kinetic energy ke per mm of rain was calculated using the wischmeier and smith 1978 equation 1978 later modified by foster et al 1981 equation 1 1 k e 0 119 0 0873 l o g i where ke is the kinetic energy of the rainfall in mj ha 1 mm 1 and i is the rainfall intensity in mm h 1 from a total of 270 natural rainfall events only 225 events present intensity data due to measurement errors with the bascule gauge in the remaining 45 events the study site was also equipped with a ville de paris rain gauge fig 2d which served as a reference for the data from the bascule gauge the vegetation is deciduous with leaf loss during the dry season from july to december fig 2b from january to june with the start of the rains the vegetation recovers its leaves fig 2a the phytosociological survey carried out at the beginning of the study 2010 identified 164 tree like individuals with a circumference at breast height standard 1 30 m from the ground that varied from 11 to 82 cm the predominant height class of the individuals was 3 1 to 7 m and the diameter class was 3 to 6 cm the most abundant plant species are croton sonderianus muell arg mimosa caesalpiniifolia benth aspidosperma pyrifolium mart combretum leprosum mart and bauhinia cheilantha bong steud pereira júnior et al 2016 stemflow was measured in six tree like individuals fig 2e representing the six classes into which the individuals were divided according to stem perimeter to measure the throughfall ten rain gauges were installed distributed randomly under the vegetation fig 2f at a height of 1 30 m from the ground the rain gauges were repositioned every two weeks to ensure a uniform distribution of sampling sites against possible measurement bias the volume of throughfall accumulated over 24 h was converted to water depth in mm by dividing the volume of water in each rain gauge by its catchment area the arithmetic mean of the volumes collected by the ten rain gauges was calculated to obtain the representative throughfall for the experimental site stemflow representative of the entire area was estimated with equation 2 the volume of water collected in the container was measured for each rainfall event 2 s f i 1 n f i n i where sf estimated stemflow for each daily rainfall event mm n number of circumference classes fi stemflow of the tree representing class i ni number of trees of class i canopy interception loss for each rainfall event was calculated using eq 3 3 i p t f s f where i loss from interception mm p total rainfall mm tf throughfall measured under the vegetation mm sf stemflow mm 2 3 grouping of rainfall events the multivariate statistics model factor analysis principal component analysis fa pca was applied to identify and understand the rainfall characteristics that best explain the variability of the interception process the following variables were investigated rainfall depth mm kinetic energy mj ha 1 mm 1 average rainfall intensity mm h 1 rainfall duration minutes maximum intensity i5 i10 i15 i20 i30 i45 i60 mm h 1 and interception loss mm the number of factors was defined following the criterion that each factor must contain a variance greater than 1 eigenvalue one criterion this criterion is based on the idea that any factor must explain a variance greater than that shown by any single variable after definition of the correlation matrix it was found that the pca model was applicable to the data by the kaiser meyer olkin test kmo the model should be accepted if kmo 0 5 the matrix of the components obtained during the extraction phase where the result describes the relationship between the factors and the individual variables may be difficult to interpret depending on the arrangement of the variables in the significant factors in order to overcome this limitation rotation factor analysis is carried out which turns the matrix into one which is more easily interpreted dillon and goldstein 1984 between the two rotation models orthogonal and oblique the first was selected based on studies presented by omar et al 2016 sureshgandhi et al 2014 and andrade et al 2008 who used pca to evaluate temporal and spatial variation in water quality the varimax method was used which aims to minimise the contribution of variables with less significance in the factor with this method the variables come to have weights close to one or zero eliminating intermediate values which make it difficult to interpret the factors to verify the similarity of the rainfall events the events were divided into groups using the technique of multivariate analysis hierarchical group analysis hga based on rainfall depth mm rainfall duration minutes and maximum rainfall over 30 min i30 mm h 1 to reduce errors due to the scale and units of the variables the data were standardised dimensionless by the z score method the data for interception loss were analysed by the kruskal wallis test at 5 significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the rainfall events and interception losses the annual rainfall depth ranged from 460 to 1155 mm fig 4 a demonstrating the high temporal variability annual and between events of the rainfall regime in the region fig 4b the largest number of events 23 of the total and greatest rainfall depth were recorded in 2011 it should be noted that in that year april was the rainiest month with 491 mm fig 4c representing 42 5 of the total rainfall depth for the year in 2016 precipitation was 540 mm with 55 of the rainfall occurring in march fig 4c rainfall that occurs in the semi arid region is characterised by being concentrated over a short period as already discussed by guerreiro et al 2013 these results express the uncertainty of the water regime common in semi arid regions as verified by andrade et al 2016 although the mean annual interception varied from 10 9 to 18 6 during the period under analysis fig 4a for any one specific event the interception could be greater than 74 as found on 2 june 2010 fig 4d the results show fig 4a that studies of interception loss should not be carried out on an annual scale only since the percentage intercepted in 2017 528 mm was the same in 2011 1155 mm expressing the low correlation between these variables studies of interception should therefore be carried out per event considering not only rainfall depth but also event duration and the frequency and intensity of the rainfall zhang et al 2015 2016 3 2 selection of indicators for the interception process there is still no consensus concerning which of the maximum intensities i5 i10 i15 i20 i30 i45 i60 should be used in studies quantifying losses from plant interception medeiros et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 as a result it was decided to identify the intensities that show a positive and significant correlation p 0 001 with the interception losses by means of the correlation matrix table 1 in table 1 it can be seen that the intensities with the greatest weight were i60 and i45 which agrees with studies by zhang et al 2016 and medeiros et al 2009 furthermore these two intensities displayed the greatest correlation with rainfall depth from the correlation matrix it can be seen that interception loss i had the greatest correlation 0 73 p 0 001 with rainfall depth p the occurrence of significant weight between interception loss i and rainfall depth p suggests that in the absence of information on rainfall intensity the magnitude can be used to estimate interception loss reasonably well in the study area using simple regression the two rainfall characteristics with the least weight although significant p 0 001 were rainfall duration d and mean intensity iavg it is believed that the low weight of iavg 0 24 is due to the high temporal variability of the rainfall characteristics the best model using pca consisted of two components and explained 87 of the total data variance table 2 with a value for the kaiser meyer olkin test kmo of 0 88 these components cp1 and cp2 allow identification of the variables with the greatest interrelations in the formed component noting that the greatest factorial weights were attributed to i30 with a value equal to 0 98 followed by i20 i45 and i15 with values equal to 0 97 the second component was formed by the mean intensity and duration of the rainfall explaining 14 4 of the data variance and confirming the results seen with the correlation matrix the i30 best explains the interception losses in the study area with the same variable maximum intensity over 30 min providing greater explanation of the erosive processes lima et al 2013 santos et al 2017 3 3 grouping of rainfall events due to the high similarity between the weights of the variables i30 was selected as representative of cp1 and rainfall duration as representative of cp2 for defining similar groups of rainfall characteristics with the greatest inference for interception loss the use of hierarchical grouping analysis hga based on rainfall depth mm i30 mm h 1 and rainfall duration minutes yielded three distinct rainfall classes table 3 after the application of hga the values for interception loss corresponding to each rainfall class formed were verified table 3 class i grouped events of smaller rainfall depth smaller i30 shorter rainfall duration and greater interception loss mean of 18 3 table 3 fig 5 for this class of rainfall 87 of the events presented rainfall lower than 20 mm 68 had a duration bellow 100 min and 71 had an i30 lower than 20 mm h 1 fig 5 due to these rainfall characteristics a larger percentage of the precipitated water is retained in the leaves and branches contributing to greater losses from interception small rainfall depths may not reach the precipitated water retention capacity of the vegetation when this capacity is reached the balance after retention is generally small toba and ohta 2005 owens et al 2006 staelens et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2016 sadeghi et al 2016 the existence of a threshold in the interception process and the characteristics under investigation is shown in fig 5 for rainfall depth higher than 20 mm duration higher than 100 min and i30 higher than 15 mm interception is always less than 30 class i displays little dispersion of the rainfall characteristics for the events fig 6 a b and c there is however high dispersion of the percentage loss from interception it is in this class that the event with the greatest interception loss is found 74 fig 6d for a rainfall depth of 8 9 mm and duration of 15 min this class represents 67 of all events accounting for only 36 1 of the total rainfall fig 7 despite being a semi arid region where the main characteristic of rainfall events is their high intensity and short duration lima et al 2013 santos et al 2017 the results point to a high frequency of low magnitude events fig 7 class ii rainfall comprised the longest durations with a mean of 365 2 min table 3 figs 5b and 6 b where in 2010 one specific event lasted 815 min which is uncommon in the area as can be observed from the data of the other monitored events despite the great dissimilarity between the mean rainfall depth duration and i30 between classes ii and iii the mean losses from interception of 16 0 and 13 3 respectively did not display a significant difference table 3 the greatest rainfall depths were seen for class iii with a maximum of 124 4 mm a minimum of 25 3 mm and mean of 47 1 mm table 3 fig 6a rainfall duration showed intermediate values in relation to the other classes with a maximum of 550 min minimum of 30 min and a mean of 191 min table 3 fig 6b the i30 had maximum and minimum values of 100 6 and 30 4 mm h 1 and the i30avg of 55 9 mm h 1 table 3 fig 6c on the other hand the lowest mean percentages in the study were recorded for interception loss with a mean value of 13 3 table 3 figs 5 and 6d the characteristics of the class iii events mainly relate to the occurrence of convective rains of high intensity high magnitude and shorter duration the plant canopy exceeds its storage capacity and immediately becomes saturated generating a redistribution of the rainfall and resulting in smaller losses from interception calder 1996 owens et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 this class accounted for 18 7 of all events and was responsible for 41 5 of the total rainfall fig 7 a decreasing trend in percentage loss from interception with increases in rainfall depth and intensity fig 5 demonstrates the saturation of the vegetation as the rainfall persists as reported by toba and ohta 2005 the rainfall events that occurred during the study period had a mean duration that ranged from 95 6 to 365 2 min between the classes defined with the hga with a greater occurrence of events with a mean duration of 95 6 min in class i these results agree with research by medeiros and araújo 2014 and santos et al 2017 who concluded that there is a predominance of short duration rainfall in a tropical semi arid region 3 4 fractionation of the rainfall in each rainfall class the highest percentage of throughfall 79 3 and stemflow 7 5 was seen in class iii table 4 the greater the intensity of the event fig 5c the faster the water retention capacity of the vegetation becomes saturated initiating throughfall and redistribution by the branches and trunks of the vegetation tables 3 and 4 fig 6a b and c calder 1996 crockford and richardson 2000 toba and ohta 2005 percentage throughfall and stemflow increased by 2 5 and 2 6 percentage points between the first and last rainfall class for the 225 rainfall events investigated in the three rainfall classes throughfall corresponded to 78 8 of the total precipitation table 4 studies under different climate conditions and in different forest types show that throughfall is the largest component of precipitation entering the forest arcova et al 2003 medeiros et al 2009 moura et al 2009 izidio et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 stemflow was 6 6 of the total precipitation table 4 authors such as arcova et al 2003 and sadeghi et al 2015 assume stemflow to be negligible as they consider this percentage to be of little importance to the interception process however stemflow is amongst the most important components of the localized distribution of precipitation around the trunk and its monitoring is fundamental moura et al 2009 medeiros et al 2009 izidio et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 sadeghi et al 2016 2017 2018 especially in periods of less rain in addition stemflow is fundamental for directing the water to the root zone favouring infiltration and increasing soil moisture and deep percolation pinheiro et al 2013 liu et al 2016 measurements in the study area indicate a mean interception loss of 14 6 of the total rainfall in keeping with the different studies already carried out in arid and semi arid regions of the world table 5 interception loss in the semi arid regions of northeastern brazil are close to the mean values of other semi arid regions of the world table 5 with interception losses ranging from 6 9 to 27 2 of the total rainfall although the various studies cited were carried out in semi arid regions of the world it should be emphasised that vegetation and rainfall characteristics differ between areas resulting in the observed variation in percentage loss from plant interception 4 conclusions according to correlation matrix of the variables related to rainfall characteristics and vegetation interception the interception losses can be significantly estimated r 0 73 by rainfall depth using hierarchical group analysis hga rainfall classification formed a class with convective rains class iii resulting in higher water input to the soil throughfall and stemflow with low interception mean interception 13 3 among the variables of rainfall characteristics under analysis the i30 best explained the interception losses in the study area in addition it was found that despite the mean rainfall intensity showing low correlation with interception 0 24 it was significant p 0 001 and could be an alternative in studies quantifying interception loss the main shortcoming of this work was the lack leaf density information such as leaf area index lai it is expected that the higher the lai the greater the potential of the vegetation to store and consequently intercept water considering the deciduous nature of seasonally dry tropical forest study and understanding of vegetation interception variation due to leaf density is crucial to improve hydrological modeling and catchment management the results presented in this study are useful for improving water and environmental management since it is possible to estimate more precisely the amount of water that actually reaches the soil in regions with seasonally dry tropical forests this paper presents data and information on interception process which helps the comprehension of the overall water balance in dry environments and improve the capacity for parameterization of hydrological models with more precise mathematical models it is possible to expand the studies for unmonitored ctachments as well as simulat scenarios that will contribute to the efficient management of water resources declarations of interest none acknowledgements the authors wish to thank the

throughfall stemflow and interception loss in a deciduous forest of a tropical semi arid region from a data series of eight consecutive years the data were collected from 2010 to 2017 comprising a total of 225 events new hydrological insights for the region among the variables used to characterize rainfall the maximum 30 min intensity i30 best explained the interception losses which is also well correlated to rainfall depth and event average intensity the predominant events 67 of the total are characterised by low rainfall depth low i30 and higher interception loss 18 of the gross rainfall in addition there is a threshold between rainfall characteristics and the interception process for rainfall and i30 lower than 20 mm and 15 mm h respectively and rainfall duration lower than 100 min interception losses are usually higher than 30 reaching up to 74 for the remaining events interception losses are mostly within the range of 10 20 of rainfall the data and information on the interception process presented in this study helps the comprehension of the overall water balance in dry environments and improve the capacity for parameterization of hydrological models contributing

seen that the intensities with the greatest weight were i60 and i45 which agrees with studies by zhang et al 2016 and medeiros et al 2009 furthermore these two intensities displayed the greatest correlation with rainfall depth from the correlation matrix it can be seen that interception loss i had the greatest correlation 0 73 p 0 001 with rainfall depth p the occurrence of significant weight between interception loss i and rainfall depth p suggests that in the absence of information on rainfall intensity the magnitude can be used to estimate interception loss reasonably well in the study area using simple regression the two rainfall characteristics with the least weight although significant p 0 001 were rainfall duration d and mean intensity iavg it is believed that the low weight of iavg 0 24 is due to the high temporal variability of the rainfall characteristics the best model using pca consisted of two components and explained 87 of the total data variance table 2 with a value for the kaiser meyer olkin test kmo of 0 88 these components cp1 and cp2 allow identification of the variables with the greatest interrelations in the formed component noting that the greatest factorial weights were attributed to i30 with a value equal to 0 98 followed by i20 i45 and i15 with values equal to 0 97 the second component was formed by the mean intensity and duration of the rainfall explaining 14 4 of the data variance and confirming the results seen with the correlation matrix the i30 best explains the interception losses in the study area with the same variable maximum intensity over 30 min providing greater explanation of the erosive processes lima et al 2013 santos et al 2017 3 3 grouping of rainfall events due to the high similarity between the weights of the variables i30 was selected as representative of cp1 and rainfall duration as representative of cp2 for defining similar groups of rainfall characteristics with the greatest inference for interception loss the use of hierarchical grouping analysis hga based on rainfall depth mm i30 mm h 1 and rainfall duration minutes yielded three distinct rainfall classes table 3 after the application of hga the values for interception loss corresponding to each rainfall class formed were verified table 3 class i grouped events of smaller rainfall depth smaller i30 shorter rainfall duration and greater interception loss mean of 18 3 table 3 fig 5 for this class of rainfall 87 of the events presented rainfall lower than 20 mm 68 had a duration bellow 100 min and 71 had an i30 lower than 20 mm h 1 fig 5 due to these rainfall characteristics a larger percentage of the precipitated water is retained in the leaves and branches contributing to greater losses from interception small rainfall depths may not reach the precipitated water retention capacity of the vegetation when this capacity is reached the balance after retention is generally small toba and ohta 2005 owens et al 2006 staelens et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2016 sadeghi et al 2016 the existence of a threshold in the interception process and the characteristics under investigation is shown in fig 5 for rainfall depth higher than 20 mm duration higher than 100 min and i30 higher than 15 mm interception is always less than 30 class i displays little dispersion of the rainfall characteristics for the events fig 6 a b and c there is however high dispersion of the percentage loss from interception it is in this class that the event with the greatest interception loss is found 74 fig 6d for a rainfall depth of 8 9 mm and duration of 15 min this class represents 67 of all events accounting for only 36 1 of the total rainfall fig 7 despite being a semi arid region where the main characteristic of rainfall events is their high intensity and short duration lima et al 2013 santos et al 2017 the results point to a high frequency of low magnitude events fig 7 class ii rainfall comprised the longest durations with a mean of 365 2 min table 3 figs 5b and 6 b where in 2010 one specific event lasted 815 min which is uncommon in the area as can be observed from the data of the other monitored events despite the great dissimilarity between the mean rainfall depth duration and i30 between classes ii and iii the mean losses from interception of 16 0 and 13 3 respectively did not display a significant difference table 3 the greatest rainfall depths were seen for class iii with a maximum of 124 4 mm a minimum of 25 3 mm and mean of 47 1 mm table 3 fig 6a rainfall duration showed intermediate values in relation to the other classes with a maximum of 550 min minimum of 30 min and a mean of 191 min table 3 fig 6b the i30 had maximum and minimum values of 100 6 and 30 4 mm h 1 and the i30avg of 55 9 mm h 1 table 3 fig 6c on the other hand the lowest mean percentages in the study were recorded for interception loss with a mean value of 13 3 table 3 figs 5 and 6d the characteristics of the class iii events mainly relate to the occurrence of convective rains of high intensity high magnitude and shorter duration the plant canopy exceeds its storage capacity and immediately becomes saturated generating a redistribution of the rainfall and resulting in smaller losses from interception calder 1996 owens et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 this class accounted for 18 7 of all events and was responsible for 41 5 of the total rainfall fig 7 a decreasing trend in percentage loss from interception with increases in rainfall depth and intensity fig 5 demonstrates the saturation of the vegetation as the rainfall persists as reported by toba and ohta 2005 the rainfall events that occurred during the study period had a mean duration that ranged from 95 6 to 365 2 min between the classes defined with the hga with a greater occurrence of events with a mean duration of 95 6 min in class i these results agree with research by medeiros and araújo 2014 and santos et al 2017 who concluded that there is a predominance of short duration rainfall in a tropical semi arid region 3 4 fractionation of the rainfall in each rainfall class the highest percentage of throughfall 79 3 and stemflow 7 5 was seen in class iii table 4 the greater the intensity of the event fig 5c the faster the water retention capacity of the vegetation becomes saturated initiating throughfall and redistribution by the branches and trunks of the vegetation tables 3 and 4 fig 6a b and c calder 1996 crockford and richardson 2000 toba and ohta 2005 percentage throughfall and stemflow increased by 2 5 and 2 6 percentage points between the first and last rainfall class for the 225 rainfall events investigated in the three rainfall classes throughfall corresponded to 78 8 of the total precipitation table 4 studies under different climate conditions and in different forest types show that throughfall is the largest component of precipitation entering the forest arcova et al 2003 medeiros et al 2009 moura et al 2009 izidio et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 stemflow was 6 6 of the total precipitation table 4 authors such as arcova et al 2003 and sadeghi et al 2015 assume stemflow to be negligible as they consider this percentage to be of little importance to the interception process however stemflow is amongst the most important components of the localized distribution of precipitation around the trunk and its monitoring is fundamental moura et al 2009 medeiros et al 2009 izidio et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 sadeghi et al 2016 2017 2018 especially in periods of less rain in addition stemflow is fundamental for directing the water to the root zone favouring infiltration and increasing soil moisture and deep percolation pinheiro et al 2013 liu et al 2016 measurements in the study area indicate a mean interception loss of 14 6 of the total rainfall in keeping with the different studies already carried out in arid and semi arid regions of the world table 5 interception loss in the semi arid regions of northeastern brazil are close to the mean values of other semi arid regions of the world table 5 with interception losses ranging from 6 9 to 27 2 of the total rainfall although the various studies cited were carried out in semi arid regions of the world it should be emphasised that vegetation and rainfall characteristics differ between areas resulting in the observed variation in percentage loss from plant interception 4 conclusions according to correlation matrix of the variables related to rainfall characteristics and vegetation interception the interception losses can be significantly estimated r 0 73 by rainfall depth using hierarchical group analysis hga rainfall classification formed a class with convective rains class iii resulting in higher water input to the soil throughfall and stemflow with low interception mean interception 13 3 among the variables of rainfall characteristics under analysis the i30 best explained the interception losses in the study area in addition it was found that despite the mean rainfall intensity showing low correlation with interception 0 24 it was significant p 0 001 and could be an alternative in studies quantifying interception loss the main shortcoming of this work was the lack leaf density information such as leaf area index lai it is expected that the higher the lai the greater the potential of the vegetation to store and consequently intercept water considering the deciduous nature of seasonally dry tropical forest study and understanding of vegetation interception variation due to leaf density is crucial to improve hydrological modeling and catchment management the results presented in this study are useful for improving water and environmental management since it is possible to estimate more precisely the amount of water that actually reaches the soil in regions with seasonally dry tropical forests this paper presents data and information on interception process which helps the comprehension of the overall water balance in dry environments and improve the capacity for parameterization of hydrological models with more precise mathematical models it is possible to expand the studies for unmonitored ctachments as well as simulat scenarios that will contribute to the efficient management of water resources declarations of interest none acknowledgements the authors wish to thank the

8497,study region hadejia river basin hrb in north eastern nigeria study focus the hydrological trends and variations of surface runoff in hadejia river catchment were assessed using data spanning 36 years 1980 2015 for proper planning and management of water resources in the basin new hydrological insight for the region the temporal and spatial irregularities in the runoff of hadeia river catchment has been detected a significant decrease of river discharge from two out of the three downstream stations had been observed however there is an increasing trend of the river discharge from all the three upstream stations though statistically insignificant the anova f 5 210 106 226 p 0 05 and cluster analysis results showed significant spatial variations between the upstream and downstream stations the increasing trend of the discharge in the upstream stations is attributable to high rainfall mean and increased urbanization in the area however the significant decreasing trend of the discharge downstream of the river catchment is associated to many factors notably high evaporation rate due to high temperature low rainfall mean and the relatively high infiltration rate encouraged by the high percentage of sandy soil and the sedimentary geological formation consequent to these trends and variations water supply and irrigation particularly in the downstream areas are at risk thus integrated basin study using hydrological modelling will be helpful to distinguish the individual impact of the blame factors and to predict the river discharge behavior in response to the impact of those factors keywords river discharge mann kendall trend modified mann kendall inverse distance weighted semi arid region 1 introduction the increased proliferation of urban settlements along surface water bodies such as rivers and lakes has increased the demand for this precious resources the water mwangi et al 2016 unfortunately most of these rivers and lakes and their water resources are gradually shrinking as a consequence of climate variability and anthropogenic activities dettinger et al 2004 detecting fluctuations in river discharge is the most suitable way to discern trends decreasing or increasing in the river discharge series afzal et al 2011 this will provides valuable information in the behavior of river flow and will assist in water resource assessment planning and management this is particularly needed in arid and semi arid regions where climate change and variability has worsened the existing water resources predicaments ye et al 2013 trend detection is an active field of interest in hydroclimatological studies manikannan et al 2011 detection of the trend in river discharge data series is the crucial beginning for basin s water resources assessment there are various trend techniques used in trend detection however mann kendall and sen s slope estimator are the most commonly used techniques walker 1991 the power of these trend tests is based on the probability to accept the null hypothesis when there is no trend and to reject it when there is a trend in the data set daniel et al 2011 temporal trend detection is deemed as one of the most crucial objectives of environmental studies particularly those related to planning and management thus detected trends in river discharge time series are important in the planning designing and operating of water resources projects the reduction of river discharge in hadejia river basin hrb is dated back to the historical and sequential drought years experienced throughout sub saharan west africa in the 1970s and 80s adams and thomas 1996 thompson and hollis 1995 in the recent past the increased human population and urbanization posed additional complications to the available water resources of the basin which is expected to get exhausted by 2020 sobowale et al 2010 similarly land use changes and the consequent urban growth had heightened the water resources predicament in the region kimmage and adams 1992 umar and ankidawa 2016 the potential water resources problems in the area presented by climate and the anthropogenic factors are worrisome particularly that the hrb supports not less than 15 million people for their livelihoods within its profile the historical flow fluctuations had drastically affected the wet season flood inundation used for flood recession agriculture in the hadejia river basin oyebande 1995 2001 which is to date the main economic activity of the inhabitants living along the river profile audu 2014 dammo et al 2015 many factors are blamed for the changes in the basin water resources however climate change and variability were the most pressing factors adakayi 2012 sawa et al 2015 the main objective of this study is to assess the runoff irregularities the presence of trends and variations from the historical river discharge data in hadejia river basin for proper planning and management of the basin s water resources this will eventually form the basis for future water resources prediction within the profile 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area hadejia river basin hrb has a catchment area of 24 687 km2 fig 1 this river catchment is situated in the north eastern part of nigeria which is referred to as semi arid zone in the eco climatic term adakayi 2012 the vegetation of the area falls within the short grass and woodland savannah vegetation zones the surface elevation is about 600 m to the south and southwest to less than 300 m above sea level in the north and north eastern part of the basin respectively geologically the basin is covered by two geological divides basement complex covered the upstream of the basin and the chad formation dominates the mid and downstream areas of the basin the working of the basin s climatic system is regulated by two air masses the south west sw and north east ne trade winds adakayi 2012 the sw trade winds come along with moisture from the coast it stays in the north from may to september summer the ne trade wind on the other hand comes along with dry cold winds from the sahara desert from october to april winter mean annual rainfall varies from 1100 mm in the southernmost locations tiga and kano to less than 300 mm in the extreme north eastern part of the basin hadejia station ahmed et al 2018 temperatures reach as high as 35 c before the arrival of rains april may and drop as low as 18 c in december january ikusemoran and andezekiel 2011 and it increases northeastward 2 2 data collection hydrological data collection in the hrb began in 1963 after the establishment of the hydrological stations by the northern nigeria government under the supervision of the ministry of agriculture s irrigation division goes 2002 these stations were formalized and extended to the systematic survey of the surface water resources with the assistance of the united states geological survey usgs in 1964 medugu et al 2011 however for the purpose of this study monthly river discharge data for 36 years 1980 2015 from six hydrological stations obtained from hadejia jama are river basin development authority hjrbda and jigawa state ministry of water resources jsmwr were used for the trends detection 2 2 1 data analysis the data were subjected to qa qc analysis prior to the application of the appropriate statistics duhan and pandey 2013 the data were checked for irregularities such as missing data and outliers the qa qc scrutiny revealed that the data were statistically clean except for few missing data constituting less than 10 of the whole dataset these missing data were replaced with the mean of the two recorded observations that binds the missing observations brockwell and davis 2002 the trend in the river discharge was analyzed using the mann kendall trend test and sen s slope estimator spatial interpolation technique the inverse distance weighted idw was used for the spatial interpolation of the trend results rahman et al 2017 however spatial variation in the data set was analyzed using anova and cluster analysis ca 2 2 2 trend analysis trends in a time series data are usually affected by the presence of negative or positive autocorrelations hamed and rao 1998 the serial correlation coefficients otherwise called autocorrelation test is performed to check the randomness and periodicity in the time series data modarres and da silva 2007 in the event randomness is found or if lag 1 serial correlation coefficients are statistically insignificant mann kendall mk trend test can be applied without altering the original data salman et al 2017a otherwise modified mann kendall mmk test should be used after removing the effect of serial correlation randomness from the time series karpouzos et al 2010 the data for this study were subjected to serial correlation test and the results showed that the coefficients were statistically significant thus besides the mann kendall trend test the modified mann kendall trend test was also applied nonparametric tests have been the most commonly used tests for establishing the temporal variations in hydro meteorological variables li et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 mann kendall mk trend test is the most promoted approach among the nonparametric statistical families jaagus 2006 jiang et al 2015a b it accommodates missing values and outliers and data with skewed distributions ab razak et al 2016 however because of the serial correlation detected modified mann kendall mmk was also applied which in most cases trend results generated from it is more acceptable than the results from mk test salman et al 2017a the mmk trend test was improved to take accounts for the scaling effect in the mk test hamed 2008 in mmk significant trend present in data series is eliminated therefore the corresponding normal departures of the rank of the de trended series are obtained using the following equation 1 z i 1 r i n 1 f o r i 1 n where r i is the rank of the de trended series i 1 n is the span of the time series and 1 is the inverse standard normal distribution function mean 0 standard deviation 1 the null hypothesis ho of the mk test is that time series values have no trend while alternative hypothesis h1 states that there is trend in the data set in this study a significant trend is indicated in the test when p value is less than 0 05 this test is based on the statistic 2 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s i g n x j x k where s is the man kendall test values x j and x k are the sequential data values j k and n are the length of the data sign x j x k is a pointer function which assumes any of the values 1 0 and 1 subject to the sign of x j xk i e 3 sgn xj xk 1 if xj xk 0 4 sgn xj xk 0 if xj xk 0 5 sgn xj xk 1 if xj xk 0 the sen slope estimator is used to estimate the true slope of man kendall s trend analysis it is a simple nonparametric test developed by sen 1968 and later presented by dorigo et al 2012 and gilbert 1987 this test calculates the magnitude of any significant trend detected in the mann kendall test gocic and trajkovic 2013 karpouzos et al 2010 in the sen s slope estimator the change in a time series is computed as the median of slope qmed of n slopes estimated from consecutive two points of the series 6 m e d q i n 1 2 i i f n i s o d d q i n 2 i q i n 2 2 i i f n i s e v e n 2 2 2 3 geospatial interpolation inverse distance weighted idw technique the idw procedure is one of the most commonly used spatial interpolation techniques in geosciences which calculates the extrapolation values of unknown points by weighting the average of the values of known points data points kura et al 2014 it is an intuitive and efficient method of interpolation for gis users especially to those without much knowledge of spatial statistics li et al 2014 the idw is applied in this study for its accuracy than many other spatial interpolation methods such as spline and krigging rahman et al 2017 basically the general concept of the idw is to estimate the unknown value of y xo in location xo given the observed y value at sampled locations xi according to the following equation 7 y x o i 1 n λ i y x i in idw application the estimated value of concentrations at y xo will have more weight if located near to the sampled locations compared to far away points in this study the spatial distribution of mean sd cv and the trend of the river discharge were interpolated within the geographical information system gis environment 2 2 4 spatial variations one way analysis of variance anova is one of the most famous statistical tool used in evaluating the variation between two or more groups of observations norusis 2008 it is used to test whether the means of two or more independent groups are equal if the decision is to reject the null hypothesis base on the outcome of the analysis then at least one of the means is different however the omnibus one way anova does not shows where the difference are norusis 2008 thus a post hoc tests for pairwise analysis is recommended chatterjee and hadi 2015 the reliability of this statistical tool is tied to three basic assumption of normality homogeneity and independence agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc is a classification method which works from the dissimilarities between the objects to be grouped the results of this analysis is presented using the dendrogram which shows the progressive grouping of the data this dendrogram represents a hierarchy of partitions it is then possible to choose a partition by truncating the tree at a given level the level depending upon either user defined constraints the user knows how many classes are to be obtained or more objective criteria ayinde et al 2013 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics the values of river discharge normality statistics via skewness and kurtosis were found to be within the range of 2 to 2 and 3 to 3 respectively indicating that the data were from normal population distribution george and mallery 2003 fig 2 similarly shapiro wilk normality test was conducted to corroborate the result of the conventional normality statistics the result mean and sd 483 41 118 7 p 0 080 showed that the river discharge data are normally distributed fig 3 a furthermore the descriptive summaries showed that the highest mean and sd for the river discharge was at wudil station and the least at chai chai station figs 2 and 4a however the highest coefficient of variation cv was at kafin hausa station and the least at wudil and hadejia stations figs 2 4b and c 3 2 hydrological trend and spatial interpolation the mk and mmk trend tests conducted on river discharge data 1980 2015 had revealed the temporal behavior of the river discharge in hadejia river basin the annual trend results showed a statistically insignificant increasing trend p values range from 0 91 0 39 mk 0 98 0 79 mm k at the upstream stations chiromawa challawa and wudil stations tables 1 and 2 and a statistically significant decreasing trends in the two out of the three downstream stations kafin hausa and hadejia stations tables 1 and 2 there is disagreement between the two tests in terms of the significance of the slope both mk and mmk portrayed decreasing or increasing trends concurrently however differs in term of the significance of the trends particularly in june august and september and also for the annual trend at hadejia station tables 1 and 2 fig 5 a in this station hadejia station mmk reported insignificant decreasing trend p 0 45 while the mk results showed a significant decreasing trend in the river discharge p 0 02 table 1 however monthly trend indicates mixed results of increasing and decreasing trends in the southern part of the basin monthly trends were generally increasing in all months except in may and the decrease is statistically significant p 0 01 mk test and p 0 04 mmk test at hadejia station table 2 fig 5f however in the northern part of the basin the monthly trends results indicates a unanimous decreasing trends in all months with significant decreasing trend in june p 0 02 mk test at hadejia station table 2 fig 5g table 3 3 3 anova results a one way analysis of variance anova were conducted to compare the differences between the six hydrological stations on the mean annual river discharge the result shows significant difference in the mean annual river discharge based on hydrological stations computed f 5 210 106 226 p 0 05 table 4 the tukey hsd test was also conducted to support the anova results the tukey test result showed significant difference between all the hydrological stations except between chiromawa and hadejia md 147 67222 std error 54 65 p 0 079 and between chai chai and kafin hausa md 0 31111 std error 54 65 p 1 000 stations respectively table 4 3 4 spatial pattern of river discharge between stations via cluster analysis ca agglomerated hierarchical clustering ahc technique yielded four clusters cluster 1 consist of only chiromawa cluster 2 comprises of challawa chai chai and kafin hausa stations clusters 3 and 4 are wudil and hadejia stations respectively fig 6 the grouping of these stations into four solid clusters was based on the river discharge dissimilarity characteristics particularly the high and low river discharge variations wudil station had the highest mean discharge followed by chiromawa and hadejia stations and they are individually clustered as clusters 3 2 and 4 respectively however the remaining three stations challawa chai chai and kafin hausa had closely similar river flow characteristics hence fall into a single cluster cluster 2 4 discussion the detection of runoff irregularities via trends and variations from the historical river discharge data is crucial for the proper planning and management of surface water resources as well as for the future river discharge prediction the trend results reflect the pattern and behavior of the balance between rainfall as the main recharge and evaporation and infiltration as the major losses although there is a strong positive significant relationship between river discharge and rainfall and a negative weak significant relationship between river discharge and temperature tmax table 5 there seems to be mismatched in the annual and monthly linear relationship between the month of peak rainfall august and that of peak discharge september fig 7 a even though there is a correspondence in some of the years of high rainfall and river discharge e g 1980 1988 1998 and 2001 the annual trend of the rainfall and river discharge series showed disagreement the rainfall series showed an increasing trend while the river discharge indicates a decreasing trend fig 7b this is because besides rainfall the hydrology of a river basin is controlled by other factors such as the lithology and soil types relief and vegetation the size of the river basin as well as other anthropogenic factors particularly direct river water abstractions the highest rainfall mean occurs 989 75 mm in the upper reaches of the basin around chiromawa challawa and wudil and the lowest was 380 92 mm in the lower reaches of the basin around kafin hausa and hadejia stations umar et al 2018 consequently trends particularly the annual trends of river discharge around these areas were generally increasing with the slope ranging from 0 13 0 04 and 0 02 in chiromawa challawa and wudil stations respectively however in the middle and lower reaches of the basin river discharge is less probably because of the high infiltration rate compared to the upstream areas of the basin these differences in the rate of the infiltration were as a result of soil and lithological disparities the between the upstream basement complex and the downstream chad formation areas fig 8 moreover the rate of evaporation is higher in the downstream area of the basin and in some cases the mean evapotranspiration exceeds the mean rainfall table 6 this is because temperature increases north eastward and that collectively diminishes the river discharge in the downstream areas adakayi 2012 in the lower reaches losses are extremely high and the discharge rate decreases significantly at kafin hausa mk p 0 02 and mmk p 0 000 and hadejia stations mk p 0 02 the monthly discharge trends however showed mixed results of statistically significant increasing trends in july mk p 0 01 at challawa station and decreasing trends in may mk p 0 01 mmk p 0 04 at hadejia station in june mk p 0 02 at hadejia station in august mk p 0 04 mmk p 0 00 at hadejia and kafin hausa stations in september mk p 0 04 at chai chai station in november mk p 0 02 mmk p 0 00 at kafin hausa station the mk and mmk trends results showed disparities in the significance of the trend slopes similar findings have been reported in the previous studies where mk and mmk give inconsistent results the mmk showed insignificant trends where the mk revealed otherwise salman et al 2017b sa adi et al 2017 the number of stations showing a significant trend in the annual and monthly river discharge in mk tests was higher compared to the mmk trend test and a similar result was reported previously kundu et al 2015 pandey et al 2017 additionally the number of stations with significance trends reduces when mmk test was used and compared with the mk test lacombe et al 2012 shahid et al 2014 dudley et al 2017 the observed inconsistencies and disparities of the mk and mmk results might be due to scaling effects or the longtime persistence ltp effects dudley et al 2017 thus the higher number of stations and months with significance values obtained using the mk test in the present study might also result from the effect of ltp which necessitate the use of mmk test to smooth the problem meanwhile the spatial hydrological disparities between the stations were revealed by the anova and the cluster analysis the anova results showed a statistically significant difference in the river discharge between all the stations except between challawa and hadejia p 0 079 and between chai chai and kafin hausa p 1 000 respectively the insignificant differences depicted between chiromawa and hadejia is attributable to the relative similarities in the river discharge flow characteristics between the two stations however the insignificant differences between chai chai and kafin hausa are likely because both two stations were located at the bifurcation channel distributaries that only experienced river flow when the river discharge volume is sufficiently high usually during the summer jja generally the spatial disparities in the river discharge are largely influenced by the distribution of rainfall between locations the geological differences and the topographical peculiarities between the areas tanko 2011 results of cluster analysis have further portrayed the spatial behavior of the river discharge in that areas with peculiar discharge characteristics were individually clustered and those with similar discharge behavior were grouped together as a single cluster the mean river discharge was found to be higher in wudil followed by chiromawa and then hadejia stations challawa chai chai and kafin hausa stations showed a relatively similar discharge flow pattern and therefore grouped as a single cluster thus the rate of river discharge was the basis for the cluster categorization the results of this study showed synergism between the trends and the spatial variations of the river discharge in the area however reasons for the trends differences between the specific locations may be due to certain peculiar characteristics unique to certain areas for instance the annual increasing trend at the upstream stations chiromaw challawa and wudil stations was attributed to the high rainfall mean and the changing land uses conversely the statistically significant decreasing trend in the two kafin hausa and hadejia stations out of the three downstream stations was linked to the low rainfall mean high temperature and relatively high rate of infiltration and evaporation adewole and serifat 2015 balogun et al 2016 olagunju 2015 the increased rate of infiltration at the mid and downstream areas of the basin is perhaps due to the sandy loam soil textural composition and the underlying sedimentary chad formation lithological class mccartney and smakhtin 2010 in the downstream areas of the basin the river discharge was also affected by the losses to non returning river channels chai chai and kafin hausa bifurcation streams and the river regulations upstream of the basin chiroma et al 2005 tanko 2011 blench 2013 the disappearance of sharp channel streams due to high erosion and siltation associated with the geological composition was similarly an important factor to reckon with goes 2001 le barbé et al 2002 consequently at a certain location the river channel does not have the capacity to contain the flood flow thus the water spread overland and floods the surrounding areas to varying depths and degrees iucn 2003 thus the net river discharge supposed to reach downstream areas is interrupted along its course the losses to evaporation evapotranspiration were because the region is characterized by constant high temperature and that is not surprising been within a semi arid climatic zone of the country the mean annual evaporation was reported to exceed mean annual precipitation particularly at the extreme north eastern part of the basin adakayi 2012 kazaure 2013 the implication of the findings to the water related programs and activities in the area is that the downstream areas may perpetually suffer from reduced flow even in the future thus water supply and irrigation will be affected tremendously besides the effects of the reduced flow on fishing and recreational activities if persisted the reduced flow may have an effect on the general livelihoods of the people depending on the river basin estimated at

locations the application of inverse distance weighted idw to the river discharge mean sd and cv have spatially displayed the areas of high and low river discharge across the basin furthermore the

8497,study region hadejia river basin hrb in north eastern nigeria study focus the hydrological trends and variations of surface runoff in hadejia river catchment were assessed using data spanning 36 years 1980 2015 for proper planning and management of water resources in the basin new hydrological insight for the region the temporal and spatial irregularities in the runoff of hadeia river catchment has been detected a significant decrease of river discharge from two out of the three downstream stations had been observed however there is an increasing trend of the river discharge from all the three upstream stations though statistically insignificant the anova f 5 210 106 226 p 0 05 and cluster analysis results showed significant spatial variations between the upstream and downstream stations the increasing trend of the discharge in the upstream stations is attributable to high rainfall mean and increased urbanization in the area however the significant decreasing trend of the discharge downstream of the river catchment is associated to many factors notably high evaporation rate due to high temperature low rainfall mean and the relatively high infiltration rate encouraged by the high percentage of sandy soil and the sedimentary geological formation consequent to these trends and variations water supply and irrigation particularly in the downstream areas are at risk thus integrated basin study using hydrological modelling will be helpful to distinguish the individual impact of the blame factors and to predict the river discharge behavior in response to the impact of those factors keywords river discharge mann kendall trend modified mann kendall inverse distance weighted semi arid region 1 introduction the increased proliferation of urban settlements along surface water bodies such as rivers and lakes has increased the demand for this precious resources the water mwangi et al 2016 unfortunately most of these rivers and lakes and their water resources are gradually shrinking as a consequence of climate variability and anthropogenic activities dettinger et al 2004 detecting fluctuations in river discharge is the most suitable way to discern trends decreasing or increasing in the river discharge series afzal et al 2011 this will provides valuable information in the behavior of river flow and will assist in water resource assessment planning and management this is particularly needed in arid and semi arid regions where climate change and variability has worsened the existing water resources predicaments ye et al 2013 trend detection is an active field of interest in hydroclimatological studies manikannan et al 2011 detection of the trend in river discharge data series is the crucial beginning for basin s water resources assessment there are various trend techniques used in trend detection however mann kendall and sen s slope estimator are the most commonly used techniques walker 1991 the power of these trend tests is based on the probability to accept the null hypothesis when there is no trend and to reject it when there is a trend in the data set daniel et al 2011 temporal trend detection is deemed as one of the most crucial objectives of environmental studies particularly those related to planning and management thus detected trends in river discharge time series are important in the planning designing and operating of water resources projects the reduction of river discharge in hadejia river basin hrb is dated back to the historical and sequential drought years experienced throughout sub saharan west africa in the 1970s and 80s adams and thomas 1996 thompson and hollis 1995 in the recent past the increased human population and urbanization posed additional complications to the available water resources of the basin which is expected to get exhausted by 2020 sobowale et al 2010 similarly land use changes and the consequent urban growth had heightened the water resources predicament in the region kimmage and adams 1992 umar and ankidawa 2016 the potential water resources problems in the area presented by climate and the anthropogenic factors are worrisome particularly that the hrb supports not less than 15 million people for their livelihoods within its profile the historical flow fluctuations had drastically affected the wet season flood inundation used for flood recession agriculture in the hadejia river basin oyebande 1995 2001 which is to date the main economic activity of the inhabitants living along the river profile audu 2014 dammo et al 2015 many factors are blamed for the changes in the basin water resources however climate change and variability were the most pressing factors adakayi 2012 sawa et al 2015 the main objective of this study is to assess the runoff irregularities the presence of trends and variations from the historical river discharge data in hadejia river basin for proper planning and management of the basin s water resources this will eventually form the basis for future water resources prediction within the profile 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area hadejia river basin hrb has a catchment area of 24 687 km2 fig 1 this river catchment is situated in the north eastern part of nigeria which is referred to as semi arid zone in the eco climatic term adakayi 2012 the vegetation of the area falls within the short grass and woodland savannah vegetation zones the surface elevation is about 600 m to the south and southwest to less than 300 m above sea level in the north and north eastern part of the basin respectively geologically the basin is covered by two geological divides basement complex covered the upstream of the basin and the chad formation dominates the mid and downstream areas of the basin the working of the basin s climatic system is regulated by two air masses the south west sw and north east ne trade winds adakayi 2012 the sw trade winds come along with moisture from the coast it stays in the north from may to september summer the ne trade wind on the other hand comes along with dry cold winds from the sahara desert from october to april winter mean annual rainfall varies from 1100 mm in the southernmost locations tiga and kano to less than 300 mm in the extreme north eastern part of the basin hadejia station ahmed et al 2018 temperatures reach as high as 35 c before the arrival of rains april may and drop as low as 18 c in december january ikusemoran and andezekiel 2011 and it increases northeastward 2 2 data collection hydrological data collection in the hrb began in 1963 after the establishment of the hydrological stations by the northern nigeria government under the supervision of the ministry of agriculture s irrigation division goes 2002 these stations were formalized and extended to the systematic survey of the surface water resources with the assistance of the united states geological survey usgs in 1964 medugu et al 2011 however for the purpose of this study monthly river discharge data for 36 years 1980 2015 from six hydrological stations obtained from hadejia jama are river basin development authority hjrbda and jigawa state ministry of water resources jsmwr were used for the trends detection 2 2 1 data analysis the data were subjected to qa qc analysis prior to the application of the appropriate statistics duhan and pandey 2013 the data were checked for irregularities such as missing data and outliers the qa qc scrutiny revealed that the data were statistically clean except for few missing data constituting less than 10 of the whole dataset these missing data were replaced with the mean of the two recorded observations that binds the missing observations brockwell and davis 2002 the trend in the river discharge was analyzed using the mann kendall trend test and sen s slope estimator spatial interpolation technique the inverse distance weighted idw was used for the spatial interpolation of the trend results rahman et al 2017 however spatial variation in the data set was analyzed using anova and cluster analysis ca 2 2 2 trend analysis trends in a time series data are usually affected by the presence of negative or positive autocorrelations hamed and rao 1998 the serial correlation coefficients otherwise called autocorrelation test is performed to check the randomness and periodicity in the time series data modarres and da silva 2007 in the event randomness is found or if lag 1 serial correlation coefficients are statistically insignificant mann kendall mk trend test can be applied without altering the original data salman et al 2017a otherwise modified mann kendall mmk test should be used after removing the effect of serial correlation randomness from the time series karpouzos et al 2010 the data for this study were subjected to serial correlation test and the results showed that the coefficients were statistically significant thus besides the mann kendall trend test the modified mann kendall trend test was also applied nonparametric tests have been the most commonly used tests for establishing the temporal variations in hydro meteorological variables li et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 mann kendall mk trend test is the most promoted approach among the nonparametric statistical families jaagus 2006 jiang et al 2015a b it accommodates missing values and outliers and data with skewed distributions ab razak et al 2016 however because of the serial correlation detected modified mann kendall mmk was also applied which in most cases trend results generated from it is more acceptable than the results from mk test salman et al 2017a the mmk trend test was improved to take accounts for the scaling effect in the mk test hamed 2008 in mmk significant trend present in data series is eliminated therefore the corresponding normal departures of the rank of the de trended series are obtained using the following equation 1 z i 1 r i n 1 f o r i 1 n where r i is the rank of the de trended series i 1 n is the span of the time series and 1 is the inverse standard normal distribution function mean 0 standard deviation 1 the null hypothesis ho of the mk test is that time series values have no trend while alternative hypothesis h1 states that there is trend in the data set in this study a significant trend is indicated in the test when p value is less than 0 05 this test is based on the statistic 2 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s i g n x j x k where s is the man kendall test values x j and x k are the sequential data values j k and n are the length of the data sign x j x k is a pointer function which assumes any of the values 1 0 and 1 subject to the sign of x j xk i e 3 sgn xj xk 1 if xj xk 0 4 sgn xj xk 0 if xj xk 0 5 sgn xj xk 1 if xj xk 0 the sen slope estimator is used to estimate the true slope of man kendall s trend analysis it is a simple nonparametric test developed by sen 1968 and later presented by dorigo et al 2012 and gilbert 1987 this test calculates the magnitude of any significant trend detected in the mann kendall test gocic and trajkovic 2013 karpouzos et al 2010 in the sen s slope estimator the change in a time series is computed as the median of slope qmed of n slopes estimated from consecutive two points of the series 6 m e d q i n 1 2 i i f n i s o d d q i n 2 i q i n 2 2 i i f n i s e v e n 2 2 2 3 geospatial interpolation inverse distance weighted idw technique the idw procedure is one of the most commonly used spatial interpolation techniques in geosciences which calculates the extrapolation values of unknown points by weighting the average of the values of known points data points kura et al 2014 it is an intuitive and efficient method of interpolation for gis users especially to those without much knowledge of spatial statistics li et al 2014 the idw is applied in this study for its accuracy than many other spatial interpolation methods such as spline and krigging rahman et al 2017 basically the general concept of the idw is to estimate the unknown value of y xo in location xo given the observed y value at sampled locations xi according to the following equation 7 y x o i 1 n λ i y x i in idw application the estimated value of concentrations at y xo will have more weight if located near to the sampled locations compared to far away points in this study the spatial distribution of mean sd cv and the trend of the river discharge were interpolated within the geographical information system gis environment 2 2 4 spatial variations one way analysis of variance anova is one of the most famous statistical tool used in evaluating the variation between two or more groups of observations norusis 2008 it is used to test whether the means of two or more independent groups are equal if the decision is to reject the null hypothesis base on the outcome of the analysis then at least one of the means is different however the omnibus one way anova does not shows where the difference are norusis 2008 thus a post hoc tests for pairwise analysis is recommended chatterjee and hadi 2015 the reliability of this statistical tool is tied to three basic assumption of normality homogeneity and independence agglomerative hierarchical clustering ahc is a classification method which works from the dissimilarities between the objects to be grouped the results of this analysis is presented using the dendrogram which shows the progressive grouping of the data this dendrogram represents a hierarchy of partitions it is then possible to choose a partition by truncating the tree at a given level the level depending upon either user defined constraints the user knows how many classes are to be obtained or more objective criteria ayinde et al 2013 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics the values of river discharge normality statistics via skewness and kurtosis were found to be within the range of 2 to 2 and 3 to 3 respectively indicating that the data were from normal population distribution george and mallery 2003 fig 2 similarly shapiro wilk normality test was conducted to corroborate the result of the conventional normality statistics the result mean and sd 483 41 118 7 p 0 080 showed that the river discharge data are normally distributed fig 3 a furthermore the descriptive summaries showed that the highest mean and sd for the river discharge was at wudil station and the least at chai chai station figs 2 and 4a however the highest coefficient of variation cv was at kafin hausa station and the least at wudil and hadejia stations figs 2 4b and c 3 2 hydrological trend and spatial interpolation the mk and mmk trend tests conducted on river discharge data 1980 2015 had revealed the temporal behavior of the river discharge in hadejia river basin the annual trend results showed a statistically insignificant increasing trend p values range from 0 91 0 39 mk 0 98 0 79 mm k at the upstream stations chiromawa challawa and wudil stations tables 1 and 2 and a statistically significant decreasing trends in the two out of the three downstream stations kafin hausa and hadejia stations tables 1 and 2 there is disagreement between the two tests in terms of the significance of the slope both mk and mmk portrayed decreasing or increasing trends concurrently however differs in term of the significance of the trends particularly in june august and september and also for the annual trend at hadejia station tables 1 and 2 fig 5 a in this station hadejia station mmk reported insignificant decreasing trend p 0 45 while the mk results showed a significant decreasing trend in the river discharge p 0 02 table 1 however monthly trend indicates mixed results of increasing and decreasing trends in the southern part of the basin monthly trends were generally increasing in all months except in may and the decrease is statistically significant p 0 01 mk test and p 0 04 mmk test at hadejia station table 2 fig 5f however in the northern part of the basin the monthly trends results indicates a unanimous decreasing trends in all months with significant decreasing trend in june p 0 02 mk test at hadejia station table 2 fig 5g table 3 3 3 anova results a one way analysis of variance anova were conducted to compare the differences between the six hydrological stations on the mean annual river discharge the result shows significant difference in the mean annual river discharge based on hydrological stations computed f 5 210 106 226 p 0 05 table 4 the tukey hsd test was also conducted to support the anova results the tukey test result showed significant difference between all the hydrological stations except between chiromawa and hadejia md 147 67222 std error 54 65 p 0 079 and between chai chai and kafin hausa md 0 31111 std error 54 65 p 1 000 stations respectively table 4 3 4 spatial pattern of river discharge between stations via cluster analysis ca agglomerated hierarchical clustering ahc technique yielded four clusters cluster 1 consist of only chiromawa cluster 2 comprises of challawa chai chai and kafin hausa stations clusters 3 and 4 are wudil and hadejia stations respectively fig 6 the grouping of these stations into four solid clusters was based on the river discharge dissimilarity characteristics particularly the high and low river discharge variations wudil station had the highest mean discharge followed by chiromawa and hadejia stations and they are individually clustered as clusters 3 2 and 4 respectively however the remaining three stations challawa chai chai and kafin hausa had closely similar river flow characteristics hence fall into a single cluster cluster 2 4 discussion the detection of runoff irregularities via trends and variations from the historical river discharge data is crucial for the proper planning and management of surface water resources as well as for the future river discharge prediction the trend results reflect the pattern and behavior of the balance between rainfall as the main recharge and evaporation and infiltration as the major losses although there is a strong positive significant relationship between river discharge and rainfall and a negative weak significant relationship between river discharge and temperature tmax table 5 there seems to be mismatched in the annual and monthly linear relationship between the month of peak rainfall august and that of peak discharge september fig 7 a even though there is a correspondence in some of the years of high rainfall and river discharge e g 1980 1988 1998 and 2001 the annual trend of the rainfall and river discharge series showed disagreement the rainfall series showed an increasing trend while the river discharge indicates a decreasing trend fig 7b this is because besides rainfall the hydrology of a river basin is controlled by other factors such as the lithology and soil types relief and vegetation the size of the river basin as well as other anthropogenic factors particularly direct river water abstractions the highest rainfall mean occurs 989 75 mm in the upper reaches of the basin around chiromawa challawa and wudil and the lowest was 380 92 mm in the lower reaches of the basin around kafin hausa and hadejia stations umar et al 2018 consequently trends particularly the annual trends of river discharge around these areas were generally increasing with the slope ranging from 0 13 0 04 and 0 02 in chiromawa challawa and wudil stations respectively however in the middle and lower reaches of the basin river discharge is less probably because of the high infiltration rate compared to the upstream areas of the basin these differences in the rate of the infiltration were as a result of soil and lithological disparities the between the upstream basement complex and the downstream chad formation areas fig 8 moreover the rate of evaporation is higher in the downstream area of the basin and in some cases the mean evapotranspiration exceeds the mean rainfall table 6 this is because temperature increases north eastward and that collectively diminishes the river discharge in the downstream areas adakayi 2012 in the lower reaches losses are extremely high and the discharge rate decreases significantly at kafin hausa mk p 0 02 and mmk p 0 000 and hadejia stations mk p 0 02 the monthly discharge trends however showed mixed results of statistically significant increasing trends in july mk p 0 01 at challawa station and decreasing trends in may mk p 0 01 mmk p 0 04 at hadejia station in june mk p 0 02 at hadejia station in august mk p 0 04 mmk p 0 00 at hadejia and kafin hausa stations in september mk p 0 04 at chai chai station in november mk p 0 02 mmk p 0 00 at kafin hausa station the mk and mmk trends results showed disparities in the significance of the trend slopes similar findings have been reported in the previous studies where mk and mmk give inconsistent results the mmk showed insignificant trends where the mk revealed otherwise salman et al 2017b sa adi et al 2017 the number of stations showing a significant trend in the annual and monthly river discharge in mk tests was higher compared to the mmk trend test and a similar result was reported previously kundu et al 2015 pandey et al 2017 additionally the number of stations with significance trends reduces when mmk test was used and compared with the mk test lacombe et al 2012 shahid et al 2014 dudley et al 2017 the observed inconsistencies and disparities of the mk and mmk results might be due to scaling effects or the longtime persistence ltp effects dudley et al 2017 thus the higher number of stations and months with significance values obtained using the mk test in the present study might also result from the effect of ltp which necessitate the use of mmk test to smooth the problem meanwhile the spatial hydrological disparities between the stations were revealed by the anova and the cluster analysis the anova results showed a statistically significant difference in the river discharge between all the stations except between challawa and hadejia p 0 079 and between chai chai and kafin hausa p 1 000 respectively the insignificant differences depicted between chiromawa and hadejia is attributable to the relative similarities in the river discharge flow characteristics between the two stations however the insignificant differences between chai chai and kafin hausa are likely because both two stations were located at the bifurcation channel distributaries that only experienced river flow when the river discharge volume is sufficiently high usually during the summer jja generally the spatial disparities in the river discharge are largely influenced by the distribution of rainfall between locations the geological differences and the topographical peculiarities between the areas tanko 2011 results of cluster analysis have further portrayed the spatial behavior of the river discharge in that areas with peculiar discharge characteristics were individually clustered and those with similar discharge behavior were grouped together as a single cluster the mean river discharge was found to be higher in wudil followed by chiromawa and then hadejia stations challawa chai chai and kafin hausa stations showed a relatively similar discharge flow pattern and therefore grouped as a single cluster thus the rate of river discharge was the basis for the cluster categorization the results of this study showed synergism between the trends and the spatial variations of the river discharge in the area however reasons for the trends differences between the specific locations may be due to certain peculiar characteristics unique to certain areas for instance the annual increasing trend at the upstream stations chiromaw challawa and wudil stations was attributed to the high rainfall mean and the changing land uses conversely the statistically significant decreasing trend in the two kafin hausa and hadejia stations out of the three downstream stations was linked to the low rainfall mean high temperature and relatively high rate of infiltration and evaporation adewole and serifat 2015 balogun et al 2016 olagunju 2015 the increased rate of infiltration at the mid and downstream areas of the basin is perhaps due to the sandy loam soil textural composition and the underlying sedimentary chad formation lithological class mccartney and smakhtin 2010 in the downstream areas of the basin the river discharge was also affected by the losses to non returning river channels chai chai and kafin hausa bifurcation streams and the river regulations upstream of the basin chiroma et al 2005 tanko 2011 blench 2013 the disappearance of sharp channel streams due to high erosion and siltation associated with the geological composition was similarly an important factor to reckon with goes 2001 le barbé et al 2002 consequently at a certain location the river channel does not have the capacity to contain the flood flow thus the water spread overland and floods the surrounding areas to varying depths and degrees iucn 2003 thus the net river discharge supposed to reach downstream areas is interrupted along its course the losses to evaporation evapotranspiration were because the region is characterized by constant high temperature and that is not surprising been within a semi arid climatic zone of the country the mean annual evaporation was reported to exceed mean annual precipitation particularly at the extreme north eastern part of the basin adakayi 2012 kazaure 2013 the implication of the findings to the water related programs and activities in the area is that the downstream areas may perpetually suffer from reduced flow even in the future thus water supply and irrigation will be affected tremendously besides the effects of the reduced flow on fishing and recreational activities if persisted the reduced flow may have an effect on the general livelihoods of the people depending on the river basin estimated at about 15 million people on the other hand the increased in the river discharge in the upstream areas will likely result in serious flooding the upstream areas are experiencing serious construction land use changes that lead to surface concretization and the eventual increase in the surface runoff moreover the available vegetation cover that plays a key role via transpiration were replaced with other land uses thus increase in the surface runoff is inevitable and will continually contribute greatly to the cumulative percentage of the river discharge in the upstream areas with its severe consequences particularly the flooding phenomena it is feared that if nothing is done to arrest the situation more serious flooding should be anticipated in the future 5 conclusions the annual trend result via mk and mmk trend test showed a statistically significant decreasing trend in the two out the three downstream stations however all the three upstream stations showed an increasing trend though not statistically significant while the monthly trends results revealed mixed results of increasing and decreasing trends with only july been statistically significant at challawa station however the statistically significant decreasing trend was in september at chai chai station and in may june and august at hadejia station similarly the anova results indicate significant spatial variations between all stations except between chiromawa and hadejia and between chai chai and kafin hausa stations additionally cluster analysis had corroborated the spatial disparities in the river discharge characteristics for instance anova results showed no significant difference between chai chai and kafin hausa and were found to fall in the same cluster category generally the findings indicate that the river discharge in hrb is significantly decreasing over time particularly at the downstream areas of the basin and varied significantly between locations except but between few locations the application of inverse distance weighted idw to the river discharge mean sd and cv have spatially displayed the areas of high and low river discharge across the basin furthermore the results showed that the monthly and annual increasing trends in the rainfall mean supposed to contribute greatly to the river flow was counterbalanced by the combined effects of increasing temperature and evaporation high infiltration rate due to soil and lithological differences and the anthropogenic effect of direct abstraction of the river water consequently river discharge is still declining even though rainfall is increasing although spatial variation is generally more noticeable however both the variations and the trends should be further investigated to unveil the actual reasons behind

8498,study region the rufiji basin east africa study focus rapid advances in global hydrological model ghm resolution model features and in situ and remotely sensed datasets are driving progress towards local relevance and application despite their increasing use however evaluation of local hydrological performance of ghms is rare in this paper we examine the performance of a well known ghm lpjml recently modified to 9 km resolution with and without modest steps to regionalise the model we consider the rufiji river basin an economically important medium size basin in eastern africa new hydrological insights for the region our results indicate that the unmodified ghm does provide a reasonable first approximation of spatial variability in mean flow conditions but scores rather poorly on seasonal and inter annual variability for the model to achieve levels of performance indicators comparable with bespoke modelling modifications to model inputs additional runoff delay and wetland parameterization were required the largest improvements are associated with adjustments in precipitation and enhanced runoff delay with the modified version as a proof of concept we show that a well known drying trend in a major tributary of the rufiji can be explained by implementing irrigation abstractions in the model overall the results suggest that with limited and fairly simple modification ghms can be regionalised to allow their use for scenario testing and further exploration of key local processes in basins with limited observational data keywords lpjml global hydrological model regionalization rufiji irrigation abstractions water resources stiegler s gorge 1 introduction global hydrological and land surface models further ghms are undergoing rapid development ever greater computational capacity and data storage further supported by developments in remote sensing the availability of gridded observation datasets and meteorological forcing data have allowed model development at higher spatial resolution covering larger areas e g flörke et al 2013 sutanudjaja et al 2017 these high resolution models with resolutions of 5 arc minutes 9 km at the equator or higher are able to model the hydrological cycle in catchments across the whole world uniformly and systematically including in regions for which in situ observations are scarce or where the capacity to conduct continued and detailed hydrological modelling is limited ghms are now almost similar in scale at least in spatial resolution if not yet in process detail to the domain of applied river basin hydrological studies as ghms increase in spatial resolution there is more potential to interpret their results at basin and sub basin scales moving beyond continental and regional scale descriptions of water scarcity and climate change impacts to sectoral issues like national food security or hydropower potential at levels of detail relevant for management applications for example ghm outputs are now being considered in the context of water resource management questions related to flood risk trigg et al 2016 winsemius et al 2015 and for providing a range of hydro meteorological services as jury 2017 tested for zambia while there is still debate on the importance of resolution over epistemic uncertainties beven and cloke 2012 bierkens et al 2015 wood et al 2012 both proponents and sceptics agree that moving to higher resolutions will provide better opportunity to compare multi model output against local observations and knowledge of stakeholders beven and cloke 2012 bierkens et al 2015 but despite their increasing use and many high impact publications based on ghms elliott et al 2014 gleeson et al 2012 schewe et al 2014 they are generally not extensively tested for

locations in the tropical to arid zones in sub saharan africa are included see e g figures in beck et al 2017 trigg et al 2016 found in a comparison of flood hazard maps for africa derived from six global models recognising their limited validation significant variations between flood hazard magnitudes with important implications for model reliability and interpretation of results for the reasons above there is a growing need for greater focus on ghm performance at basin and sub basin scales to assess confidence in simulation results and to diagnose and rectify issues with model performance we recognise that a model evaluation should reflect the model s purpose not all developers of ghms claim their models are suitable at the local scale or for management still many studies implicitly rely on the models to do well locally and seasonally even if results are presented at a global scale and aggregated to annual means estimates of hydropower generation environmental flows conditions or sustainable ground water abstraction for irrigation all rely heavily on a realistic estimation of seasonality and variability in flows at specific locations in this paper we take a case study approach and consider the suitability of using an established and open source ghm lpjml schaphoff et al 2017b to simulate the hydrology in a mid sized basin in east africa with a view to support river basin management the rufiji basin is the largest and most economically important river basin in tanzania and the largest basin located within one country in eastern africa see fig 1 many parts are remote and inaccessible measurement locations are clustered mainly in the central part of the basin and frequency of observations is limited particularly at main stem locations and important tributaries in the lower part of the basin previous modelling efforts on the rufiji include a model of the great ruaha sub catchment fig 1 as part of a series of initiatives during the late 1990s and 2000s to understand the causes of dwindling dry season flows entering the ruaha national park that stopped flowing completely in 1993 kashaigili et al 2006a lankford et al 2004 walsh 2012 a recent basin scale study was conducted to support the rufiji basin water board rbwb in their planning of estimated water demands for hydropower production and agriculture wrem international 2015 other modelling studies in the basin are at the sub catchment scale and include application of the pitman model to the great ruaha river catchment tumbo and hughes 2015 assessing the effects of drying events in the usangu wetlands in the great ruaha river catchment using satellite radar altimetry kihwele et al 2017 statistical streamflow forecasting in the kilombero river yawson et al 2005 and applying the swat model to assess the impact of land use changes on streamflow in the same kilombero catchment leemhuis et al 2017 most of these models are primarily research tools we are unaware of any description of the rufiji basin hydrology in any global modelling study most global studies just feature the congo niger nile and zambezi rivers in africa part of our motivation for this study is to explore the potential opportunities of rapid advances in ghms for developing country applications by engaging with the global modelling community developing country researchers and government agencies might benefit from open access code collaborative support through networks of practice and consistency with evolving model structure and new input datasets use of such models also allows replicability comparability with other such models and possibly applications in ungauged basins we present a stepwise approach consisting of initial validation assessment against three hydrological performance indicators to examine how well the unmodified global model version performs followed by assessment of the incremental gains from sequential adjustments to the input data schematization of catchment areas and wetlands and limited parameter optimisation detailed assessments of the calibration and validation of a high resolution ghm for a regional application of this kind are rare we apply the latest version of lpjml lpjml4 schaphoff et al 2017b at 5 min resolution with the regionalised model we test as proof of concept whether a reduction in great ruaha river flow an issue of national concern and dispute lankford et al 2004 walsh 2012 can indeed be attributed mainly to irrigation and evaluate the influence of irrigation on flows at stiegler s gorge where a major hydropower dam is planned with potentially massive impact on the floodplain ecosystem downstream duvail et al 2014 2 methodology 2 1 the model lpjml lpjml lund potsdam jena managed land model is a hydrology and vegetation model that is usually applied at the global scale the model is unique in its combined representation of the dynamics of natural vegetation sitch et al 2003 agricultural production bondeau et al 2007 fader et al 2010 and hydrology gerten et al 2004 it includes human impacts on the water cycle through irrigation extraction rost et al 2008 and reservoir operation biemans et al 2011 evapotranspiration is calculated with the priestley taylor function using downward shortwave and longwave radiation and temperature unsaturated zone processes are described by a standard simple bucket type model consisting of six soil layers each with percolation if soil moisture is above field capacity and lateral drainage if soil moisture is above saturation schaphoff et al 2017b the transport of water in the river channel is approximated by a cascade of linear reservoirs river sections straight lines between the midpoints of cells are divided into homogeneous segments with a length of 10 km each treated as a linear reservoir river routing is calculated at a 3 hour time step with a globally constant flow velocity 1 m s schaphoff et al 2017b this means for our application at 5 arc minute resolution water can travel a distance of about 8 grid cells per day so that within 10 days runoff from the furthest point in the basin would reach the outlet this routing method excludes any floodplain or wetlands characteristics lpjml is a state of the art ghm and is included in several global model inter comparisons on hydrology and agriculture watermip by haddeland et al 2011 isimip by davie et al 2013 and agmip by rosenzweig et al 2013 lpjml is often used to study the linkage between water and food production and has the functionality to evaluate adaptation options related to land and water development biemans et al 2013 jägermeyr et al 2015 the model runs at a daily time step three recent improvements to the model as reported by schaphoff et al 2017b enabled our testing of the model at the regional scale first the resolution at which the model can be applied was increased from 30 to 5 s to match this new resolution the schematization of the river network was updated using the hydrosheds database lehner et al 2008 soil parameters at this resolution were derived from the harmonized world soil database v1 2 nachtergaele et al 2010 second a simple representation of groundwater was recently implemented using a linear reservoir model similar to that of wada et al 2010 this allows for estimation of unsustainable groundwater use by irrigation and for delayed groundwater drainage a single parameter gwcoeff controls the lag in groundwater outflow to the surface water by applying a linear reservoir model to the groundwater store third a variable infiltration capacity parameter p has been introduced by jägermeyr et al 2016 on managed land use which we also applied to the natural land use class we used this version of the global lpjml model as our baseline unmodified model and the subset of results for the rufiji catchment we call our rufiji global model fig 2 2 2 method step wise approach and data sets we designed a three step approach to modify the model and achieve better performance adjust and update essential input data using observations improve the schematization of wetlands and explore the effects of lags in groundwater and runoff via a limited parameter sensitivity analysis fig 2 2 2 1 input data adjustments chirps is a gridded global precipitation dataset combining cloud surface temperature with observations at 0 05 resolution it has been shown to compare favourably with similar global climatology products especially in areas with complex terrain and low station densities funk et al 2015 and has been tested for several regions in sub saharan africa hessels 2015 toté et al 2015 local deviations in precipitation can however have a large influence on simulated flow due to the non linear response of runoff to precipitation monthly chirps grid cell totals were therefore compared with observed monthly precipitation data of 19 rain gauges obtained from the rbwb and the climatic research unit cru to obtain a first order approximation of any bias chirps data were found to overestimate precipitation and so adjusted to correct bias on a sub catchment basis by linear scaling correcting for the mean percentage difference over the whole period of observation this led to a precipitation reduction of 13 over the kilombero river sub catchment and 9 over the rest of the basin fig 3 the land use dataset used by lpjml is based on mirca2000 a global dataset of cropping patterns of 26 major crop types for the year 2000 portmann et al 2010 major changes in land use between 2000 and 2008 2010 are reported in tanzanian government statistics ministry of agriculture of the united republic of tanzania 2017a b as also observed by leemhuis et al 2017 using remote sensing to reflect this we adjusted the land use in lpjml by simply applying the official estimate of percentage change to both rainfed and irrigated cropped areas in mirca2000 for the aggregated lpjml crop classes see supplement i which preserved the spatial pattern of existing land use in mirca2000 2 2 2 schematization correction while the hydrosheds database provides a detailed river flow routing at 5 resolution lehner et al 2008 at the scale of small sub catchments for which we evaluate the model performance small deviations in area can be significant for the total runoff see fig 1c for an example of the mbarali river sub catchment we first corrected for the difference in area between the gridded hydrosheds grid and the official sub catchment shapefiles from the rufiji basin water board applying a simple correction factor to simulated runoff per sub catchment see supplement sub catchments smaller than approximately 10 000 km2 show large errors in area in a second step we corrected for any spatial deviations due to errors in the routing scheme aggregating only the simulated runoff of gridcells within the shape of each sub catchment as a result we overrule the lpjml routing from this step onwards and instead calculate flow in a post processing procedure using gridcell runoff as input using the program r a third correction accounted for wetland evaporative losses which are not explicitly modelled by lpjml we applied a loss factor for wetlands upstream of the makalala flow observation point in the little ruaha river sub catchment for the well known usangu wetlands upstream in the great ruaha sub catchment upstream of point 14 at the confluence of multiple tributaries in fig 1a and for the kilombero wetland system to calibrate simulated mean annual flows to within a 10 deviation of observed flows at measurement points just downstream of these wetlands makalala for the little ruaha wetland msembe for the usangu wetland and kilombero swero for the kilombero wetland the usangu wetlands are known to delay flow kashaigili et al 2006a which was approximated by adding a lag of one month to all flow leaving the wetlands at any one time we applied the same delay to the kilombero and makalala wetlands 2 2 3 parameter sensitivity and optimization our aim was to use the original model parameters as far as possible with minimal adjustments but enough to achieve an acceptable simulation of monthly flow characteristics we therefore limited our calibration to a simple sensitivity analysis on two model parameters the infiltration capacity parameter p varied from 1 6 with 2 being default and 6 leading to the highest infiltration see eq 1 and a groundwater drainage lag recently introduced in lpjml gwcoeff varied from 1 90 180 to 270 days the infiltration rate qinf in mm day depends on the current soil water content of the first layer as follows 1 q i n f p r i r 1 s w w p w p w s a t w p w p p where prir is daily rain and applied irrigation water wsat is the soil water content at saturation and wpwp the soil water content at wilting point and sw the total actual soil water content of the first layer in mm the surplus water that does not infiltrate is assumed to generate surface runoff the groundwater coefficient gwcoeff in days defines the period over which a certain amount of seepage into the groundwater component at day i in days contributes to groundwater drainage at time t in days 2 q d r a i n t i t g w c o e f f t q s e e p i g w c o e f f where qdrain is the amount of groundwater drainage with qseep the amount of seepage at time i in days a higher gwcoeff means that seepage is spread out over a longer time period buffering peaks in drainage and if gwcoeff is high enough leading to a higher base flow in addition we added a surface water lag parameter to the total runoff of lpjml in post processing based on an initial assessment of observed hydrographs one which splits the monthly runoff surface runoff lateral runoff and groundwater drainage into an immediate component without lag a component with a one month lag and a tail component lagged for the five consecutive months this was implemented to solve some of the limitations of a simple bucket type model which does not capture the intricacies of subsurface drainage see e g the kilombero subcatchment study by lyon et al 2015 such a lag might also capture some of the delay due to storage in surface waters affected by the detail of small scale topography in reality which global river routing models tend to misrepresent yamazaki et al 2011 we applied the lag parameters uniformly over the whole basin rather than varying them by sub catchment since we had no information on their spatial distribution other parameters notably soil parameters were updated to latest available data but not calibrated standard crop parameters were used for which the planting and harvesting dates have recently been improved and validated for east africa waha et al 2013 2012 2 3 model performance assessment indicators daily observed flow data were obtained from the rbwb a total of 57 stations have been installed over the past decades in the rufiji basin but only a few have recorded consistently and during recent years rwbo 2013 sixteen stations provided some data for 1980 2010 for which results are shown out of which eight were selected to optimize the parameters those with long data series covering various parts of the basin see fig 1 simulated flows were compared with observations at a monthly time step after aggregating the daily data to monthly averages when more than three days in a month were missing the complete month was removed which led to a reduction of approximately 5 of the data for comparison of annual time series only years with data for all months were included we applied three basic hydrological indicators overall performance kling gupta model efficiency kge kge is a comprehensive metric a weighted average of the pearson product moment correlation coefficient the ratio between the mean of the simulated values and the mean of the observed ones and variability ratio which is computed using the standard deviation of simulated and observed kling gupta efficiencies range from infinity to 1 the closer to 1 the more precise the model is the two selected model parameters p and gwcoeff were optimised on the mean kge for the eight selected measurement locations kge is a useful overall metric and suitable as an environmental flow indicator as environmental flow requirements often depend on effective representation of both low flows and high flows low flows log transformed nash sutcliffe model efficiency lognse by taking the log of simulated and observed before calculating the nse the influence of missing peak flows is reduced and more emphasis is placed on the base flow the criticism of the standard nse is that it is overly sensitive to the magnitude and timing of peak flows e g schaefli and gupta 2007 lognse is a useful model performance indicator when one is interested in using a model to assess irrigation water availability during the low flow period volume errors relative volume errors rve rve gives an indication of whether the overall water balance is reasonably well simulated and is a useful indicator for assessing hydropower production with a model as total water availability is important when dam storage can buffer seasonality 2 4 study area rufiji basin the basin approximately 177 420 km2 in size includes a marked elevation range from sea level to 2960 m encompassing both dry and tropical climate zones as a result of a large gradient in total precipitation which ranges from 500 mm per year to more than 1500 mm per year see fig 6a for the spatial pattern precipitation is highly seasonal with a mix of uni and bi modal maxima together with a complex hydrology including several major wetland systems expanding irrigation and several hydropower reservoirs similar to other river basins in sub saharan africa the basin is experiencing rapid socio economic change and it also comprises a large part of a region earmarked for ambitious agricultural expansion the southern agricultural growth corridor of tanzania the rufiji produces roughly half of tanzania s river flow supplies water for 4 5 million people and generates 80 of the country s hydro power 464 mw at three hydropower sites almost 50 of the total combined national hydro thermal power capacity wrem international 2015 high development potential involves critical trade offs between the water energy agriculture and conservation sectors 3 results 3 1 step wise model improvement seasonal patterns the global model performs rather poorly for all gauging stations and all three indicators in the unmodified global run table 1 shows the performance per gauging station for the period 1981 2010 with fig 4 highlighting the eight selected sub catchments showing a step wise improvement in seasonal flow as modifications are applied fig 5 shows a taylor diagram a further graphical refinement of the kge indicator used to select the parameters the original ghm overestimates both absolute flow volume and seasonality underscoring a need for adjustment to input data and model specification to produce a simulation performance that is satisfactory for exploring scenarios there is no single adjustment that improved both volume and seasonality for all sub catchments the correction of precipitation input reduced simulated flow significantly in all sub catchments but did little to improve the indicators that describe seasonality the kge and lognse adjustments in routing and sub catchment area also have a strong effect however the direction of change differed between sub catchments for example the mbarali sub catchment see fig 1 for locations of gauging sites and sub catchments was oversized in the hydrosheds delineation and the area correction improved simulation of flow volumes in the chimala sub catchment the adjustment of area and routing of upstream runoff reduced flow volume below observed values thereby leading to a worse performance this however was a helpful finding as it uncovered errors elsewhere specific discharge i e volume of flow per unit of area was likely too low which could have been a result of an underrepresentation of precipitation in this small sub catchment represented by just a couple of grid cells including a steep elevation gradient the reduction and one month delay in flow by the wetland factor for the little ruaha above makalala improved flow estimates for the immediate downstream location of makalala and for locations further downstream along the little ruaha wetland losses of 50 of flow were required to bring rve within 10 of observations for usangu in the great ruaha river assumed losses of 35 were sufficient to bring the rve at msembe within 10 of observations this loss in flow translates into an area specific loss over the usanga plains 4480 km2 kashaigili et al 2006b of 2 5 3 mm day during and just after the wet season when the plains are flooded or saturated january june this corresponds well with the evapotranspiration deficit over this area as calculated by lpjml monthly averages vary between 2 3 and 4 mm day for the period january june a deficit that could be considered an approximation of potential additional wetland evapotranspiration for the kilombero wetlands no additional losses were imposed as this would have led to further underestimation of flows limited available observations of questionable quality kilombero swero observations only overlap three years with our simulation period with several data gaps especially during the wet season complicate deriving a loss factor based on the rve lower losses than for the other wetlands could be expected though as in this wetter part of the basin the difference between actual and simulated soil evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration is relatively modest during the wet season land use adjustments had only a very small effect with changes in runoff due to updated vegetation cover very limited and increased irrigation demand due to change in crop water requirements hardly visible partly this is due to the order in which improvement steps have been introduced it is only after the seasonality of flow has been improved that by introducing a greater lag through the parameter optimization which leads to more base flow allowing irrigation demand to be met in months when precipitation is mostly absent reductions in flow in the dry seasons as a result of introducing irrigation improved model performance especially at msembe which lies downstream of the major rice growing area in the great ruaha sub catchment fig 6 c shows the concentration of irrigation in the western drier part of the basin where large commercial farms are fed by runoff from the neighbouring hills we simulated an irrigation water demand for the basin of 2 2 bcm per year similar to that reported in the river basin management plan 2 4 bcm per year wrem international 2015 the introduction of a uniform lag in surface water runoff was most effective in improving the seasonality which greatly improved the lognse and kge indicators optimal values were a lag of one month for 35 of flow and further delay of another 15 of flow equally divided over the next consecutive five months interestingly the infiltration parameters and groundwater lag coefficient gave best results for selected stations when kept at their original values our final modified local model lpjmllocal matches both the total monthly volumes and seasonality of the observations at the eight selected sub catchments rather well with the initial overestimation of flow of more than 100 reduced to on average only 4 and kge values increased to on average 0 7 lognse representing low flow conditions improved but only to moderate levels 0 4 on average mainly because of overestimation of low flows in the little ruaha sub catchment of the other stations in table 1 some measuring flows from small upstream sub catchments like the mtitu ruaha kigogo and yovi perform poorly fig 4 also shows there is a trade off in performance between sub catchments especially during the months november till february with some requiring a stronger seasonality e g the little ruaha river stations while others would improve with lower peak flows during the rainy season e g chimala river at chitekelo if parameters would be calibrated per sub catchment rather than for the basin as a whole better performances would be achieved but such a differentiation in parameter values should preferably be guided by sub catchment specific process understanding 3 2 simulation of monthly and annual flow time series monthly time series for the 1981 2010 period show in more detail the match between simulated and observed fig 6 while lpjmllocal does well in reproducing the overall pattern some peaks e g in the mbarali igawa catchment in 1992 are missed the high flows during the 1997 1998 el niño event are visible in several sub catchments indicating that the basin was mainly influenced by wet conditions more typical of the east african response to el niño rather than the dry normal conditions more typical of southern africa recent low flow years in 2000 2003 and 2006 are well captured by the model observed flows at msembe for 1997 1998 are shown dotted fig 7 and have been excluded from the evaluation while flows in the great ruaha were reported higher during this year e g by citizen observer www theruahanotes com great ruaha river the extremity of values more than 10 times the average flow is difficult to explain upstream catchments mbarali ndembera salimwani did record higher flows during this el niño year but not to this extent equally precipitation measurements at msembe and other stations close by show an increase during the rainy season but only a modest one extrapolation of the rating curve with which water levels are translated into flows to such an extremes is prone to errors e g di baldassarre and montanari 2009 and they are of limited accuracy beyond the range for which they were established which suggests these observations should be used with caution simulation of annual flows is reasonable with the exception of chimala at chitekelo the smallest sub catchment evaluated and the little ruaha at ihimbu table 2 reasons for lower kge are different in each sub catchment in mbarali for example fig 8 especially the last three years 2008 2010 are simulated drier than observed but it is unclear why as both observed rainfall and the chirps rainfall product used in the hydrological model seem to correspond well and signal average or below average precipitation during these years a possible explanation could be the influence of isolated cloud bursts on runoff not picked up by satellite in this small catchment in a hilly region more generally fewer data points in the annual time series with years omitted completely if a single month was missing means that a single outlier year will strongly affect the performance indicators this explains partly the low values for little ruaha at ihimbu where two wet outliers not observed in the neighbouring downstream point at ndiuka strongly influence the kge value limited resources a vast catchment and difficult road conditions complicate data collection especially during the rainy season 3 3 irrigation expansion affecting downstream flows an improved local hydrology vegetation model provides an opportunity to evaluate the interaction between upstream water abstractions for irrigation and downstream flow causes of reduced dry season flows since the beginning of the 1990s in the great ruaha river have long been contentious because of their role in the ruaha national park increased abstraction from rice cultivation in the upstream regions has been suggested to be the main cause but disagreement about the effect of climate variability or the contribution of the expanding and non stationary usangu wetland to reduced flows lankford et al 2004 remains fig 9 shows pre 1980 observed flow variation mean and 0 25 0 75 quantile range and the 1981 2010 observed seasonality which indicates flows have diminished at the end of the long rains in april may and into the low flow season historically flow could be observed year round at msembe the main gauging site below usangu wetland dropping in november but still enough to maintain a basic ecosystem function e g providing water for wildlife in the ruaha national park and surrounding areas in only two months in 1980 did average monthly flows drop below 1 m3 s in the last decades since 1981 flow has reduced to almost zero from september onwards leaving the great ruaha river almost dry for months on end the lpjmllocal model reproduces well this reduced flow during the 1981 2010 period switching off irrigation in the model brings back a pattern that matches the historic observed flows reasonably well though flows in january and february seem to be slightly overestimated similar to historic observations the model shows that no low flows are extremely rare under natural flow conditions without water abstractions further downstream at stiegler s gorge is the site of one of the largest hydropower schemes currently in the planning and development stage in africa the irrigation extraction of 2 2 bcm per year has only a modest effect on flows at this location here close to the delta the rufiji has increased to a large river with an annual flow of about 35 bcm although this fluctuates from less than 20 bcm to more than 40 bcm per year note that the observed series at this critical point in the basin stops in 1978 a median monthly reduction in flow at stiegler s due to irrigation abstractions of 4 5 was simulated with the model 25 percentile 2 6 75 percentile 7 8 reduction and only in two months over the whole 30 years time series did simulated flow drop below 100 m3 s at stiegler s gorge partly due to upstream irrigation abstractions if however upstream demand for irrigation more than triples to 7 6 bcm in 2030 as suggested by the basin water resources development plan wrem international 2015 irrigation is likely to have a much more significant effect on downstream water availability especially in dry years 4 discussion everywhere and locally relevant has been posed as the ultimate aim of global hydrological modelling bierkens et al 2015 in this paper we examined the performance of a well known ghm lpjml for a medium sized basin in eastern africa the rufiji basin the rather poor performance of the original model in its global configuration is not surprising given the complex hydrology multiple wetlands systems seasonal inundation of the basin the steep gradients in elevation and precipitation and the limited schematization of delayed runoff and groundwater processes in lpjml it is a hard target to hit with an uncalibrated global model our study finds that for scenario analysis or water management applications further calibration and validation against observed discharge is required as also mentioned by hattermann et al 2017 our study does provide several suggestions for what could be relatively simple but effective steps in the regionalization of a ghm like lpjml that uses global input data the first step considered input data and precipitation adjustment using a comparison of global remote sensed input data against local observations was most effective in achieving a good simulation of the annual water balance more advanced methods to correct precipitation than used in this paper could be applied e g through elevation informed interpolation of station data rather than using a single sub catchment based adjustment factor the adjustments made are relatively modest and not uncommon in this scale of hydrological modelling but due to the non linear nature between precipitation and runoff they lead to large changes in simulated flows and hence the high model sensitivity to bias in input data in the case of the rufiji local data on catchment areas was important for some sub catchments particularly small ones in areas of high precipitation second introducing lags in surface water runoff one representing site specific processes in our case wetlands and one compensating for general limitations to process description schematization and parameterization was essential to reproduce the observed seasonal pattern of flow for the rufiji due to almost total lack of information on wetlands in the kilombero and makalala and limited data on those in the usanga plains adding the most basic functions of such wetlands through a delay of 1 month and a loss as a fraction of flow was felt to be a reasonable compromise between rigour and practice specific losses for usanga corresponded well with the evapotranspiration deficit during the rainy season providing some confidence in the approach more advanced methods like treating them as a non linear storage reservoir with variable evapotranspiration based on surface water level and vegetation development could potentially lead to a better simulation of surface water losses and flow delay several alternatives have recently been described and tested pereira et al 2017 yamazaki et al 2011 but were considered beyond the scope of this study as they would require a major reconfiguration of lpjml the non site specific lag introduced represented those delays in soil and surface water not explicitly included in process description or parameterisation the soil module with the local parameterisation derived from the harmonized soil database appeared to react particularly rigid separating water in the soil column mainly between fast surface runoff and slow groundwater discharge with no intermediate lateral flow a more catchment specific schematization of soil layers not available for the rufiji but possibly available for other basins might improve separation between fast runoff and medium to slow lateral and deep drainage in the context of optimizing a conceptual two parameter model over a large number of catchments mouelhi et al 2006 found the exchange with the outside of the basin e g our wetland losses and the routing storage capacity the most important parameters followed by the soil moisture storage capacity similar to our lag parameters third whilst trying to stay as close to the original ghm it was useful to examine the effects of adjusting some model parameters considered critical for key characteristics of observed flows we found the lag parameters to be most critical issues of equifinality e g between groundwater lag and surface water lag parameters could be further explored guiding this process with local understanding of sub catchment specific processes could allow calibration by sub catchment rather than for the basin as a whole however taking this too far begins to replicate development of a bespoke model which is not the purpose of this study including more ghms targeting the same catchment s would make an interesting opportunity for cross comparison after improvements the lpjml model performed well in simulating average annual flows monthly time series and seasonal patterns and reasonably well in simulating observed inter annual variability whilst we note that some fairly important assumptions have been made to arrive at the final model version these are not unprecedented in this scale of hydrological modelling particularly in areas such as the rufiji that are very data sparse the simulation performance is adequate to use the model for exploring the effects of recent environmental change future scenarios and sensitivity analysis for example we show that depletion of flows especially during the dry season in the great ruaha river during recent decades can be largely accounted for by increased irrigation abstractions critical data requirements for further model development include information on wetland characteristics this would allow a stronger focus on simulation of daily flow characteristics but is some way off given the present data situation and in situ measurements of precipitation and discharge specifically for downstream major tributaries kilombero and luwegu and the rufiji main stem a key question that remains is whether it is worth adjusting a global model to apply it to a medium sized basin the time spent improving lpjml in the order of months for just one basin most probably equals the time that would have been spent setting up a designated hydrological model like swat many of the steps have required and benefitted from local sources of data and existing reports on the hydrology and environment in the basin however as ghms improve resolution and schematization fewer local adjustments may be required they could be more targeted and the adjustment time greatly reduced using lessons learned from studies such as this in large developing countries with data sparse regions and few long duration good quality flow records application of a regionalised ghm would have significant benefits to allow consistent modelling of multiple basins and opportunities for local researchers to link with global research networks and access open source models 5 conclusions our study contains a dual message whilst the ghm under consideration lpjml in its original configuration does provide a first approximation of rufiji hydrology capturing much of the spatial variation in rainfall and evapotranspiration leading to varying flows at different locations for it to do well at the local scale and to be accurate enough to explore sensitivities and scenarios various catchment specific modifications are needed stepwise implementation of relatively simple modifications revealed the most important step to improve flow volumes was precipitation adjustment to improve seasonality introducing a lag in surface water runoff was the most effective measure local sources of in situ data and information on the hydrology and environment have been essential for the regionalisation process but there remain critical data requirements for further model development this modified version of a ghm is robust enough to explore water management questions such as assessment of the impact of climate or land use changes on hydropower or irrigation plans we show as a proof of concept that a reduction in the great ruaha river flow can be explained by increased irrigation but that the influence of irrigation based on the area under irrigation in 2010 on flows much further downstream at stiegler s gorge where large hydropower infrastructure is planned is modest projected demand from irrigation expansion

8498,study region the rufiji basin east africa study focus rapid advances in global hydrological model ghm resolution model features and in situ and remotely sensed datasets are driving progress towards local relevance and application despite their increasing use however evaluation of local hydrological performance of ghms is rare in this paper we examine the performance of a well known ghm lpjml recently modified to 9 km resolution with and without modest steps to regionalise the model we consider the rufiji river basin an economically important medium size basin in eastern africa new hydrological insights for the region our results indicate that the unmodified ghm does provide a reasonable first approximation of spatial variability in mean flow conditions but scores rather poorly on seasonal and inter annual variability for the model to achieve levels of performance indicators comparable with bespoke modelling modifications to model inputs additional runoff delay and wetland parameterization were required the largest improvements are associated with adjustments in precipitation and enhanced runoff delay with the modified version as a proof of concept we show that a well known drying trend in a major tributary of the rufiji can be explained by implementing irrigation abstractions in the model overall the results suggest that with limited and fairly simple modification ghms can be regionalised to allow their use for scenario testing and further exploration of key local processes in basins with limited observational data keywords lpjml global hydrological model regionalization rufiji irrigation abstractions water resources stiegler s gorge 1 introduction global hydrological and land surface models further ghms are undergoing rapid development ever greater computational capacity and data storage further supported by developments in remote sensing the availability of gridded observation datasets and meteorological forcing data have allowed model development at higher spatial resolution covering larger areas e g flörke et al 2013 sutanudjaja et al 2017 these high resolution models with resolutions of 5 arc minutes 9 km at the equator or higher are able to model the hydrological cycle in catchments across the whole world uniformly and systematically including in regions for which in situ observations are scarce or where the capacity to conduct continued and detailed hydrological modelling is limited ghms are now almost similar in scale at least in spatial resolution if not yet in process detail to the domain of applied river basin hydrological studies as ghms increase in spatial resolution there is more potential to interpret their results at basin and sub basin scales moving beyond continental and regional scale descriptions of water scarcity and climate change impacts to sectoral issues like national food security or hydropower potential at levels of detail relevant for management applications for example ghm outputs are now being considered in the context of water resource management questions related to flood risk trigg et al 2016 winsemius et al 2015 and for providing a range of hydro meteorological services as jury 2017 tested for zambia while there is still debate on the importance of resolution over epistemic uncertainties beven and cloke 2012 bierkens et al 2015 wood et al 2012 both proponents and sceptics agree that moving to higher resolutions will provide better opportunity to compare multi model output against local observations and knowledge of stakeholders beven and cloke 2012 bierkens et al 2015 but despite their increasing use and many high impact publications based on ghms elliott et al 2014 gleeson et al 2012 schewe et al 2014 they are generally not extensively tested for hydrological performance validation is often limited to comparison of monthly means at major river basin scale e g greuell et al 2015 langerwisch et al 2013 schaphoff et al 2017a veldkamp et al 2018 with individual gauge catchment areas typically greater than 5000 km2 in a meta analysis of applications of the vic ghm melsen et al 2016 show that despite an increase in spatial resolution the time interval over which the model was calibrated and validated did not change over time detailed process understanding explanation of catchment specific behaviour and within catchment comparative analysis are generally lacking calibration shown to improve global hydrological model validation is usually not done beck et al 2017 finally and particularly relevant for catchments in data scarce regions like sub saharan africa validation of ghms is done mostly against flow observations from one global database monthly runoff from the grdc http www bafg de grdc which could introduce bias as few station locations in the tropical to arid zones in sub saharan africa are included see e g figures in beck et al 2017 trigg et al 2016 found in a comparison of flood hazard maps for africa derived from six global models recognising their limited validation significant variations between flood hazard magnitudes with important implications for model reliability and interpretation of results for the reasons above there is a growing need for greater focus on ghm performance at basin and sub basin scales to assess confidence in simulation results and to diagnose and rectify issues with model performance we recognise that a model evaluation should reflect the model s purpose not all developers of ghms claim their models are suitable at the local scale or for management still many studies implicitly rely on the models to do well locally and seasonally even if results are presented at a global scale and aggregated to annual means estimates of hydropower generation environmental flows conditions or sustainable ground water abstraction for irrigation all rely heavily on a realistic estimation of seasonality and variability in flows at specific locations in this paper we take a case study approach and consider the suitability of using an established and open source ghm lpjml schaphoff et al 2017b to simulate the hydrology in a mid sized basin in east africa with a view to support river basin management the rufiji basin is the largest and most economically important river basin in tanzania and the largest basin located within one country in eastern africa see fig 1 many parts are remote and inaccessible measurement locations are clustered mainly in the central part of the basin and frequency of observations is limited particularly at main stem locations and important tributaries in the lower part of the basin previous modelling efforts on the rufiji include a model of the great ruaha sub catchment fig 1 as part of a series of initiatives during the late 1990s and 2000s to understand the causes of dwindling dry season flows entering the ruaha national park that stopped flowing completely in 1993 kashaigili et al 2006a lankford et al 2004 walsh 2012 a recent basin scale study was conducted to support the rufiji basin water board rbwb in their planning of estimated water demands for hydropower production and agriculture wrem international 2015 other modelling studies in the basin are at the sub catchment scale and include application of the pitman model to the great ruaha river catchment tumbo and hughes 2015 assessing the effects of drying events in the usangu wetlands in the great ruaha river catchment using satellite radar altimetry kihwele et al 2017 statistical streamflow forecasting in the kilombero river yawson et al 2005 and applying the swat model to assess the impact of land use changes on streamflow in the same kilombero catchment leemhuis et al 2017 most of these models are primarily research tools we are unaware of any description of the rufiji basin hydrology in any global modelling study most global studies just feature the congo niger nile and zambezi rivers in africa part of our motivation for this study is to explore the potential opportunities of rapid advances in ghms for developing country applications by engaging with the global modelling community developing country researchers and government agencies might benefit from open access code collaborative support through networks of practice and consistency with evolving model structure and new input datasets use of such models also allows replicability comparability with other such models and possibly applications in ungauged basins we present a stepwise approach consisting of initial validation assessment against three hydrological performance indicators to examine how well the unmodified global model version performs followed by assessment of the incremental gains from sequential adjustments to the input data schematization of catchment areas and wetlands and limited parameter optimisation detailed assessments of the calibration and validation of a high resolution ghm for a regional application of this kind are rare we apply the latest version of lpjml lpjml4 schaphoff et al 2017b at 5 min resolution with the regionalised model we test as proof of concept whether a reduction in great ruaha river flow an issue of national concern and dispute lankford et al 2004 walsh 2012 can indeed be attributed mainly to irrigation and evaluate the influence of irrigation on flows at stiegler s gorge where a major hydropower dam is planned with potentially massive impact on the floodplain ecosystem downstream duvail et al 2014 2 methodology 2 1 the model lpjml lpjml lund potsdam jena managed land model is a hydrology and vegetation model that is usually applied at the global scale the model is unique in its combined representation of the dynamics of natural vegetation sitch et al 2003 agricultural production bondeau et al 2007 fader et al 2010 and hydrology gerten et al 2004 it includes human impacts on the water cycle through irrigation extraction rost et al 2008 and reservoir operation biemans et al 2011 evapotranspiration is calculated with the priestley taylor function using downward shortwave and longwave radiation and temperature unsaturated zone processes are described by a standard simple bucket type model consisting of six soil layers each with percolation if soil moisture is above field capacity and lateral drainage if soil moisture is above saturation schaphoff et al 2017b the transport of water in the river channel is approximated by a cascade of linear reservoirs river sections straight lines between the midpoints of cells are divided into homogeneous segments with a length of 10 km each treated as a linear reservoir river routing is calculated at a 3 hour time step with a globally constant flow velocity 1 m s schaphoff et al 2017b this means for our application at 5 arc minute resolution water can travel a distance of about 8 grid cells per day so that within 10 days runoff from the furthest point in the basin would reach the outlet this routing method excludes any floodplain or wetlands characteristics lpjml is a state of the art ghm and is included in several global model inter comparisons on hydrology and agriculture watermip by haddeland et al 2011 isimip by davie et al 2013 and agmip by rosenzweig et al 2013 lpjml is often used to study the linkage between water and food production and has the functionality to evaluate adaptation options related to land and water development biemans et al 2013 jägermeyr et al 2015 the model runs at a daily time step three recent improvements to the model as reported by schaphoff et al 2017b enabled our testing of the model at the regional scale first the resolution at which the model can be applied was increased from 30 to 5 s to match this new resolution the schematization of the river network was updated using the hydrosheds database lehner et al 2008 soil parameters at this resolution were derived from the harmonized world soil database v1 2 nachtergaele et al 2010 second a simple representation of groundwater was recently implemented using a linear reservoir model similar to that of wada et al 2010 this allows for estimation of unsustainable groundwater use by irrigation and for delayed groundwater drainage a single parameter gwcoeff controls the lag in groundwater outflow to the surface water by applying a linear reservoir model to the groundwater store third a variable infiltration capacity parameter p has been introduced by jägermeyr et al 2016 on managed land use which we also applied to the natural land use class we used this version of the global lpjml model as our baseline unmodified model and the subset of results for the rufiji catchment we call our rufiji global model fig 2 2 2 method step wise approach and data sets we designed a three step approach to modify the model and achieve better performance adjust and update essential input data using observations improve the schematization of wetlands and explore the effects of lags in groundwater and runoff via a limited parameter sensitivity analysis fig 2 2 2 1 input data adjustments chirps is a gridded global precipitation dataset combining cloud surface temperature with observations at 0 05 resolution it has been shown to compare favourably with similar global climatology products especially in areas with complex terrain and low station densities funk et al 2015 and has been tested for several regions in sub saharan africa hessels 2015 toté et al 2015 local deviations in precipitation can however have a large influence on simulated flow due to the non linear response of runoff to precipitation monthly chirps grid cell totals were therefore compared with observed monthly precipitation data of 19 rain gauges obtained from the rbwb and the climatic research unit cru to obtain a first order approximation of any bias chirps data were found to overestimate precipitation and so adjusted to correct bias on a sub catchment basis by linear scaling correcting for the mean percentage difference over the whole period of observation this led to a precipitation reduction of 13 over the kilombero river sub catchment and 9 over the rest of the basin fig 3 the land use dataset used by lpjml is based on mirca2000 a global dataset of cropping patterns of 26 major crop types for the year 2000 portmann et al 2010 major changes in land use between 2000 and 2008 2010 are reported in tanzanian government statistics ministry of agriculture of the united republic of tanzania 2017a b as also observed by leemhuis et al 2017 using remote sensing to reflect this we adjusted the land use in lpjml by simply applying the official estimate of percentage change to both rainfed and irrigated cropped areas in mirca2000 for the aggregated lpjml crop classes see supplement i which preserved the spatial pattern of existing land use in mirca2000 2 2 2 schematization correction while the hydrosheds database provides a detailed river flow routing at 5 resolution lehner et al 2008 at the scale of small sub catchments for which we evaluate the model performance small deviations in area can be significant for the total runoff see fig 1c for an example of the mbarali river sub catchment we first corrected for the difference in area between the gridded hydrosheds grid and the official sub catchment shapefiles from the rufiji basin water board applying a simple correction factor to simulated runoff per sub catchment see supplement sub catchments smaller than approximately 10 000 km2 show large errors in area in a second step we corrected for any spatial deviations due to errors in the routing scheme aggregating only the simulated runoff of gridcells within the shape of each sub catchment as a result we overrule the lpjml routing from this step onwards and instead calculate flow in a post processing procedure using gridcell runoff as input using the program r a third correction accounted for wetland evaporative losses which are not explicitly modelled by lpjml we applied a loss factor for wetlands upstream of the makalala flow observation point in the little ruaha river sub catchment for the well known usangu wetlands upstream in the great ruaha sub catchment upstream of point 14 at the confluence of multiple tributaries in fig 1a and for the kilombero wetland system to calibrate simulated mean annual flows to within a 10 deviation of observed flows at measurement points just downstream of these wetlands makalala for the little ruaha wetland msembe for the usangu wetland and kilombero swero for the kilombero wetland the usangu wetlands are known to delay flow kashaigili et al 2006a which was approximated by adding a lag of one month to all flow leaving the wetlands at any one time we applied the same delay to the kilombero and makalala wetlands 2 2 3 parameter sensitivity and optimization our aim was to use the original model parameters as far as possible with minimal adjustments but enough to achieve an acceptable simulation of monthly flow characteristics we therefore limited our calibration to a simple sensitivity analysis on two model parameters the infiltration capacity parameter p varied from 1 6 with 2 being default and 6 leading to the highest infiltration see eq 1 and a groundwater drainage lag recently introduced in lpjml gwcoeff varied from 1 90 180 to 270 days the infiltration rate qinf in mm day depends on the current soil water content of the first layer as follows 1 q i n f p r i r 1 s w w p w p w s a t w p w p p where prir is daily rain and applied irrigation water wsat is the soil water content at saturation and wpwp the soil water content at wilting point and sw the total actual soil water content of the first layer in mm the surplus water that does not infiltrate is assumed to generate surface runoff the groundwater coefficient gwcoeff in days defines the period over which a certain amount of seepage into the groundwater component at day i in days contributes to groundwater drainage at time t in days 2 q d r a i n t i t g w c o e f f t q s e e p i g w c o e f f where qdrain is the amount of groundwater drainage with qseep the amount of seepage at time i in days a higher gwcoeff means that seepage is spread out over a longer time period buffering peaks in drainage and if gwcoeff is high enough leading to a higher base flow in addition we added a surface water lag parameter to the total runoff of lpjml in post processing based on an initial assessment of observed hydrographs one which splits the monthly runoff surface runoff lateral runoff and groundwater drainage into an immediate component without lag a component with a one month lag and a tail component lagged for the five consecutive months this was implemented to solve some of the limitations of a simple bucket type model which does not capture the intricacies of subsurface drainage see e g the kilombero subcatchment study by lyon et al 2015 such a lag might also capture some of the delay due to storage in surface waters affected by the detail of small scale topography in reality which global river routing models tend to misrepresent yamazaki et al 2011 we applied the lag parameters uniformly over the whole basin rather than varying them by sub catchment since we had no information on their spatial distribution other parameters notably soil parameters were updated to latest available data but not calibrated standard crop parameters were used for which the planting and harvesting dates have recently been improved and validated for east africa waha et al 2013 2012 2 3 model performance assessment indicators daily observed flow data were obtained from the rbwb a total of 57 stations have been installed over the past decades in the rufiji basin but only a few have recorded consistently and during recent years rwbo 2013 sixteen stations provided some data for 1980 2010 for which results are shown out of which eight were selected to optimize the parameters those with long data series covering various parts of the basin see fig 1 simulated flows were compared with observations at a monthly time step after aggregating the daily data to monthly averages when more than three days in a month were missing the complete month was removed which led to a reduction of approximately 5 of the data for comparison of annual time series only years with data for all months were included we applied three basic hydrological indicators overall performance kling gupta model efficiency kge kge is a comprehensive metric a weighted average of the pearson product moment correlation coefficient the ratio between the mean of the simulated values and the mean of the observed ones and variability ratio which is computed using the standard deviation of simulated and observed kling gupta efficiencies range from infinity to 1 the closer to 1 the more precise the model is the two selected model parameters p and gwcoeff were optimised on the mean kge for the eight selected measurement locations kge is a useful overall metric and suitable as an environmental flow indicator as environmental flow requirements often depend on effective representation of both low flows and high flows low flows log transformed nash sutcliffe model efficiency lognse by taking the log of simulated and observed before calculating the nse the influence of missing peak flows is reduced and more emphasis is placed on the base flow the criticism of the standard nse is that it is overly sensitive to the magnitude and timing of peak flows e g schaefli and gupta 2007 lognse is a useful model performance indicator when one is interested in using a model to assess irrigation water availability during the low flow period volume errors relative volume errors rve rve gives an indication of whether the overall water balance is reasonably well simulated and is a useful indicator for assessing hydropower production with a model as total water availability is important when dam storage can buffer seasonality 2 4 study area rufiji basin the basin approximately 177 420 km2 in size includes a marked elevation range from sea level to 2960 m encompassing both dry and tropical climate zones as a result of a large gradient in total precipitation which ranges from 500 mm per year to more than 1500 mm per year see fig 6a for the spatial pattern precipitation is highly seasonal with a mix of uni and bi modal maxima together with a complex hydrology including several major wetland systems expanding irrigation and several hydropower reservoirs similar to other river basins in sub saharan africa the basin is experiencing rapid socio economic change and it also comprises a large part of a region earmarked for ambitious agricultural expansion the southern agricultural growth corridor of tanzania the rufiji produces roughly half of tanzania s river flow supplies water for 4 5 million people and generates 80 of the country s hydro power 464 mw at three hydropower sites almost 50 of the total combined national hydro thermal power capacity wrem international 2015 high development potential involves critical trade offs between the water energy agriculture and conservation sectors 3 results 3 1 step wise model improvement seasonal patterns the global model performs rather poorly for all gauging stations and all three indicators in the unmodified global run table 1 shows the performance per gauging station for the period 1981 2010 with fig 4 highlighting the eight selected sub catchments showing a step wise improvement in seasonal flow as modifications are applied fig 5 shows a taylor diagram a further graphical refinement of the kge indicator used to select the parameters the original ghm overestimates both absolute flow volume and seasonality underscoring a need for adjustment to input data and model specification to produce a simulation performance that is satisfactory for exploring scenarios there is no single adjustment that improved both volume and seasonality for all sub catchments the correction of precipitation input reduced simulated flow significantly in all sub catchments but did little to improve the indicators that describe seasonality the kge and lognse adjustments in routing and sub catchment area also have a strong effect however the direction of change differed between sub catchments for example the mbarali sub catchment see fig 1 for locations of gauging sites and sub catchments was oversized in the hydrosheds delineation and the area correction improved simulation of flow volumes in the chimala sub catchment the adjustment of area and routing of upstream runoff reduced flow volume below observed values thereby leading to a worse performance this however was a helpful finding as it uncovered errors elsewhere specific discharge i e volume of flow per unit of area was likely too low which could have been a result of an underrepresentation of precipitation in this small sub catchment represented by just a couple of grid cells including a steep elevation gradient the reduction and one month delay in flow by the wetland factor for the little ruaha above makalala improved flow estimates for the immediate downstream location of makalala and for locations further downstream along the little ruaha wetland losses of 50 of flow were required to bring rve within 10 of observations for usangu in the great ruaha river assumed losses of 35 were sufficient to bring the rve at msembe within 10 of observations this loss in flow translates into an area specific loss over the usanga plains 4480 km2 kashaigili et al 2006b of 2 5 3 mm day during and just after the wet season when the plains are flooded or saturated january june this corresponds well with the evapotranspiration deficit over this area as calculated by lpjml monthly averages vary between 2 3 and 4 mm day for the period january june a deficit that could be considered an approximation of potential additional wetland evapotranspiration for the kilombero wetlands no additional losses were imposed as this would have led to further underestimation of flows limited available observations of questionable quality kilombero swero observations only overlap three years with our simulation period with several data gaps especially during the wet season complicate deriving a loss factor based on the rve lower losses than for the other wetlands could be expected though as in this wetter part of the basin the difference between actual and simulated soil evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration is relatively modest during the wet season land use adjustments had only a very small effect with changes in runoff due to updated vegetation cover very limited and increased irrigation demand due to change in crop water requirements hardly visible partly this is due to the order in which improvement steps have been introduced it is only after the seasonality of flow has been improved that by introducing a greater lag through the parameter optimization which leads to more base flow allowing irrigation demand to be met in months when precipitation is mostly absent reductions in flow in the dry seasons as a result of introducing irrigation improved model performance especially at msembe which lies downstream of the major rice growing area in the great ruaha sub catchment fig 6 c shows the concentration of irrigation in the western drier part of the basin where large commercial farms are fed by runoff from the neighbouring hills we simulated an irrigation water demand for the basin of 2 2 bcm per year similar to that reported in the river basin management plan 2 4 bcm per year wrem international 2015 the introduction of a uniform lag in surface water runoff was most effective in improving the seasonality which greatly improved the lognse and kge indicators optimal values were a lag of one month for 35 of flow and further delay of another 15 of flow equally divided over the next consecutive five months interestingly the infiltration parameters and groundwater lag coefficient gave best results for selected stations when kept at their original values our final modified local model lpjmllocal matches both the total monthly volumes and seasonality of the observations at the eight selected sub catchments rather well with the initial overestimation of flow of more than 100 reduced to on average only 4 and kge values increased to on average 0 7 lognse representing low flow conditions improved but only to moderate levels 0 4 on average mainly because of overestimation of low flows in the little ruaha sub catchment of the other stations in table 1 some measuring flows from small upstream sub catchments like the mtitu ruaha kigogo and yovi perform poorly fig 4 also shows there is a trade off in performance between sub catchments especially during the months november till february with some requiring a stronger seasonality e g the little ruaha river stations while others would improve with lower peak flows during the rainy season e g chimala river at chitekelo if parameters would be calibrated per sub catchment rather than for the basin as a whole better performances would be achieved but such a differentiation in parameter values should preferably be guided by sub catchment specific process understanding 3 2 simulation of monthly and annual flow time series monthly time series for the 1981 2010 period show in more detail the match between simulated and observed fig 6 while lpjmllocal does well in reproducing the overall pattern some peaks e g in the mbarali igawa catchment in 1992 are missed the high flows during the 1997 1998 el niño event are visible in several sub catchments indicating that the basin was mainly influenced by wet conditions more typical of the east african response to el niño rather than the dry normal conditions more typical of southern africa recent low flow years in 2000 2003 and 2006 are well captured by the model observed flows at msembe for 1997 1998 are shown dotted fig 7 and have been excluded from the evaluation while flows in the great ruaha were reported higher during this year e g by citizen observer www theruahanotes com great ruaha river the extremity of values more than 10 times the average flow is difficult to explain upstream catchments mbarali ndembera salimwani did record higher flows during this el niño year but not to this extent equally precipitation measurements at msembe and other stations close by show an increase during the rainy season but only a modest one extrapolation of the rating curve with which water levels are translated into flows to such an extremes is prone to errors e g di baldassarre and montanari 2009 and they are of limited accuracy beyond the range for which they were established which suggests these observations should be used with caution simulation of annual flows is reasonable with the exception of chimala at chitekelo the smallest sub catchment evaluated and the little ruaha at ihimbu table 2 reasons for lower kge are different in each sub catchment in mbarali for example fig 8 especially the last three years 2008 2010 are simulated drier than observed but it is unclear why as both observed rainfall and the chirps rainfall product used in the hydrological model seem to correspond well and signal average or below average precipitation during these years a possible explanation could be the influence of isolated cloud bursts on runoff not picked up by satellite in this small catchment in a hilly region more generally fewer data points in the annual time series with years omitted completely if a single month was missing means that a single outlier year will strongly affect the performance indicators this explains partly the low values for little ruaha at ihimbu where two wet outliers not observed in the neighbouring downstream point at ndiuka strongly influence the kge value limited resources a vast catchment and difficult road conditions complicate data collection especially during the rainy season 3 3 irrigation expansion affecting downstream flows an improved local hydrology vegetation model provides an opportunity to evaluate the interaction between upstream water abstractions for irrigation and downstream flow causes of reduced dry season flows since the beginning of the 1990s in the great ruaha river have long been contentious because of their role in the ruaha national park increased abstraction from rice cultivation in the upstream regions has been suggested to be the main cause but disagreement about the effect of climate variability or the contribution of the expanding and non stationary usangu wetland to reduced flows lankford et al 2004 remains fig 9 shows pre 1980 observed flow variation mean and 0 25 0 75 quantile range and the 1981 2010 observed seasonality which indicates flows have diminished at the end of the long rains in april may and into the low flow season historically flow could be observed year round at msembe the main gauging site below usangu wetland dropping in november but still enough to maintain a basic ecosystem function e g providing water for wildlife in the ruaha national park and surrounding areas in only two months in 1980 did average monthly flows drop below 1 m3 s in the last decades since 1981 flow has reduced to almost zero from september onwards leaving the great ruaha river almost dry for months on end the lpjmllocal model reproduces well this reduced flow during the 1981 2010 period switching off irrigation in the model brings back a pattern that matches the historic observed flows reasonably well though flows in january and february seem to be slightly overestimated similar to historic observations the model shows that no low flows are extremely rare under natural flow conditions without water abstractions further downstream at stiegler s gorge is the site of one of the largest hydropower schemes currently in the planning and development stage in africa the irrigation extraction of 2 2 bcm per year has only a modest effect on flows at this location here close to the delta the rufiji has increased to a large river with an annual flow of about 35 bcm although this fluctuates from less than 20 bcm to more than 40 bcm per year note that the observed series at this critical point in the basin stops in 1978 a median monthly reduction in flow at stiegler s due to irrigation abstractions of 4 5 was simulated with the model 25 percentile 2 6 75 percentile 7 8 reduction and only in two months over the whole 30 years time series did simulated flow drop below 100 m3 s at stiegler s gorge partly due to upstream irrigation abstractions if however upstream demand for irrigation more than triples to 7 6 bcm in 2030 as suggested by the basin water resources development plan wrem international 2015 irrigation is likely to have a much more significant effect on downstream water availability especially in dry years 4 discussion everywhere and locally relevant has been posed as the ultimate aim of global hydrological modelling bierkens et al 2015 in this paper we examined the performance of a well known ghm lpjml for a medium sized basin in eastern africa the rufiji basin the rather poor performance of the original model in its global configuration is not surprising given the complex hydrology multiple wetlands systems seasonal inundation of the basin the steep gradients in elevation and precipitation and the limited schematization of delayed runoff and groundwater processes in lpjml it is a hard target to hit with an uncalibrated global model our study finds that for scenario analysis or water management applications further calibration and validation against observed discharge is required as also mentioned by hattermann et al 2017 our study does provide several suggestions for what could be relatively simple but effective steps in the regionalization of a ghm like lpjml that uses global input data the first step considered input data and precipitation adjustment using a comparison of global remote sensed input data against local observations was most effective in achieving a good simulation of the annual water balance more advanced methods to correct precipitation than used in this paper could be applied e g through elevation informed interpolation of station data rather than using a single sub catchment based adjustment factor the adjustments made are relatively modest and not uncommon in this scale of hydrological modelling but due to the non linear nature between precipitation and runoff they lead to large changes in simulated flows and hence the high model sensitivity to bias in input data in the case of the rufiji local data on catchment areas was important for some sub catchments particularly small ones in areas of high precipitation second introducing lags in surface water runoff one representing site specific processes in our case wetlands and one compensating for general limitations to process description schematization and parameterization was essential to reproduce the observed seasonal pattern of flow for the rufiji due to almost total lack of information on wetlands in the kilombero and makalala and limited data on those in the usanga plains adding the most basic functions of such wetlands through a delay of 1 month and a loss as a fraction of flow was felt to be a reasonable compromise between rigour and practice specific losses for usanga corresponded well with the evapotranspiration deficit during the rainy season providing some confidence in the approach more advanced methods like treating them as a non linear storage reservoir with variable evapotranspiration based on surface water level and vegetation development could potentially lead to a better simulation of surface water losses and flow delay several alternatives have recently been described and tested pereira et al 2017 yamazaki et al 2011 but were considered beyond the scope of this study as they would require a major reconfiguration of lpjml the non site specific lag introduced represented those delays in soil and surface water not explicitly included in process description or parameterisation the soil module with the local parameterisation derived from the harmonized soil database appeared to react particularly rigid separating water in the soil column mainly between fast surface runoff and slow groundwater discharge with no intermediate lateral flow a more catchment specific schematization of soil layers not available for the rufiji but possibly available for other basins might improve separation between fast runoff and medium to slow lateral and deep drainage in the context of optimizing a conceptual two parameter model over a large number of catchments mouelhi et al 2006 found the exchange with the outside of the basin e g our wetland losses and the routing storage capacity the most important parameters followed by the soil moisture storage capacity similar to our lag parameters third whilst trying to stay as close to the original ghm it was useful to examine the effects of adjusting some model parameters considered critical for key characteristics of observed flows we found the lag parameters to be most critical issues of equifinality e g between groundwater lag and surface water lag parameters could be further explored guiding this process with local understanding of sub catchment specific processes could allow calibration by sub catchment rather than for the basin as a whole however taking this too far begins to replicate development of a bespoke model which is not the purpose of this study including more ghms targeting the same catchment s would make an interesting opportunity for cross comparison after improvements the lpjml model performed well in simulating average annual flows monthly time series and seasonal patterns and reasonably well in simulating observed inter annual variability whilst we note that some fairly important assumptions have been made to arrive at the final model version these are not unprecedented in this scale of hydrological modelling particularly in areas such as the rufiji that are very data sparse the simulation performance is adequate to use the model for exploring the effects of recent environmental change future scenarios and sensitivity analysis for example we show that depletion of flows especially during the dry season in the great ruaha river during recent decades can be largely accounted for by increased irrigation abstractions critical data requirements for further model development include information on wetland characteristics this would allow a stronger focus on simulation of daily flow characteristics but is some way off given the present data situation and in situ measurements of precipitation and discharge specifically for downstream major tributaries kilombero and luwegu and the rufiji main stem a key question that remains is whether it is worth adjusting a global model to apply it to a medium sized basin the time spent improving lpjml in the order of months for just one basin most probably equals the time that would have been spent setting up a designated hydrological model like swat many of the steps have required and benefitted from local sources of data and existing reports on the hydrology and environment in the basin however as ghms improve resolution and schematization fewer local adjustments may be required they could be more targeted and the adjustment time greatly reduced using lessons learned from studies such as this in large developing countries with data sparse regions and few long duration good quality flow records application of a regionalised ghm would have significant benefits to allow consistent modelling of multiple basins and opportunities for local researchers to link with global research networks and access open source models 5 conclusions our study contains a dual message whilst the ghm under consideration lpjml in its original configuration does provide a first approximation of rufiji hydrology capturing much of the spatial variation in rainfall and evapotranspiration leading to varying flows at different locations for it to do well at the local scale and to be accurate enough to explore sensitivities and scenarios various catchment specific modifications are needed stepwise implementation of relatively simple modifications revealed the most important step to improve flow volumes was precipitation adjustment to improve seasonality introducing a lag in surface water runoff was the most effective measure local sources of in situ data and information on the hydrology and environment have been essential for the regionalisation process but there remain

ogallala aquifer 1 introduction the llano estacado of western texas and eastern new mexico is a physiographic region located at the southern end of the great plains of north america shumard 1892 johnson 1901 this vast elevated plain has long been recognized as a distinct region fenneman 1931 cummins 1892 the key distinguishing feature is its exceptionally level surface a surface that generally lacks flowing streams or other reliable sources of surface water germond 1940 beneath this low relief tableland lies the southernmost extension of the ogallala aquifer a vast freshwater aquifer that underlies portions of eight states with the bulk of its volume beneath texas oklahoma kansas and nebraska lewis 1990 opie 2000 the ogallala aquifer provides a source of groundwater that is key to a productive irrigated agricultural system terrell 1998 unlike other states where groundwater is more strictly managed farmers and ranchers of texas operate under the rule of capture which grants landowners the right to capture groundwater beneath their property cronin 1969 brune 1981 kaiser 1987 landowners do not necessarily own the water but have the right to pump and capture whatever water is available regardless of the effects of that pumping on neighboring landowners kaiser 2005 unrestricted pumping has led to a significant depletion of groundwater resources in the texas portion of the llano estacado musick et al 1990 postel 1992 alley 2006 in an attempt to monitor groundwater conditions the texas water development board twdb in partnership with local groundwater districts maintains a network of automated water level recorders in observation wells throughout the state hopkins 1994 these instrumented wells referred to as recorder wells are equipped with sensors that provide hourly or daily information with regard to water levels finnell 2009 of special interest here are seasonal fluctuations that result from the extraction of groundwater during the growing season although recorder wells are not pumped neighboring actively pumped wells can induce a seasonal depression of the water table within the observation well and this perturbation can be observed and recorded hopkins and anderson 2016 seasonal perturbations detected in an observation well are not a result of natural phenomenon rather they are driven by human decisions to switch nearby irrigation pumps on or off conover and akin 1942 merriam 1942 land and newton 2008 each year farmers assess climatic and soil moisture conditions and make rational decisions as to when to start and stop irrigation farmers make independent decisions to ensure the success of their chosen crop however they are guided by an understanding of local conditions and the need to raise a crop during a well defined growing season thus the collective actions of numerous farmers acting independently produce seasonal perturbations that typically follow regular patterns that tend to repeat each year that is not to say that seasonal patterns are identical from one year to the next variations in rainfall can indirectly modify seasonal patterns of groundwater extraction producers may switch off irrigation pumps during periods of adequate rainfall whereas periods of drought may lead to more vigorous pumping the supply of available groundwater can also influence the amount of water extracted for irrigation as the available water supply is reduced to an unusable level irrigation pumps may be shutoff to allow groundwater to refill cones of depression thus random climatic shifts and supply problems can lead to changes in irrigation patterns and the water table will respond accordingly the focus of this paper is on seasonal fluctuations of the water table observed in agricultural regions on the high plains of the llano estacado 2 methods water levels in an aquifer respond to changes in the balance between recharge and discharge in the case of groundwater beneath the llano estacado recharge is negligible and water levels are driven primarily by extraction of water for irrigation or other purposes since a recorder well is not pumped the observed water level perturbations are induced by overlapping cones of depression that radiate outward from nearby actively pumped wells typically seasonal perturbations detected in a recorder well are cyclical such that the water table is depressed during the growing season then recovers as pumping is curtailed thus the frequency of an oscillation is roughly one cycle per year or one cycle every 365 days the ogallala aquifer is a non stationary system such that after each annual cycle water levels do not necessarily return to the undisturbed level of the previous year in most cases aquifer depletion causes the mean water level to drop relative to the land surface so that after each annual cycle the depth to water has increased somewhat in a few rare cases water levels in an observation well may appear to rise for a few years as nearby active wells are abandoned and cones of depression are allowed time to recover nevertheless whether the water table rises or falls the mean water level is slowly but constantly changing over time one can define a mean annual water level d n for any given day n by simply averaging daily water levels over a period of 365 days here we compute a moving average so that the mean water level for a given day is computed by averaging 182 daily values before and 182 daily values after the day of interest as follows 1 d n 1 365 i n 182 n 182 d i for any given day n one can compute the perturbation of the water level d n by subtracting the mean water level d n from the observed water level d n as 2 d n d n d n note that a positive water level perturbation occurs when the water table rises above the annual moving average position and a negative water level perturbation occurs when the water table drops below the moving annual average position fig 1 thus we are comparing the position of the water table for any given day to the moving annual average position each perturbation value is associated with a day of year which is simply the consecutive number of days after the start of each calendar year thus if we have a number of years of data then we can average all water level perturbations associated with a given day of year for all years of which data is available 3 recorder wells there are a total of 17 active recorder wells on the high plains of the llano estacado and at least another 11 that have collected data in the past but are no longer in operation it is possible to compute seasonal perturbation curves for each of these recorder wells however it is beyond the scope of this study to discuss results for all 28 well locations instead three representative recorder wells were selected that provide clear examples of how this method can be applied and what can be learned from the computed perturbation curves fig 2 the three recorder wells selected for this study are in crosby dawson and gray counties fig 2 all three wells are located on the high plains of the llano estacado and were drilled into the ogallala formation in addition all are located in cropland where neighboring wells are used primarily to irrigate crops this is not true of all recorder wells on the llano estacado for example recorder wells in reagan and glasscock counties are located in regions where groundwater is often used for oilfield applications such as drilling operations or hydraulic fracturing recorder wells in bailey and martin counties are located within vast wellfields that supply or supplement municipal water supplies for the cities of lubbock and midland respectively in the sandhills region of lamb county a recorder well is located within a well field that provides water for two major power plants clearly recorder wells located in nonagricultural regions would not be expected to exhibit the same seasonal perturbation patterns as those located in regions where groundwater is devoted exclusively to cropland irrigation another important factor considered when selecting these three recorder wells was the length and continuity of the available data record as with studies of climate a long and continuous data record is key to establishing true seasonal patterns what constitutes a sufficiently long record is not clear however one would assume that a record of at least one decade would be preferable of the three recorder wells selected for this study the crosby county well has the longest record of 25 years and both the dawson and gray county wells have long data records of 16 and 12 years respectively data records for all recorder wells in this region contain occasional data gaps most likely caused by equipment failure this is not unusual for long term field studies anyone who has attempted to maintain a sampling system over long periods recognizes that equipment failures and resulting data gaps are inevitable brief gaps of a few hours or days do not pose serious problems since water levels in a recorder well typically change very slowly however significant data gaps that extend for many weeks or months pose significant challenges to the precise calculation of perturbation values thus when choosing recorder wells for this study data continuity was an important consideration a summary of basic physical characteristics for each well is compiled in table 1 here we have listed the state well number the location of the well the depth of the well depth to water and the estimated saturated thickness each depth to water value represents the most recent measurement obtained by the local groundwater district typically measured during the winter when surrounding pumps are shutdown and the water table has had time to recover from the previous growing season since wells are typically completed in or near the base of the aquifer at the contact point between the ogallala formation and the underling confining layer of red clay one can estimate the saturated thickness by simply subtracting depth to water from well depth note that the gray county well has the largest volume of stored groundwater as indicated by its relatively large saturated thickness the crosby well on the other hand has the lowest saturated thickness of the three wells 3 1 crosby county recorder well the crosby county recorder well state well number 23 30 103 is located 47 km to the east of lubbock texas as is typical of most of the llano estacado region this recorder well is surrounded by numerous sections of plowed land with some natural grass cover within shallow playa basins fig 3 the surface soils are primarily olton loam with lesser amounts of randall clay within playas the primary crop is cotton but grain sorghum and winter wheat are also grown in the area crops are grown on a mixture of irrigated and dryland farms water for irrigation is pumped from the underlying ogallala aquifer and applied by furrow center pivot and sub surface irrigation systems the high plains underground water conservation district maintains detailed records of registered wells within the boundaries of its district typically the latitude and longitude of each well is provided along with information regarding its classification a well may be classified as an irrigation well a stock well a domestic house well a public water supply well an industrial well etc domestic wells and stock wells are typically low volume wells that provide less than 17 5 gpm and thus have little effect on neighboring wells irrigation wells on the other hand can supply water at high volumetric flow rates and when active form large cones of depression that radiate outward active irrigation wells are the primary drivers of observed seasonal fluctuations within recorder wells in the vicinity of the crosby recorder well most wells are classified as irrigation wells which are marked as white dots in fig 3 the crosby well was drilled to a depth of 91 m in august of 1954 and was used to irrigate cropland until it was retired and converted to a twdb recorder well in december of 1992 at which point the submersible pump was removed and a float and weight system was installed the most recent measurement of depth to water in this well was 66 m and the saturated thickness is estimated to be 25 m although this observation well is no longer pumped there are other actively pumped wells nearby that provide groundwater for crop production the nearest active well is 116 m to the south of the observation well and there is another active well 128 m to the north overall there are five active wells within a radius of 500 m and an additional ten active wells within a radius of one kilometer it is assumed that seasonal extractions of water from the nearest wells contribute the most to observed seasonal perturbations of the water table however it is not possible to predict the influence of each active well on the recorder well because there are no public records of when the wells are turned on or off and there are no records of how much water is being extracted from each neighboring well at any given moment the full record of depth to water measurements obtained by the crosby county recorder well stretches from 7 december 1992 to the present a period of 25 years daily values are provided from late 1992 to 2005 and hourly values are provided from 2006 to the present to be consistent across the entire 25 year period hourly values were converted to daily values by simply taking a daily average of all hourly values each day thus the final working data set consists of 25 years of daily values as shown plotted as a time series in fig 4 here water levels are plotted as negative values measured from the land surface one can clearly see in fig 4 both long term trends that show a gradual depletion of the aquifer and seasonal fluctuations of the water table that reflect seasonal irrigation cycles typical of such an intensively cultivated region long term trends reveal that water levels have generally declined over time as one might expect however a careful examination reveals that the rate of decline can vary appreciably overall there appears to be a general decline of around 18 3 cm year from 1992 to 2011 whereas from 2012 to 2017 the curve is essentially flat slope of 0 7 cm year superimposed on these long term trends are the more dynamic seasonal fluctuations associated with irrigation cycles these seasonal perturbations have amplitudes of from 1 to 4 m each year which suggests that nearby actively pumped wells exert a significant influence on water levels in this recorder well unfortunately the crosby county data set fig 4 suffers from two significant periods of missing data during the first six years of data collection the largest data gap extends nearly 14 months from mid july of 1995 to mid august of 1996 another major gap extends over a period of nearly 8 months from january to august of 1998 it is challenging to reliably compute perturbation curves with such large data gaps however if we exclude the initial six year portion of the time series it is still possible to compute perturbation curves using the remaining 19 year period which extends from mid 1998 to the present using eqs 1 and 2 water level perturbations were computed for each day of the 19 year record and then the average perturbation was computed for each day of year the results plotted in fig 5 show the average or regular seasonal pattern of water level perturbations within the recorder well overall the results suggest that water levels peak during winter and early spring months when irrigation is at a minimum and water levels drop to a low point in august when irrigation is at a maximum the maximum positive perturbation in march is 0 5 m and the low point in august is 1 4 m resulting in an overall amplitude of 1 9 m for this perturbation curve the results also reveal an interesting phenomenon whereby the water level initially declines in april due to early season irrigation and then partially recovers in may and early june most likely due to a local pause in irrigation the reason for this early summer cessation of irrigation and associated recovery of the water table is not known for sure however one can speculate that it is associated with rainfall rainfall is an important factor that can reduce the need for irrigation during periods of plentiful rain farmers may decide to alter their irrigation schedules and switch irrigation pumps off to save water and reduce operating costs if a sufficient number of farmers temporarily stop irrigating then the water table may have sufficient time to partially recover the national climatic data center provides daily rainfall data for many locations across the united states including locations across the llano estacado in crosby county daily rainfall data is available for crosbyton a town located about 12 km to the northeast of the crosby county recorder well this data set extends from 1893 to the present a period of 124 years to compute seasonal rainfall patterns each daily rainfall observation was assigned a day of year based upon the date of measurement then the data set was sorted by day of year and the average amount of rainfall was determined for each day of year due to the highly sporadic nature of rainfall the average rainfall from one day to the next can be highly variable to clarify seasonal patterns it was possible to smooth these data by computing a 10 day moving average using daily rainfall for 5 days before the day of interest and five days after the day of interest here the smoothed temporal distribution of rainfall is plotted in fig 5 the results of this analysis suggest that rainfall in crosby county follows a seasonal pattern similar to other locations across the llano estacado the spring and summer months which coincide with the growing season are the dominant months for rainfall there is a significant rise in rainfall starting in april which continues through may and peaks in early june daily rainfall values drop in late june and remain at somewhat lower levels in july and august followed by a smaller secondary peak in september the june rainfall peak may explain why water level perturbations turn positive during this same period plentiful rainfall in may and early june may lead to a suspension of irrigation and a short lived recovery of the water table the somewhat drier months of july and august lead to a resumption of irrigation and a major draw down of the water table 3 2 dawson county recorder well dawson county recorder well state well number 28 25 604 is located on farm to market road 828 between the small communities of sparenberg and klondike texas as shown in fig 6 the dawson well is located along a topographic high between two sandy and usually dry stream channels that wrap around the well site and then merge to the south these stream channels called draws rarely contain flowing water but can occasionally flood during periods of heavy rainfall as is typical of land in the southern llano estacado the recorder well is surrounded by numerous sections of highly erodible cropland with some natural grass cover in areas where the soils are too shallow to grow crops the surface soils in this region are primarily amarillo fine sandy loam with lesser amounts of arvana fine sandy loam and portales loam in the draws the primary crops in this region include cotton and grain sorghum the dawson county recorder well was drilled to a depth of 58 m in 1956 recent measurements of depth to water suggest that the water table is 18 m below the surface thus the estimated saturated thickness is 41 m this well was used for many years to irrigate cropland until it was retired and converted to a twdb recorder well on 7 june 2001 the full record of depth to water measurements obtained at the dawson county recorder well stretches from 7 june 2001 to the present a period of more than 16 years daily values are provided from 2001 to 2005 and hourly values are provided from 2006 to the present as with the crosby county well the dawson county data set suffers from a few occasional gaps of from a few hours to a few weeks daily water levels plotted as a time series in fig 7 do not show any major signs of depletion there is a slight decline from 2001 through 2004 followed by a slight rise from 2005 to 2011 there was another decline from 2012 to 2014 followed by a significant rise from 2014 to the present it is difficult to say with any confidence why the water table is rising and falling in this manner one possible explanation is that some neighboring wells are pumped and then allowed to rest for a few years allowing the water table to recover the dawson county well shows substantial seasonal fluctuations associated with pumping during the growing season a water level perturbation curve was computed for each day of the 16 year record and then the average perturbation was computed for each day of year and plotted in fig 8 results suggest that water levels tend to be highest during the winter months of december january and february the water table begins to decline significantly starting in march and continues to decline through may this drop is most likely associated with early season irrigation as farmers prepare fields for planting and then irrigate to insure plant germination results also show that the early season decline is reversed in june as the water table temporarily recovers before a sudden and more rapid decline during the warm and relatively dry months of july and august after reaching a minimum at the end of august water levels rise rapidly through september as irrigation is curtailed while producers finish their crops and prepare for harvest there is little if any irrigation from october through december which allows the water table to rise steadily but less rapidly compared to september a maximum positive perturbation of 1 1 m occurs in january for the dawson well whereas the maximum perturbation for the crosby well occurs in march the low point of 2 9 m for the dawson well is shifted to the end of august whereas the minimum value for the crosby well occurs in mid august the overall amplitude of the dawson perturbation curve is 4 0 m which is significantly larger than the 1 9 m amplitude of the crosby well the relatively large amplitude is surprising since the dawson well has few nearby irrigation wells there are no irrigation wells within a radius of 500 m as shown in fig 6 the nearest active irrigation well is 655 m to the southwest and there are only ten irrigation wells within a one kilometer radius of this observation well based on the map of surrounding irrigation wells one might assume that the amplitude of the dawson perturbation curve would be small but this is not the case rainfall in dawson county is not appreciably different from that of crosby county fig 8 the rainfall distribution was computed from a 107 year record collected in nearby lamesa texas located 17 km to the north note that rainfall is at a minimum in the winter months of december january and february rainfall reaches a maximum in june and there is a secondary peak of equal magnitude in september in between june and september is a trough of somewhat lower rainfall associated with a subtropical ridge of high pressure that often forms over the region during the summer bomar 1983 the partial recovery of the water table in june appears to be closely associated with the rainfall peak in june this hydrographic aberration in an otherwise smooth perturbation curve is most likely associated with a temporary suspension of irrigation brought about by plentiful rainfall 3 3 gray county recorder well gray county recorder well state well number 05 26 501 is located 12 5 km to the northeast of pampa on a thin finger like extension of the llano estacado that extends between red deer creek to the north and the valley of the north fork red river to the south fig 2 outside of the numerous playa lakes with their veneer of randall clay the soils surrounding the recorder well are predominately pullman clay loam a clay rich soil with low hydraulic conductivity the recorder well sits between three corn fields watered with center pivot irrigation systems see red dot in fig 9 corn is an important feed grain and source of fodder for livestock in this region but it is also a water intensive crop and in the semiarid environment of the llano estacado can only be grown in areas with sufficient groundwater the gray county recorder well was drilled into the ogallala formation in 1956 to a depth of 164 m the most recent measurement of depth to water was 113 m which yields an estimated saturated thickness of 51 m thus the saturated thickness of the gray county well is significantly higher than the other two recorder wells in crosby and dawson counties the gray county well was retired and converted to a recorder well on 1 october 2005 although this observation well is no longer pumped there are two actively pumped wells within a 500 m radius of this observation well and a total of four active wells within a radius of 1 km fig 9 the nearest active well is only 59 m to the southeast of the observation well and it is assumed that this well contributes the most to the observed seasonal perturbations in the water table other active wells worth mentioning include one at 380 m to the east northeast one at a distance of 559 m to the west and another at 880 m to the north all other active wells are more than 1 km from the recorder well daily water levels plotted as a time series in fig 10 show little if any depletion from 2005 to 2009 followed by a modest decline from 2010 to 2014 followed by a slight rise from 2015 to the present superimposed on these long term trends are the more pronounced seasonal fluctuations associated with pumping during the growing season these seasonal perturbations have amplitudes from 4 to as much as 6 m each year this suggests that neighboring actively pumped wells induce significant water level perturbations in the gray county recorder well average water level perturbations were computed for each day of the 12 year record and then the average perturbation was computed for each day of year the results plotted in fig 11 show that water levels tend to be highest during the months of march and april prior to planting the water table begins to decline significantly in may accelerates downward from june through july and reaches a minimum in mid august the maximum positive perturbation in april is 1 2 m and the low point in august is 2 5 m resulting in an overall amplitude of 3 7 m for this perturbation curve this amplitude is nearly identical to the amplitude of the dawson county recorder well and is more than twice the amplitude of the crosby county well the seasonal rainfall distribution was computed from a 110 year record collected by national weather service cooperators in pampa texas a small town located 12 km to the west of the gray county recorder well results shown in fig 11 suggest that rainfall is at a maximum in june with a much smaller secondary peak in august although rainfall is typically at a maximum in june there is only a slight recovery of the water table at this time this suggests that unlike the previous two examples there does not appear to be a significant shutdown of irrigation systems in june despite plentiful rainfall perhaps the high saturated thickness in gray county allows farmers to irrigate more continuously since they do not suffer significant supply limitations in addition the corn crop grown in this area is a water intensive crop that requires more continuous irrigation 4 discussion and conclusions since the inception of irrigated agriculture on the llano estacado reserves of stored water within the ogallala aquifer have been steadily declining the depletion of the aquifer has been well documented by local groundwater districts that maintain vast networks of thousands of observation wells scattered across the llano estacado region the long term trend of gradual depletion is accompanied by more rapid seasonal fluctuations of the water table that reflect regional patterns of irrigation these seasonal water level perturbations can be observed in data collected by recorder wells maintained by the texas water development board recorder wells provide continuous records of daily or hourly data on groundwater conditions which can provide valuable insight into groundwater withdrawals during the growing season and subsequent recovery after harvest seasonal water table fluctuations are induced by intersecting cones of depression that extend outward from nearby actively pumped wells typically seasonal perturbations are cyclical such that the water table is depressed during the growing season then at least partially recovers as pumping is curtailed however water level perturbations can vary somewhat from one year to the next the reason of course is that these cycles are driven by independent decisions of numerous farmers to switch irrigation systems on or off these decisions are influenced by factors such as soil moisture plant stress and variable climatic conditions in addition an inadequate supply of groundwater can lead to involuntary disruptions during the growing season as farmers are forced to shutdown irrigation systems due to supply limitations despite these complications seasonal water level perturbations tend to follow somewhat regular patterns each year such that it is often possible to define an average or normal cycle for a given recorder well here a method was developed to compute the average or normal perturbation pattern for a given location when computing perturbation curves one must consider that the mean position of the water table is constantly shifting after each annual cycle water levels rarely return to the undisturbed level of the previous year thus the method developed to compute an average or normal perturbation cycle employs a moving average so that this non stationary condition is properly handled the computed water level perturbations therefore describe the fluctuations of the water table about a constantly changing mean reference level the resulting perturbation curves can be compared and interpreted to provide valuable insight into the collective actions and decisions of farmers that irrigate neighboring fields generally all the perturbation curves presented in this paper tend to follow a similar pattern of high water levels during the winter months and low levels during the summer growing season in areas with limited groundwater supplies such as crosby or dawson counties farmers may try to conserve water by shutting off irrigation systems during periods of plentiful rainfall and adequate soil moisture as a result one can often detect distinct hydrographic anomalies associated with periods when irrigation is briefly curtailed and the water table is allowed time to partially recover such irrigation breaks appear to correlate closely with periods of plentiful rainfall which typically occur during the spring months of late may and early june in gray county where groundwater supplies are more abundant the typical late spring hydrographic aberration is less evident this suggests that farmers with adequate water may be less inclined to shutdown irrigation systems to conserve groundwater resources or it may reflect the fact that farmers in gray county grow crops such as corn that require more water these farmers may be operating at a constant soil moisture deficit and may choose to keep their systems running continuously throughout the growing season having plentiful groundwater may reduce the need for involuntary shutdowns since continuous pumping does not necessarily exhaust the water supply clearly the interpretation of perturbation curves requires some speculation whereas water level perturbation curves can be computed precisely from data provided by recorder wells rarely are researchers provided information on the decisions of farmers to switch irrigation systems on or off nevertheless if one assumes that farmers act rationally and tend to respond to climatic and soil moisture conditions then an analysis and interpretation of perturbation curves can provide keen insight into the dynamic nature of seasonal pumping of the ogallala aquifer

on the high plains of the llano estacado 2 methods water levels in an aquifer respond to changes in the balance between recharge and discharge in the case of groundwater beneath the llano estacado recharge is negligible and water levels are driven primarily by extraction of water for irrigation or other purposes since a recorder well is not pumped the observed water level perturbations are induced by overlapping cones of depression that radiate outward from nearby actively pumped wells typically seasonal perturbations detected in a recorder well are cyclical such that the water table is depressed during the growing season then recovers as pumping is curtailed thus the frequency of an oscillation is roughly one cycle per year or one cycle every 365 days the ogallala aquifer is a non stationary system such that after each annual cycle water levels do not necessarily return to the undisturbed level of the previous year in most cases aquifer depletion causes the mean water level to drop relative to the land surface so that after each annual cycle the depth to water has increased somewhat in a few rare cases water levels in an observation well may appear to rise for a few years as nearby active wells are abandoned and cones of depression are allowed time to recover nevertheless whether the water table rises or falls the mean water level is slowly but constantly changing over time one can define a mean annual water level d n for any given day n by simply averaging daily water levels over a period of 365 days here we compute a moving average so that the mean water level for a given day is computed by averaging 182 daily values before and 182 daily values after the day of interest as follows 1 d n 1 365 i n 182 n 182 d i for any given day n one can compute the perturbation of the water level d n by subtracting the mean water level d n from the observed water level d n as 2 d n d n d n note that a positive water level perturbation occurs when the water table rises above the annual moving average position and a negative water level perturbation occurs when the water table drops below the moving annual average position fig 1 thus we are comparing the position of the water table for any given day to the moving annual average position each perturbation value is associated with a day of year which is simply the consecutive number of days after the start of each calendar year thus if we have a number of years of data then we can average all water level perturbations associated with a given day of year for all years of which data is available 3 recorder wells there are a total of 17 active recorder wells on the high plains of the llano estacado and at least another 11 that have collected data in the past but are no longer in operation it is possible to compute seasonal perturbation curves for each of these recorder wells however it is beyond the scope of this study to discuss results for all 28 well locations instead three representative recorder wells were selected that provide clear examples of how this method can be applied and what can be learned from the computed perturbation curves fig 2 the three recorder wells selected for this study are in crosby dawson and gray counties fig 2 all three wells are located on the high plains of the llano estacado and were drilled into the ogallala formation in addition all are located in cropland where neighboring wells are used primarily to irrigate crops this is not true of all recorder wells on the llano estacado for example recorder wells in reagan and glasscock counties are located in regions where groundwater is often used for oilfield applications such as drilling operations or hydraulic fracturing recorder wells in bailey and martin counties are located within vast wellfields that supply or supplement municipal water supplies for the cities of lubbock and midland respectively in the sandhills region of lamb county a recorder well is located within a well field that provides water for two major power plants clearly recorder wells located in nonagricultural regions would not be expected to exhibit the same seasonal perturbation patterns as those located in regions where groundwater is devoted exclusively to cropland irrigation another important factor considered when selecting these three recorder wells was the length and continuity of the available data record as with studies of climate a long and continuous data record is key to establishing true seasonal patterns what constitutes a sufficiently long record is not clear however one would assume that a record of at least one decade would be preferable of the three recorder wells selected for this study the crosby county well has the longest record of 25 years and both the dawson and gray county wells have long data records of 16 and 12 years respectively data records for all recorder wells in this region contain occasional data gaps most likely caused by equipment failure this is not unusual for long term field studies anyone who has attempted to maintain a sampling system over long periods recognizes that equipment failures and resulting data gaps are inevitable brief gaps of a few hours or days do not pose serious problems since water levels in a recorder well typically change very slowly however significant data gaps that extend for many weeks or months pose significant challenges to the precise calculation of perturbation values thus when choosing recorder wells for this study data continuity was an important consideration a summary of basic physical characteristics for each well is compiled in table 1 here we have listed the state well number the location of the well the depth of the well depth to water and the estimated saturated thickness each depth to water value represents the most recent measurement obtained by the local groundwater district typically measured during the winter when surrounding pumps are shutdown and the water table has had time to recover from the previous growing season since wells are typically completed in or near the base of the aquifer at the contact point between the ogallala formation and the underling confining layer of red clay one can estimate the saturated thickness by simply subtracting depth to water from well depth note that the gray county well has the largest volume of stored groundwater as indicated by its relatively large saturated thickness the crosby well on the other hand has the lowest saturated thickness of the three wells 3 1 crosby county recorder well the crosby county recorder well state well number 23 30 103 is located 47 km to the east of lubbock texas as is typical of most of the llano estacado region this recorder well is surrounded by numerous sections of plowed land with some natural grass cover within shallow playa basins fig 3 the surface soils are primarily olton loam with lesser amounts of randall clay within playas the primary crop is cotton but grain sorghum and winter wheat are also grown in the area crops are grown on a mixture of irrigated and dryland farms water for irrigation is pumped from the underlying ogallala aquifer and applied by furrow center pivot and sub surface irrigation systems the high plains underground water conservation district maintains detailed records of registered wells within the boundaries of its district typically the latitude and longitude of each well is provided along with information regarding its classification a well may be classified as an irrigation well a stock well a domestic house well a public water supply well an industrial well etc domestic wells and stock wells are typically low volume wells that provide less than 17 5 gpm and thus have little effect on neighboring wells irrigation wells on the other hand can supply water at high volumetric flow rates and when active form large cones of depression that radiate outward active irrigation wells are the primary drivers of observed seasonal fluctuations within recorder wells in the vicinity of the crosby recorder well most wells are classified as irrigation wells which are marked as white dots in fig 3 the crosby well was drilled to a depth of 91 m in august of 1954 and was used to irrigate cropland until it was retired and converted to a twdb recorder well in december of 1992 at which point the submersible pump was removed and a float and weight system was installed the most recent measurement of depth to water in this well was 66 m and the saturated thickness is estimated to be 25 m although this observation well is no longer pumped there are other actively pumped wells nearby that provide groundwater for crop production the nearest active well is 116 m to the south of the observation well and there is another active well 128 m to the north overall there are five active wells within a radius of 500 m and an additional ten active wells within a radius of one kilometer it is assumed that seasonal extractions of water from the nearest wells contribute the most to observed seasonal perturbations of the water table however it is not possible to predict the influence of each active well on the recorder well because there are no public records of when the wells are turned on or off and there are no records of how much water is being extracted from each neighboring well at any given moment the full record of depth to water measurements obtained by the crosby county recorder well stretches from 7 december 1992 to the present a period of 25 years daily values are provided from late 1992 to 2005 and hourly values are provided from 2006 to the present to be consistent across the entire 25 year period hourly values were converted to daily values by simply taking a daily average of all hourly values each day thus the final working data set consists of 25 years of daily values as shown plotted as a time series in fig 4 here water levels are plotted as negative values measured from the land surface one can clearly see in fig 4 both long term trends that show a gradual depletion of the aquifer and seasonal fluctuations of the water table that reflect seasonal irrigation cycles typical of such an intensively cultivated region long term trends reveal that water levels have generally declined over time as one might expect however a careful examination reveals that the rate of decline can vary appreciably overall there appears to be a general decline of around 18 3 cm year from 1992 to 2011 whereas from 2012 to 2017 the curve is essentially flat slope of 0 7 cm year superimposed on these long term trends are the more dynamic seasonal fluctuations associated with irrigation cycles these seasonal perturbations have amplitudes of from 1 to 4 m each year which suggests that nearby actively pumped wells exert a significant influence on water levels in this recorder well unfortunately the crosby county data set fig 4 suffers from two significant periods of missing data during the first six years of data collection the largest data gap extends nearly 14 months from mid july of 1995 to mid august of 1996 another major gap extends over a period of nearly 8 months from january to august of 1998 it is challenging to reliably compute perturbation curves with such large data gaps however if we exclude the initial six year portion of the time series it is still possible to compute perturbation curves using the remaining 19 year period which extends from mid 1998 to the present using eqs 1 and 2 water level perturbations were computed for each day of the 19 year record and then the average perturbation was computed for each day of year the results plotted in fig 5 show the average or regular seasonal pattern of water level perturbations within the recorder well overall the results suggest that water levels peak during winter and early spring months when irrigation is at a minimum and water levels drop to a low point in august when irrigation is at a maximum the maximum positive perturbation in march is 0 5 m and the low point in august is 1 4 m resulting in an overall amplitude of 1 9 m for this perturbation curve the results also reveal an interesting phenomenon whereby the water level initially declines in april due to early season irrigation and then partially recovers in may and early june most likely due to a local pause in irrigation the reason for this early summer cessation of irrigation and associated recovery of the water table is not known for sure however one can speculate that it is associated with rainfall rainfall is an important factor that can reduce the need for irrigation during periods of plentiful rain farmers may decide to alter their irrigation schedules and switch irrigation pumps off to save water and reduce operating costs if a sufficient number of farmers temporarily stop irrigating then the water table may have sufficient time to partially recover the national climatic data center provides daily rainfall data for many locations across the united states including locations across the llano estacado in crosby county daily rainfall data is available for crosbyton a town located about 12 km to the northeast of the crosby county recorder well this data set extends from 1893 to the present a period of 124 years to compute seasonal rainfall patterns each daily rainfall observation was assigned a day of year based upon the date of measurement then the data set was sorted by day of year and the average amount of rainfall was determined for each day of year due to the highly sporadic nature of rainfall the average rainfall from one day to the next can be highly variable to clarify seasonal patterns it was possible to smooth these data by computing a 10 day moving average using daily rainfall for 5 days before the day of interest and five days after the day of interest here the smoothed temporal distribution of rainfall is plotted in fig 5 the results of this analysis suggest that rainfall in crosby county follows a seasonal pattern similar to other locations across the llano estacado the spring and summer months which coincide with the growing season are the dominant months for rainfall there is a significant rise in rainfall starting in april which continues through may and peaks in early june daily rainfall values drop in late june and remain at somewhat lower levels in july and august followed by a smaller secondary peak in september the june rainfall peak may explain why water level perturbations turn positive during this same period plentiful rainfall in may and early june may lead to a suspension of irrigation and a short lived recovery of the water table the somewhat drier months of july and august lead to a resumption of irrigation and a major draw down of the water table 3 2 dawson county recorder well dawson county recorder well state well number 28 25 604 is located on farm to market road 828 between the small communities of sparenberg and klondike texas as shown in fig 6 the dawson well is located along a topographic high between two sandy and usually dry stream channels that wrap around the well site and then merge to the south these stream channels called draws rarely contain flowing water but can occasionally flood during periods of heavy rainfall as is typical of land in the southern llano estacado the recorder well is surrounded by numerous sections of highly erodible cropland with some natural grass cover in areas where the soils are too shallow to grow crops the surface soils in this region are primarily amarillo fine sandy loam with lesser amounts of arvana fine sandy loam and portales loam in the draws the primary crops in this region include cotton and grain sorghum the dawson county recorder well was drilled to a depth of 58 m in 1956 recent measurements of depth to water suggest that the water table is 18 m below the surface thus the estimated saturated thickness is 41 m this well was used for many years to irrigate cropland until it was retired and converted to a twdb recorder well on 7 june 2001 the full record of depth to water measurements obtained at the dawson county recorder well stretches from 7 june 2001 to the present a period of more than 16 years daily values are provided from 2001 to 2005 and hourly values are provided from 2006 to the present as with the crosby county well the dawson county data set suffers from a few occasional gaps of from a few hours to a few weeks daily water levels plotted as a time series in fig 7 do not show any major signs of depletion there is a slight decline from 2001 through 2004 followed by a slight rise from 2005 to 2011 there was another decline from 2012 to 2014 followed by a significant rise from 2014 to the present it is difficult to say with any confidence why the water table is rising and falling in this manner one possible explanation is that some neighboring wells are pumped and then allowed to rest for a few years allowing the water table to recover the dawson county well shows substantial seasonal fluctuations associated with pumping during the growing season a water level perturbation curve was computed for each day of the 16 year record and then the average perturbation was computed for each day of year and plotted in fig 8 results suggest that water levels tend to be highest during the winter months of december january and february the water table begins to decline significantly starting in march and continues to decline through may this drop is most likely associated with early season irrigation as farmers prepare fields for planting and then irrigate to insure plant germination results also show that the early season decline is reversed in june as the water table temporarily recovers before a sudden and more rapid decline during the warm and relatively dry months of july and august after reaching a minimum at the end of august water levels rise rapidly through september as irrigation is curtailed while producers finish their crops and prepare for harvest there is little if any irrigation from october through december which allows the water table to rise steadily but less rapidly compared to september a maximum positive perturbation of 1 1 m occurs in january for the dawson well whereas the maximum perturbation for the crosby well occurs in march the low point of 2 9 m for the dawson well is shifted to the end of august whereas the minimum value for the crosby well occurs in mid august the overall amplitude of the dawson perturbation curve is 4 0 m which is significantly larger than the 1 9 m amplitude of the crosby well the relatively large amplitude is surprising since the dawson well has few nearby irrigation wells there are no irrigation wells within a radius of 500 m as shown in fig 6 the nearest active irrigation well is 655 m to the southwest and there are only ten irrigation wells within a one kilometer radius of this observation well based on the map of surrounding irrigation wells one might assume that the amplitude of the dawson perturbation curve would be small but this is not the case rainfall in dawson county is not appreciably different from that of crosby county fig 8 the rainfall distribution was computed from a 107 year record collected in nearby lamesa texas located 17 km to the north note that rainfall is at a minimum in the winter months of december january and february rainfall reaches a maximum in june and there is a secondary peak of equal magnitude in september in between june and september is a trough of somewhat lower rainfall associated with a subtropical ridge of high pressure that often forms over the region during the summer bomar 1983 the partial recovery of the water table in june appears to be closely associated with the rainfall peak in june this hydrographic aberration in an otherwise smooth perturbation curve is most likely associated with a temporary suspension of irrigation brought about by plentiful rainfall 3 3 gray county recorder well gray county recorder well state well number 05 26 501 is located 12 5 km to the northeast of pampa on a thin finger like extension of the llano estacado that extends between red deer creek to the north and the valley of the north fork red river to the south fig 2 outside of the numerous playa lakes with their veneer of randall clay the soils surrounding the recorder well are predominately pullman clay loam a clay rich soil with low hydraulic conductivity the recorder well sits between three corn fields watered with center pivot irrigation systems see red dot in fig 9 corn is an important feed grain and source of fodder for livestock in this region but it is also a water intensive crop and in the semiarid environment of the llano estacado can only be grown in areas with sufficient groundwater the gray county recorder well was drilled into the ogallala formation in 1956 to a depth of 164 m the most recent measurement of depth to water was 113 m which yields an estimated saturated thickness of 51 m thus the saturated thickness of the gray county well is significantly higher than the other two recorder wells in crosby and dawson counties the gray county well was retired and converted to a recorder well on 1 october 2005 although this observation well is no longer pumped there are two actively pumped wells within a 500 m radius of this observation well and a total of four active wells within a radius of 1 km fig 9 the nearest active well is only 59 m to the southeast of the observation well and it is assumed that this well contributes the most to the observed seasonal perturbations in the water table other active wells worth mentioning include one at 380 m to the east northeast one at a distance of 559 m to the west and another at 880 m to the north all other active wells are more than 1 km from the recorder well daily water levels plotted as a time series in fig 10 show little if any depletion from 2005 to 2009 followed by a modest decline from 2010 to 2014 followed by a slight rise from 2015 to the present superimposed on these long term trends are the more pronounced seasonal fluctuations associated with pumping during the growing season these seasonal perturbations have amplitudes from 4 to as much as 6 m each year this suggests that neighboring actively pumped wells induce significant water level perturbations in the gray county recorder well average water level perturbations were computed for each day of the 12 year record and then the average perturbation was computed for each day of year the results plotted in fig 11 show that water levels tend to be highest during the months of march and april prior to planting the water table begins to decline significantly in may accelerates downward from june through july and reaches a minimum in mid august the maximum positive perturbation in april is 1 2 m and the low point in august is 2 5 m resulting in an overall amplitude of 3 7 m for this perturbation curve this amplitude is nearly identical to the amplitude of the dawson county recorder well and is more than twice the amplitude of the crosby county well the seasonal rainfall distribution was computed from a 110 year record collected by national weather service cooperators in pampa texas a small town located 12 km to the west of the gray county recorder well results shown in fig 11 suggest that rainfall is at a maximum in june with a much smaller secondary peak in august although rainfall is typically at a maximum in june there is only a slight recovery of the water table at this time this suggests that unlike the previous two examples there does not appear to be a significant shutdown of irrigation systems in june despite plentiful rainfall perhaps the high saturated thickness in gray county allows farmers to irrigate more continuously since they do not suffer significant supply limitations in addition the corn crop grown in this area is a water intensive crop that requires more continuous irrigation 4 discussion and conclusions since the inception of irrigated agriculture on the llano estacado reserves of stored water within the ogallala aquifer have been steadily declining the depletion of the aquifer has been well documented by local groundwater districts that maintain vast networks of thousands of observation wells scattered across the llano estacado region the long term trend of gradual depletion is accompanied by more rapid seasonal fluctuations of the water table that reflect regional patterns of irrigation these seasonal water level perturbations can be observed in data collected by recorder wells maintained by the texas water development board recorder wells provide continuous records of daily or hourly data on groundwater conditions which can provide valuable insight into groundwater withdrawals during the growing season and subsequent recovery after harvest seasonal water table fluctuations are induced by intersecting cones of depression that extend outward from nearby actively pumped wells typically seasonal perturbations are cyclical such that the water table is depressed during the growing season then at least partially recovers as pumping is curtailed however water level perturbations can vary somewhat from one year to the next the reason of course is that these cycles are driven by independent decisions of numerous farmers to switch irrigation systems on or off these decisions are influenced by factors such as soil moisture plant stress and variable climatic conditions in addition an inadequate supply of groundwater can lead to involuntary disruptions during the growing season as farmers are forced to shutdown irrigation systems due to supply limitations despite these complications seasonal water level perturbations tend to follow somewhat regular patterns each year such that it is often possible to define an average or normal cycle for a given recorder well here a method was developed to compute the average or normal perturbation pattern for a given location when computing perturbation curves one must consider that the mean position of the water table is constantly shifting after each annual cycle water levels rarely return to the undisturbed level of the previous year thus the method developed to compute an average or normal perturbation cycle employs a moving average so that this non stationary condition is properly handled the computed water level perturbations therefore describe the fluctuations of the water table about a constantly changing mean reference level the resulting perturbation curves can be compared and interpreted to provide valuable insight into the collective actions and decisions of farmers that irrigate neighboring fields generally all the perturbation curves presented in this paper tend to follow a similar pattern of high water levels during the winter months and low levels during the summer growing season in areas with limited groundwater supplies such as crosby or dawson counties farmers may try to conserve water by shutting off irrigation systems during periods of plentiful rainfall and adequate soil moisture as a result one can often detect distinct hydrographic anomalies associated with periods when irrigation is briefly curtailed and the water table is allowed time to partially recover such irrigation breaks appear to correlate closely with periods of plentiful rainfall which typically occur during the spring months of late may and early june in gray county where groundwater supplies are more abundant the typical late spring hydrographic aberration is less evident this suggests that farmers with adequate water may be less inclined to shutdown irrigation systems to conserve groundwater resources or it may reflect the fact that farmers in gray county grow crops such as corn that require more water these farmers may be operating at a constant soil moisture deficit and may choose to keep their systems running continuously throughout the growing season having plentiful groundwater may reduce the need for involuntary shutdowns since continuous pumping does not necessarily exhaust the water supply clearly the interpretation of perturbation curves requires some speculation whereas water level perturbation curves can be computed precisely from data provided by recorder wells rarely are researchers provided information on the decisions of farmers to switch irrigation systems on or off nevertheless if one assumes that farmers act rationally and tend to respond to climatic and soil moisture conditions then an analysis and interpretation of perturbation curves can provide keen insight into the dynamic nature of seasonal pumping of the ogallala aquifer
