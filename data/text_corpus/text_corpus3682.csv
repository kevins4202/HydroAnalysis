18410,in this study zwitterionic polymer brushes with controlled architecture were grafted on the surface of gravity driven membrane gdm via surface initiated reaction to impart antifouling property a variety of membrane characterization techniques were conducted to demonstrate the successful functionalization of zwitterionic polymers on pvdf hollow fiber membrane the membrane underwent 90 min of reaction time possessing strong hydrophilicity and high permeability was determined as the optimal modified membrane long term gdm dynamic fouling experiments operated for 30 days using sewage wastewater as feed solution indicated zwitterionic polymer modified membrane exhibit excellent membrane fouling resistance thus enhanced stable flux confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm imaging implied that zwitterionic polymer modification significantly inhibit the adsorption of extracellular polymeric substances eps which dominates fouling propensity resulting in the formation of a thin biofilm with high porosity under synthetic functions of foulants deposition and microbial activities interfacial free energy prediction affirmed the presence of zwitterionic functional layer on membrane surface could substantially decrease the interactions e g electrostatic attractions and hydrophobic effects between membrane and foulants thereby reduced flux decline and high stable flux our study suggests surface hydrophilic functionalization shows promising potential for improving the performance of ultra low pressure filtration graphical abstract image 1 keywords gravity driven membrane zwitterionic polymers antifouling flux stabilization biofilm 1 introduction membrane based technologies play a critical role in augmenting fresh water resources to alleviate water crisis which afflicts millions of people worldwide elimelech and phillip 2011 shannon et al 2008 ultrafiltration uf membrane process a traditional pressure driven system that could provide an effective barrier for colloids suspended substances and microorganisms have been implemented for a wide variety of fields including water and wastewater treatment juice and dairy processing and cell harvesting davenport et al 2017 shi et al 2014 recently a kind of ultra low pressure uf technology gravity driven membrane gdm process has attracted increasing attention due to its exceptional easy operation and maintenance no extra auxiliary systems and low energy consumption pronk et al 2019 typically in gdm systems uf membranes are operated under extremely low pressure gravitational pressure 40 65 mbar in a dead end mode with no physical or chemical cleaning applied over an extended period of operation time microbial activities tolerated on the membrane surface will induce a porous heterogeneous and permeable biofouling layer and result in a stabilization of flux peter varbanets et al 2010 in gdm technology the biofilm grown on the membrane surface not only performs as a physical barrier to separate contaminants but also contributes to pollutant removal via biodegradation of organic substances chomiak et al 2015 desmond et al 2018 as a gravitational driven energy efficient membrane technology without placing an excessive strain on limited energy supplies gdm has been extended in decentralized drinking water supply wastewater treatment pretreatment of seawater and so on pronk et al 2019 however like other membrane processes one of the major challenges gdm facing is still membrane fouling and low water productivity peter varbanets et al 2011 tang et al 2018b the presence of membrane fouling would inevitably lead to detrimental effects such as decreased permeability shortened membrane lifetime and increased maintenance costs reported stable flux of gdm is around 2 10 l m 2 h 1 notably lower than conventional uf process which could reach 50 100 l m 2 h 1 under operation pressure of 0 2 1 0 bar pronk et al 2019 previous studies have demonstrated that flux stabilization in gdm was related to the construction of biofouling layer which is determined by the synergistic effects of membrane fouling development and biologically induced biofilm structural changes derlon et al 2016 as filtration proceeds the resistance decreases due to structural changes balances the resistance increase because of foulants deposition leading to the final flux stabilization peter varbanets et al 2011 shao et al 2019 in order to improve the permeability in gdm system either increase organisms activities or decrease fouling potential of feed water could be effective pathways to enhance flux values in gdm tang et al 2018a it is reported that cultivation and dosing of specific types of metazoans to sustain a constant level of organisms in the system may engineer a highly porous structure of fouling layer thereby improved stable flux in gdm derlon et al 2013 klein et al 2016 however as the occurrence of microorganisms is dependent on the water source and seasonal conditions and their sustainability in the biofilm is hard to control leading to metazoan predation a quite erratic and unfeasible process derlon et al 2012 on the other hand pretreatment of the feedwater was proposed as alternatives to increase permeate flux by combining gdm system with other processes such as coagulation oxidation biological filtration and adsorption process li et al 2019 pronk et al 2019 whereas these integrated gdm systems usually need extra requirements of chemical inputs footprint auxiliary equipment and high costs tang et al 2018a it is generally accepted that hydrophilic modification of membranes could effectively reduce fouling propensity typically as extra free energy penalty is needed for foulants to replace water molecules bound to hydrophilic materials foulant adsorption on hydrophilic surfaces is energetically unfavorable liu et al 2017b ostuni et al 2001 zhang et al 2016 different strategies have been employed to impart hydrophilicity to uf membranes including addition of hydrophilic materials during membrane casting process or developing a fouling resistant surface on pre fabricated membranes via post modification chen et al 2011 comparatively in situ surface segregation could endow membrane with low fouling potential to both external structures and interior pores but difficult to ensure complete coverage of hydrophilic materials on membrane surfaces where main foulant membrane interactions take place while post modification allows the construction of antifouling layer with consistent surface coverage and retains membrane physical properties simultaneously davenport et al 2017 as a biofilm controlled membrane process the construction of biofouling layer highly determines flux stabilization in gdm technology whereas the interactions between membrane and foulants greatly affects biofilm formation pronk et al 2019 therefore we intended to construct a hydrophilic surface by post modification to control the biofilm formation in gdm via changing interactions between membrane and foulants numerous hydrophilic materials have been demonstrated exhibiting high antifouling efficacy in uf membrane modification including polyvinyl pyrrolidone marchese et al 2003 carbon based materials tang et al 2018b zhang et al 2013 hydrophilic nanoparticles liang et al 2014 poly ethylene glycol peg ma et al 2016 zwitterionic polymers zhu et al 2017 etc among which zwitterionic polymers have raised considerable attraction in antifouling membrane modification areas as they possess the same units of cationic groups and ionic groups which could form a firm hydration shell via electrostatic interactions he et al 2016 jiang and cao 2010 various studies have demonstrated that grafting zwitterionic polymer brushes on membrane surface could tremendously improve fouling resistance in various membrane technologies such as uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and forward osmosis fo chiang et al 2012 li et al 2012a liu et al 2017b mi and jiang 2014 yang et al 2011 however seldom study focused on the role of membrane surface properties via hydrophilic modification in gdm technology in this study we demonstrated hydrophilic modification on gdm membrane surface could effectively improve membrane performance to obtain enhanced stable flux hydrophilic zwitterionic polymers were grafted on pvdf membrane via atom transfer radical polymerization atrp and optimization study was carried out to select the membrane possessing high fouling potential fouling experiments under gdm operation mode utilizing real wastewater as feed solution was conducted to investigate membrane dynamic fouling behavior the biofilm development and interactions between model foulants and membranes were further analyzed to illustrate antifouling mechanism of zwitterion coated membranes to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to systematically investigate the role of membrane surface hydrophilic modification on gdm performance our results provide insights into the antifouling mechanisms of the developed membrane and highlight the potential application of zwitterionic polymers in surface

water sewage wastewater from the campus of harbin institute of technology was collected as the raw water before dynamic fouling experiments the raw water was prefiltered by a 10 μm cartridge filter to eliminate the impacts of large particles or colloids basic characteristics of the raw water were listed in table 1 2 3 2 experimental setup and operation conditions the schematic of gravity driven hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane system is shown in fig 2 overall the experimental setup consists of a storage water tank a constant level feed water tank and membrane tanks with lab made hollow

al 2017a to obtain biovolume of each component i e cells proteins α polysaccharides and β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and the average biofilm thickness and porosity 2 6 xdlvo theory interfacial free energy calculated by the extended derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek xdlvo theory has been widely applied to quantitatively estimate the physicochemical interactions between membrane and foulants thereby evaluating membrane fouling potential according to xdlvo theory the interactions between materials can be expressed as the combination of ulw uab and uel where ulw represents electro dynamic or lifshitz vander waals lw forces which are based on dipole moments uab stands for polar or lewis acid base ab interactions which are based on electron donor electron acceptor interactions between polar moieties in a polar media e g water while uel corresponds to electrostatic el interactions which are relied on electrical surface charge typically present for moieties in polar media e g water accordingly the interaction energy between membranes and foulants is represented by the gibbs free energy of interfacial interaction δg consisting of lifshitz van der waals interaction lw energy lewis acid base interaction ab energy and electrostatic force el energy generally δg can be recognized as an indicator whether the interaction between foulant and membrane is attractive i e δg 0 or repulsive i e δg 0 specifically δg δg lw δg ab and δg el can be calculated by the following equations eqs 1 4 1 δ g δ g l w δ g a b δ g e l 2 δ g l w 2 γ m l w γ w l w γ f l w γ w l w 3 δ g a b 2 γ w

results and discussion 3 1 optimization of membrane modification atom transfer radical polymerization atrp was conducted to graft zwitterionic polymer brushes psbma on pvdf membrane as a highly controlled chemical polymerization technique grafted polymer brush layers were found grown linearly with atrp reaction time davenport et al 2017 liu et al 2017b it has been reported that the thickness of psbma brush layer grafted on the pvdf membrane surface can reach around 300 nm after 2 h of reaction davenport et al 2017 in the current study three polymerization time i e 1 h 1 5 h and 2 h were applied to acquire functional zwitterionic polymer brush layer with different architectures various characterization techniques were utilized in order to find the optimal modified membrane presenting high water transport properties as well as low fouling potential firstly sem imaging and porosity analysis were conducted to characterize membrane surface morphology before and after modifications as shown in fig 3 pristine pvdf membrane exhibits obvious irregular pore distribution with the estimated areal porosity around 8 while after the grafting of psbma brushes it is clear that the crosslinked polymer layer covered the membrane surface to different degrees depending on the polymerization time longer atrp reaction time leads to thicker polymer film and smaller pore size thus lower porosity after 2 h of psbma polymer growth the visible areal porosity estimated from sem images reduced by around 90 compared to pristine membrane indicating a high propensity of zwitterionic polymer coverage in order to further verify the successful grafting of psbma polymer brushes attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy was performed to examine the membrane surface functional groups fig 4 a presents the transmittance spectra of pristine and modified pvdf membranes in the wavenumber range of 1800 800 cm 1 which covers the main functional groups of psbma modified membranes since the penetration depth of ftir is typically between 1 and 5 μm kazarian and chan 2013 ye et al 2015 which is larger than functionalized psbma brush layers peaks associated with pvdf were observed in the atr ftir spectra for all membranes specifically peaks at 1180 cm 1 and 878 cm 1 correspond to the c c band and c c c asymmetrical stretching of pvdf respectively davenport et al 2017 the band at 840 cm 1 was ascribed to the c f stretching vibration of pvdf while the peak at 1402 cm 1 was correlated with ch2 wagging vibrations davenport et al 2017 pda modified membranes exhibit no apparent spectra changes compared to the control membrane which can be attributed to the incomplete coverage and thin thickness of pda coating davenport et al 2017 liu et al 2017b 2017c compared to pristine pvdf membrane on all psbma grafted membranes two distinct peaks appeared at 1039 cm 1 and 1726 cm 1 which are ascribed to so3 stretch vibrations and oco stretching of psbma polymer li et al 2012a 2012b demonstrating the successful functionalization of zwitterionic polymers these typical psbma peak intensities increased with longer atrp reaction time which results from higher psbma polymer brush proportions furthermore membrane surface element was analyzed by xps and the respective wide scan of the pristine and modified membranes were shown in fig s1 supporting information as shown the major signals of f o and c were observed in the wide scan spectrum of the pristine pvdf membrane after psbma grafting distinct n1s s2p and br3d signals appeared while the intensities of f1s reduced significantly and o1s strengthened obviously confirming the presence of psbma polymers li et al 2012b which was consistent with the results of ftir as zwitterionic polymers possess the same units of cationic and anionic groups which can react with water molecules via electrostatic interactions to form a strong hydration layer to improve hydrophilicity laschewsky 2014 laughlin 1991 water contact angle measurements were carried out to investigate membrane surface hydrophilicity and the results are presented in fig 4 b pristine membrane exhibited a remarkable high contact angle of 96 2 due to the intrinsic hydrophobic property of pvdf polymer kang and cao 2014 compared to the control membrane the pvdf 1h psbma membrane shows notably increased hydrophilicity with contact angle reduced by 18 3 when atrp proceed for 1 5 h and 2 h due to the evenly covered thick psbma brush layer fig 3 a both acquired modified membranes exhibits remarkably improved hydrophilic surface with contact angles reduced to around 64 6 and 61 0 respectively functionalization of zwitterionic polymers on membrane surface effectively enhanced membrane surface hydrophilicity and longer psbma polymerization time resulted in higher membrane hydrophilicity one thing needs to be mentioned is that hydrophilic modification by grafting zwitterionic polymers on membrane surface were generally conducted on dense membranes f g ro nf and fo which can reduce membrane contact angle to as low as 10 while for porous membrane such as microfiltration or ultrafiltration the hydrophilicity may not enhance as high as that due to the presence of unmodified interior pore structures kang and cao 2014 werber et al 2016 besides the surface grafting strategy doug et al has conducted interior pda immobilization before atrp process in order to grafting zwitterionic polymers on both external and internal parts of uf membrane thus further improving membrane fouling resistance however despite improved hydrophilicity the interior grafted zwitterionic polymers reduced the transport of water significantly due to pore blocking davenport et al 2017 in our study as gdm generally exhibits remarkable low water flux we aimed to conduct surface grafting to improve membrane fouling resistance by improving hydrophilicity without compromising much water permeability furthermore in gdm system the composition and structure of biofouling layer is critical to both flux development and permeate quality as the construction of biofouling layer is highly influenced by the interactions between membrane surface and foulants this study focused more on the role of membrane surface property thus surface grafting of hydrophilic zwitterionic polymers by highly controlled atrp was conducted normally for post membrane modification pathways surface coating surface grafting etc surface functionalization of hydrophilic materials may on the one hand enhance permeability due to hydrophilicity improvement but on the other hand decrease permeability because of the coverage of functional layer on top of membrane surface therefore one of the principles of membrane modification is to efficiently improve membrane performance f g improving fouling resistance without compromising membrane permeability after contact angle measurements pure water permeability of membranes before and after functionalization were investigated to find the optimal modification condition from fig 4 c water permeability of pristine membrane was around 0 25 l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 comparatively after 1 h of psbma grafting the membrane permeability slightly increased by 45 7 when the reaction time extended to 1 5 h the permeability reached as high as 1 65 l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 significantly increased by 84 8 however when atrp reaction continuously proceeded to 2 h water permeability of the pvdf 2h psbma membrane was 0 91 l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 which increased by 72 5 compared to pristine membrane but 44 8 lower than that of the pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane although 2 h of psbma grafting endows membrane with the highest hydrophilicity grafting of thick polymer brushes 300 nm davenport et al 2017 liu et al 2017b on the membrane surface and low areal porosity 0 75 fig 3 b reversely weakened the capability to water flow transport therefore declined permeability shortly as 1 5 h of atrp reaction imparts the membrane both high permeability and hydrophilicity indicating a promising potential to obtain high water flux and fouling resistance the modified pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane was selected as the optimal membrane for all further investigations including dynamic fouling experiments discussed later 3 2 flux stabilization it is generally accepted zwitterionic polymer brushes could form a firm hydration shell and exhibit strong steric hindrance introduced by brush like flexible polymer chain both regarded as effective barriers to prevent the contact with foulants he et al 2016 previous studies have reported that the functionalization of pvdf membrane with zwitterionic polymers could alleviate fouling in traditional ultrafiltration process effectively chiang et al 2009 davenport et al 2017 hadidi and zydney 2014 zhao and he 2015 however no study has been conducted in the area of gdm typically in a gdm system ultrafiltration membrane is performed at dead end mode driven by gravity pressure ultra low pressure without any physical chemical cleaning and flux stabilization occurred during extended periods of time peter varbanets et al 2010 during gdm membrane fouling process the foulants accumulated in the biofilm will continuously increase the total membrane resistance thereby causing flux decline on the other hand due to the biologically induced structural changes the biofilm layer progressively varies from an initial homogeneous structure to a heterogeneous structure embedded with channel networks this heterogeneous structure with high porosity leads to a decrease of total resistance thereby reduced flux decline as time passing by the flux gradually balances under the above synthetic interactions leading to flux stabilization after around one week peter varbanets et al 2010 pronk et al 2019 in order to demonstrate the fouling resistant capability of zwitterionic polymer modified membrane in gdm dynamic fouling experiments using sewage wastewater as feed solution were conducted to investigate membrane fouling behavior flux stabilization during long term operation was monitored and the formed biofilm were further characterized fig 5 a presents the flux profile of pristine pvdf and modified pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane during one month operation period while fig 5 b displays the final stable flux during the stage flux stabilization occurred as shown in fig 5 a due to the extremely low operation pressure applied in gdm system initial flux for both membranes were relatively high but dropped sharply in the beginning stage comparatively zwitterionic polymer grafted membrane presents instinct higher initial water flux than pristine membrane due to the enhanced membrane surface hydrophilicity despite the same operation pressure pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane 113 7 1 2 l m 2 h 1 pvdf membrane 78 8 4 6 l m 2 h 1 which is in accordance with the permeability results as dynamic fouling exceeded pristine pvdf membrane shows a considerable flux decrease and finally stabilized at around 5 l m 2 h 1 until one week of operation in contrast the psbma modified membrane presents a comparatively smoother flux decline until the water flux stabilized after half month of operation the final stabilized water flux of the pristine membrane was 4 90 0 44 l m 2 h 1 while that of pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane was 11 42 0 21 l m 2 h 1 despite the dead end filtration mode in gdm system the psbma grafted membrane demonstrated 57 enhancement of final stable flux indicating high water productivity it can be inferred that membrane surface functionalization of zwitterionic polymers could notably delay and even reduce flux decline in gdm system as a biofilm controlled membrane system flux stabilization in gdm is determined by the synthetic effects of foulants accumulation and biofilm construction thickness porosity etc the composition and structure of biofilm formed on membrane surface will be further discussed in section 3 4 3 3 filtration permeate quality the permeate quality of control and modified gdm filtration systems were investigated by conducting fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem spectra analysis toc measurements and flow cytometer measurements feem has been widely applied to characterize aquatic samples to evaluate the removal efficiency of natural organic matters ahmad and reynolds 1999 chang et al 2015 normally excitation and emission boundaries can be defined into five regions i region i and ii aromatic proteins excitation wavelengths 250 nm emission wavelengths 350 nm ii region iii fulvic acid like organic matters excitation wavelengths 250 nm emission wavelengths 350 nm iii region iv soluble microbial by product like materials excitation wavelengths of 250 280 nm emission wavelengths 380 nm iv region v humic acid like organic matters excitation wavelengths 280 nm emission wavelengths 380 nm chen et al 2003 as illustrated in fig 6 a feed water presents broad excitation and emission spectra strong peaks were located in the excitation emission wavelength ranges of 220 230 320 350 nm and 270 290 325 350 nm which are related to aromatic proteins and soluble microbial by product like substances respectively the peak at the excitation emission wavelength ranges of 310 340 400 430 nm was corresponded to humic acid like organic matters these fluorescence spectrum results implied that the feed water mainly contained proteins and soluble microbial by product like substances as shown in fig 6 b and c the peak intensities of two permeate samples significantly decreased indicating that membrane processes have removed large quantities of organic matters more specifically nearly all aromatic proteins and the majority of soluble microbial by product like substances have been separated successfully different from traditionally pressure driven uf in gdm the biofilm developed on the membrane can either act as a secondary membrane separation role or perform biodegradation of organic substances contributing to organic removal pronk et al 2019 interestingly modified pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane exhibited reduced peak intensities than that of control membrane suggesting that psbma grafting lead to a slightly higher pollutant removal efficiency this may be attributed to the enhanced hydrophilicity of the membrane due to the grafting of zwitterionic polymers which could form a layer of water molecules to repel typical hydrophobic foulants such as proteins and soluble microbial by product like substances schlenoff 2014 additionally the thick zwitterionic polymer film can perform as another physical barrier to avoid the passage of foulants next the removal efficacies of toc and bacteria have been further investigated to evaluate membrane separation performance and the results are shown in fig 6 d it can be implied that pristine pvdf membrane removed toc and total bacteria by around 40 and 89 respectively the modified pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane exhibited slightly higher removal efficiencies than control which is consistent with the data of feem these results demonstrated that the modified membrane shows both improved stable flux and separation performance in gdm due to the construction of psbma polymer film on membrane surface 3 4 biofilm development theoretically biological fouling could be divided into three steps the reversible adsorption irreversible adsorption and proliferation habimana et al 2014 the reversible adsorption mainly comes from fibronectin via nonspecific interaction and the irreversible adsorption achieved by the extracellular polymers via covalent interactions both highly relating with organic fouling matin et al 2011 tourney et al 2008 for the last step the biological foulants grow and proliferate to form intact biofilms that are hard to be removed which will sharply deteriorate membrane performance i e reduce flux and selectivity he et al 2016 it is well known that in gdm system membrane fouling caused by foulants accumulation and biofilm structural changes over time is the major process determining the fouling mechanism and flux stabilization peter varbanets et al 2011 as discussed above in the current study psbma grafted membrane exhibits reduced flux decline and higher stable flux than the control membrane under a dynamic fouling condition lower flux decline of modified membrane implying that the existence of zwitterionic polymer brushes is expected to affect the construction of biofilm structure remarkably therefore we systematically compared the composition and structure of the biofilms formed on pristine pvdf and psbma modified pvdf membranes by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm fig 7 displays the representative clsm orthogonal images of biofilm developed on pristine and modified membranes after gdm dynamic fouling cells proteins β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and α d glucopyranose polysaccharides were stained in pink green blue and red respectively specified single dye stained clsm images were presented in fig s2 support information from fig 7 and fig s2 cells formed a continuous network layer rich in pore channel on both membranes comparatively the layer developed on pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane was clearly looser with larger channel size proteins on pristine membrane formed a heterogeneous fouling layer with large clusters while significantly reduced and appeared only in some spots on modified membrane β d glucopyranose polysaccharide on both membranes aggregated into distinct clusters α d glucopyranose polysaccharides formed a relatively continuous network layer and respectively the layer on pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane showing reduced intensity clsm images indicated that the grafting of zwitterionic polymer brushes can effectively reduce biofilm thickness with notable decreased eps content to further analyze the biofouling layer construction on pristine and functionalized membranes biofilm proportions were quantitatively calculated in detail as depicted in table 2 cell biovolume accumulated on pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane was 19 lower than that on pristine pvdf membrane which was consistent with the obtained representative clsm fluorescence images in fig 7 zwitterionic polymer grafting also decreased eps components in formed biofilm where proteins reduced by 60 and polysaccharides decreased by 39 specifically protein biovolume on control membrane was 36 97 0 56 μm3 μm 2 while significantly reduced to 14 70 1 16 μm3 μm 2 for pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane furthermore psbma functionalization effectively decreased the biovolume of β polysaccharides and α polysaccharides by 25 and 50 respectively the total thickness of biofilm was compressed by around 16 after membrane modification compared to pristine pvdf membrane biofilm formed on pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane exhibited heterogeneity and higher porosity with the occurrence of large voids between patches of biofilm occurred fig 7 considering the average areal porosity table 2 estimated from obtained clsm images functionalized membrane presents a 34 higher areal porosity thereby stronger water transport capability as in ultra low pressure ultrafiltration such as gdm system biological growth can occur and the extracellular polymeric substances eps excreted by the biofilm is the critical factor which can exacerbate membrane fouling peter varbanets et al 2011 the presence of zwitterionic polymer brushes can mitigate membrane biofouling remarkably due to its excellent fouling resistance especially against eps adhesion on the other hand the microbial activity on the membrane surface induced biofouling layer to become porous heterogeneous and permeable thereby relieves flux decline and finally results in higher flux stabilization during long term operation 3 5 membrane foulant physicochemical interactions dynamic fouling tests and clsm results have demonstrated membrane surface functionalization with zwitterionic polymers could notably mitigate membrane fouling and compress biofilm formation in gdm system it has been reported that numerous factors including operation pressure feed water conditions i e concentration ph etc have played critical roles in determining membrane fouling behaviors subhi et al 2012 besides the above external factors the development of fouling layer is also highly dependent on the membrane properties i e hydrophilicity roughness it is generally accepted that higher surface roughness could aggravate membrane fouling by increasing the attachment of foulants due to larger surface area elimelech et al 1997 furthermore according to wenzel s model roughness can also contribute to surface hydrophilicity except hydrophilic agent zuo and wang 2013 thereby membrane surface roughness before and after modification was investigated by afm measurements the results indicated that the grafting of psbma polymer brushes on membrane surface slightly increased membrane surface roughness both roughness parameters rq and ra enhanced by 14 fig s3 supporting information however t test shows that the change of roughness was not significantly which can be attributed to the evenly coverage of zwitterionic functional layer thus the hydrophilicity enhancement after modification can be roughly ascribed to the grafting of hydrophilic psbma brushes showing promising potential to reduce membrane fouling however simple surface hydrophilicity is not convincing to assess membrane performance and foulant deposition on membrane surface is typically determined by the physicochemical interactions between membranes and foulants subhi et al 2012 generally foulant deposition during membrane filtration was determined by the complex interplay of drag force from the convective flux electrostatic double layer interactions between charged foulants and the charged membrane surface and non electrostatic interactions subhi et al 2012 essentially electrostatic interactions and non electrostatic interactions make up the affinity of foulant towards the membrane surface therefore the xdlvo model prediction was further conducted to estimate the membrane foulant interaction energy profiles electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions in control and modified membrane systems the real sewage wastewater used during the dynamic fouling experiment was filtered by a 0 45 μm membrane and applied as model foulant representative table 3 illustrates the surface tension parameters calculated from contact angle and zeta potential measurements of investigated membranes and real sewage wastewater table s2 γlw γ γ and γab are referred to the lifshitz van der waals electron acceptor electron donor and lewis acid base components respectively the results indicate that pristine pvdf membrane had a relatively high electron acceptor γ and zero electron donor component γ resulting in non polar component of surface tension similar results have been reported in previous studies liu et al 2011 zuo and wang 2013 after psbma functionalization electron acceptor γ slightly increased from 0 14 mj m2 to 0 42 mj m2 and electron donor component γ enhanced significantly to 12 79 mj m2 the high electron donor monopolarity of modified membrane suggests it was likely to be ionized to donate electrons in aqueous media consistent with previous reports zuo and wang 2013 with the surface tension results from table 3 the interfacial free energy between membrane surface and real sewage wastewater was thereby determined according to xdlvo theory the total interaction energy can be divided into δglw δgab and δgel and the results are shown in table 4 typically positive interaction energy signifies resistance to membrane fouling while a negative value implies an attractive function which would aggravate membrane fouling from table 4 the total interaction energy between membrane and foulants were negative for both pvdf and pvdf 1 5h psbma membranes suggesting that foulants tend to attach on membranes in both systems specifically psbma grafted membrane exhibits a much less negative δgtot 44 10 mj m2 than pristine membrane 67 28 mj m2 implying functionalization of zwitterionic polymers tremendously reduced the adhesion of foulants thus promising potential to alleviate membrane fouling furthermore all the interaction energy components were negative for both membranes indicating interfacial free energy of acid base van der waals force and electrostatic double layer force all contributed to foulants adhesion comparatively different values of interaction energies implied different extends of fouling tendency that is more negative component contributed more to membrane fouling it is clear that for the pristine pvdf membrane the interfacial free energy of acid base played a dominant role in the initial fouling stage while van der waals force and electrostatic double layer force contributed much less after membrane modification van der waals force exhibits little change while acid base force and electrostatic double layer force reduced tremendously with the acid base force played a critical role during the interaction process thereby the functionalization of zwitterionic polymers significantly reduced fouling by decreasing electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between foulants and membrane which is in accordance with flux decline and clsm results in dynamic fouling tests similar phenomena were also reported in previous studies gourley et al 1994 hadidi and zydney 2014 zuo and wang 2013 3 6 the role of zwitterionic polymer grafting in gdm system low flux decline and high stable flux of psbma modified gdm membrane system in dynamic fouling experiments confirmed the antifouling character of zwitterionic polymers the complete and dense coverage of zwitterionic polymer brushes are expected to possess strong hydrophilic repulsion caused by local charge induced hydration force steric repulsion by the brush flexible polymer chain and shielding effect of hydrophobic functional groups on pvdf membrane surface which are prone to fouling all contributing to the excellent fouling resistance besides the coverage of zwitterionic functional layer could be regarded as another separation barrier to reject contaminants leading to improved rejection efficacy from thermodynamics viewpoint compared to the pristine pvdf membrane the psbma modified membrane needs more energy for the foulants to break through the hydration shell suggesting the foulants adsorption process is less prone to happen xdlvo prediction demonstrated the construction of zwitterionic polymer layer could significantly reduce electrostatic attractions and hydrophobic effects between membrane and foulants due to its neutral charge and hydrophilic property which might change biofilm constructing and alleviate biofouling however it is emphasized that the membrane foulant interactions are effective primarily at the early stage of fouling the notably lower rate of flux decline for the functionalized membrane compared to the pristine pvdf membrane during the initial fouling period highlights the effectiveness of zwitterionic modification as the advection of foulants towards membrane by gravity pressure proceeded and rejected foulants continuously accumulated on membrane surface the aforementioned antifouling mechanisms of zwitterionic polymers could not be effective and instead the dominant interaction occurs between the newly approaching foulants and the already deposited foulants as known in gdm system foulants adhesion and microbial activity tolerated on the membrane surface would induce a porous heterogeneous and permeable biofouling layer and result in the stabilization of flux after around one week of filtration tang et al 2018b besides antiadhesion property that inhibits the nonspecific adsorption of foulants the strong hydration affinity and steric effect of zwitterionic polymers may endow membrane with an self cleaning ability effect which could release absorbed foulants and help improve cleaning efficiency he et al 2016 this self cleaning effect of zwitterionic polymers is expected to take effect under long term operation in gdm where dead end mode was operated in low pressure without any backwash or chemical cleaning the mechanisms above mentioned together lead to a more porous permeable and compressed biofilm formed on the zwitterion modified membrane as illustrated in clsm results thereby delayed flux decline and enhanced stable flux than the control system 4 conclusion in this study we functionalized pvdf membrane with zwitterionic polymer brushes via highly controlled atrp to combat membrane fouling different polymerization time was conducted and the optimal modified membrane was determined as pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane showing both high hydrophilicity and permeability dynamic fouling tests in gdm operation indicated that surface construction of zwitterionic polymers could significantly reduce flux decline thereby obtaining high final stable flux from xdlvo analysis the presence of zwitterionic polymer brushes with strong water affinity could tremendously reduce the interactions between membrane and foulants especially electrostatic attractions and hydrophobic effects the construction of zwitterionic polymer film on membrane surface may not only impart low membrane foulant interactions inhibiting foulants adhesion but also endow with self cleaning property releasing absorbed foulants which resulted in compressed biofilm formation exhibiting thin thickness and high porosity thereby relieved membrane fouling and improved stable flux we demonstrated surface grafting of hydrophilic zwitterionic polymers on membrane surface could effectively enhance water flux and membrane selectivity in gdm operation furthermore as our modification strategy in constructing psbma film was a precisely controlled method careful optimization of the zwitterionic polymer film thickness is expected to further improve the antifouling property while maintaining the optimal membrane transport properties in addition to surface grafting strategy in situ surface segregation is anticipated to realize the synchronization of membrane fabricating and the surface and pore enrichment of zwitterionic polymers which is expected to further improve membrane

18410,in this study zwitterionic polymer brushes with controlled architecture were grafted on the surface of gravity driven membrane gdm via surface initiated reaction to impart antifouling property a variety of membrane characterization techniques were conducted to demonstrate the successful functionalization of zwitterionic polymers on pvdf hollow fiber membrane the membrane underwent 90 min of reaction time possessing strong hydrophilicity and high permeability was determined as the optimal modified membrane long term gdm dynamic fouling experiments operated for 30 days using sewage wastewater as feed solution indicated zwitterionic polymer modified membrane exhibit excellent membrane fouling resistance thus enhanced stable flux confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm imaging implied that zwitterionic polymer modification significantly inhibit the adsorption of extracellular polymeric substances eps which dominates fouling propensity resulting in the formation of a thin biofilm with high porosity under synthetic functions of foulants deposition and microbial activities interfacial free energy prediction affirmed the presence of zwitterionic functional layer on membrane surface could substantially decrease the interactions e g electrostatic attractions and hydrophobic effects between membrane and foulants thereby reduced flux decline and high stable flux our study suggests surface hydrophilic functionalization shows promising potential for improving the performance of ultra low pressure filtration graphical abstract image 1 keywords gravity driven membrane zwitterionic polymers antifouling flux stabilization biofilm 1 introduction membrane based technologies play a critical role in augmenting fresh water resources to alleviate water crisis which afflicts millions of people worldwide elimelech and phillip 2011 shannon et al 2008 ultrafiltration uf membrane process a traditional pressure driven system that could provide an effective barrier for colloids suspended substances and microorganisms have been implemented for a wide variety of fields including water and wastewater treatment juice and dairy processing and cell harvesting davenport et al 2017 shi et al 2014 recently a kind of ultra low pressure uf technology gravity driven membrane gdm process has attracted increasing attention due to its exceptional easy operation and maintenance no extra auxiliary systems and low energy consumption pronk et al 2019 typically in gdm systems uf membranes are operated under extremely low pressure gravitational pressure 40 65 mbar in a dead end mode with no physical or chemical cleaning applied over an extended period of operation time microbial activities tolerated on the membrane surface will induce a porous heterogeneous and permeable biofouling layer and result in a stabilization of flux peter varbanets et al 2010 in gdm technology the biofilm grown on the membrane surface not only performs as a physical barrier to separate contaminants but also contributes to pollutant removal via biodegradation of organic substances chomiak et al 2015 desmond et al 2018 as a gravitational driven energy efficient membrane technology without placing an excessive strain on limited energy supplies gdm has been extended in decentralized drinking water supply wastewater treatment pretreatment of seawater and so on pronk et al 2019 however like other membrane processes one of the major challenges gdm facing is still membrane fouling and low water productivity peter varbanets et al 2011 tang et al 2018b the presence of membrane fouling would inevitably lead to detrimental effects such as decreased permeability shortened membrane lifetime and increased maintenance costs reported stable flux of gdm is around 2 10 l m 2 h 1 notably lower than conventional uf process which could reach 50 100 l m 2 h 1 under operation pressure of 0 2 1 0 bar pronk et al 2019 previous studies have demonstrated that flux stabilization in gdm was related to the construction of biofouling layer which is determined by the synergistic effects of membrane fouling development and biologically induced biofilm structural changes derlon et al 2016 as filtration proceeds the resistance decreases due to structural changes balances the resistance increase because of foulants deposition leading to the final flux stabilization peter varbanets et al 2011 shao et al 2019 in order to improve the permeability in gdm system either increase organisms activities or decrease fouling potential of feed water could be effective pathways to enhance flux values in gdm tang et al 2018a it is reported that cultivation and dosing of specific types of metazoans to sustain a constant level of organisms in the system may engineer a highly porous structure of fouling layer thereby improved stable flux in gdm derlon et al 2013 klein et al 2016 however as the occurrence of microorganisms is dependent on the water source and seasonal conditions and their sustainability in the biofilm is hard to control leading to metazoan predation a quite erratic and unfeasible process derlon et al 2012 on the other hand pretreatment of the feedwater was proposed as alternatives to increase permeate flux by combining gdm system with other processes such as coagulation oxidation biological filtration and adsorption process li et al 2019 pronk et al 2019 whereas these integrated gdm systems usually need extra requirements of chemical inputs footprint auxiliary equipment and high costs tang et al 2018a it is generally accepted that hydrophilic modification of membranes could effectively reduce fouling propensity typically as extra free energy penalty is needed for foulants to replace water molecules bound to hydrophilic materials foulant adsorption on hydrophilic surfaces is energetically unfavorable liu et al 2017b ostuni et al 2001 zhang et al 2016 different strategies have been employed to impart hydrophilicity to uf membranes including addition of hydrophilic materials during membrane casting process or developing a fouling resistant surface on pre fabricated membranes via post modification chen et al 2011 comparatively in situ surface segregation could endow membrane with low fouling potential to both external structures and interior pores but difficult to ensure complete coverage of hydrophilic materials on membrane surfaces where main foulant membrane interactions take place while post modification allows the construction of antifouling layer with consistent surface coverage and retains membrane physical properties simultaneously davenport et al 2017 as a biofilm controlled membrane process the construction of biofouling layer highly determines flux stabilization in gdm technology whereas the interactions between membrane and foulants greatly affects biofilm formation pronk et al 2019 therefore we intended to construct a hydrophilic surface by post modification to control the biofilm formation in gdm via changing interactions between membrane and foulants numerous hydrophilic materials have been demonstrated exhibiting high antifouling efficacy in uf membrane modification including polyvinyl pyrrolidone marchese et al 2003 carbon based materials tang et al 2018b zhang et al 2013 hydrophilic nanoparticles liang et al 2014 poly ethylene glycol peg ma et al 2016 zwitterionic polymers zhu et al 2017 etc among which zwitterionic polymers have raised considerable attraction in antifouling membrane modification areas as they possess the same units of cationic groups and ionic groups which could form a firm hydration shell via electrostatic interactions he et al 2016 jiang and cao 2010 various studies have demonstrated that grafting zwitterionic polymer brushes on membrane surface could tremendously improve fouling resistance in various membrane technologies such as uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro and forward osmosis fo chiang et al 2012 li et al 2012a liu et al 2017b mi and jiang 2014 yang et al 2011 however seldom study focused on the role of membrane surface properties via hydrophilic modification in gdm technology in this study we demonstrated hydrophilic modification on gdm membrane surface could effectively improve membrane performance to obtain enhanced stable flux hydrophilic zwitterionic polymers were grafted on pvdf membrane via atom transfer radical polymerization atrp and optimization study was carried out to select the membrane possessing high fouling potential fouling experiments under gdm operation mode utilizing real wastewater as feed solution was conducted to investigate membrane dynamic fouling behavior the biofilm development and interactions between model foulants and membranes were further analyzed to illustrate antifouling mechanism of zwitterion coated membranes to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to systematically investigate the role of membrane surface hydrophilic modification on gdm performance our results provide insights into the antifouling mechanisms of the developed membrane and highlight the potential application of zwitterionic polymers in surface

free energy calculated by the extended derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek xdlvo theory has been widely applied to quantitatively estimate the physicochemical interactions between membrane and foulants thereby evaluating membrane fouling potential according to xdlvo theory the interactions between materials can be expressed as the combination of ulw uab and uel where ulw represents electro dynamic or lifshitz vander waals lw forces which are based on dipole moments uab stands for polar or lewis acid base ab interactions which are based on electron donor electron acceptor interactions between polar moieties in a polar media e g water while uel corresponds to electrostatic el interactions which are relied on electrical surface charge typically present for moieties in polar media e g water accordingly the interaction energy between membranes and foulants is represented by the gibbs free energy of interfacial interaction δg consisting of lifshitz van der waals interaction lw energy lewis acid base interaction ab energy and electrostatic force el energy generally δg can be recognized as an indicator whether the interaction between foulant and membrane is attractive i e δg 0 or

results and discussion 3 1 optimization of membrane modification atom transfer radical polymerization atrp was conducted to graft zwitterionic polymer brushes psbma on pvdf membrane as a highly controlled chemical polymerization technique grafted polymer brush layers were found grown linearly with atrp reaction time davenport et al 2017 liu et al 2017b it has been reported that the thickness of psbma brush layer grafted on the pvdf membrane surface can reach around 300 nm after 2 h of reaction davenport et al 2017 in the current study three polymerization time i e 1 h 1 5 h and 2 h were applied to acquire functional zwitterionic polymer brush layer with different architectures various characterization techniques were utilized in order to find the optimal modified membrane presenting high water transport properties as well as low fouling potential firstly sem imaging and porosity analysis were conducted to characterize membrane surface morphology before and after modifications as shown in fig 3 pristine pvdf membrane exhibits obvious irregular pore distribution with the estimated areal porosity around 8 while after the grafting of psbma brushes it is clear that the crosslinked polymer layer covered the membrane surface to different degrees depending on the polymerization time longer atrp reaction time leads to thicker polymer film and smaller pore size thus lower porosity after 2 h of psbma polymer growth the visible areal porosity estimated from sem images reduced by around 90 compared to pristine membrane indicating a high propensity of zwitterionic polymer coverage in order to further verify the successful grafting of psbma polymer brushes attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy was performed to examine the membrane surface functional groups fig 4 a presents the transmittance spectra of pristine and modified pvdf membranes in the wavenumber range of 1800 800 cm 1 which covers the main functional groups of psbma modified membranes since the penetration depth of ftir is typically between 1 and 5 μm kazarian and chan 2013 ye et al 2015 which is larger than functionalized psbma brush layers peaks associated with pvdf were observed in the atr ftir spectra for all membranes specifically peaks at 1180 cm 1 and 878 cm 1 correspond to the c c band and c c c asymmetrical stretching of pvdf respectively davenport et al 2017 the band at 840 cm 1 was ascribed to the c f stretching vibration of pvdf while the peak at 1402 cm 1 was correlated with ch2 wagging vibrations davenport et al 2017 pda modified membranes exhibit no apparent spectra changes compared to the control membrane which can be attributed to the incomplete coverage and thin thickness of pda coating davenport et al 2017 liu et al 2017b 2017c compared to pristine pvdf membrane on all psbma grafted membranes two distinct peaks appeared at 1039 cm 1 and 1726 cm 1 which are ascribed to so3 stretch vibrations and oco stretching of psbma polymer li et al 2012a 2012b demonstrating the successful functionalization of zwitterionic polymers these typical psbma peak intensities increased with longer atrp reaction time which results from higher psbma polymer brush proportions furthermore membrane surface element was analyzed by xps and the respective wide scan of the pristine and modified membranes were shown in fig s1 supporting information as shown the major signals of f o and c were observed in the wide scan spectrum of the pristine pvdf membrane after psbma grafting distinct n1s s2p and br3d signals appeared while the intensities of f1s reduced significantly and o1s strengthened obviously confirming the presence of psbma polymers li et al 2012b which was consistent with the results of ftir as zwitterionic polymers possess the same units of cationic and anionic groups which can react with water molecules via electrostatic interactions to form a strong hydration layer to improve hydrophilicity laschewsky 2014 laughlin 1991 water contact angle measurements were carried out to investigate membrane surface hydrophilicity and the results are presented in fig 4 b pristine membrane exhibited a remarkable high contact angle of 96 2 due to the intrinsic hydrophobic property of pvdf polymer kang and cao 2014 compared to the control membrane the pvdf 1h psbma membrane shows notably increased hydrophilicity with contact angle reduced by 18 3 when atrp proceed for 1 5 h and 2 h due to the evenly covered thick psbma brush layer fig 3 a both acquired modified membranes exhibits remarkably improved hydrophilic surface with contact angles reduced to around 64 6 and 61 0 respectively functionalization of zwitterionic polymers on membrane surface effectively enhanced membrane surface hydrophilicity and longer psbma polymerization time resulted in higher membrane hydrophilicity one thing needs to be mentioned is that hydrophilic modification by grafting zwitterionic polymers on membrane surface were generally conducted on dense membranes f g ro nf and fo which can reduce membrane contact angle to as low as 10 while for porous membrane such as microfiltration or ultrafiltration the hydrophilicity may not enhance as high as that due to the presence of unmodified interior pore structures kang and cao 2014 werber et al 2016 besides the surface grafting strategy doug et al has conducted interior pda immobilization before atrp process in order to grafting zwitterionic polymers on both external and internal parts of uf membrane thus further improving membrane fouling resistance however despite improved hydrophilicity the interior grafted zwitterionic polymers reduced the transport of water significantly due to pore blocking davenport et al 2017 in our study as gdm generally exhibits remarkable low water flux we aimed to conduct surface grafting to improve membrane fouling resistance by improving hydrophilicity without compromising much water permeability furthermore in gdm system the composition and structure of biofouling layer is critical to both flux development and permeate quality as the construction of biofouling layer is highly influenced by the interactions between membrane surface and foulants this study focused more on the role of membrane surface property thus surface grafting of hydrophilic zwitterionic polymers by highly controlled atrp was conducted normally for post membrane modification pathways surface coating surface grafting etc surface functionalization of hydrophilic materials may on the one hand enhance permeability due to hydrophilicity improvement but on the other hand decrease permeability because of the coverage of functional layer on top of membrane surface therefore one of the principles of membrane modification is to efficiently improve membrane performance f g improving fouling resistance without compromising membrane permeability after contact angle measurements pure water permeability of membranes before and after functionalization were investigated to find the optimal modification condition from fig 4 c water permeability of pristine membrane was around 0 25 l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 comparatively after 1 h of psbma grafting the membrane permeability slightly increased by 45 7 when the reaction time extended to 1 5 h the permeability reached as high as 1 65 l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 significantly increased by 84 8 however when atrp reaction continuously proceeded to 2 h water permeability of the pvdf 2h psbma membrane was 0 91 l m 2 h 1 kpa 1 which increased by 72 5 compared to pristine membrane but 44 8 lower than that of the pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane although 2 h of psbma grafting endows membrane with the highest hydrophilicity grafting of thick polymer brushes 300 nm davenport et al 2017 liu et al 2017b on the membrane surface and low areal porosity 0 75 fig 3 b reversely weakened the capability to water flow transport therefore declined permeability shortly as 1 5 h of atrp reaction imparts the membrane both high permeability and hydrophilicity indicating a promising potential to obtain high water flux and fouling resistance the modified pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane was selected as the optimal membrane for all further investigations including dynamic fouling experiments discussed later 3 2 flux stabilization it is generally accepted zwitterionic polymer brushes could form a firm hydration shell and exhibit strong steric hindrance introduced by brush like flexible polymer chain both regarded as effective barriers to prevent the contact with foulants he et al 2016 previous studies have reported that the functionalization of pvdf membrane with zwitterionic polymers could alleviate fouling in traditional ultrafiltration process effectively chiang et al 2009 davenport et al 2017 hadidi and zydney 2014 zhao and he 2015 however no study has been conducted in the area of gdm typically in a gdm system ultrafiltration membrane is performed at dead end mode driven by gravity pressure ultra low pressure without any physical chemical cleaning and flux stabilization occurred during extended periods of time peter varbanets et al 2010 during gdm membrane fouling process the foulants accumulated in the biofilm will continuously increase the total membrane resistance thereby causing flux decline on the other hand due to the biologically induced structural changes the biofilm layer progressively varies from an initial homogeneous structure to a heterogeneous structure embedded with channel networks this heterogeneous structure with high porosity leads to a decrease of total resistance thereby reduced flux decline as time passing by the flux gradually balances under the above synthetic interactions leading to flux stabilization after around one week peter varbanets et al 2010 pronk et al 2019 in order to demonstrate the fouling resistant capability of zwitterionic polymer modified membrane in gdm dynamic fouling experiments using sewage wastewater as feed solution were conducted to investigate membrane fouling behavior flux stabilization during long term operation was monitored and the formed biofilm were further characterized fig 5 a presents the flux profile of pristine pvdf and modified pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane during one month operation period while fig 5 b displays the final stable flux during the stage flux stabilization occurred as shown in fig 5 a due to the extremely low operation pressure applied in gdm system initial flux for both membranes were relatively high but dropped sharply in the beginning stage comparatively zwitterionic polymer grafted membrane presents instinct higher initial water flux than pristine membrane due to the enhanced membrane surface hydrophilicity despite the same operation pressure pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane 113 7 1 2 l m 2 h 1 pvdf membrane 78 8 4 6 l m 2 h 1 which is in accordance with the permeability results as dynamic fouling exceeded pristine pvdf membrane shows a considerable flux decrease and finally stabilized at around 5 l m 2 h 1 until one week of operation in contrast the psbma modified membrane presents a comparatively smoother flux decline until the water flux stabilized after half month of operation the final stabilized water flux of the pristine membrane was 4 90 0 44 l m 2 h 1 while that of pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane was 11 42 0 21 l m 2 h 1 despite the dead end filtration mode in gdm system the psbma grafted membrane demonstrated 57 enhancement of final stable flux indicating high water productivity it can be inferred that membrane surface functionalization of zwitterionic polymers could notably delay and even reduce flux decline in gdm system as a biofilm controlled membrane system flux stabilization in gdm is determined by the synthetic effects of foulants accumulation and biofilm construction thickness porosity etc the composition and structure of biofilm formed on membrane surface will be further discussed in section 3 4 3 3 filtration permeate quality the permeate quality of control and modified gdm filtration systems were investigated by conducting fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem spectra analysis toc measurements and flow cytometer measurements feem has been widely applied to characterize aquatic samples to evaluate the removal efficiency of natural organic matters ahmad and reynolds 1999 chang et al 2015 normally excitation and emission boundaries can be defined into five regions i region i and ii aromatic proteins excitation wavelengths 250 nm emission wavelengths 350 nm ii region iii fulvic acid like organic matters excitation wavelengths 250 nm emission wavelengths 350 nm iii region iv soluble microbial by product like materials excitation wavelengths of 250 280 nm emission wavelengths 380 nm iv region v humic acid like organic matters excitation wavelengths 280 nm emission wavelengths 380 nm chen et al 2003 as illustrated in fig 6 a feed water presents broad excitation and emission spectra strong peaks were located in the excitation emission wavelength ranges of 220 230 320 350 nm and 270 290 325 350 nm which are related to aromatic proteins and soluble microbial by product like substances respectively the peak at the excitation emission wavelength ranges of 310 340 400 430 nm was corresponded to humic acid like organic matters these fluorescence spectrum results implied that the feed water mainly contained proteins and soluble microbial by product like substances as shown in fig 6 b and c the peak intensities of two permeate samples significantly decreased indicating that membrane processes have removed large quantities of organic matters more specifically nearly all aromatic proteins and the majority of soluble microbial by product like substances have been separated successfully different from traditionally pressure driven uf in gdm the biofilm developed on the membrane can either act as a secondary membrane separation role or perform biodegradation of organic substances contributing to organic removal pronk et al 2019 interestingly modified pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane exhibited reduced peak intensities than that of control membrane suggesting that psbma grafting lead to a slightly higher pollutant removal efficiency this may be attributed to the enhanced hydrophilicity of the membrane due to the grafting of zwitterionic polymers which could form a layer of water molecules to repel typical hydrophobic foulants such as proteins and soluble microbial by product like substances schlenoff 2014 additionally the thick zwitterionic polymer film can perform as another physical barrier to avoid the passage of foulants next the removal efficacies of toc and bacteria have been further investigated to evaluate membrane separation performance and the results are shown in fig 6 d it can be implied that pristine pvdf membrane removed toc and total bacteria by around 40 and 89 respectively the modified pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane exhibited slightly higher removal efficiencies than control which is consistent with the data of feem these results demonstrated that the modified membrane shows both improved stable flux and separation performance in gdm due to the construction of psbma polymer film on membrane surface 3 4 biofilm development theoretically biological fouling could be divided into three steps the reversible adsorption irreversible adsorption and proliferation habimana et al 2014 the reversible adsorption mainly comes from fibronectin via nonspecific interaction and the irreversible adsorption achieved by the extracellular polymers via covalent interactions both highly relating with organic fouling matin et al 2011 tourney et al 2008 for the last step the biological foulants grow and proliferate to form intact biofilms that are hard to be removed which will sharply deteriorate membrane performance i e reduce flux and selectivity he et al 2016 it is well known that in gdm system membrane fouling caused by foulants accumulation and biofilm structural changes over time is the major process determining the fouling mechanism and flux stabilization peter varbanets et al 2011 as discussed above in the current study psbma grafted membrane exhibits reduced flux decline and higher stable flux than the control membrane under a dynamic fouling condition lower flux decline of modified membrane implying that the existence of zwitterionic polymer brushes is expected to affect the construction of biofilm structure remarkably therefore we systematically compared the composition and structure of the biofilms formed on pristine pvdf and psbma modified pvdf membranes by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm fig 7 displays the representative clsm orthogonal images of biofilm developed on pristine and modified membranes after gdm dynamic fouling cells proteins β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and α d glucopyranose polysaccharides were stained in pink green blue and red respectively specified single dye stained clsm images were presented in fig s2 support information from fig 7 and fig s2 cells formed a continuous network layer rich in pore channel on both membranes comparatively the layer developed on pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane was clearly looser with larger channel size proteins on pristine membrane formed a heterogeneous fouling layer with large clusters while significantly reduced and appeared only in some spots on modified membrane β d glucopyranose polysaccharide on both membranes aggregated into distinct clusters α d glucopyranose polysaccharides formed a relatively continuous network layer and respectively the layer on pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane showing reduced intensity clsm images indicated that the grafting of zwitterionic polymer brushes can effectively reduce biofilm thickness with notable decreased eps content to further analyze the biofouling layer construction on pristine and functionalized membranes biofilm proportions were quantitatively calculated in detail as depicted in table 2 cell biovolume accumulated on pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane was 19 lower than that on pristine pvdf membrane which was consistent with the obtained representative clsm fluorescence images in fig 7 zwitterionic polymer grafting also decreased eps components in formed biofilm where proteins reduced by 60 and polysaccharides decreased by 39 specifically protein biovolume on control membrane was 36 97 0 56 μm3 μm 2 while significantly reduced to 14 70 1 16 μm3 μm 2 for pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane furthermore psbma functionalization effectively decreased the biovolume of β polysaccharides and α polysaccharides by 25 and 50 respectively the total thickness of biofilm was compressed by around 16 after membrane modification compared to pristine pvdf membrane biofilm formed on pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane exhibited heterogeneity and higher porosity with the occurrence of large voids between patches of biofilm occurred fig 7 considering the average areal porosity table 2 estimated from obtained clsm images functionalized membrane presents a 34 higher areal porosity thereby stronger water transport capability as in ultra low pressure ultrafiltration such as gdm system biological growth can occur and the extracellular polymeric substances eps excreted by the biofilm is the critical factor which can exacerbate membrane fouling peter varbanets et al 2011 the presence of zwitterionic polymer brushes can mitigate membrane biofouling remarkably due to its excellent fouling resistance especially against eps adhesion on the other hand the microbial activity on the membrane surface induced biofouling layer to become porous heterogeneous and permeable thereby relieves flux decline and finally results in higher flux stabilization during long term operation 3 5 membrane foulant physicochemical interactions dynamic fouling tests and clsm results have demonstrated membrane surface functionalization with zwitterionic polymers could notably mitigate membrane fouling and compress biofilm formation in gdm system it has been reported that numerous factors including operation pressure feed water conditions i e concentration ph etc have played critical roles in determining membrane fouling behaviors subhi et al 2012 besides the above external factors the development of fouling layer is also highly dependent on the membrane properties i e hydrophilicity roughness it is generally accepted that higher surface roughness could aggravate membrane fouling by increasing the attachment of foulants due to larger surface area elimelech et al 1997 furthermore according to wenzel s model roughness can also contribute to surface hydrophilicity except hydrophilic agent zuo and wang 2013 thereby membrane surface roughness before and after modification was investigated by afm measurements the results indicated that the grafting of psbma polymer brushes on membrane surface slightly increased membrane surface roughness both roughness parameters rq and ra enhanced by 14 fig s3 supporting information however t test shows that the change of roughness was not significantly which can be attributed to the evenly coverage of zwitterionic functional layer thus the hydrophilicity enhancement after modification can be roughly ascribed to the grafting of hydrophilic psbma brushes showing promising potential to reduce membrane fouling however simple surface hydrophilicity is not convincing to assess membrane performance and foulant deposition on membrane surface is typically determined by the physicochemical interactions between membranes and foulants subhi et al 2012 generally foulant deposition during membrane filtration was determined by the complex interplay of drag force from the convective flux electrostatic double layer interactions between charged foulants and the charged membrane surface and non electrostatic interactions subhi et al 2012 essentially electrostatic interactions and non electrostatic interactions make up the affinity of foulant towards the membrane surface therefore the xdlvo model prediction was further conducted to estimate the membrane foulant interaction energy profiles electrostatic and non electrostatic interactions in control and modified membrane systems the real sewage wastewater used during the dynamic fouling experiment was filtered by a 0 45 μm membrane and applied as model foulant representative table 3 illustrates the surface tension parameters calculated from contact angle and zeta potential measurements of investigated membranes and real sewage wastewater table s2 γlw γ γ and γab are referred to the lifshitz van der waals electron acceptor electron donor and lewis acid base components respectively the results indicate that pristine pvdf membrane had a relatively high electron acceptor γ and zero electron donor component γ resulting in non polar component of surface tension similar results have been reported in previous studies liu et al 2011 zuo and wang 2013 after psbma functionalization electron acceptor γ slightly increased from 0 14 mj m2 to 0 42 mj m2 and electron donor component γ enhanced significantly to 12 79 mj m2 the high electron donor monopolarity of modified membrane suggests it was likely to be ionized to donate electrons in aqueous media consistent with previous reports zuo and wang 2013 with the surface tension results from table 3 the interfacial free energy between membrane surface and real sewage wastewater was thereby determined according to xdlvo theory the total interaction energy can be divided into δglw δgab and δgel and the results are shown in table 4 typically positive interaction energy signifies resistance to membrane fouling while a negative value implies an attractive function which would aggravate membrane fouling from table 4 the total interaction energy between membrane and foulants were negative for both pvdf and pvdf 1 5h psbma membranes suggesting that foulants tend to attach on membranes in both systems specifically psbma grafted membrane exhibits a much less negative δgtot 44 10 mj m2 than pristine membrane 67 28 mj m2 implying functionalization of zwitterionic polymers tremendously reduced the adhesion of foulants thus promising potential to alleviate membrane fouling furthermore all the interaction energy components were negative for both membranes indicating interfacial free energy of acid base van der waals force and electrostatic double layer force all contributed to foulants adhesion comparatively different values of interaction energies implied different extends of fouling tendency that is more negative component contributed more to membrane fouling it is clear that for the pristine pvdf membrane the interfacial free energy of acid base played a dominant role in the initial fouling stage while van der waals force and electrostatic double layer force contributed much less after membrane modification van der waals force exhibits little change while acid base force and electrostatic double layer force reduced tremendously with the acid base force played a critical role during the interaction process thereby the functionalization of zwitterionic polymers significantly reduced fouling by decreasing electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between foulants and membrane which is in accordance with flux decline and clsm results in dynamic fouling tests similar phenomena were also reported in previous studies gourley et al 1994 hadidi and zydney 2014 zuo and wang 2013 3 6 the role of zwitterionic polymer grafting in gdm system low flux decline and high stable flux of psbma modified gdm membrane system in dynamic fouling experiments confirmed the antifouling character of zwitterionic polymers the complete and dense coverage of zwitterionic polymer brushes are expected to possess strong hydrophilic repulsion caused by local charge induced hydration force steric repulsion by the brush flexible polymer chain and shielding effect of hydrophobic functional groups on pvdf membrane surface which are prone to fouling all contributing to the excellent fouling resistance besides the coverage of zwitterionic functional layer could be regarded as another separation barrier to reject contaminants leading to improved rejection efficacy from thermodynamics viewpoint compared to the pristine pvdf membrane the psbma modified membrane needs more energy for the foulants to break through the hydration shell suggesting the foulants adsorption process is less prone to happen xdlvo prediction demonstrated the construction of zwitterionic polymer layer could significantly reduce electrostatic attractions and hydrophobic effects between membrane and foulants due to its neutral charge and hydrophilic property which might change biofilm constructing and alleviate biofouling however it is emphasized that the membrane foulant interactions are effective primarily at the early stage of fouling the notably lower rate of flux decline for the functionalized membrane compared to the pristine pvdf membrane during the initial fouling period highlights the effectiveness of zwitterionic modification as the advection of foulants towards membrane by gravity pressure proceeded and rejected foulants continuously accumulated on membrane surface the aforementioned antifouling mechanisms of zwitterionic polymers could not be effective and instead the dominant interaction occurs between the newly approaching foulants and the already deposited foulants as known in gdm system foulants adhesion and microbial activity tolerated on the membrane surface would induce a porous heterogeneous and permeable biofouling layer and result in the stabilization of flux after around one week of filtration tang et al 2018b besides antiadhesion property that inhibits the nonspecific adsorption of foulants the strong hydration affinity and steric effect of zwitterionic polymers may endow membrane with an self cleaning ability effect which could release absorbed foulants and help improve cleaning efficiency he et al 2016 this self cleaning effect of zwitterionic polymers is expected to take effect under long term operation in gdm where dead end mode was operated in low pressure without any backwash or chemical cleaning the mechanisms above mentioned together lead to a more porous permeable and compressed biofilm formed on the zwitterion modified membrane as illustrated in clsm results thereby delayed flux decline and enhanced stable flux than the control system 4 conclusion in this study we functionalized pvdf membrane with zwitterionic polymer brushes via highly controlled atrp to combat membrane fouling different polymerization time was conducted and the optimal modified membrane was determined as pvdf 1 5h psbma membrane showing both high hydrophilicity and permeability dynamic fouling tests in gdm operation indicated that surface construction of zwitterionic polymers could significantly reduce flux decline thereby obtaining high final stable flux from xdlvo analysis the presence of zwitterionic polymer brushes with strong water affinity could tremendously reduce the interactions between membrane and foulants especially electrostatic attractions and hydrophobic effects the construction of zwitterionic polymer film on membrane surface may not only impart low membrane foulant interactions inhibiting foulants adhesion but also endow with self cleaning property releasing absorbed foulants which resulted in compressed biofilm formation exhibiting thin thickness and high porosity thereby relieved membrane fouling and improved stable flux we demonstrated surface grafting of hydrophilic zwitterionic polymers on membrane surface could effectively enhance water flux and membrane selectivity in gdm operation furthermore as our modification strategy in constructing psbma film was a precisely controlled method careful optimization of the zwitterionic polymer film thickness is expected to further improve the antifouling property while maintaining the optimal membrane transport properties in addition to surface grafting strategy in situ surface segregation is anticipated to realize the synchronization of membrane fabricating and the surface and pore enrichment of zwitterionic polymers which is expected to further improve membrane

18411,pyrrhotite is often considered as a gangue mineral and discarded in mine wastes and tailings glyphosate and fertilizer often excessively used in agriculture flow into water bodies with agriculture runoff and cause pollution of water bodies in this study the pyrrhotite was used as a substrate in a pilot constructed wetland cw to remove the glyphosate and nutrients from simulated agriculture runoff in nearly one year the pilot pyrrhotite constructed wetland pyrr cw removed 90 3 6 1 of glyphosate 88 2 5 1 of total phosphorus tp and 60 40 5 60 of total nitrogen tn on average much higher than the control cw the abundances of sulfur oxidizing bacteria such as sulfurifustis sulfuriferula and thiobacillus were much higher in the pyrr cw than those in the control cw in the pyrr cw goethite was produced by pyrrhotite aerobic oxidation pao and pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification pad continuously and spontaneously higher glyphosate and tp removals were resulted from adsorption on the goethite produced and higher tn removal was attributed to the pad high glyphosate and nutrients removal could keep a long term until the pyrrhotite in the pyrr cw was used up the phosphorus p sequestered in the pyrr cw existed mainly in organic p fe al p and ca mg p and their order was fe al p organic p ca mg p no heavy metal ions released from the pyrr cw with higher and lasting removal rate and lower cost the pyrr cw is a promising technology for simultaneous glyphosate and nutrients removal from agricultural runoff and wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords

uses of fertilizers herbicides and pesticides have been expanded in agriculture all over the world kasak et al 2018 baylis 2000 glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine pmg a broad spectrum nonselective organophosphate herbicide is the largest applied herbicide worldwide jiang et al 2018 the widespread usages of pmg and fertilizer in agriculture result in agricultural runoff containing amounts of pmg nitrogen n and phosphorous p and causes pollution of water bodies hijosa valsero et al 2010 weerakoon et al 2018 maillard et al 2012 which is currently one of the most pressing environmental issues worldwide turner et al 2006 constructed wetlands cws between agricultural areas and water bodies are widely used to remove pmg n and p in agricultural runoff for its relatively low costs minimal maintenance requirements and energy inputs dal ferro et al 2018 lee et al 2010 however the cws usually have limited ability to remove pmg n and p in agricultural runoff which has created concerns over the applicability and longevity of the cws lee et al 2010 scholz and hedmark 2010 huetta et al 2005 in the cws the main mechanism for both pmg stangroom et al 2000 and p hu and shan 2009 removal is adsorption of substrate the affinity of pmg and p towards iron containing substrates is well established rivoira et al 2016 and iron rich and iron oxide containing substrates are excellent adsorbents for pmg fiorilli et al 2017 and p rentza et al 2009 however adsorption of pmg and p by an iron containing substrate in the cws is a finite process once the substrate becomes saturated it will have to be either washed or replaced richardson 1985 which is very difficult to be implemented in the cws ferric ions were proposed to add into agricultural runoff for enhancing p removal of the cws sherwood and qualls 2001 but it increased the operational cost and management complexity of the cws it is desirable that the substrates in the cws be able to release iron ions into water continuously and spontaneously in the cws the main mechanism for n removal is generally considered to be microbial denitrification occurring either heterotrophically or autotrophically fleming singer and horne 2002 hang et al 2017 agricultural runoff has high nitrate and low cod tn ratio which make n removal in cws difficult due to insufficient organic carbon availability for heterotrophic denitrifiers huetta et al 2005 mander et al 2014 solid organic materials such as wood mulch saeed and sun 2011 and rice husk tee et al 2012 have been used as substrates in cws to enhance heterotrophic denitrification but using them in the cws has the risk of potential cod secondary pollution wu et al 2014 elemental sulfur bezbaruah and zhang 2003 park et al 2015 has been used as a substrate in cws to enhance autotrophic denitrification with low cost and without risk of cod secondary pollution zhang and lampe 1999 however both solid organic matter and elemental sulfur could not enhance pmg and p removal recently we used natural pyrite as substrate in a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland and found that pyrite had no negative effects on growth of reeds removals of cod and nh4 n but enhanced long term tn and tp removal ge et al 2019 however pmg removal was not investigated in the pyrite cw natural pyrrhotite fe1 xs where x varies from 0 to 0 125 is the second most abundant and widespread iron sulfides after pyrite in the earth rickard and luther 2007 both of them are made of fe and s element but they have different molecular formula crystal structure and chemical characteristics autotrophic denitrification rate of pyrrhotite is faster than that of pyrite after successfully studying pyrite constructed wetland to enhance n and p removal ge et al 2019 we have the inspiration to study constructed wetland filled with pyrrhotite for glyphosate and nutrient removal natural pyrrrhotite has never been used as substrate in cw before but our previous researches found the natural pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification biofilter padb had excellent simultaneous n and p removal from wastewater lack of organic matter li et al 2013 2016 after synthetic pyrrhotite was added into aquifer sediments the denitrification rate increased with the synthetic pyrrhotite concentration in sediments until saturation was reached garcia gil and golterman 1993 golterman 1991 therefore it is feasible that natural pyrrhotite is directly used as a substrate in the cw for enhancement of pmg and nutrient removal in this study a pilot pyrrhotite cw pyrr cw was constructed the objectives of this study are to investigate performances and mechanisms of the pyrr cw for simultaneous pmg and nutrient removal in simulated agricultural runoff this would be a novel way to control pollution of water bodies from agricultural runoff 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates pyrrhotite and limestone were obtained from anhui and jiangsu province china respectively they were analyzed with x ray

1000 700 mm l w h on a sidewall there were 18 outlets for monitoring changes of water quality in the substrate layer fig 1 the 18 outlets were labeled as pxy with x 1 2 6 for horizontal distance of 0

reported here is the contact time porosity substrate volume flow rate of the wastewater influent and effluent were collected 1 or 2 times a week water samples were collected from the 18 outlets as

around p12 p22 p32 p42 p52 p62 were obtained with a sampling scoop for analysis of phosphorus forms in the substrate followed literature forbes et al 2004 and substrate samples between p32 and p42 of pyrr cw and lime cw were collected for microbial community analysis following our previous research ge et al 2019 3 results 3 1 effects of hrt on pmg and nutrients removal fig 2 shows that pmg tp and tn removal rate in the pyrr cw and the lime cw increased quickly with hrt increasing to 60 h and then basically leveled therefore the optimal hrt was 60 h for both the lime cw and the pyrr cw which was in the range of recommended hrt of common cws for wastewater treatment 2 5 days wu et al 2015 in the following experiments the hrt was kept at 60 h as shown in fig 2 at each hrt pmg and tp removal rates in the pyrr cw were much higher than those were in the lime cw it was due to that pmg and tp were quickly adsorbed more on fe rich substrates than on ca rich substrates which was supported by ksp of metal pmg complexes decreased in the order of ca fe sundaram and sundaram 1997 but the pmg removal rate difference was smaller than the tp removal difference between the pyrr cw and the lime cw it was attributed to the pmg biodegradation in the two cws which was little related to the substrates the tn removal difference between the pyrr cw and lime cw became obvious only as the hrt was over 60 h the heterotrophic denitrification is faster than the autotrophic denitrification as the hrt was short tn removal was mainly dependent on heterotrophic denitrification thus there was small tn removal difference between the pyrr cw and the lime cw once the hrt was long enough the tn removal difference arising from autotrophic denitrification in the pyrr cw and lime cw emerged and increased until saturation was reached saeed and sun 2012 3 2 pmg and phosphorus removal both the pyrr cw and the lime cw continuously operated for 307 days fig 3 a1 and a2 show pmg removal in the pyrr cw and the lime cw respectively the influent pmg waved between 10 and 30 mg l 1 for the pyrr cw and between 10 and 23 mg l 1 for the lime cw and the average effluent pmg and pmg removal rate were 1 5 0 8 mean s d mg l 1 and 90 3 6 1 for the pyrr cw and 5 4 1 3 mg l 1 and 66 4 8 8 for the lime cw respectively pmg removal rate of the pyrr cw was much higher than that of the lime cw p 0 001 as shown in fig 3b1 and b2 the average influent po4 3 p of the pyrr cw and the lime cw were 1 04 0 39 and 1 33 0 39 mg l 1 respectively and the average effluent and removal rate of them were 0 13 0 07 and 88 3 3 9 and 1 29 0 56 mg l 1 and 8 6 63 8 respectively the pyrr cw had stable and effective po4 3 removal in the whole operation period however the lime cw had po4 3 removal over 70 within the first 2 months of operation but below 20 and even released po4 3 within the further operation it indicated that the lime cw reached p adsorption saturation after optimal hrt experiments and the first two months of operation according to fig 3c1 and c2 the average influent tp of the pyrr cw and lime cw were 4 28 0 88 and 4 90 0 64 mg l 1 respectively and the average effluent and removal rate of tp of them were 0 48 0 15 and 88 2 5 1 and 4 50 0 69 mg l 1 and 8 2 10 1 respectively it indicated that the pyrr cw had lasting excellent p removal performance 3 3 nitrogen removal as shown in fig 4a1 b1 and c1 the average influent nh4 n no3 n and tn of the pyrr cw were 6 61 4 04 11 85 5 35 and 23 60 7 12 mg l 1 respectively the pyrr cw obtained effluent with 1 88 1 23 mg l 1 nh4 n 4 05 1 62 mg l 1 no3 n and 9 21 2 50 mg l 1 tn on average and the average nh4 n no3 n and tn removal rate in the pyrr cw were 66 02 13 82 63 22 12 12 and 60 40 5 60 respectively on comparison fig 4a2 b2 and c2 the average influent nh4 n no3 n and tn of the lime cw were 8 40 4 43 11 53 5 56 and 22 00 8 45 mg l 1 respectively the lime cw obtained effluent with 2 42 1 42 mg l 1 nh4 n 6 29 2 65 mg l 1 no3 n and 10 55 5 01 mg l 1 tn on average and the average nh4 n no3 n and tn removal rate were 71 35 7 66 44 21 8 96 and 51 19 10 86 respectively the pyrr cw had worse nh4 n removal performance than the lime cw p 0 05 but it had better removal performances on both no3 n p 0 001 and tn p 0 001 than the lime cw 4 discussion dissolved oxygen do is one of the principal control parameters in the cws kimwaga 2015 in this study do has close relationship with cod degradation nitrification denitrification pmg biodegradation and adsorption of pmg and p main do supplies in the cws are influent carrying aquatic plant releasing and air transferring liu et al 2016 do supplies could be considered to be the same for both the pyrr cw and the lime cw for the same cw configuration and aquatic plants however do consumption processes were quite different between the pyrr cw and the lime cw besides do consumption processes of cod degradation nitrification pmg biodegradation which existed in both the pyrr cw and the lime cw the more important do consumption process pyrrhotite aerobic oxidation pao existed only in the pyrr cw which is expressed as follow 1 4 f e s 9 o 2 10 h 2 o 4 f e o h 3 4 s o 4 2 8 h therefore do decreased faster and was lower in the pyrr cw than in the lime cw fig 5a1 and a2 and it had important effects on nutrients and pmg removal in the pyrr cw due to lack of do for cod degradation and nitrification the average cod and nh4 n removal rate in the pyrr cw were 50 79 6 33 fig s4a and 66 02 13 82 fig 4a1 respectively lower than those in the lime cw 56 98 5 84 p 0 001 fig s4b and 71 35 7 66 p 0 001 fig 4a2 respectively however in our previous study ge et al 2019 we found that there were no significant differences between the pyrite cw and the limestone cw on cod and nh4 n removal though both pyrrhotite and pyrite consist of iron and sulfur they have different chemical activity oxidation rate of pyrrhotite is faster than that of pyrite due to the vacancy of iron atoms in the pyrrhotite crystal structure belzile et al 2004 thus do shortage was much more in the pyrr cw than that in the pyrite cw which made cod degradation and nitrification decrease more in the pyrr cw than in the pyrite cw as shown in fig 5a1 and a2 in horizontal 0 600 mm of the substrate area do was consumed and nh4 n was removed quickly and no3 n increased a little and in horizontal 600 3000 mm of the substrate area do decreased a little and nh4 n basically levelled and no3 n decreased gradually in both the pyrr cw and the lime cw it indicated that nitrification occurred mainly in horizontal 0 600 mm of the substrate area and denitrification occurred mainly in horizontal 600 3000 mm of the substrate area in both the pyrr cw and the lime cw no3 n decreased faster in the pyrr cw than in the lime cw fig 5a1 and a2 which occurred in each level of the substrate area fig 6b1 and b2 the enhanced denitrification in the pyrr cw was ascribed to the pad a few of previous studies schippers and jorgensen 2002 haaijer et al 2007 found that in freshwater wetland synthetic fes can be oxidized microbially with no3 as electron acceptor and be of importance to microbial denitrification the pad is expressed as follow 2 10 f e s 9 n o 3 16 h 2 o 10 f e o h 3 5 n 2 10 s o 4 2 2 h the five largest genera in pyrr cw were anaeromyxobacter 5 08 propionivibrio 4 08 defluviicoccus 3 64 sphingomonas 3 44 bradyrhizobium 3 44 fig 7 which are a little different from those in the pyrite cw ge 2019 but the microbial communities in the padb with the same volume ratio of pyrrhotite and limestone as the pyrr cw were quite different from those in the pyrr cw the dominant bacteria in the padb were thiobacillus 58 65 and sulfurimonas 12 30 which used pyrrhotite as the electron donor to reduce no3 zhang et al 2019 bacteria in the pyrr cw grew naturally but in the padb were enriched with culture medium therefore the pyrr cw could enhance tn removal rate by culturing more thiobacillus and sulfurimonas in the pyrr cw abundances of sulfur oxidizing bacteria involved the pao and the pad were at least dozens of times more than those in the lime cw for example abundance of sulfurifustis umezawa et al 2016 involved in the pao were 1 2 and 0 in the pyrr cw and the lime cw respectively and sulfuriferula watanabe et al 2016 and thiobacillus involved in the pad were 6 9 and 9 6 in the pyrr cw and 0 and 0 3 in the lime cw respectively the pad made the pyrr cw remove no3 more than the lime cw comparatively the abundance of thiobacillus in the pyrr cw was much higher than those in the pyrite cw 1 2 ge et al 2019 it implied that autotrophic denitrificationin the pyrr cw was stronger than that in the pyrite cw both the pao and the pad produced so4 2 and fe oh 3 the high so4 2 in the effluent of the pyrr cw fig s4c supported the pao and the pad reactions happened in the pyrr cw newly produced fe oh 3 usually transforms into goethite feooh as follow lee et al 2015 3 f e o h 3 f e o o h h 2 o in the past several decades the mineral goethite ahmed et al 2018 barja and afonso 2005 jonsson et al 2008 received much attention for pmg removal in cws because it is common mineral and has strong adsorption for pmg in a wide range of environmental processes in the pyrr cw goethite was produced quickly in horizontal 0 600 mm by the pao and slowly in horizontal 600 3000 mm by the pad in the substrate area continuously and spontaneously in the pyrr cw the newly produced goethite has higher p adsorption capacity than the mineral goethite conidi and parker 2015 therefore pmg was removed quickly in horizontal 0 600 mm the substrate area and slowly in the other substrate area fig 5b1 and 6a1 just because of goethite produced continuously through the pao and the pad the pyrr cw was of excellent pmg removal average 90 3 6 1 in near one year comparatively pmg usually poorly eliminated 55 in typical cws when whose inlet concentration was high ranging from a few mg l 1 to tens of mg l 1 liu et al 2019 as pmg entered the cws pmg attenuation occurred by an initial fast adsorption to the substrate and followed by a slow biodegradation imfeld et al 2013 pmg degradation formed aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa etc and ultimately degraded to form po4 3 etc rueppel et al 1977 li et al 2018 like pmg ampa was also strongly adsorbed on goethite rampazzo et al 2013 the sorption of pmg and ampa on the produced goethite reduced their toxic effects on microbial growth schnurer et al 2006 which was beneficial for the pyrr cw to remove other pollutants in the agricultural runoff with the similar phosphonate functional groups po4 3 pmg and ampa competed for the same sorption sites gimsing and borggaard 2001 and po4 3 competition significantly impacted the pmg adsorption capacity yan and jing 2018 but in the pyrr cw both po4 3 and pmg p was completely removed fig 5b1 it was attributed to that the goethite produced and pyrrhotite in the pyrr cw were enough for both po4 3 and pmg sorption so tp in the substrate area of the pyrr cw decreased to below 0 2 mg l 1 but in the lime cw tp in the substrate area basically had no decrease fig 5b2 which further indicated that p adsorption saturation of the limestone that pmg p decreased slowly in the substrate area of the lime cw fig 5b2 was ascribed to the slow pmg biodegradation usually in cws pmg can be gradually degraded in a few days imfeld et al 2013 pmg biodegradation produced po4 3 and caused po4 3 p increasing slowly in the substrate area of the lime cw in horizontal direction fig 5b2 the sequestered p in both the pyrr cw and lime cw existed mainly in organic p fe al p and ca mg p fig s5 in the pyrr cw the order of them was fe al p organic p ca mg p but in lime cw the ca mg p was dominant proportion of organic p in the pyrr cw was more than that in the lime cw it showed that goethite and pyrrhotite sequestered more pmg or ampa than the limestone which was in agreement with munira et al munira et al 2018 the sequestered organic p in the pyrr cw would finally turn into fe al p after biodegradation and adsorption in the effluent so4 2 was up to 1102 205 mg l 1 which much higher than that of standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 in china our previous research li et al 2016 found that padb was able to remove 14 mg l 1 no3 n in 24 h with only about 50 mg l 1 of so4 2 released therefore the pyrr cw have latent capacity for faster denitrification and less so4 2 releasing table s2 shows that all heavy metal ions were lower than those of standard iii for surface water gb 3838 2002 china and standards for farmland irrigation water gb 20922 2007 china therefore the risk of releasing heavy metal ions was very low as natural pyrrhotite was used in cw pyrrhotite is often considered as a gangue mineral and discarded in mine wastes and tailings where it is oxidized to produce acid mine drainage belzile et al 2004 one of the most serious forms of water pollution in the world akcil and koldas 2006 however in this study the pyrr cw demonstrated excellent pmg tn tp removal rates of 90 3 681 g pmg m 2 yr 1 60 4 700 g n m 2 yr 1 and 88 2 185 g p m 2 yr 1 on average respectively in nearly one year comparatively pmg tn tp removal rates in the typical cws were 55 liu et al 2019 40 55 250 630 g n m 2 yr 1 vymazal 2007 hu et al 2012 lee et al 2009 40 60 45 75g p m 2 yr 1 vymazal 2007 respectively therefore pyrrhotite the harmful gangue mineral to waster environment became a beneficial material to water environment as used in the cw materials with high content of ca fe and al have been recommended as desirable substrates of cws due to high p adsorption capacity but most of them loss their p retention capacity after 3 5 years period of application vohla et al 2011 because of adsorption saturation like the limestone however in the pyrr cw the pao and the pad can take place continuously and spontaneously therefore the pyrr cw would keep higher removal efficiency of pmg tn and tp for a long term until pyrrhotite is not enough for their removal to our best knowledge besides the pyrite cw ge et al 2019 the pyrr cw was the only cw whose p retention capacity was not limited by adsorption saturation of substrate besides pmg many other organophosphorus chemicals are extensively used in agriculture industry and household and have been widely detected in water bodies liu et al 2019 rott et al 2018 with the similar phosphonate functional groups as pmg they could also be effectively removed by the pyrr cw the organophosphorus chemicals removed from the wastewater would retain in the pyrr cw and finally turn into second minerals containing po4 3 li et al 2016 which could be taken into account as fertilizer vohla et al 2011 5 conclusion the natural pyrrhotite was used as a substrate in a pilot constructed wetland to remove the glyphosate and nutrients from synthetic agriculture runoff in nearly one year the pyrr cw removed 90 3 6 1 of glyphosate 88 2 5 1 of tp and 60 40 5 60 of tn on average from the agriculture runoff in the pyrr cw goethite was produced by pao and pad continuously and spontaneously higher glyphosate and tp removals were resulted from adsorption on the produced goethite and higher tn removal was attributed to the pad the five largest genera in pyrr cw were anaeromyxobacter 5 08 propionivibrio 4 08 defluviicoccus 3 64 sphingomonas 3 44 bradyrhizobium 3 44 the phosphorus p sequestered in the pyrr cw existed mainly in organic p fe al p and ca mg p and their order was fe al p organic p ca mg p no heavy metal ions released from the pyrr cw pyrrhotite the harmful gangue mineral to waster environment became a beneficial material to water environment as used in the cw declaration of competing

18411,pyrrhotite is often considered as a gangue mineral and discarded in mine wastes and tailings glyphosate and fertilizer often excessively used in agriculture flow into water bodies with agriculture runoff and cause pollution of water bodies in this study the pyrrhotite was used as a substrate in a pilot constructed wetland cw to remove the glyphosate and nutrients from simulated agriculture runoff in nearly one year the pilot pyrrhotite constructed wetland pyrr cw removed 90 3 6 1 of glyphosate 88 2 5 1 of total phosphorus tp and 60 40 5 60 of total nitrogen tn on average much higher than the control cw the abundances of sulfur oxidizing bacteria such as sulfurifustis sulfuriferula and thiobacillus were much higher in the pyrr cw than those in the control cw in the pyrr cw goethite was produced by pyrrhotite aerobic oxidation pao and pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification pad continuously and spontaneously higher glyphosate and tp removals were resulted from adsorption on the goethite produced and higher tn removal was attributed to the pad high glyphosate and nutrients removal could keep a long term until the pyrrhotite in the pyrr cw was used up the phosphorus p sequestered in the pyrr cw existed mainly in organic p fe al p and ca mg p and their order was fe al p organic p ca mg p no heavy metal ions released from the pyrr cw with higher and lasting removal rate and lower cost the pyrr cw is a promising technology for simultaneous glyphosate and nutrients removal from agricultural runoff and wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords

uses of fertilizers herbicides and pesticides have been expanded in agriculture all over the world kasak et al 2018 baylis 2000 glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine pmg a broad spectrum nonselective organophosphate herbicide is the largest applied herbicide worldwide jiang et al 2018 the widespread usages of pmg and fertilizer in agriculture result in agricultural runoff containing amounts of pmg nitrogen n and phosphorous p and causes pollution of water bodies hijosa valsero et al 2010 weerakoon et al 2018 maillard et al 2012 which is currently one of the most pressing environmental issues worldwide turner et al 2006 constructed wetlands cws between agricultural areas and water bodies are widely used to remove pmg n and p in agricultural runoff for its relatively low costs minimal maintenance requirements and energy inputs dal ferro et al 2018 lee et al 2010 however the cws usually have limited ability to remove pmg n and p in agricultural runoff which has created concerns over the applicability and longevity of the cws lee et al 2010 scholz and hedmark 2010 huetta et al 2005 in the cws the main mechanism for both pmg stangroom et al 2000 and p hu and shan 2009 removal is adsorption of substrate the affinity of pmg and p towards iron containing substrates is well established rivoira et al 2016 and iron rich and iron oxide containing substrates are excellent adsorbents for pmg fiorilli et al 2017 and p rentza et al 2009 however adsorption of pmg and p by an iron containing substrate in the cws is a finite process once the substrate becomes saturated it will have to be either washed or replaced richardson 1985 which is very difficult to be implemented in the cws ferric ions were proposed to add into agricultural runoff for enhancing p removal of the cws sherwood and qualls 2001 but it increased the operational cost and management complexity of the cws it is desirable that the substrates in the cws be able to release iron ions into water continuously and spontaneously in the cws the main mechanism for n removal is generally considered to be microbial denitrification occurring either heterotrophically or autotrophically fleming singer and horne 2002 hang et al 2017 agricultural runoff has high nitrate and low cod tn ratio which make n removal in cws difficult due to insufficient organic carbon availability for heterotrophic denitrifiers huetta et al 2005 mander et al 2014 solid organic materials such as wood mulch saeed and sun 2011 and rice husk tee et al 2012 have been used as substrates in cws to enhance heterotrophic denitrification but using them in the cws has the risk of potential cod secondary pollution wu et al 2014 elemental sulfur bezbaruah and zhang 2003 park et al 2015 has been used as a substrate in cws to enhance autotrophic denitrification with low cost and without risk of cod secondary pollution zhang and lampe 1999 however both solid organic matter and elemental sulfur could not enhance pmg and p removal recently we used natural pyrite as substrate in a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland and found that pyrite had no negative effects on growth of reeds removals of cod and nh4 n but enhanced long term tn and tp removal ge et al 2019 however pmg removal was not investigated in the pyrite cw natural pyrrhotite fe1 xs where x varies from 0 to 0 125 is the second most abundant and widespread iron sulfides after pyrite in the earth rickard and luther 2007 both of them are made of fe and s element but they have different molecular formula crystal structure and chemical characteristics autotrophic denitrification rate of pyrrhotite is faster than that of pyrite after successfully studying pyrite constructed wetland to enhance n and p removal ge et al 2019 we have the inspiration to study constructed wetland filled with pyrrhotite for glyphosate and nutrient removal natural pyrrrhotite has never been used as substrate in cw before but our previous researches found the natural pyrrhotite autotrophic denitrification biofilter padb had excellent simultaneous n and p removal from wastewater lack of organic matter li et al 2013 2016 after synthetic pyrrhotite was added into aquifer sediments the denitrification rate increased with the synthetic pyrrhotite concentration in sediments until saturation was reached garcia gil and golterman 1993 golterman 1991 therefore it is feasible that natural pyrrhotite is directly used as a substrate in the cw for enhancement of pmg and nutrient removal in this study a pilot pyrrhotite cw pyrr cw was constructed the objectives of this study are to investigate performances and mechanisms of the pyrr cw for simultaneous pmg and nutrient removal in simulated agricultural runoff this would be a novel way to control pollution of water bodies from agricultural runoff 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates pyrrhotite and limestone were obtained from anhui and jiangsu province china respectively they were analyzed with x ray diffraction and x ray fluorescence spectrometer arl 9800xp switzerland the fes and caco3 accounted for 97 51 and 98 73 in the pyrrhotite and limestone respectively table s1 xrd spectra show that they are pyrrhotite and limestone mineral phases figs s1 and s2 respectively the particle size of all substrates was between 5 and 20 mm 2 2 subsurface flow constructed wetlands two horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands pyrr cw and lime cw located by the local stream 32º07 56 n 118º56 56 e were constructed with brick and cement with the same configuration 5640 mm 1480 mm 1200 mm l w h fig s3 as our previous research ge et al 2019 the substrates in the lime cw and the pyrr cw were limestone mixture of pyrrhotite and limestone 1 1 of volume ratio respectively the substrate layer was 3000 1000 700 mm l w h on a sidewall there were 18 outlets for monitoring changes of water quality in the substrate layer fig 1 the 18 outlets were labeled as pxy with x 1 2 6 for horizontal distance of 0 600 1200 1800 2400 and 3000 mm along water flow and y 1 2 3 for 50 300 and 600 mm high respectively 2 3 operation sampling and analysis common reeds p australis were planted in the two cws with 8 individual plants per m2 in july 2014 from then on simulated agricultural runoff prepared with the river water and pmg kh2po4 and kno3 for suitable influent concentrations pmg 10 30 mg l po4 3 p 0 5 2 0 mg l no3 n 5 25 mg l was pumped into the two cws with peristaltic pump continuously between sept and dec of 2014 they operated for reed growth and optimal hydraulic retention time hrt the hrt changed between 24 and 84h in each hrt the operation time lasted for 3 weeks from mar to dec 2015 the two cws continuously operated at the optimal hrt for pmg and nutrients removal performance the hrt reported here is the contact time porosity substrate volume flow rate of the wastewater influent and effluent were collected 1 or 2 times a week water samples were collected from the 18 outlets as needed water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filter and stored at 4 c until they were analyzed cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n tn tp and po4 3 p were analyzed using spectrophotometric measurement uv vis spectrophotometer a6 pgeneral beijing the ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured with portable acidity meter phb 4 leici shanghai and dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach usa respectively the residual heavy metal ions concentrations were determined with icp optima 5300dv perkinelmer usa samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter and the remaining amount of pmg was determined by hplc agilent 1200 usa after precolumn derivatization by 9 fluorenylmethyl chloroformate fmoc cl using a waters atlantis c18 250 mm 416 mm 5 μm i d the mobile phase consisted of phosphoric buffer and acetonitrile at a ratio of 75 25 and a flow rate of 1 ml min fluorescence detection was set at an excitation wavelength of 254 nm and emission at 315 nm ibanez et al 2005 in the summer of 2015 substrate samples around p12 p22 p32 p42 p52 p62 were obtained with a sampling scoop for analysis of phosphorus forms in the substrate followed literature forbes et al 2004 and substrate samples between p32 and p42 of pyrr cw and lime cw were collected for microbial community analysis following our previous research ge et al 2019 3 results 3 1 effects of hrt on pmg and nutrients removal fig 2 shows that pmg tp and tn removal rate in the pyrr cw and the lime cw increased quickly with hrt increasing to 60 h and then basically leveled therefore the optimal hrt was 60 h for both the lime cw and the pyrr cw which was in the range of recommended hrt of common cws for wastewater treatment 2 5 days wu et al 2015 in the following experiments the hrt was kept at 60 h as shown in fig 2 at each hrt pmg and tp removal rates in the pyrr cw were much higher than those were in the lime cw it was due to that pmg and tp were quickly adsorbed more on fe rich substrates than on ca rich substrates which was supported by ksp of metal pmg complexes decreased in the order of ca fe sundaram and sundaram 1997 but the pmg removal rate difference was smaller than the tp removal difference between the pyrr cw and the lime cw it was attributed to the pmg biodegradation in the two cws which was little related to the substrates the tn removal difference between the pyrr cw and lime cw became obvious only as the hrt was over 60 h the heterotrophic denitrification is faster than the autotrophic denitrification as the hrt was short tn removal was mainly dependent on heterotrophic denitrification thus there was small tn removal difference between the pyrr cw and the lime cw once the hrt was long enough the tn removal difference arising from autotrophic denitrification in the pyrr cw and lime cw emerged and increased until saturation was reached saeed and sun 2012 3 2 pmg and phosphorus removal both the pyrr cw and the lime cw continuously operated for 307 days fig 3 a1 and a2 show pmg removal in the pyrr cw and the lime cw respectively the influent pmg waved between 10 and 30 mg l 1 for the pyrr cw and between 10 and 23 mg l 1 for the lime cw and the average effluent pmg and pmg removal rate were 1 5 0 8 mean s d mg l 1 and 90 3 6 1 for the pyrr cw and 5 4 1 3 mg l 1 and 66 4 8 8 for the lime cw respectively pmg removal rate of the pyrr cw was much higher than that of the lime cw p 0 001 as shown in fig 3b1 and b2 the average influent po4 3 p of the pyrr cw and the lime cw were 1 04 0 39 and 1 33 0 39 mg l 1 respectively and the average effluent and removal rate of them were 0 13 0 07 and 88 3 3 9 and 1 29 0 56 mg l 1 and 8 6 63 8 respectively the pyrr cw had stable and effective po4 3 removal in the whole operation period however the lime cw had po4 3 removal over 70 within the first 2 months of operation but below 20 and even released po4 3 within the further operation it indicated that the lime cw reached p adsorption saturation after optimal hrt experiments and the first two months of operation according to fig 3c1 and c2 the average influent tp of the pyrr cw and lime cw were 4 28 0 88 and 4 90 0 64 mg l 1 respectively and the average effluent and removal rate of tp of them were 0 48 0 15 and 88 2 5 1 and 4 50 0 69 mg l 1 and 8 2 10 1 respectively it indicated that the pyrr cw had lasting excellent p removal performance 3 3 nitrogen removal as shown in fig 4a1 b1 and c1 the average influent nh4 n no3 n and tn of the pyrr cw were 6 61 4 04 11 85 5 35 and 23 60 7 12 mg l 1 respectively the pyrr cw obtained effluent with 1 88 1 23 mg l 1 nh4 n 4 05 1 62 mg l 1 no3 n and 9 21 2 50 mg l 1 tn on average and the average nh4 n no3 n and tn removal rate in the pyrr cw were 66 02 13 82 63 22 12 12 and 60 40 5 60 respectively on comparison fig 4a2 b2 and c2 the average influent nh4 n no3 n and tn of the lime cw were 8 40 4 43 11 53 5 56 and 22 00 8 45 mg l 1 respectively the lime cw obtained effluent with 2 42 1 42 mg l 1 nh4 n 6 29 2 65 mg l 1 no3 n and 10 55 5 01 mg l 1 tn on average and the average nh4 n no3 n and tn removal rate were 71 35 7 66 44 21 8 96 and 51 19 10 86 respectively the pyrr cw had worse nh4 n removal performance than the lime cw p 0 05 but it had better removal performances on both no3 n p 0 001 and tn p 0 001 than the lime cw 4 discussion dissolved oxygen do is one of the principal control parameters in the cws kimwaga 2015 in

consumption processes were quite different between the pyrr cw and the lime cw besides do consumption processes of cod degradation nitrification pmg biodegradation which existed in both the pyrr cw and the lime cw the more important do consumption process pyrrhotite aerobic oxidation pao existed only in the pyrr cw which is expressed as follow 1 4 f e s 9 o 2 10 h 2 o 4 f e o h 3 4 s o 4 2 8 h therefore do decreased faster and was lower in the pyrr cw than in the lime cw fig 5a1 and a2 and it had important effects on nutrients and pmg removal in the pyrr cw due to lack of do for cod degradation and nitrification the average cod and nh4 n removal rate in the pyrr cw were 50 79 6 33 fig s4a and 66 02 13 82 fig 4a1 respectively lower than those in the lime cw 56 98 5 84 p 0 001 fig s4b and 71 35 7 66 p 0 001 fig 4a2 respectively however in our previous study ge et al 2019 we found that there were no significant differences between the pyrite cw and the limestone cw on cod and nh4 n removal though both pyrrhotite and pyrite consist of iron and sulfur they have different chemical activity oxidation rate of pyrrhotite is faster than that of pyrite due to the vacancy of iron atoms in the pyrrhotite crystal structure belzile et al 2004 thus do shortage was much more in the pyrr cw than that in the pyrite cw which made cod degradation and nitrification decrease more in the pyrr cw than in the pyrite cw as shown in fig 5a1 and a2 in horizontal 0 600 mm of the substrate area do was consumed and nh4 n was removed quickly and no3 n increased a little and in horizontal 600 3000 mm of the substrate area do decreased a little and nh4 n basically levelled and no3 n decreased gradually in both the pyrr cw and the lime cw it indicated that nitrification occurred mainly in horizontal 0 600 mm of the substrate area and denitrification occurred mainly in horizontal 600 3000 mm of the substrate area in both the pyrr cw and the lime cw no3 n decreased faster in the pyrr cw than in the lime cw fig 5a1 and a2 which occurred in each level of the substrate area fig 6b1 and b2 the enhanced denitrification in the pyrr cw was ascribed to the pad a few of previous studies schippers and jorgensen 2002 haaijer et al 2007 found that in freshwater wetland synthetic fes can be oxidized microbially with no3 as electron acceptor and be of importance to microbial denitrification the pad is expressed as follow 2 10 f e s 9 n o 3 16 h 2 o 10 f e o h 3 5 n 2 10 s o 4 2 2 h the five largest genera in pyrr cw were anaeromyxobacter 5 08 propionivibrio 4 08 defluviicoccus 3 64 sphingomonas 3 44 bradyrhizobium 3 44 fig 7 which are a little different from those in the pyrite cw ge 2019 but the microbial communities in the padb with the same volume ratio of pyrrhotite and limestone as the pyrr cw were quite different from those in the pyrr cw the dominant bacteria in the padb were thiobacillus 58 65 and sulfurimonas 12 30 which used pyrrhotite as the electron donor to reduce no3 zhang et al 2019 bacteria in the pyrr cw grew naturally but in the padb were enriched with culture medium therefore the pyrr cw could enhance tn removal rate by culturing more thiobacillus and sulfurimonas in the pyrr cw abundances of sulfur oxidizing bacteria involved the pao and the pad were at least dozens of times more than those in the lime cw for example abundance of sulfurifustis umezawa et al 2016 involved in the pao were 1 2 and 0 in the pyrr cw and the lime cw respectively and sulfuriferula watanabe et al 2016 and thiobacillus involved in the pad were 6 9 and 9 6 in the pyrr cw and 0 and 0 3 in the lime cw respectively the pad made the pyrr cw remove no3 more than the lime cw comparatively the abundance of thiobacillus in the pyrr cw was much higher than those in the pyrite cw 1 2 ge et al 2019 it implied that autotrophic denitrificationin the pyrr cw was stronger than that in the pyrite cw both the pao and the pad produced so4 2 and fe oh 3 the high so4 2 in the effluent of the pyrr cw fig s4c supported the pao and the pad reactions happened in the pyrr cw newly produced fe oh 3 usually transforms into goethite feooh as follow lee et al 2015 3 f e o h 3 f e o o h h 2 o in the past several decades the mineral goethite ahmed et al 2018 barja and afonso 2005 jonsson et al 2008 received much attention for pmg removal in cws because it is common mineral and has strong adsorption for pmg in a wide range of environmental processes in the pyrr cw goethite was produced quickly in horizontal 0 600 mm by the pao and slowly in horizontal 600 3000 mm by the pad in the substrate area continuously and spontaneously in the pyrr cw the newly produced goethite has higher p adsorption capacity than the mineral goethite conidi and parker 2015 therefore pmg was removed quickly in horizontal 0 600 mm the substrate area and slowly in the other substrate area fig 5b1 and 6a1 just because of goethite produced continuously through the pao and the pad the pyrr cw was of excellent pmg removal average 90 3 6 1 in near one year comparatively pmg usually poorly eliminated 55 in typical cws when whose inlet concentration was high ranging from a few mg l 1 to tens of mg l 1 liu et al 2019 as pmg entered the cws pmg attenuation occurred by an initial fast adsorption to the substrate and followed by a slow biodegradation imfeld et al 2013 pmg degradation formed aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa etc and ultimately degraded to form po4 3 etc rueppel et al 1977 li et al 2018 like pmg ampa was also strongly adsorbed on goethite rampazzo et al 2013 the sorption of pmg and ampa on the produced goethite reduced their toxic effects on microbial growth schnurer et al 2006 which was beneficial for the pyrr cw to remove other pollutants in the agricultural runoff with the similar phosphonate functional groups po4 3 pmg and ampa competed for the same sorption sites gimsing and borggaard 2001 and po4 3 competition significantly impacted the pmg adsorption capacity yan and jing 2018 but in the pyrr cw both po4 3 and pmg p was completely removed fig 5b1 it was attributed to that the goethite produced and pyrrhotite in the pyrr cw were enough for both po4 3 and pmg sorption so tp in the substrate area of the pyrr cw decreased to below 0 2 mg l 1 but in the lime cw tp in the substrate area basically had no decrease fig 5b2 which further indicated that p adsorption saturation of the limestone that pmg p decreased slowly in the substrate area of the lime cw fig 5b2 was ascribed to the slow pmg biodegradation usually in cws pmg can be gradually degraded in a few days imfeld et al 2013 pmg biodegradation produced po4 3 and caused po4 3 p increasing slowly in the substrate area of the lime cw in horizontal direction fig 5b2 the sequestered p in both the pyrr cw and lime cw existed mainly in organic p fe al p and ca mg p fig s5 in the pyrr cw the order of them was fe al p organic p ca mg p but in lime cw the ca mg p was dominant proportion of organic p in the pyrr cw was more than that in the lime cw it showed that goethite and pyrrhotite sequestered more pmg or ampa than the limestone which was in agreement with munira et al munira et al 2018 the sequestered organic p in the pyrr cw would finally turn into fe al p after biodegradation and adsorption in the effluent so4 2 was up to 1102 205 mg l 1 which much higher than that of standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 in china our previous research li et al 2016 found that padb was able to remove 14 mg l 1 no3 n in 24 h with only about 50 mg l 1 of so4 2 released therefore the pyrr cw have latent capacity for faster denitrification and less so4 2 releasing table s2 shows that all heavy metal ions were lower than those of standard iii for surface water gb 3838 2002 china and standards for farmland irrigation water gb 20922 2007 china therefore the risk of releasing heavy metal ions was very low as natural pyrrhotite was used in cw pyrrhotite is often considered as a gangue mineral and discarded in mine wastes and tailings where it is oxidized to produce acid mine drainage belzile et al 2004 one of the most serious forms of water pollution in the world akcil and koldas 2006 however in this study the pyrr cw demonstrated excellent pmg tn tp removal rates of 90 3 681 g pmg m 2 yr 1 60 4 700 g n m 2 yr 1 and 88 2 185 g p m 2 yr 1 on average respectively in nearly one year comparatively pmg tn tp removal rates in the typical cws were 55 liu et al 2019 40 55 250 630 g n m 2 yr 1 vymazal 2007 hu et al 2012 lee et al 2009 40 60 45 75g p m 2 yr 1 vymazal 2007 respectively therefore pyrrhotite the harmful gangue mineral to waster environment became a beneficial material to water environment as used in the cw materials with high content of ca fe and al have been recommended as desirable substrates of cws due to high p adsorption capacity but most of them loss their p retention capacity after 3 5 years period of application vohla et al 2011 because of adsorption saturation like the limestone however in the pyrr cw the pao and the pad can take place continuously and spontaneously therefore the pyrr cw would keep higher removal efficiency of pmg tn and tp for a long term until pyrrhotite is not enough for their removal to our best knowledge besides the pyrite cw ge et al 2019 the pyrr cw was the only cw whose p retention capacity was not limited by adsorption saturation of substrate besides pmg many other organophosphorus chemicals are extensively used in agriculture industry and household and have been widely detected in water bodies liu et al 2019 rott et al 2018 with the similar phosphonate functional groups as pmg they could also be effectively removed by the pyrr cw the organophosphorus chemicals removed from the wastewater would retain in the pyrr cw and finally turn into second minerals containing po4 3 li et al 2016 which could be taken into account as fertilizer vohla et al 2011 5 conclusion the natural pyrrhotite was used as a substrate in a pilot constructed wetland to remove the glyphosate and nutrients from synthetic agriculture runoff in nearly one year the pyrr cw removed 90 3 6 1 of glyphosate 88 2 5 1 of tp and 60 40 5 60 of tn on average from the agriculture runoff in the pyrr cw goethite was produced by pao and pad continuously and spontaneously higher glyphosate and tp removals were resulted from adsorption on the produced goethite and higher tn removal was attributed to the pad the five largest genera in pyrr cw were anaeromyxobacter 5 08 propionivibrio 4 08 defluviicoccus 3 64 sphingomonas 3 44 bradyrhizobium 3 44 the phosphorus p sequestered in the pyrr cw existed mainly in organic p fe al p and ca mg p and their order was fe al p organic p ca mg p no heavy metal ions released from the pyrr cw pyrrhotite the harmful gangue mineral to waster environment became a beneficial material to water environment as used in the cw declaration of competing

18412,this study describes the photoelectrochemical pec treatment of authentic sewage from hong kong for h2 production and degradation of emerging pollutants ep s simultaneously and disinfection of e coli the g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 cab 1 coated thin film acted as the photoanode in a three electrode configuration pec cell and real sewage as the electrolyte electrochemical studies revealed the near reversible diffusion controlled and high electron transfer reaction at the electrode electrolyte surface for cab 1 the achieved photocurrent density was 0 1 0 2 ma cm 2 at 1 23 v vs rhe exhibiting the highest pec degradation efficiency 11 15 h 1 cm 2 compared to other base materials like g c3n4 bivo4 6 88 h 1 cm 2 or ag agcl bivo4 4 06 h 1 cm 2 during the same reaction the evolved 118 μmol of h2 gas corresponds to a faradic efficiency of 69 38 the composition of sewage was found to influence the overall pec efficiency the higher amount of total suspended solids turbidity and anionic species decreased the efficiency while as the other parameters like alkaline ph increased the pec efficiency photo electrochemically the cab 1 also effectively disinfected the e coli present in the sewage with a final discharge of 1000 cfu ml which is within the permissible discharge limits 1500 cfu ml in hong kong graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial disinfection degradation of emerging pollutants g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 photoanode hong kong sewage photoelectrochemical h2 production 1 introduction the exponential increase in energy demand and water pollution pose risks to the earth s sustainable future dependence on conventional fossil fuels and the enormous population growth are two reasons contributing to these problems for example hong kong s energy consumption has increased by 5 during the past ten years the total energy consumed in 2007 was 322 136 tj and increased to 338 264 tj in 2017 govt 2017 edition with the majority of this energy coming from non renewable resources similarly sewage treatment plants across hong kong receive 2 8 million m3 of urban and industrial sewage per day govt 2018 costing a significant amount on treatment procedures the best possible way to tackle these issues is by creating a sustainable nexus between the sewage treatment and renewable energy production photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis have emerged as relevant options as these technologies are suitable both for h2 production and sewage treatment in a sustainable way kim and choi 2010 socha et al 2006 van de krol and grätzel 2012 however compared to photocatalysis the photoelectrochemical pec pathway is more effective due to a controlled reaction and better charge separation hisatomi et al 2014 the photoelectrocatalysis based advanced oxidation process has been largely used in recent times for water treatment due to its higher efficiency operability under ambient conditions and usage of low cost equipment garcia segura and brillas 2017 in a typical pec cell under the influence of light and applied potential v the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of respective chemical species take place licht 1995 the modified electrodes photoanode and cathode are immersed in a liquid electrolyte to perform the overall reaction here the concern is that the anodic material needs to be photoactive aqueously stable and thermodynamically viable to overcome the large gibbs free energy value δg 237 kj mol for the water oxidation kudo and miseki 2009 and should be suitable for organic pollutant degradation and microbial disinfection previously numerous photoactive semiconductors like tio2 kesselman et al 1997 rather et al 2018a bivo4 jeong et al 2013 c3n4 lu et al 2017 and their heterojunctions like c3n4 bivo4 wang et al 2017a tio2 c3n4 wang et al 2017b etc have been reported as suitable photoanodes for different pec applications such as water splitting degradation of organic pollutants disinfection and co2 reduction among the heterojunctions mediator based z schemes between two different semiconductors have been reported to possess higher charge separation efficiency due to electron hole annihilation by the mediator zhao et al zhao et al 2016 reported the c3n4 au bivo4 z scheme for effective visible light driven h2 production and ou et al ou et al 2018 similarly reported a hierarchial ag mediated c3n4 bivo4 heterojunction for the oxidation of water numerous available reports have revealed that the efficiency of a typical pec process for the oxidation of water pollutants depends upon several factors like cell configuration operational parameters types of substrate etc zhou et al 2019 reported that the pec degradation of water pollutants is substrate depending they also observed that the operational parameters influence the rate of degradation other reports have also concluded that among the operational parameters the presence of total organic carbon toc chrzescijanska and kusmierek 2013 and natural organic matter nom gora et al 2018 affect the photoelectrochemical photocatalytic degradation activity as they directly compete with the degradation reaction another important parameter is the ph of the wastewater as it determines the oxidation ability of the reactive oxygen species and the adsorption of the pollutants on the working electrode most of the pec reactions operate in standard electrolytes like kcl na2so4 kh2po4 etc kesselman et al 1997 jeong et al 2013 koo et al 2017 and preferably in a half reaction pathway using specific electron grätzel 2001 or hole scavengers kim and choi 2014 to mask the oxidation and reduction half reactions respectively a few studies have revealed the role of organic contaminants like dyes and phenolic compounds in water as electron donors for hydrogen h2 production kim et al kim and choi 2010 have reported that the phenolic compounds in water could act as the electron donors for h2 production and same group further reported the degradation of organic compounds 4 chlorophenol and urea during photocatalytic h2 production kesselman et al 1997 a recent report by wang et al 2015 suggested that in an ideal situation organic contaminants in water may be oxidized by an activated semiconductor photoanode while nitrate and heavy metal reduction including the reduction of protons to h2 takes place at the cathode based on the available reports and the feasibility of the reaction it would be of interest to study the h2 production degradation of organic pollutants and bacterial disinfection in a single reaction using the authentic sewage as the redox electrolyte in this regard we have developed a pec based sewage treatment method for the degradation of emerging pollutants ep s h2 production and the disinfection of e coli simultaneously the sewage was collected from different treatment plants across hong kong prior to the treatment process for this study the photoanodic material was the modified g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 heterojunction the photoanodic material selection was made based on our two recent publications rather et al 2018b akbarzadeh et al 2018 which discussed the synthesis characterization optimization and efficient photocatalytic photoelectrochemical application of flower shaped g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 microstructures this material possesses an efficient charge transfer ability and was successfully utilized for the photocatalytic degradation of emerging pollutants ibuprofen akbarzadeh et al 2018 and co2 reduction via water oxidation rather et al 2018b 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents ammonium heptamolybdate

hexacyanoferrate ii 99 k4fe cn 6 3h2o sigma aldrich were used without any purification for thin film preparation an indium tin oxide ito coated glass 8 12 ω sq was used as the substrate nafion membrane 117 sigma aldrich was installed to separate the anodic and cathodic chambers in two compartment pec cells 2 2 synthesis of the photocatalytic material g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 the synthesis and optimization of the g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 heterostructure abbreviated to cab 1 was carried out in a similar way to that reported in our previous report rather et al 2018b without any further addition the photo electrochemically optimized cab 1 rather et al 2018b containing 0 025 g of g c3n4 and 3 g l of agno3 acted as the photocatalyst for the fabrication of the thin film photoanodes for this study moreover the structural xrd raman morphological sem tem eds mapping and optical uv vis characterization of the g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 have been also discussed in detail in our previous report akberzedah et al 2018 2 3 fabrication of photoanodic thin films the photocatalytic material cab 1 10 mg dispersed in 10 ml of etoh containing 10 μl nafion binder was ultrasonicated for 30 min at the same time cleaned conductive indium tin oxide glass ito 2 2 cm was placed in a petri plate with its conductive surface positioned upwards the cab 1 dispersion was added to these petri plates dipping the ito glass completely after evaporating the etoh at 80 c for 12 h a thin film of photocatalytic material was formed which was further calcined at 180 c for 2 h before use 2 4 synthesis of molybdenum disulfide mos2 a new hydrothermal method was developed for the synthesis of molybdenum disulfide mos2 nanoparticles in a typical procedure 100 mg each of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o and thiourea n2h4cs were dissolved in 20 ml of water the mixture was hydrothermally treated in an autoclave at 220 c for 24 h the black colored precipitate of mos2 was washed with water several times and oven dried at 80 c 2 5 assembly of photoelectrochemical cell pec and activity the photoelectrochemical tests were conducted in a conventional three electrode cell fig s1 supporting information shows the schematic representation and the actual pictures of the pec cells used during this study a 65 ml capacity single chambered pec cell with 3 cm distance between the photoanode and cathode and a two chambered pec cell consisting of anodic 65 ml and cathodic chamber 65 ml were separated by a proton exchange membrane nafion 117 the distance between the photoanode and cathode in the latter case was 13 cm the photoanode consists of the fabricated thin films of the photocatalytic material on the ito glass commercially available pt wire and thin films of mos2 acted as the cathode the potential applied during the tests was kept constant at 1 23 v vs reversible hydrogen electrode rhe the redox electrolyte for this study was authentic sewage collected from different treatment locations across hong kong which was filtered through whatman filter paper grade 230 before use filtration was done to remove sludge if any from the collected sewage using ordinary whatman filter paper as the photoelectrochemical process is more suitable to removing the dissolved organic pollutants or emerging pollutants filtration of sample or control over tss and turbidity can enhance the lifetime of the working photo electrode the sewage samples collected from three different sites were named as secondary treatment plant 1 secondary treatment plant 2 and tertiary treatment plant as the concentration of the emerging pollutants ep in the real sewage was below the detection limit benzophenone bzp was externally added to make up the final concentration of 2 ppm before use the wastewater was characterized by icp oes varian 725 es and ion chromatography furthermore the distance between the light source 1 5 a m solar simulator perfect light 150 w and the quartz window of the pec cell was 20 cm the following procedure was adopted for the treatment of the proton exchange membrane nafion 117 before installation in a two chambered cell in a typical procedure the nafion 117 membrane was boiled in di water for 1 h followed by 0 5 m h2so4 for 2 h and again in di water for 1 h keeping the temperature at 100 c for each step 2 6 characterization of photocatalysts and product analysis the surface morphology of the thin film was studied by scanning electron microscopy sem tm3030 hitachi a corrtest electrochemical workstation wuhan correct instruments corp ltd 2 5 v was operated in the potentiostatic mode vs standard ag agcl electrode the value of the applied potential vs ag agcl was changed to get a constant voltage of 1 23 v against rhe the degradation profiles of the ep s were monitored by hplc 1260 series agilent technologies usa equipped with a c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm and a uv detector operating in an isothermal mode the wavelength of the uv detector was set at 223 nm the flow rate of the mobile phase which consisted of water ph 2 adjusted by h3po4 and methanol 20 80 v v was 1 ml min degradation intermediates were detected and identified on agilent hplc equipped with an ab sciex qtrap 4500 mass spectrometer single quad flow rate 0 5 ml min 20 80 water and meoh using a c18 column for separation hydrogen gas h2 evolved during the reaction was analyzed by gas chromatography gc with the inbuilt thermal conductivity detector tcd agilent series 7890 gas analyzers tcd detector with a molecular sieve 13x column the oven temperature was 60 c injector and detector temperature were set at 60 c and 200 c respectively manual injection was done by a gas tight syringe and the quantification was done against 1000 ppm standard n2 balanced h2 3 results and discussion the optical morphological and interfacial properties of cab 1 were discussed in rather et al 2018b which describes the flower shaped g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 microstructure cab 1 containing 0 025 g of g c3n4 and of agno3 as the effective weight ratio for a photoelectrochemical reaction moreover the cab 1 shows the preferential photodeposition of ag0 on the 040 facet resulting in the formation of a suitable heterojunction with high charge transfer ability rather et al 2018b the cab 1 micro flowers were in a size range of 3 5 μm and contained some cubical agcl crystals of 2 3 μm size without any further optimization the same material was used as a photoanode to conduct the current study 3 1 electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 electrode cyclic voltammetry cv studies were conducted using 0 2 m fe cn 6 3 4 as the redox electrolyte to determine the electrochemical properties of the g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 cab 1 electrode as shown in fig 1 a the cab 1 electrolyte interface exhibits the reversible properties associated with the redox reaction of fe cn 6 3 4 with the generation of specific anodic ip a and cathodic ip c peak currents the ratio of ip a and ip c approximately equals to 1 corresponding to a near reversible process bard and faulkner 2001a moreover the current density increased linearly with the square root of the scan rate fig 1b indicating a diffusion controlled process bard and faulkner 2001b the peak current and the separation of peaks on the cab 1 electrode are associated with the electron transfer rate which directly influences the rate of the reaction on its surface the value of the current coefficient calculated by the randles sevcik equation was 4 9197 10 11 cm2 s and remained approximately constant at different scan rates fig 1b representing a high electron transfer along the electrodes furthermore irradiating the cab 1 electrode with 1 5 a m solar light increased the current density by 66 without changing the onset current of the anodic peak fig 1c the cab 1 electrode showed similar reversible properties when the authentic sewage water containing benzophenone bzp replaced the standard electrolyte fig 1d the oxidation peak ip a observed at 0 28 v vs ag agcl or 0 7 v vs rhe corresponds to the oxidation of organic moiety benzophenone as the oxidation potential remains within the range of 0 6 0 7 v vs rhe scott et al 1998 in the control experiment no such events occurred on bare ito glass fig 1d the electrode electrolyte and photoelectrochemical properties of cab 1 makes it the best fit to perform the overall photoelectrochemical reaction 3 2 morphological characteristics and optimization of the cab 1 thin films the cab 1 microstructure retains its original morphological features after being fabricated into thin films with the original morphology of cab 1 reported in rather et al 2018b the sem analysis of the thin film at different resolutions fig 2 a b revealed the expected flower shaped morphology of cab 1 microstructures with a size range between 3 and 5 μm which is consistent with rather et al 2018b furthermore the calcination temperature and film thickness influenced the overall pec performance of the cab 1 photoanode a decrease in pec performance was observed while decreasing the drying calcining temperature of the thin films to 30 c and 80 c instead of 180 c fig s2 ascribed to adsorbed gases and moisture the average layer thickness of cab 1 varies between 10 20 μm fig s3a and the film thickness was increased by increasing the amount of cab 1 amount in the suspension used for the dip coating process increasing the amount from 1 mg ml to 3 mg ml and 5 mg ml the pec performance decreased fig s3b due to low charge transfer across the electrode electrolyte interface caused by the lower photon penetration moreover by increasing the film thickness the charge carriers e h need to cross large grain boundaries to reach the surface resulting in their fast recombination yaw et al 2016 this was confirmed by cv measurements revealing an abrupt decrease in the intensity of both anodic and cathodic peaks fig s3c by increasing the film thickness the ternary photo anodic material g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 was designed for better interfacial electron transfer to confirm the excitation of both g c3n4 and bivo4 uv vis spectral analysis of the cab 1 and other base materials was performed as shown in fig s4 a considerable red shift in g c3n4 and a slight blue shift in bivo4 after formation of g c3n4 bivo4 heterojunction indicating that both g c3n4 and bivo4 are excited in visible light moreover the heterojunction g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 was designed to ensure that electrons are harvested from the g c3n4 conduction band cb due to its more negative reduction potential compared to bivo4 in other case designing the heterojunction in reverse may decrease the charge transfer ability in addition a similar heterojunction the c3n4 ag bivo4 hetrojunction was reported by ou et al ou et al 2018 to be efficient 3 3 photoelectrochemical performance of cab 1 photoelectrode in the single chamber cell the control experiments using bare ito glass as the working electrode and a test in the absence of light fig 3 a showed a small or insignificant response to the degradation of bzp and h2 production using secondary treatment plant 1 sewage as the electrolyte the removal efficiency h 1 cm 2 was calculated using the time course data of the overall degradation efficiency obtained during 6 h of irradiation fig s5 as shown in fig 3b after normalizing the electrode area to 1 cm 2 cab 1 showed the highest degradation efficiency for the removal of bzp among all photoelectrodes at 1 23 v vs rhe equivalent to 11 15 h 1cm 2 followed by g c3n4 bivo4 6 88 h 1cm 2 g c3n4 5 46 h 1 cm 2 ag agcl bivo4 4 06 h 1cm 2 and bivo4 2 67 h 1 cm 2 interestingly the photocurrent density vs time fig s6 curves obtained during this pec process also followed the same trend the highest photocurrent density of 0 2 ma cm 2 was achieved for cab 1 which is insignificant in the absence of light for the same electrode the increase in the pec performance of cab 1 is primarily credited to the efficient electron transfer towards the cathode and strong suppression in the recombination rate of the charge carriers influencing the formation of high energetic reactive species like hydroxyl radicals which are responsible for the degradation of bzp rather et al 2018b as given in equation 1 kumar et al 2019 the theoretical calculation of the h2 produced during the reaction was done by using faraday s law of electrolysis 1 n 1 2 0 t i d t f r t f where n moles denotes the h2 produced during the reaction i and f represent the photocurrent density ampere and faraday s constant 96485 and rtf refers to room temperature and pressure as shown in fig 4 a theoretically an increase in the h2 evolution was observed in the cab 1 photoanode producing 178 μmol cm 2 of h2 in 2 h at a potentiostatic voltage of 1 23 v vs rhe which is the highest among all photoanodes used the actual amount of h2 detected by gc using cab 1 was 118 μmol cm 2 corresponding to a faradic efficiency of 69 38 the deviation from the ideal faradic efficiency is due to the possible involvement of some side reactions as sewage water contains a lot of competing redox species wang et al 2015 ghasemian et al 2017 for the same reaction the on off transient light fig 4b showed that cab 1 is activated by solar light with a stable photocurrent response at 1 23 v vs rhe the spike in the peak current of cab 1 is due to its different charge transfer kinetics as the peak current of cab 1 is several times higher than other base materials like g c3n4 and bivo4 so the mobility of the electrons and holes at the interface is different which directly influences the transfer of these charge carriers across the interface and it takes more time to attain stability moreover as shown in fig 5 the cab 1 exhibited a prolonged stability in photocurrent density the curve was stable for almost 6 h achieving 65 cm 2 pec degradation of bzp 3 4 influence of sewage collected from different locations across hong kong on pec efficiency of cab 1 the sewage used for this study was collected from three different treatment locations across hong kong namely secondary treatment plant 1 secondary treatment plant 2 and tertiary treatment plant among the three samples the cab 1 showed the highest photocurrent response for the tertiary treatment plant sewage fig 6 a followed by the secondary treatment plant 1 and the secondary treatment plant 2 sewage the pec degradation efficiency follows the same trend fig 6b with highest degradation efficiency of 12 61 h 1 cm 2 achieved in the tertiary treatment plant followed by secondary treatment plant 1 11 15 h 1cm 2 and the secondary treatment plant 2 7 07 h 1cm 2 the change is ascribed to the dissimilar composition of the sewage as shown in table 1 the chloride cl and sulfate so4 2 content in the secondary treatment plant 2 sewage was very high 5301 4 8 3 mg l and 206 8 mg l respectively compared to the secondary treatment plant 1 sewage cl 410 5 0 3 mg l so4 2 19 3 0 0 mg l and the tertiary treatment plant sewage cl 35 8 0 4 mg l so4 2 4 8 0 1 mg l during the photoelectrochemical reaction the accumulation of cl and so4 2 on the cab 1 photo electrode reduces the charge h transport hence decreasing the degradation efficiency furthermore an increase in the amount of total suspended solids tss and turbidity decreased the rate of degradation fig s7 the presence of a high tss content 22800 mg l secondary treatment plant 2 in the sample collected before secondary treatment table 1 increases the photocurrent density slightly fig s7a but decreases the degradation efficiency fig s7b this change is credited to irregular light intensity scattering as reported earlier by salamat et al 2017 3 5 effect of ph and target pollutant on the photoelectrochemical performance of cab 1 the ph of sewage was manually adjusted to 3 and 10 using dilute hcl and naoh to determine its influence on the overall pec activity in cab 1 the photocurrent density stabilized at a similar value at ph 6 8 and ph 10 fig 6c while an abrupt decrease was observed at ph 3 due to lower photo excitation response of bivo4 which directly influenced its photocatalytic activity ahmad et al 2015 trześniewski et al reported trześniewski et al 2017 that a minimal ph 4 threshold is required for photo excitation of bivo4 and below this ph value no such event occurs moreover the higher pec degradation rate under alkaline conditions is due to the significant suppression of the recombination rate and formation of reactive oxidative species guan et al 2011 chen and ray 1998 the emerging pollutant benzophenone bzp was replaced with other similar candidates such as ibuprofen ibu and carbamazepine cbz as the target pollutants to determine their influence on the overall pec performance of cab 1 as presented in fig s8a the degradation efficiency was higher while using cbz 12 01 h 1 cm 2 as the target pollutant followed by bzp 11 15 h 1 cm 2 and ibu 4 33 h 1 cm 2 the changes in degradation efficiency are ascribed to the different oxidative pathways adopted by ep s the anodic peak ip a for ibu based sewage was observed at a higher potential fig s8b than bzp based sewage fig 1d the change in the anodic peak might also be due to the different degradation pathways adopted by different ep s the schematic representation of the oxidation pathways of varying ep s are presented in fig s9 the ibu degradation is initiated by deprotonation followed by oxidation and hydroxylation to produce 1 4 isobutylphenyl ethan 1 ol m z 178 6 as the reaction intermediate in case of bzp the hydroxyl radical directly attacks the carbonyl carbon to generate 3 methoxy phenol m z 122 04 and benzoic acid m z 124 as the reaction intermediates before the final mineralization these degradation pathways are in agreement with some earlier reports wang et al 2016 zúñiga benítez et al 2016 3 6 photoelectrochemical performance of cab 1 photo electrode in a two chamber cell the pec reactions for simultaneous h2 production and the degradation of bzp were also performed in a two chambered pec cell separated by a proton exchange membrane the proton exchange membrane was installed after going through the standard treatment procedure discussed in section 2 5 at an applied potential of 1 23 v vs rhe the photocurrent density achieved was lower than the single chambered cell due to the greater distance between the working and counter electrodes 13 cm increasing the resistance to the charge flow fig s10 the pec degradation efficiency of the anodic and cathodic compartment was 9 42 h 1 cm 2 and 5 32 h 1 cm 2 respectively moreover increasing the value of the applied potential to 1 5 and 1 75 vs rhe showed a small variation in the overall pec performance of cab 1 the commercial pt wire was replaced by thin films of mos2 as the cathodic electrocatalytic material for the pec reaction the preliminary structural characterization of mos2 fig s11 matches with jcpds card no 73 1508 showing the formation of mos2 nanoparticles that was further confirmed with the elemental mapping fig s12 the pec degradation achieved by cab 1 using mos2 as the counter electrode in a two chambered cell was 6 52 h 1 cm 2 fig s10b while as for single chambered cell it was 4 5 h 1 cm 2 fig s13 compared to pt the overall performance of mos2 was low and the decrease was due to the higher over potential value of mos2 zúñiga benítez et al 2016 at an applied bias of 1 23 v vs rhe which is theoretically considered as zero for pt at the same potential 3 6 1 photoelectrochemical disinfection of e coli the photoelectrochemical disinfection ability of the cab 1 and all other base material photo electrodes were evaluated against the gram negative strain of the e coli to prepare the e coli suspension for photoelectrochemical disinfection a single colony was cultured in 10 ml of lb broth in a shaking incubator 150 rpm min at 37 c for 12 h bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation 8000 rpm for 5 min at 4 c and washed with the sewage fresh sample collected from the tertiary treatment plant after that the cells were re suspended in sewage as stock e coli cell density was 108 cfu ml for further dilution in the test in fig 7 a the highest pec disinfection ability was observed in g c3n4 with the final discharge of 100 cfu 100 ml cm 2 followed by cab 1 with the final release of 1000 cfu 100 ml cm 2 though the trend is different from the simultaneous pec h2 evolution and ep degradation results yet the final discharge limit in case of cab 1 is within the acceptable discharge limits for tertiary treatment plant 1500 cfu 100 ml table 1 recently our group reported the disinfection ability of a similar type of material g c3n4 ag bivo4 and found that the hydroxyl radicals make a substantial contribution for e coli disinfection zeng et al 2019 similarly some earlier reports have attributed the disinfection ability to the formation of cl2 due to oxidation of cl ghasemian et al 2017 which is likely during the current study as the sewage water contains a high amount of cl 3 6 2 mechanism of photoelectrochemical activity as reported in rather et al 2018b the cab 1 follows a z schematic approach in a photocatalytic process the plausible mechanism of the photoelectrochemical action of cab 1 for the simultaneous h2 evolution and degradation of ep s is schematically presented in fig 7b the small band gap of bivo4 2 40 ev and g c3n4 2 50 ev enable their activation under 1 5 a m solar irradiation leading to the persistent generation of electron e hole h pairs as the charge carriers as reported rather et al 2018b the charge carriers in cab 1 showed the highest lifetime 23 1 μs and charge transfer ability when the potential was applied across the heterojunction these excited electrons were scavenged from the cb of g c3n4 because of its more negative band potential g c3n4 0 25 ev compared to bivo4 cb 0 11 v furthur these electrons are transferred towards the cathode where on pt electrode the h2 evolution takes place at the same time the energetic holes h in the valance band of bivo4 have sufficient potential to oxidize the ep s present in the sewage water with variable oxidation potentials the polarization and plasmonic effect of ag agcl help in the annihilation of e and h from the cb of bivo4 and vb of g c3n4 respectively making cab 1 an active z schematic heterojunction the presence of other ionic species in wastewater helps to complete the redox cycle wang et al 2015 for h2 production the ideal efficiency was not achieved confirming the role of some competing reactions like the possible reduction of 2no3 n2o cl cl2 or no3 no etc wang et al 2015 ghasemian et al 2017 and the formation of robust oxidative species like hydroxyl radicals zeng et al 2019 in the photoelectrochemical process the holes h are supposed to be the major reactive species as the electrons lead to the competitive h2 production reaction this is in consistent with our previous report akbarzadeh et al 2018 on g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 where it was observed that holes h are the major oxidative species followed by the superoxide radical o2 for the degradation of ep s the holes are directly involved in the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh which are also very strong species for the oxidative breakdown of ep s 4 conclusions in summary g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 cab 1 has been successfully utilized as a multifunctional photoanode to perform the photoelectrochemical h2 production and ep s degradation simultaneously and disinfection of e coli during the current study the sewage composition and dissolved organics were found to play a crucial role in determining the overall pec efficiency of the cell and the presence of larger anionic species like so4 2 cl and the total suspended solids tss decrease the pec efficiency the ph of the sewage also plays a crucial role in determining the pec efficiency where acidic ph decreases the ability for photo excitation of bivo4 and alkaline ph increase the pec efficiency due to suppression of the recombination and formation of active reactive species the choice of the cathode is also critical as its over potential is the primary criterion for the spontaneous h2 evolution declaration of

18412,this study describes the photoelectrochemical pec treatment of authentic sewage from hong kong for h2 production and degradation of emerging pollutants ep s simultaneously and disinfection of e coli the g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 cab 1 coated thin film acted as the photoanode in a three electrode configuration pec cell and real sewage as the electrolyte electrochemical studies revealed the near reversible diffusion controlled and high electron transfer reaction at the electrode electrolyte surface for cab 1 the achieved photocurrent density was 0 1 0 2 ma cm 2 at 1 23 v vs rhe exhibiting the highest pec degradation efficiency 11 15 h 1 cm 2 compared to other base materials like g c3n4 bivo4 6 88 h 1 cm 2 or ag agcl bivo4 4 06 h 1 cm 2 during the same reaction the evolved 118 μmol of h2 gas corresponds to a faradic efficiency of 69 38 the composition of sewage was found to influence the overall pec efficiency the higher amount of total suspended solids turbidity and anionic species decreased the efficiency while as the other parameters like alkaline ph increased the pec efficiency photo electrochemically the cab 1 also effectively disinfected the e coli present in the sewage with a final discharge of 1000 cfu ml which is within the permissible discharge limits 1500 cfu ml in hong kong graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial disinfection degradation of emerging pollutants g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 photoanode hong kong sewage photoelectrochemical h2 production 1 introduction the exponential increase in energy demand and water pollution pose risks to the earth s sustainable future dependence on conventional fossil fuels and the enormous population growth are two reasons contributing to these problems for example hong kong s energy consumption has increased by 5 during the past ten years the total energy consumed in 2007 was 322 136 tj and increased to 338 264 tj in 2017 govt 2017 edition with the majority of this energy coming from non renewable resources similarly sewage treatment plants across hong kong receive 2 8 million m3 of urban and industrial sewage per day govt 2018 costing a significant amount on treatment procedures the best possible way to tackle these issues is by creating a sustainable nexus between the sewage treatment and renewable energy production photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis have emerged as relevant options as these technologies are suitable both for h2 production and sewage treatment in a sustainable way kim and choi 2010 socha et al 2006 van de krol and grätzel 2012 however compared to photocatalysis the photoelectrochemical pec pathway is more effective due to a controlled reaction and better charge separation hisatomi et al 2014 the photoelectrocatalysis based advanced oxidation process has been largely used in recent times for water treatment due to its higher efficiency operability under ambient conditions and usage of low cost equipment garcia segura and brillas 2017 in a typical pec cell under the influence of light and applied potential v the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of respective chemical species take place licht 1995 the modified electrodes photoanode and cathode are immersed in a liquid electrolyte to perform the overall reaction here the concern is that the anodic material needs to be photoactive aqueously stable and thermodynamically viable to overcome the large gibbs free energy value δg 237 kj mol for the water oxidation kudo and miseki 2009 and should be suitable for organic pollutant degradation and microbial disinfection previously numerous photoactive semiconductors like tio2 kesselman et al 1997 rather et al 2018a bivo4 jeong et al 2013 c3n4 lu et al 2017 and their heterojunctions like c3n4 bivo4 wang et al 2017a tio2 c3n4 wang et al 2017b etc have been reported as suitable photoanodes for different pec applications such as water splitting degradation of organic pollutants disinfection and co2 reduction among the heterojunctions mediator based z schemes between two different semiconductors have been reported to possess higher charge separation efficiency due to electron hole annihilation by the mediator zhao et al zhao et al 2016 reported the c3n4 au bivo4 z scheme for effective visible light driven h2 production and ou et al ou et al 2018 similarly reported a hierarchial ag mediated c3n4 bivo4 heterojunction for the oxidation of water numerous available reports have revealed that the efficiency of a typical pec process for the oxidation of water pollutants depends upon several factors like cell configuration operational parameters types of substrate etc zhou et al 2019 reported that the pec degradation of water pollutants is substrate depending they also observed that the operational parameters influence the rate of degradation other reports have also concluded that among the operational parameters the presence of total organic carbon toc chrzescijanska and kusmierek 2013 and natural organic matter nom gora et al 2018 affect the photoelectrochemical photocatalytic degradation activity as they directly compete with the degradation reaction another important parameter is the ph of the wastewater as it determines the oxidation ability of the reactive oxygen species and the adsorption of the pollutants on the working electrode most of the pec reactions operate in standard electrolytes like kcl na2so4 kh2po4 etc kesselman et al 1997 jeong et al 2013 koo et al 2017 and preferably in a half reaction pathway using specific electron grätzel 2001 or hole scavengers kim and choi 2014 to mask the oxidation and reduction half reactions respectively a few studies have revealed the role of organic contaminants like dyes and phenolic compounds in water as electron donors for hydrogen h2 production kim et al kim and choi 2010 have reported that the phenolic compounds in water could act as the electron donors for h2 production and same group further reported the degradation of organic compounds 4 chlorophenol and urea during photocatalytic h2 production kesselman et al 1997 a recent report by wang et al 2015 suggested that in an ideal situation organic contaminants in water may be oxidized by an activated semiconductor photoanode while nitrate and heavy metal reduction including the reduction of protons to h2 takes place at the cathode based on the available reports and the feasibility of the reaction it would be of interest to study the h2 production degradation of organic pollutants and bacterial disinfection in a single reaction using the authentic sewage as the redox electrolyte in this regard we have developed a pec based sewage treatment method for the degradation of emerging pollutants ep s h2 production and the disinfection of e coli simultaneously the sewage was collected from different treatment plants across hong kong prior to the treatment process for this study the photoanodic material was the modified g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 heterojunction the photoanodic material selection was made based on our two recent publications rather et al 2018b akbarzadeh et al 2018 which discussed the synthesis characterization optimization and efficient photocatalytic photoelectrochemical application of flower shaped g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 microstructures this material possesses an efficient charge transfer ability and was successfully utilized for the photocatalytic degradation of emerging pollutants ibuprofen akbarzadeh et al 2018 and co2 reduction via water oxidation rather et al 2018b 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents ammonium heptamolybdate

hexacyanoferrate ii 99 k4fe cn 6 3h2o sigma aldrich were used without any purification for thin film preparation an indium tin oxide ito coated glass 8 12 ω sq was used as the substrate nafion membrane 117 sigma aldrich was installed to separate the anodic and cathodic chambers in two compartment pec cells 2 2 synthesis of the photocatalytic material g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 the synthesis and optimization of the g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 heterostructure abbreviated to cab 1 was carried out in a similar way to that reported in our previous report rather et al 2018b without any further addition the photo electrochemically optimized cab 1 rather et al 2018b containing 0 025 g of g c3n4 and 3 g l of agno3 acted as the photocatalyst for the fabrication of the thin film photoanodes for this study moreover the structural xrd raman morphological sem tem eds mapping and optical uv vis characterization of the g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 have been also discussed in detail in our previous report akberzedah et al 2018 2 3 fabrication of photoanodic thin films the photocatalytic material cab 1 10 mg dispersed in 10 ml of etoh containing 10 μl nafion binder was ultrasonicated for 30 min at the same time cleaned conductive indium tin oxide glass ito 2 2 cm was placed in a petri plate with its conductive surface positioned upwards the cab 1 dispersion was added to these petri plates dipping the ito glass completely after evaporating the etoh at 80 c for 12 h a thin film of photocatalytic material was formed which was further calcined at 180 c for 2 h before use 2 4 synthesis of molybdenum disulfide mos2 a new hydrothermal method was developed for the synthesis of molybdenum disulfide mos2 nanoparticles in a typical procedure 100 mg each of ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o and thiourea n2h4cs were dissolved in 20 ml of water the mixture was hydrothermally treated in an autoclave at 220 c for 24 h the black colored precipitate of mos2 was washed with water several times and oven dried at 80 c 2 5 assembly of photoelectrochemical cell pec and activity the photoelectrochemical tests were conducted in a conventional three electrode cell fig s1 supporting information shows the schematic representation and the actual pictures of the pec cells used during this study a 65 ml capacity single chambered pec cell with 3 cm distance between the photoanode and cathode and a two chambered pec cell consisting of anodic 65 ml and cathodic chamber 65 ml were separated by a proton exchange membrane nafion 117 the distance between the photoanode and cathode in the latter case was 13 cm the photoanode consists of the fabricated thin films of the photocatalytic material on the ito glass commercially available pt wire and thin films of mos2 acted as the cathode the potential applied during the tests was kept constant at 1 23 v vs reversible hydrogen electrode rhe the redox electrolyte for this study was authentic sewage collected from different treatment locations across hong kong which was filtered through whatman filter paper grade 230 before use filtration was done to remove sludge if any from the collected sewage using ordinary whatman filter paper as the photoelectrochemical process is more suitable to removing the dissolved organic pollutants or emerging pollutants filtration of sample or control over tss and turbidity can enhance the lifetime of the working photo electrode the sewage samples collected from three different sites were named as secondary treatment plant 1 secondary treatment plant 2 and tertiary treatment plant as the concentration of the emerging pollutants ep in the real sewage was below the detection limit benzophenone bzp was externally added to make up the final concentration of 2 ppm before use the wastewater was characterized by icp oes varian 725 es and ion chromatography furthermore the distance between the light source 1 5 a m solar simulator perfect light 150 w and the quartz window of the pec cell was 20 cm the following procedure was adopted for the treatment of the proton exchange membrane nafion 117 before installation in a two chambered cell in a typical procedure the nafion 117 membrane was boiled in di water for 1 h followed by 0 5 m h2so4 for 2 h and again in di water for 1 h keeping the temperature at 100 c for each step 2 6 characterization of photocatalysts and product analysis the surface morphology of the thin film was studied by scanning electron microscopy sem tm3030 hitachi a corrtest electrochemical workstation wuhan correct instruments corp ltd 2 5 v was operated in the potentiostatic mode vs standard ag agcl electrode the value of the applied potential vs ag agcl was changed to get a constant voltage of 1 23 v against rhe the degradation profiles of the ep s were monitored by hplc 1260 series agilent technologies usa equipped with a c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm and a uv detector operating in an isothermal mode the wavelength of the uv detector was set at 223 nm the flow rate of the mobile phase which consisted of water ph 2 adjusted by h3po4 and methanol 20 80 v v was 1 ml min degradation intermediates were detected and identified on agilent hplc equipped with an ab sciex qtrap 4500 mass spectrometer single quad flow rate 0 5 ml min 20 80 water and meoh using a c18 column for separation hydrogen gas h2 evolved during the reaction was analyzed by gas chromatography gc with the inbuilt thermal conductivity detector tcd agilent series 7890 gas analyzers tcd detector with a molecular sieve 13x column the oven temperature was 60 c injector and detector temperature were set at 60 c and 200 c respectively manual injection was done by a gas tight syringe and the quantification was done against 1000 ppm standard n2 balanced h2 3 results and discussion the optical morphological and interfacial properties of cab 1 were discussed in rather et al 2018b which describes the flower shaped g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 microstructure cab 1 containing 0 025 g of g c3n4 and of agno3 as the effective weight ratio for a photoelectrochemical reaction moreover the cab 1 shows the preferential photodeposition of ag0 on the 040 facet resulting in the formation of a suitable heterojunction with high charge transfer ability rather et al 2018b the cab 1 micro flowers were in a size range of 3 5 μm and contained some cubical agcl crystals of 2 3 μm size without any further optimization the same material was used as a photoanode to conduct the current study 3 1 electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 electrode cyclic voltammetry cv studies were conducted using 0 2 m fe cn 6 3 4 as the redox electrolyte to determine the electrochemical properties of the g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 cab 1 electrode as shown in fig 1 a the cab 1 electrolyte interface exhibits the reversible properties associated with the redox reaction of fe cn 6 3 4 with the generation of specific anodic ip a and cathodic ip c peak currents the ratio of ip a and ip c approximately equals to 1 corresponding to a near reversible process bard and faulkner 2001a moreover the current density increased linearly with the square root of the scan rate fig 1b indicating a diffusion controlled process bard and faulkner 2001b the peak current and the separation of peaks on the cab 1 electrode are associated with the electron transfer rate which directly influences the rate of the reaction on its surface the value of the current coefficient calculated by the randles sevcik equation was 4 9197 10 11 cm2 s and remained approximately constant at different scan rates fig 1b representing a high electron transfer along the electrodes furthermore irradiating the cab 1 electrode with 1 5 a m solar light increased the current density by 66 without changing the onset current of the anodic peak fig 1c the cab 1 electrode showed similar reversible properties when the authentic sewage water containing benzophenone bzp replaced the standard electrolyte fig 1d the oxidation peak ip a observed at 0 28 v vs ag agcl or 0 7 v vs rhe corresponds to the oxidation of organic moiety benzophenone as the oxidation potential remains within the range of 0 6 0 7 v vs rhe scott et al 1998 in the control experiment no such events occurred on bare ito glass fig 1d the electrode electrolyte and photoelectrochemical properties of cab 1 makes it the best fit to perform the overall photoelectrochemical reaction 3 2 morphological characteristics and optimization of the cab 1 thin films the cab 1 microstructure retains its original morphological features after being fabricated into thin films with the original morphology of cab 1 reported in rather et al 2018b the sem analysis of the thin film at different resolutions fig 2 a b revealed the expected flower shaped morphology of cab 1 microstructures with a size range between 3 and 5 μm which is consistent with rather et al 2018b furthermore the calcination temperature and film thickness influenced the overall pec performance of the cab 1 photoanode a decrease in pec performance was observed while decreasing the drying calcining temperature of the thin films to 30 c and 80 c instead of 180 c fig s2 ascribed to adsorbed gases and moisture the average layer thickness of cab 1 varies between 10 20 μm fig s3a and the film thickness was increased by increasing the amount of cab 1 amount in the suspension used for the dip coating process increasing the amount from 1 mg ml to 3 mg ml and 5 mg ml the pec performance decreased fig s3b due to low charge transfer across the electrode electrolyte interface caused by the lower photon penetration moreover by increasing the film thickness the charge carriers e h need to cross large grain boundaries to reach the surface resulting in their fast recombination yaw et al 2016 this was confirmed by cv measurements revealing an abrupt decrease in the intensity of both anodic and cathodic peaks fig s3c by increasing the film thickness the ternary photo anodic material g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 was designed for better interfacial electron transfer to confirm the excitation of both g c3n4 and bivo4 uv vis spectral analysis of the cab 1 and other base materials was performed as shown in fig s4 a considerable red shift in g c3n4 and a slight blue shift in bivo4 after formation of g c3n4 bivo4 heterojunction indicating that both g c3n4 and bivo4 are excited in visible light moreover the heterojunction g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 was designed to ensure that electrons are harvested from the g c3n4 conduction band cb due to its more negative reduction potential compared to bivo4 in other case designing the heterojunction in reverse may decrease the charge transfer ability in addition a similar heterojunction the c3n4 ag bivo4 hetrojunction was reported by ou et al ou et al 2018 to be efficient 3 3 photoelectrochemical performance of cab 1 photoelectrode in the single chamber cell the control experiments using bare ito glass as the working electrode and a test in the absence of light fig 3 a showed a small or insignificant response to the degradation of bzp and h2 production using secondary treatment plant 1 sewage as the electrolyte the removal efficiency h 1 cm 2 was calculated using the time course data of the overall degradation efficiency obtained during 6 h of irradiation fig s5 as shown in fig 3b after normalizing the electrode area to 1 cm 2 cab 1 showed the highest degradation efficiency for the removal of bzp among all photoelectrodes at 1 23 v vs rhe equivalent to 11 15 h 1cm 2 followed by g c3n4 bivo4 6 88 h 1cm 2 g c3n4 5 46 h 1 cm 2 ag agcl bivo4 4 06 h 1cm 2 and bivo4 2 67 h 1 cm 2 interestingly the photocurrent density vs time fig s6 curves obtained during this pec process also followed the same trend the highest photocurrent density of 0 2 ma cm 2 was achieved for cab 1 which is insignificant in the absence of light for the same electrode the increase in the pec performance of cab 1 is primarily credited to the efficient electron transfer towards the cathode and strong suppression in the recombination rate of the charge carriers influencing the formation of high energetic reactive species like hydroxyl radicals which are responsible for the degradation of bzp rather et al 2018b as given in equation 1 kumar et al 2019 the theoretical calculation of the h2 produced during the reaction was done by using faraday s law of electrolysis 1 n 1 2 0 t i d t f r t f where n moles denotes the h2 produced during the reaction i and f represent the photocurrent density ampere and faraday s constant 96485 and rtf refers to room temperature and pressure as shown in fig 4 a theoretically an increase in the h2 evolution was observed in the cab 1 photoanode producing 178 μmol cm 2 of h2 in 2 h at a potentiostatic voltage of 1 23 v vs rhe which is the highest among all photoanodes used the actual amount of h2 detected by gc using cab 1 was 118 μmol cm 2 corresponding to a faradic efficiency of 69 38 the deviation from the ideal faradic efficiency is due to the possible involvement of some side reactions as sewage water contains a lot of competing redox species wang et al 2015 ghasemian et al 2017 for the same reaction the on off transient light fig 4b showed that cab 1 is activated by solar light with a stable photocurrent response at 1 23 v vs rhe the spike in the peak current of cab 1 is due to its different charge transfer kinetics as the peak current of cab 1 is several times higher than other base materials like g c3n4 and bivo4 so the mobility of the electrons and holes at the interface is different which directly influences the transfer of these charge carriers across the interface and it takes more time to attain stability moreover as shown in fig 5 the cab 1 exhibited a prolonged stability in photocurrent density the curve was stable for almost 6 h achieving 65 cm 2 pec degradation of bzp 3 4 influence of sewage collected from different locations across hong kong on pec efficiency of cab 1 the sewage used for this study was collected from three different treatment locations across hong kong namely secondary treatment plant 1 secondary treatment plant 2 and tertiary treatment plant among the three samples the cab 1 showed the highest photocurrent response for the tertiary treatment plant sewage fig 6 a followed by the secondary treatment plant 1 and the secondary treatment plant 2 sewage the pec degradation efficiency follows the same trend fig 6b with highest degradation efficiency of 12 61 h 1 cm 2 achieved in the tertiary treatment plant followed by secondary treatment plant 1 11 15 h 1cm 2 and the secondary treatment plant 2 7 07 h 1cm 2 the change is ascribed to the dissimilar composition of the sewage as shown in table 1 the chloride cl and sulfate so4 2 content in the secondary treatment plant 2 sewage was very high 5301 4 8 3 mg l and 206 8 mg l respectively compared to the secondary treatment plant 1 sewage cl 410 5 0 3 mg l so4 2 19 3 0 0 mg l and the tertiary treatment plant sewage cl 35 8 0 4 mg l so4 2 4 8 0 1 mg l during the photoelectrochemical reaction the accumulation of cl and so4 2 on the cab 1 photo electrode reduces the charge h transport hence decreasing the degradation efficiency furthermore an increase in the amount of total suspended solids tss and turbidity decreased the rate of degradation fig s7 the presence of a high tss content 22800 mg l secondary treatment plant 2 in the sample collected before secondary treatment table 1 increases the photocurrent density slightly fig s7a but decreases the degradation efficiency fig s7b this change is credited to irregular light intensity scattering as reported earlier by salamat et al 2017 3 5 effect of ph and target pollutant on the photoelectrochemical performance of cab 1 the ph of sewage was manually adjusted to 3 and 10 using dilute hcl and naoh to determine its influence on the overall pec activity in cab 1 the photocurrent density stabilized at a similar value at ph 6 8 and ph 10 fig 6c while an abrupt decrease was observed at ph 3 due to lower photo excitation response of bivo4 which directly influenced its photocatalytic activity ahmad et al 2015 trześniewski et al reported trześniewski et al 2017 that a minimal ph 4 threshold is required for photo excitation of bivo4 and below this ph value no such event occurs moreover the higher pec degradation rate under alkaline conditions is due to the significant suppression of the recombination rate and formation of reactive oxidative species guan et al 2011 chen and ray 1998 the emerging pollutant benzophenone bzp was replaced with other similar candidates such as ibuprofen ibu and carbamazepine cbz as the target pollutants to determine their influence on the overall pec performance of cab 1 as presented in fig s8a the degradation efficiency was higher while using cbz 12 01 h 1 cm 2 as the target pollutant followed by bzp 11 15 h 1 cm 2 and ibu 4 33 h 1 cm 2 the changes in degradation efficiency are ascribed to the different oxidative pathways adopted by ep s the anodic peak ip a for ibu based sewage was observed at a higher potential fig s8b than bzp based sewage fig 1d the change in the anodic peak might also be due to the different degradation pathways adopted by different ep s the schematic representation of the oxidation pathways of varying ep s are presented in fig s9 the ibu degradation is initiated by deprotonation followed by oxidation and hydroxylation to produce 1 4 isobutylphenyl ethan 1 ol m z 178 6 as the reaction intermediate in case of bzp the hydroxyl radical directly attacks the carbonyl carbon to generate 3 methoxy phenol m z 122 04 and benzoic acid m z 124 as the reaction intermediates before the final mineralization these degradation pathways are in agreement with some earlier reports wang et al 2016 zúñiga benítez et al 2016 3 6 photoelectrochemical performance of cab 1 photo electrode in a two chamber cell the pec reactions for simultaneous h2 production and the degradation of bzp were also performed in a two chambered pec cell separated by a proton exchange membrane the proton exchange membrane was installed after going through the standard treatment procedure discussed in section 2 5 at an applied potential of 1 23 v vs rhe the photocurrent density achieved was lower than the single chambered cell due to the greater distance between the working and counter electrodes 13 cm increasing the resistance to the charge flow fig s10 the pec degradation efficiency of the anodic and cathodic compartment was 9 42 h 1 cm 2 and 5 32 h 1 cm 2 respectively moreover increasing the value of the applied potential to 1 5 and 1 75 vs rhe showed a small variation in the overall pec performance of cab 1 the commercial pt wire was replaced by thin films of mos2 as the cathodic electrocatalytic material for the pec reaction the preliminary structural characterization of mos2 fig s11 matches with jcpds card no 73 1508 showing the formation of mos2 nanoparticles that was further confirmed with the elemental mapping fig s12 the pec degradation achieved by cab 1 using mos2 as the counter electrode in a two chambered cell was 6 52 h 1 cm 2 fig s10b while as for single chambered cell it was 4 5 h 1 cm 2 fig s13 compared to pt the overall performance of mos2 was low and the decrease was due to the higher over potential value of mos2 zúñiga benítez et al 2016 at an applied bias of 1 23 v vs rhe which is theoretically considered as zero for pt at the same potential 3 6 1 photoelectrochemical disinfection of e coli the photoelectrochemical disinfection ability of the cab 1 and all other base material photo electrodes were evaluated against the gram negative strain of the e coli to prepare the e coli suspension for photoelectrochemical disinfection a single colony was cultured in 10 ml of lb broth in a shaking incubator 150 rpm min at 37 c for 12 h bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation 8000 rpm for 5 min at 4 c and washed with the sewage fresh sample collected from the tertiary treatment plant after that the cells were re suspended in sewage as stock e coli cell density was 108 cfu ml for further dilution in the test in fig 7 a the highest pec disinfection ability was observed in g c3n4 with the final discharge of 100 cfu 100 ml cm 2 followed by cab 1 with the final release of 1000 cfu 100 ml cm 2 though the trend is different from the simultaneous pec h2 evolution and ep degradation results yet the final discharge limit in case of cab 1 is within the acceptable discharge limits for tertiary treatment plant 1500 cfu 100 ml table 1 recently our group reported the disinfection ability of a similar type of material g c3n4 ag bivo4 and found that the hydroxyl radicals make a substantial contribution for e coli disinfection zeng et al 2019 similarly some earlier reports have attributed the disinfection ability to the formation of cl2 due to oxidation of cl ghasemian et al 2017 which is likely during the current study as the sewage water contains a high amount of cl 3 6 2 mechanism of photoelectrochemical activity as reported in rather et al 2018b the cab 1 follows a z schematic approach in a photocatalytic process the plausible mechanism of the photoelectrochemical action of cab 1 for the simultaneous h2 evolution and degradation of ep s is schematically presented in fig 7b the small band gap of bivo4 2 40 ev and g c3n4 2 50 ev enable their activation under 1 5 a m solar irradiation leading to the persistent generation of electron e hole h pairs as the charge carriers as reported rather et al 2018b the charge carriers in cab 1 showed the highest lifetime 23 1 μs and charge transfer ability when the potential was applied across the heterojunction these excited electrons were scavenged from the cb of g c3n4 because of its more negative band potential g c3n4 0 25 ev compared to bivo4 cb 0 11 v furthur these electrons are transferred towards the cathode where on pt electrode the h2 evolution takes place at the same time the energetic holes h in the valance band of bivo4 have sufficient potential to oxidize the ep s present in the sewage water with variable oxidation potentials the polarization and plasmonic effect of ag agcl help in the annihilation of e and h from the cb of bivo4 and vb of g c3n4 respectively making cab 1 an active z schematic heterojunction the presence of other ionic species in wastewater helps to complete the redox cycle wang et al 2015 for h2 production the ideal efficiency was not achieved confirming the role of some competing reactions like the possible reduction of 2no3 n2o cl cl2 or no3 no etc wang et al 2015 ghasemian et al 2017 and the formation of robust oxidative species like hydroxyl radicals zeng et al 2019 in the photoelectrochemical process the holes h are supposed to be the major reactive species as the electrons lead to the competitive h2 production reaction this is in consistent with our previous report akbarzadeh et al 2018 on g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 where it was observed that holes h are the major oxidative species followed by the superoxide radical o2 for the degradation of ep s the holes are directly involved in the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh which are also very strong species for the oxidative breakdown of ep s 4 conclusions in summary g c3n4 ag agcl bivo4 cab 1 has been successfully utilized as a multifunctional photoanode to perform the photoelectrochemical h2 production and ep s degradation simultaneously and disinfection of e coli during the current study the sewage composition and dissolved organics were found to play a crucial role in determining the overall pec efficiency of the cell and the presence of larger anionic species like so4 2 cl and the total suspended solids tss decrease the pec efficiency the ph of the sewage also plays a crucial role in determining the pec efficiency where acidic ph decreases the ability for photo excitation of bivo4 and alkaline ph increase the pec efficiency due to suppression of the recombination and formation of active reactive species the choice of the cathode is also critical as its over potential is the primary criterion for the spontaneous h2 evolution declaration of

18413,low molecular weight organic acids lmwoas are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and consequently may affect the heavy metal transport in aquifer systems in this study the influences of lmwoas on the transport of cd2 under different ph conditions in saturated porous media were evaluated for this three lmwoas such as acetic acid tartaric acid and citric acid were employed a two site nonequilibrium transport model was applied to simulate the transport data under acidic conditions ph 5 0 the results indicated that lmwoas inhibited the transport of cd2 even at the low concentrations of organic acids i e 0 05 and 0 1 mm the inhibition effects might be attributed to the complexation role of the sand surface bound organic acids and also electrostatic interaction meanwhile the inhibition effects of lmwoas on cd2 transport in the following order of citric acid tartaric acid acetic acid which was also in agreement with the decreasing complex stability constants between cd2 and lmwoas this order may be dependent on their molecular structures i e amount and type of functional groups and complexing strength interestingly when the lmwoa concentrations 0 5 mm tartaric acid and citric acid still inhibited cd2 transport while acetic acid slightly enhanced the cd2 mobility due to its weaker complexing strength however under neutral conditions ph 7 0 lmwoas generally enhanced the transport of cd2 the transport enhancement of lmwoas was ascribed to the formation of stable aqueous non adsorbing cd organic acid complexes in addition citric acid could obviously inhibit the transport of cd2 under competitive transport conditions i e with competing cations which is mainly due to different complex affinities of citric acid to pb2 and cd2 these findings demonstrate that lmwoas may inhibit or facilitate cd2 transport under different environmental conditions thus environmental assessment concerning the transport of heavy metals should consider the roles of organic acids graphical abstract image 1 keywords cd2 lmwoas transport model porous media 1 introduction cadmium cd is one of the most toxic heavy metal pollutants and it exhibits adverse effects on living organisms kabatapendias and mukherjee 2007 butter et al 1998 singh et al 2018 the anthropogenic processes and human activities can result in a significant release of cadmium ion cd2 into the groundwater environment the permissible limit for cd2 concentration in groundwater as per the world health organization who guidelines is 3 μg l who 2004 however many studies have demonstrated that the concentrations of cd2 from different places exceeded its standard value for example in the shibganj area bangladesh the mining area of lavrio greece and the residential wells of central anne arundel maryland the maximum cd2 concentrations were found to be 13 μg l 43 μg l and 66 μg l respectively saha and zaman 2011 stamatis et al 2001 bolton 2006 in addition it has been found that cd2 concentration was 90 μg l near the alara landfill nigeria adeyemi et al 2007 buragohain et al 2010 found that the concentration of cd2 was 120 μg l in the dhemaji district india moreover higher cd2 concentration was also reported on the surface of the river water for example ambedkar and muniyan 2012 demonstrated that the maximum concentration was as high as 1 46 mg l in gadilam river tamilnadu india consequently the highly toxic cd2 in the environment has attracted many researchers wide concern due to its harmful effects on the living organism xiao and wu 2014 thus the study about the transport properties of cd2 in the aquifers becomes highly desirable as on date a number of studies have been investigated about the transport properties of cd2 which is affected by aging ionic strength cation species initial concentrations and colloids in saturated porous media seuntjens et al 2001 zuo et al 2015 elbana and selim 2010 tsang et al 2007 kookana and naidu 1998 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 xie et al 2018 for example kookana and naidu 1998 found that the transport of cd2 at a constant ionic strength was in an order of magnitude faster in the presence of ca2 than that in the presence of na ions tsang et al 2007 demonstrated that cd2 transport behavior was predominantly affected by rate limited sorption at low concentration i e 10 5 m similarly elbana and selim 2010 reported that cd2 retention exhibited strong nonlinear and kinetic behavior in alkaline and acidic soils wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 claimed that the presence of kaolinite colloids probably retarded the transport of cd2 in porous media under higher ionic strength conditions moreover it has been reported that porous media s ph is an important factor in determining the retention of heavy metals herreweghe et al 2002 najafi and jalali 2015 however the low molecular weight organic acids lmwoas based studies on transport of cd2 have been paid limited interest low molecular weight organic acids lmwoas are ubiquitous water soluble organic compounds that have been detected in a variety of environmental conditions xiao and wu 2014 brinkmann et al 2003 tedetti et al 2006 particularly in natural soil solutions jones 1998 strobel 2001 wang et al 2009 generally the concentration of lmwoas has a wide range of 1 μm to 1 mm in soil solutions jones 1998 strobel 2001 hu et al 2005 lmwoas regulates the heavy metals in terms of their environmental migration and ecological toxicology through chelation complexation and adsorption reactions xiao and wu 2014 elkhatib et al 2007 the complexation with cd2 could reduce the respiration rate of soil renella et al 2004 lu et al 2007 indicated that when the soil was spiked by cd2 monocarboxylic acids di and tri carboxylic acids were found in the root exudates krishnamurti et al 1997 reported that cd2 may form complexes with various organic acids many researchers have reported that lmwoas affected the adsorption desorption of heavy metals on soils and minerals mcbride 1989 huang et al 2010 li et al 2015 mcbride 1989 found that citrate and amino acids exhibited the obvious inhibition of cu2 cd2 zn2 pb2 adsorption on oxides and clay minerals however huang et al 2010 reported that lmwoas such as acetic acid tartaric acid and citric acid enhanced cd2 adsorption on goethite and montmorillonite at low concentrations meanwhile li et al 2015 demonstrated that the amounts of three metals cu2 cd2 and pb2 desorbed from a field soil by lmwoas i e malonic acid and dl hydroxybutanedioic acid strongly decreased with an increase in ph the results indicated that ph was the dominant factor affecting the release of metal ions in the extraction procedure using lmwoas in addition organic acids also play an important role in controlling the transport of heavy metals jiang et al 2012 zhang and zhang 2010 paradelo et al 2012 kantar 2007 zhang and zhang 2010 reported that the concentrations of metal ions e g cu2 cd2 and zn2 in the leachates were positively correlated with dissolved organic matters paradelo et al 2012 found that the coupled transport of humic acids ha and cu2 was controlled by the ph and the binding capacity of cu ha furthermore kantar 2007 simulated metal ion transport through the saturated systems in the presence of organic ligands based on the above knowledge the presence of lmwoas may enhance inhibit or have no effect on the transport of cd2 in aquifer system which is dependent on the ph of the solution and the characteristics of organic acids however up to now there has been limited reports are only available about the effects of lmwoas on cd2 transport thus it is necessary to study the influence of lmwoas on the transport of cd2 under different ph conditions in this study three lmwoas acetic acid tartaric acid and citric acid with different chemical structures were employed to study the influence of lmwoas on the transport of cd2 the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to assess the effect of lmwoas on cd2 transport behaviors under acidic and neutral conditions 2 to examined the transport of cd2 in saturated quartz sand as affected by various lmwoas 3 to investigate the effects of competitive ions using pb2 as the model metal ions on cd2 transport in the presence of lmwoas meanwhile the specific goals are to explore the primary mechanisms controlling the transport of cd2 in saturated quartz sand moreover a two site nonequilibrium transport model was used to analyze the transport data under the experimental conditions our findings from experiments are reliable for understanding the underlying retention mechanisms and predicting the cd2 migration in similar systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the quartz sand used for the column experiments was purchased from sigma aldrich the sand sieved to a size range of 0 21 0 30 mm was used as the porous medium and the average grain size was about 0 26 mm before use the sand was cleaned thoroughly according to the procedure described by mattison et al 2011 to remove impurities e g metal oxides on the grain surface the measured brunauer emmett teller bet surface area micromeritics norcross ga of the sand is 0 06 m2 g the ph of zero charge phzpc is 3 3 and the cation exchange capacity cec is 1 8 meq 100 g detailed procedures are provided in supplementary material an electro kinetic analyzer anton paar graz austria was used to determine the streaming potential of quartz sand to obtain its ζ potential using the helmholtz smoluchowski equation kim et al 2009 wang et al 2010 relevant information is given in supplementary material acetic acid 99 5 tartaric acid 99 and citric acid 99 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china selected physicochemical parameters of the three lmwoas are presented in table 1 the compounds cd no3 2 and nacl were all analytical reagent and were obtained by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china deionized di water was used for all the solution preparations 2 2 preparations of cd2 solutions the cd2 solution 3 mg l used for the column experiments was prepared by the dilution of a 100 mg l stock solution of cadmium nitrate cd no3 2 in an electrolyte solution 0 5 mm nacl in order to conduct the experiments in the presence of lmwoas firstly it was necessary to prepare the 0 5 mm nacl background solution was amended with 0 1 mm organic acid then a certain amount of cd no3 2 stock solution was added into the prepared background solution to obtain the desired solution in addition each desired ph value of the cd2 solutions with or without lmwoas was achieved by 0 1 m hcl or naoh the changes of ph values are negligibly small in the influent solutions during the experimental operation period fig s1a and s1c in supplementary material 2 3 column experiments the procedures were followed as described in the previous studies chung et al 2016 miralles et al 2010 about 15 2 g of the sands were packed into a 10 3 cm length and 11 mm diameter borosilicate glass columns yielding the bulk density of 1 55 0 02 g cm3 and the porosity of 0 41 0 01 the columns were employed in an up flow mode using syringe pumps kd scientific for each experiment the column was first flushed with up to 30 pore volumes pv of di water to ensure a saturated steady state flow condition at a constant pore velocity of 0 31 cm min 0 292 ml min following 21 pv of background solution 0 5 mm nacl was injected then 15 pv of the cd2 solution was injected into the column at the same pore velocity about 3 5 ml 0 8 pv of the effluent was collected for the analysis of cd2 concentrations at around 30 min of intervals the concentrations of cd2 in effluents were measured by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo electron corporation usa column transport studies were conducted at least in duplicate for every column experiment a new column filled with sand was used column properties are shown in table s1 2 4 batch sorption experiments based on our previous research a batch sorption method li et al 2019 was adopted to investigate the binding affinities of cd2 to quartz sand in the presence of different lmwoas briefly approximately 5 g of quartz sand and 20 ml of cd2 solution 3 mg l with or without lmwoas were placed into 20 ml amber glass vials these vials were equilibrated for 10 h by horizontally shaking the duration equals column experiment the vials were then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatants were withdrawn to obtain the concentrations of cd2 in the aqueous solution using an icp oes instrument as mentioned above the concentrations of cd2 adsorbed to sand were calculated based on a mass balance approach all experiments were run in triplicate the distribution coefficients of cd2 k d l kg between sand and water were calculated by using the equation k d q c e where q mg kg was the concentration of cd2 adsorbed on the sand in addition c e mg l was the concentration of cd2 in the solution the values of k d were listed in table s2 additionally the amount of lmwoas adsorbed onto the sand was determined by adsorption experiments at different ph conditions detailed experimental procedures are given in the supplementary material 2 5 modeling cd2 transport in saturated porous media the simulation models have been commonly used to predict the transport behavior of metal ions the transport of metal ions in a steady state can be described by one dimensional convection dispersion equation cde which can be expressed as follow kasten et al 1952 1 r c t d 2 c x 2 v c x where r is the retardation factor c mg l is the solute concentration t is the time v m d is the average pore water velocity x m is distance and d m2 d is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient however the transport of reactive solutes in porous media may also be influenced by physicochemical nonequilibrium processes nielsen et al 1986 worch 2004 chemical nonequilibrium behavior may arise from adsorption kinetics uyusur et al 2014 physical nonequilibrium caused by immobile water region during transport leij and bradford 2009 several nonequilibrium transport models based on physical chemical or combined physical and chemical nonequilibrium processes were applied widely to descript the nonequilibrium mass transfer during transport worch 2004 leij and bradford 2009 field and leij 2014 chung et al 2016 in this work the two site nonequilibrium transport model was used to describe cd2 transport in the sand column the two site nonequilibrium transport model assumes that sorption sites in porous media can be classified into two sites i e an equilibrium site and a kinetic site nkedi kizza et al 1984 the dimensionless form of the cde for two site nonequilibrium transport model can be written as nkedi kizza et al 1984 2 β r c 1 t 1 p 2 c 1 x 2 c 1 x ω c 1 c 2 3 1 β r c 2 t ω c 1 c 2 where the dimensionless parameters are defined as follows 4 x x l 5 p v l d 6 r 1 ρ b θ k d 7 β θ f ρ b k d θ ρ b k d 8 ω α 1 β r l v in the above the subscripts 1 and 2 represent equilibrium and kinetic sites respectively c 1 and c 2 mg l are the relative concentration of solutes in equilibrium and kinetic sites respectively t is the dimensionless time and l m is the column length x is dimensionless versions of the axial distance p is the peclet number ρ b g cm3 and θ are the sorbent bulk density and porosity of the sand column k d l kg is the partition coefficient β is the fraction of instantaneous retardation to the total retardation wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 f is the fraction of type 1 sites ω is the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient kuntz and grathwohl 2009 and α h 1 is the first order rate for kinetics at type 2 sites to obtain the value of dispersion coefficient d the breakthrough curves btcs of the conservative tracer kbr were fitted with the one dimensional steady state advection dispersion equation fig s2 using cxtfit 2 1 code a published computer program for estimating the solute transport parameters in the subsurface toride et al 1999 bromide concentrations were measured using an ics 2100 ion chromatograph dionex corporation sunnyvale ca usa as expected the fitted retardation factors r for the tracer were equal to 1 0 the cde model showed a good agreement with the tracer btcs fig s2 that meant that the immobile water region in the pore structure seemed to be small thus the physical nonequilibrium caused by immobile water region during transport could be negligible in this study chung et al 2016 we assumed that the dispersion coefficient of cd2 was as same as that of the tracer 0 498 m2 d in the column chen et al 2011 the parameters r β and ω were obtained by fitting the breakthrough curve of cd2 the values of k d f and α were calculated using equations 6 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of lmwoas on the transport of cd2 under acidic conditions the cd2 mobility affected by lmwoas is shown in fig 1 in general lmwoas could inhibit the transport of cd2 at lower concentrations of organic acids i e 0 05 and 0 1 mm under acidic conditions i e ph 5 0 in the absence of lmwoas the breakthrough of cd2 ions reached 92 after 10 pv fig 1a on the basis of previous studies the surface hydroxyl groups si oh approximately 4 5 5 0 hydroxyls nm 2 on silicon dioxide surfaces morrow and mcfarlan 1991 can be ionized and provide the net negative charge si o on the sand surface at ph 5 0 jada et al 2006 thus the positively charged cd2 without organic acids could bind to the negatively charged hydroxyl groups of sand grains uyusur et al 2014 with the addition of organic acids acetic acid had a slightly inhibitory effect on the transport of cd2 in comparison the maximum c c 0 values increased to essentially 84 with 11 pv in the presence of 0 1 mm citric acid fig 1b these observations that lmwoas inhibited the transport of cd2 can be understood via the following mechanisms on one hand at ph 5 0 acetic acid denoted as hl l represents ligand tartaric acid denoted as h2l and citric acid denoted as h3l present hl hl or hl2 hence they also may be adsorbed on sand surface by hydrogen bond formation malandrino et al 2006 christy 2010 kong et al 2018 additionally although the porous media was cleaned before column experiments there were still some traces of metal oxides e g fe al oxides on the sand surface which may provide favorable sites for the adsorption of lmwoas dong et al 2016 as shown in table s3 in the presence of organic acids a part of lmwoas were adsorbed onto grain surfaces resulting in more negative charges on the sand surfaces table s4 huang et al 2003 yuan et al 2007 thus more positively charged cd2 deposited on the porous media in addition the slightly higher ph values in effluents i e ph 5 2 5 5 in comparison with the corresponding ph values in influents i e ph 5 0 thus it may also be an indication of organic acid adsorption onto sand surfaces under the test conditions due to the decrease of lmwoas in effluents fig s1b note that the deposition of lmwoas on porous media could also be influenced by aquifer properties e g the pore scale heterogeneity in flow the surface roughness of sand particles the blocking effect during the transport process liu et al 2015 morales et al 2009 akbour et al 2013 on the other hand the adsorbed lmwoas may offer new deposition sites for cd2 hu et al 2007 it might be due to electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged dissociated acid anions and the porous media huang et al 2010 and then the amounts of lmwoas adsorbed onto sand were small 0 19 0 32 mmol kg table s3 as mentioned above 15 2 g of the sands were packed into the columns thus approximately 2 89 4 86 μmol lmwoas were adsorbed onto sand during the transport process it is noteworthy that the injected concentration of cd2 was 3 mg l the influent volume was 55 ml thus the influent solution contained about 1 35 μmol cd ions hence the amounts of adsorbed lmwoas onto sand were greater than those of cd2 in the aqueous phase in this case cd2 could bind to lmwoas in the form of sand lmwoa cd instead of sio cd because lmwoas are rich in oxygen containing functional groups table 1 and are able to form a complex with cd2 especially for citric acid which has three cooh and one oh tsang et al 2007 najafi and jalali 2015 huang et al 2010 collins et al 1999 parfitt et al 1977 lee et al 1996 holm et al 2003 wang et al 2012 consequently lmwoas inhibited the transport of cd2 in the sand columns moreover considering the fact that carbon dioxide present in the air can be dissolved in water it is always in equilibrium with h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 sadhukhan et al 2014 some previous studies have demonstrated that cd2 could form complexes with bicarbonate and carbonate chada et al 2005 pivovarov 2005 foti et al 2011 however cd2 carbonato complexes had negligible effect on transport of cd2 under the test conditions possibly due to the low concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonate in the prepared background solution the concentrations of bicarbonate the predominant species of dissolved co2 in the aqueous phase were 0 013 0 002 mm and 0 025 0 001 mm at ph 5 0 and ph 7 0 respectively the concentration of bicarbonate was determined by the titration method with hydrochloric acid methyl orange as indicators fletcher and staden 2003 fig s3 to further prove the importance of organic acids adsorption on porous media we conducted an additional experiment by saturating the porous media with the citric acid solution before injecting cd2 solution through the column yang et al 2012 in this case all the sands were coated with citric acid the transport of cd2 in the citric acid saturated columns was significantly more inhibited in comparison with the transport of cd2 in the presence of citric acid fig 2 judging from the relative positions of points in the breakthrough curves it was possible to verify that organic acids adsorption on sand grains contributed to the transport inhibition effects of organic acids under acidic conditions note that the transport inhibition effects of lmwoas on cd2 transport were dependent on organic acid species at lower concentrations of organic acids the inhibition effects followed the order of citric acid tartaric acid acetic acid these obvious different effects on the transport of cd2 among the three organic acids may be due to their different molecular structures i e amount and type of functional groups and their strengths of complex formation wu et al 2011 reported that surface coverage on the grain surface usually depended on the molecular weights of organic acid for example organic acids with higher molecular weight such as citric acid usually have broader and larger surface coverage than those with lower molecular weight huang et al 2003 jing et al 2007 thereby more number of cd2 ions could bind with the citric acid which adsorbed on the sand surface in addition the amount of heavy metals complexion by lmwoas depends on the type of organic acid number of functional groups najafi and jalali 2015 compared with acetic acid and tartaric acid citric acid has more carboxylic and hydroxyl groups table 1 in general increasing the number of carboxylic acid groups in the lmwoas will result in the formation of more stable complexes between lmwoas and metal ions liu et al 2017 according to the pk a of organic acids table 1 the predominant species of citric acid tartaric acid and acetic acid were hl2 l2 and l at ph 5 0 respectively in this case the logarithms of complex stability constants log k between citric acid tartaric acid and acetic acid with cd2 were found to be 3 32 2 15 and 1 30 respectively bunting and thong 1970 janoš 1993 the larger the complex stability constants results in the more stable metal organic acid complexes consequently the transport of cd2 could be more strongly inhibited by citric acid as compared with others this result previously demonstrates that the stability of metal organic acid complexes affects the mobility of cd2 the distribution coefficients k d also indicated that the strongest adsorption of cd2 on the sand was observed in the presence of citric acid table s2 furthermore we also investigated the transport of cd2 at lower concentration 1 mg l through saturated sand columns in the presence of lmwoas similar patterns were observed at lower concentration of cd2 fig s4 it is already known that nonequilibrium transport behavior results from rate limited sorption exhibits early breakthrough and long tailing tsang et al 2007 some previous studies found that the corresponding chemical characteristics of porous media e g phenolic and carboxylate content could influence the rate limited cd2 sorption christl et al 2001 tsang et al 2007 it is not surprising that the simulation of the transport data was also well fitted with the two site nonequilibrium transport model in this study r 2 0 982 0 998 table 2 the optimized parameters are given in table 2 as expected from the breakthrough curves the r values of cd2 followed the order of citric acid 8 53 tartaric acid 8 37 acetic acid 6 90 in the presence of 0 1 mm organic acid fig 3 the result was well in agreement with the increasing complex stability constants between cd2 and lmwoas furthermore the f parameter of cd2 followed the order of citric acid tartaric acid acetic acid at lower concentration of organic acid which was consistent with the transport results as mentioned above the higher values of f 0 5 indicate that the mechanism of cd2 sorption onto quartz sand appears to be changed from the nonequilibrium sorption to the equilibrium sorption wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 this phenomenon was also observed for the parameter β which represents the fraction of instantaneous retardation to the total retardation fig s5b florido et al 2010 the value of β revealed that a larger amount of cd2 ions were adsorbed at equilibrium sites rather than at nonequilibrium sites candela et al 2007 the first order rate coefficient α of cd2 followed the sequence citric acid tartaric acid acetic acid fig s5c the α value reflects the rate of sorption reaction to reach the equilibrium condition here the higher α value means the lower transport at the lower concentration of cd2 in the aqueous phase wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 furthermore for a given organic acid the inhibition effects of tartaric acid or citric acid depended on the concentrations of organic acids fig s6 interestingly the inhibition effects increased with the increasing concentration of organic acids from 0 05 mm to 0 1 mm but then the effects decreased with the further increase in organic acid concentration 0 5 mm this observation may be explained via the following mechanisms on one hand when the organic acid concentrations increased the deposition sites for organic acids on the sand are saturated at higher organic acid concentrations more free organic acids remained in the aqueous phase and the remaining organic acids in solutions can then form a complex with cd2 liao 2006 the water soluble cd2 complexes were not more likely to deposit on the sand surfaces kong et al 2018 on the other hand the remaining organic acids and the cd2 complexed organic acids e g cdl cdhl and cdh2l in the system may directly compete with cd2 for new deposition sites as mentioned above hu et al 2007 hence less cd2 could be deposited on sand surface at high concentrations of organic acids this is evidenced by the transport of cd2 at higher acetic acid concentration as shown in fig 1c cd2 mobility in the sand column increased slightly in the presence of 0 5 mm acetic acid on the basis of the discussion above we propose that the slightly transport enhancement of acetic acid was likely attributable to the weaker complexing strength of acetic acid the log k value was only 1 30 for cd acetic acid complexes and deposition site competition 3 2 effects of lmwoas on the transport of cd2 under neutral conditions marked effects of lmwoas on the cd2 btcs were observed under neutral conditions fig 4 in the absence of lmwoas cd2 was detected after 9 pv fig 4a the maximum c c 0 in the effluent was less than 65 indicating that transport of cd2 decreased with ph fig s7 the effect of ph on cd2 mobility is consistent with the results of published research chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 the ζ potential values of sand at ph 7 0 were more negative than that at ph 5 0 table s4 therefore more cd2 could be adsorbed via the electrostatic adsorption reactions liao 2006 and cd2 may be irreversibly adsorbed to grains at ph 7 0 dijkstra et al 2004 thus the potential mobility of cd2 is lower under neutral conditions interestingly unlike ph 5 0 lmwoas could enhance the transport of cd2 under neutral conditions i e ph 7 0 fig 4 similarly this phenomenon was also observed for the lower concentration of cd2 1 mg l fig s8 moreover for a given organic acid the transport enhancement effects increased with increasing organic acid concentrations fig s9 these observations are evident from the decrease of r values in fig 3 we propose that the transport enhancement effects were likely attributable to the formation of stable aqueous non adsorbing cd organic acid complexes huang et al 2010 hizal et al 2009 malandrino et al 2006 shirvani et al 2015 kong et al 2018 organic acids were deprotonated at ph 7 0 see the pk a of organic acids in table 1 wei et al 2011 for example the main form of citric acid denoted as h3l changed from h3l to h2l then to hl2 and finally to l3 with increasing solution ph it has already known that l3 the predominant species of acetic acid at ph 7 0 had higher chelating ability to heavy metals and efficiently inhibited the hydrolysis of heavy metals than h2l and hl2 ding et al 2014 in this case the formation of stable aqueous non adsorbing complexes reduced the concentration of free cd2 and thus the transport of metal ions increased similarly hizal et al 2009 found that the possibility of metal ions e g cd2 and pb2 to form soluble i e non adsorbable metal ion humic acid complexes increased at higher ph moreover with the addition of organic acid cd2 could form cdl cdl and cdl complexes with acetic acid tartaric acid and citric acid at ph 7 0 respectively therefore the electrostatic attraction between complexes and sands becomes weaker as compared with that between cd2 and grains in addition it has been reported that the adsorption of organic acids on aquifer media e g soil sand and clay minerals decreased with increasing ph due to the repulsive effects hizal et al 2009 ward and brady 1998 xu et al 2007 for example when 0 5 mm citric acid presented in the background solution the adsorbed mass of citric acid onto sand grains decreased from 0 24 mmol kg to 0 17 mmol kg with increasing ph from 5 0 to 7 0 table s3 in other words compared with acidic conditions most organic acids remained in the aqueous phase at ph 7 0 consequently more stable aqueous complexes formed under these test conditions hence organic acids would facilitate cd2 transport more readily under neutral conditions regardless of high or low lmwoa concentrations in the background solutions transport enhancement effects followed the order of citric acid tartaric acid acetic acid for example from the breakthrough curve of cd2 only approximate 8 pv were needed with 0 1 mm acetic acid comparing with about 6 pv in the presence of 0 1 mm citric acid fig 4a in addition the maximum value of c c 0 reached 76 in the presence of acetic acid lower than the 93 in the presence of citric acid when the concentration of organic acid was 0 5 mm fig 4b the maximum breakthrough reached 83 and 97 in the presence of acetic acid and citric acid respectively as mentioned above such a trend may be ascribed to the differences in structure complexing capability and molecular weight of the two organic acids organic acid that has a higher molecular weight i e citric acid can attract and or chelate more cd2 because it carries more negative charges and has a larger surface area than a lower molecular weight organic acid i e acetic acid wang et al 2012 jing et al 2007 liao 2006 resulting in a larger number of cd2 being retained in the aqueous phase accordingly complexes formed by cd2 with citric acid have higher stability constants the log k values were 3 77 capone et al 1986 than those formed by cd2 with acetic acid the log k values were 1 30 bunting and thong 1970 under neutral conditions consequently citric acid is more effective in enhancing the transport of cd2 under neutral conditions similarly huang et al 2010 investigated the influence of lmwoas on cd2 adsorption on montmorillonite the results showed that the concentration of cd2 in the liquid phase in the presence of citric acid was higher than that in the presence of acetic acid the experimental data under neutral conditions was also fitted with the two site nonequilibrium transport model data in table 2 and fig 3 show that the retardation factors the r values for cd2 decreased when concentrations of organic acids increased indicating that lmwoas can retard cd2 deposition in contrast f tended to increase from 0 715 in the absence of organic acid to 0 771 in the presence of citric acid fig s5a likewise β of cd2 increased from 0 735 to 0 812 implying that the degree of nonequilibrium decreased chung et al 2016 the results of β 0 5 suggested that the transport of cd2 was dominated by equilibrium conditions because the majority of cd2 adsorption sites were equilibrium at ph 7 0 fig s5b pang et al 2004 this was in agreement with the results of previous studies fonseca et al 2011 in addition the value of the first order rate coefficient α obtained from cd2 was the highest in the presence of citric acid fig s5c indicating that cd2 was the most likely to enter into type 2 nonequilibrium sites during transport due to the strongest complexing capacity among the three organic acids liu et al 2013 k d distribution coefficients also decreased with increasing organic acid concentrations table s2 the trends implied that higher organic acid concentrations had a stronger effect on the adsorption of cd2 in addition the k d values of cd2 calculated from the fitted r value using equation 6 were compared with the values obtained from the batch sorption experiments the results showed that the fitted values agreed reasonably with the experimentally observed values in this study which are consistent with other published studies kookana and naidu 1998 3 3 effects of citric acid on the transport of cd2 in the presence of competing cation cd2 mobility affected by citric acid in the presence of competitive ion i e pb2 is shown in fig 5 interestingly citric acid could markedly inhibit the transport of cd2 in the presence of 3 mg l pb2 in the absence of citric acid the maximum c c 0 reached 98 within 5 pv note that the transport of cd2 in column experiments tend to increase in the presence of 3 mg l pb2 compared with that of cd2 without competing cations fig s10 this observation might be attributed to the strong competition of pb2 with cd2 for the deposition sites fonseca et al 2011 naidu et al 1994 jiang et al 2010 in the presence of citric acid the btcs of cd2 nearly overlapped at two different concentrations and cd2 was detected after 5 pv the value of the retardation factor r with organic acids was smaller than that without organic acids table 2 the phenomena can be ascribed to different complex affinities of citric acid to pb2 and cd2 as evident from the comparison between the transport of pb2 and cd2 fig s11 it has been reported that organic acids had greater complexing strength for pb2 comparing with cd2 fonseca et al 2011 kalmykova et al 2008 wang et al 2013 appel and ma 2002 for example the stability constant of citric acid cd complex log k 3 32 is lower than that of the citric acid pb complex log k 4 10 janoš 1993 the different complexing strengths could lead to the redistribution of metals between citric acid and aqueous system he et al 2018 in aqueous system the preferential binding of pb2 by dissolved citric acid i e not adsorbed by sand can keep more pb2 in the solution accordingly less cd2 complex with citric acid consequently as one might expect citric acid could markedly enhance the transport of pb2 and inhibit the transport of cd2 fig 5 and fig s12 in addition a certain amount of pb2 complex with citric acid in the influent resulting in binding of more cd2 to oh groups and the adsorbed lmwoas on the sand surfaces yuan et al 2007 meanwhile the negatively charged organic acids adsorbed to sand will facilitate the cd2 deposition to sand due to the electrostatic interaction he et al 2018 finally the formation of sand organic acid cd ternary complex may also contribute to the inhibition of cd2 in the presence of citric acid heidmann et al 2005 the results imply that cadmium may pose a lesser threat to groundwater in the presence of lmwoas than that in the absence of lmwoas under the competitive transport conditions 4 conclusions laboratory column experiments were conducted to study the effects of lmwoas on the transport of cd2 under acidic and neutral conditions this study has demonstrated that lmwoas such as acetic acid tartaric acid and citric acid played an important role in cd2 transport in saturated porous media in general lmwoas inhibited the transport of cd2 at lower concentrations of organic acids i e 0 05 and 0 1 mm under acidic conditions this observation was attributed to the development of new deposition sites and the increase in electrostatic interaction interestingly cd2 mobility in the sand column increased slightly in the presence of 0 5 mm acetic acid we proposed that the result was likely attributable to the weaker complexing strength of acetic acid and deposition site competition notably at lower concentrations of organic acids under acidic conditions the transport inhibition effects of lmwoas on cd2 transport followed the order of citric acid tartaric acid acetic acid which was in agreement with the decreasing complex stability constants between lmwoas and cd2 this statement may be related to their different molecular structures and their complex forming ability conversely lmwoas could enhance the transport of cd2 under neutral conditions i e ph 7 0 the transport enhancement of lmwoas was probably due to the formation of stable aqueous non adsorbing cd organic acid complexes furthermore citric acid could markedly inhibit the transport of cd2 in the presence of competing cation i e pb2 this phenomenon was due to the different complex affinities of citric acid to pb2 and cd2 from this perspective whether inhibition or enhancement the transport behaviors were mainly dependent on the concentration of organic acids ph organic acid species and also surrounding conditions such as competitive transport conditions finally this study is expected to provide critical knowledge to evaluate the fate and transport of cd2 in subsurface environments and to provide the evidence based strategies for the remediation of cadmium contaminated soil obviously natural aquatic environments contain many different heavy metal ions these ions may have a significant difference in complex forming ability hydrated radii and charge density it is probably reasonable to expect that the different effects of lmwoas on the transport behaviors of metal ions may also possibly vary with different species of metal ions therefore more studies are required to get a better understanding of the transport of various metal ions e g pb2 cu2 and zn2 as a function of different lmwoas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18413,low molecular weight organic acids lmwoas are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and consequently may affect the heavy metal transport in aquifer systems in this study the influences of lmwoas on the transport of cd2 under different ph conditions in saturated porous media were evaluated for this three lmwoas such as acetic acid tartaric acid and citric acid were employed a two site nonequilibrium transport model was applied to simulate the transport data under acidic conditions ph 5 0 the results indicated that lmwoas inhibited the transport of cd2 even at the low concentrations of organic acids i e 0 05 and 0 1 mm the inhibition effects might be attributed to the complexation role of the sand surface bound organic acids and also electrostatic interaction meanwhile the inhibition effects of lmwoas on cd2 transport in the following order of citric acid tartaric acid acetic acid which was also in agreement with the decreasing complex stability constants between cd2 and lmwoas this order may be dependent on their molecular structures i e amount and type of functional groups and complexing strength interestingly when the lmwoa concentrations 0 5 mm tartaric acid and citric acid still inhibited cd2 transport while acetic acid slightly enhanced the cd2 mobility due to its weaker complexing strength however under neutral conditions ph 7 0 lmwoas generally enhanced the transport of cd2 the transport enhancement of lmwoas was ascribed to the formation of stable aqueous non adsorbing cd organic acid complexes in addition citric acid could obviously inhibit the transport of cd2 under competitive transport conditions i e with competing cations which is mainly due to different complex affinities of citric acid to pb2 and cd2 these findings demonstrate that lmwoas may inhibit or facilitate cd2 transport under different environmental conditions thus environmental assessment concerning the transport of heavy metals should consider the roles of organic acids graphical abstract image 1 keywords cd2 lmwoas transport model porous media 1 introduction cadmium cd is one of the most toxic heavy metal pollutants and it exhibits adverse effects on living organisms kabatapendias and mukherjee 2007 butter et al 1998 singh et al 2018 the anthropogenic processes and human activities can result in a significant release of cadmium ion cd2 into the groundwater environment the permissible limit for cd2 concentration in groundwater as per the world health organization who guidelines is 3 μg l who 2004 however many studies have demonstrated that the concentrations of cd2 from different places exceeded its standard value for example in the shibganj area bangladesh the mining area of lavrio greece and the residential wells of central anne arundel maryland the maximum cd2 concentrations were found to be 13 μg l 43 μg l and 66 μg l respectively saha and zaman 2011 stamatis et al 2001 bolton 2006 in addition it has been found that cd2 concentration was 90 μg l near the alara landfill nigeria adeyemi et al 2007 buragohain et al 2010 found that the concentration of cd2 was 120 μg l in the dhemaji district india moreover higher cd2 concentration was also reported on the surface of the river water for example ambedkar and muniyan 2012 demonstrated that the maximum concentration was as high as 1 46 mg l in gadilam river tamilnadu india consequently the highly toxic cd2 in the environment has attracted many researchers wide concern due to its harmful effects on the living organism xiao and wu 2014 thus the study about the transport properties of cd2 in the aquifers becomes highly desirable as on date a number of studies have been investigated about the transport properties of cd2 which is affected by aging ionic strength cation species initial concentrations and colloids in saturated porous media seuntjens et al 2001 zuo et al 2015 elbana and selim 2010 tsang et al 2007 kookana and naidu 1998 wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 xie et al 2018 for example kookana and naidu 1998 found that the transport of cd2 at a constant ionic strength was in an order of magnitude faster in the presence of ca2 than that in the presence of na ions tsang et al 2007 demonstrated that cd2 transport behavior was predominantly affected by rate limited sorption at low concentration i e 10 5 m similarly elbana and selim 2010 reported that cd2 retention exhibited strong nonlinear and kinetic behavior in alkaline and acidic soils wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 claimed that the presence of kaolinite colloids probably retarded the transport of cd2 in porous media under higher ionic strength conditions moreover it has been reported that porous media s ph is an important factor in determining the retention of heavy metals herreweghe et al 2002 najafi and jalali 2015 however the low molecular weight organic acids lmwoas based studies on transport of cd2 have been paid limited interest low molecular weight organic acids lmwoas are ubiquitous water soluble organic compounds that have been detected in a variety of environmental conditions xiao and wu 2014 brinkmann et al 2003 tedetti et al 2006 particularly in natural soil solutions jones 1998 strobel 2001 wang et al 2009 generally the concentration of lmwoas has a wide range of 1 μm to 1 mm in soil solutions jones 1998 strobel 2001 hu et al 2005 lmwoas regulates the heavy metals in terms of their environmental migration and ecological toxicology through chelation complexation and adsorption reactions xiao and wu 2014 elkhatib et al 2007 the complexation with cd2 could reduce the respiration rate of soil renella et al 2004 lu et al 2007 indicated that when the soil was spiked by cd2 monocarboxylic acids di and tri carboxylic acids were found in the root exudates krishnamurti et al 1997 reported that cd2 may form complexes with various organic acids many researchers have reported that lmwoas affected the adsorption desorption of heavy metals on soils and minerals mcbride 1989 huang et al 2010 li et al 2015 mcbride 1989 found that citrate and amino acids exhibited the obvious inhibition of cu2 cd2 zn2 pb2 adsorption on oxides and clay minerals however huang et al 2010 reported that lmwoas such as acetic acid tartaric acid and citric acid enhanced cd2 adsorption on goethite and montmorillonite at low concentrations meanwhile li et al 2015 demonstrated that the amounts of three metals cu2 cd2 and pb2 desorbed from a field soil by lmwoas i e malonic acid and dl hydroxybutanedioic acid strongly decreased with an increase in ph the results indicated that ph was the dominant factor affecting the release of metal ions in the extraction procedure using lmwoas in addition organic acids also play an important role in controlling the transport of heavy metals jiang et al 2012 zhang and zhang 2010 paradelo et al 2012 kantar 2007 zhang and zhang 2010 reported that the concentrations of metal ions e g cu2 cd2 and zn2 in the leachates were positively correlated with dissolved organic matters paradelo et al 2012 found that the coupled transport of humic acids ha and cu2 was controlled by the ph and the binding capacity of cu ha furthermore kantar 2007 simulated metal ion transport through the saturated systems in the presence of organic ligands based on the above knowledge the presence of lmwoas may enhance inhibit or have no effect on the transport of cd2 in aquifer system which is dependent on the ph of the solution and the characteristics of organic acids however up to now there has been limited reports are only available about the effects of lmwoas on cd2 transport thus it is necessary to study the influence of lmwoas on the transport of cd2 under different ph conditions in this study three lmwoas acetic acid tartaric acid and citric acid with different chemical structures were employed to study the influence of lmwoas on the transport of cd2 the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to assess the effect of lmwoas on cd2 transport behaviors under acidic and neutral conditions 2 to examined the transport of cd2 in saturated quartz sand as affected by various lmwoas 3 to investigate the effects of competitive ions using pb2 as the model metal ions on cd2 transport in the presence of lmwoas meanwhile the specific goals are to explore the primary mechanisms controlling the transport of cd2 in saturated quartz sand moreover a two site nonequilibrium transport model was used to analyze the transport data under the experimental conditions our findings from experiments are reliable for understanding the underlying retention mechanisms and predicting the cd2 migration in similar systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the quartz sand used for the column experiments was purchased from sigma aldrich the sand sieved to a size range of 0 21 0 30 mm was used as the porous medium and the average grain size was about 0 26 mm before use the sand was cleaned thoroughly according to the procedure described by mattison et al 2011 to remove impurities e g metal oxides on the grain surface the measured brunauer emmett teller bet surface area micromeritics norcross ga of the sand is 0 06 m2 g the ph of zero charge phzpc is 3 3 and the cation exchange capacity cec is 1 8 meq 100 g detailed procedures are provided in supplementary material an electro kinetic analyzer anton paar graz austria was used to determine the streaming potential of quartz sand to obtain its ζ potential using the helmholtz smoluchowski equation kim et al 2009 wang et al 2010 relevant information is given in supplementary material acetic acid 99 5 tartaric acid 99 and citric acid 99 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china selected physicochemical parameters of the three lmwoas are presented in table 1 the compounds cd no3 2 and nacl were all analytical reagent and were obtained by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china deionized di water was used for all the solution preparations 2 2 preparations of cd2 solutions the cd2 solution 3 mg l used for the column experiments was prepared by the dilution of a 100 mg l stock solution of cadmium nitrate cd no3 2 in an electrolyte solution 0 5 mm nacl in order to conduct the experiments in the presence of lmwoas firstly it was necessary to prepare the 0 5 mm nacl background solution was amended with 0 1 mm organic acid then a certain amount of cd no3 2 stock solution was added into the prepared background solution to obtain the desired solution in addition each desired ph value of the cd2 solutions with or without lmwoas was achieved by 0 1 m hcl or naoh the changes of ph values are negligibly small in the influent solutions during the experimental operation period fig s1a and s1c in supplementary material 2 3 column experiments the procedures were followed as described in the previous studies chung et al 2016 miralles et al 2010 about 15 2 g of the sands were packed into a 10 3 cm length and 11 mm diameter borosilicate glass columns yielding the bulk density of 1 55 0 02 g cm3 and the porosity of 0 41 0 01 the columns were employed in an up flow mode using syringe pumps kd scientific for each experiment the column was first flushed with up to 30 pore volumes pv of di water to ensure a saturated steady state flow condition at a constant pore velocity of 0 31 cm min 0 292 ml min following 21 pv of background solution 0 5 mm nacl was injected then 15 pv of the cd2 solution was injected into the column at the same pore velocity about 3 5 ml 0 8 pv of the effluent was collected for the analysis of cd2 concentrations at around 30 min of intervals the concentrations of cd2 in effluents were measured by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo electron corporation usa column transport studies were conducted at least in duplicate for every column experiment a new column filled with sand was used column properties are shown in table s1 2 4 batch sorption experiments based on our previous research a batch sorption method li et al 2019 was adopted to investigate the binding affinities of cd2 to quartz sand in the presence of different lmwoas briefly approximately 5 g of quartz sand and 20 ml of cd2 solution 3 mg l with or without lmwoas were placed into 20 ml amber glass vials these vials were equilibrated for 10 h by horizontally shaking the duration equals column experiment the vials were then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatants were withdrawn to obtain the concentrations of cd2 in the aqueous solution using an icp oes instrument as mentioned above the concentrations of cd2 adsorbed to sand were calculated based on a mass balance approach all experiments were run in triplicate the distribution coefficients of cd2 k d l kg between sand and water were calculated by using the equation k d q c e where q mg kg was the concentration of cd2 adsorbed on the sand in addition c e mg l was the concentration of cd2 in the solution the values of k d were listed in table s2 additionally the amount of lmwoas adsorbed onto the sand was determined by adsorption experiments at different ph conditions detailed experimental procedures are given in the supplementary material 2 5 modeling cd2 transport in saturated porous media the simulation models have been commonly used to predict the transport behavior of metal ions the transport of metal ions in a steady state can be described by one dimensional convection dispersion equation cde which can be expressed as follow kasten et al 1952 1 r c t d 2 c x 2 v c x where r is the retardation factor c mg l is the solute concentration t is the time v m d is the average pore water velocity x m is distance and d m2 d is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient however the transport of reactive solutes in porous media may also be influenced by physicochemical nonequilibrium processes nielsen et al 1986 worch 2004 chemical nonequilibrium behavior may arise from adsorption kinetics uyusur et al 2014 physical nonequilibrium caused by immobile water region during transport leij and bradford 2009 several nonequilibrium transport models based on physical chemical or combined physical and chemical nonequilibrium processes were applied widely to descript the nonequilibrium mass transfer during transport worch 2004 leij and bradford 2009 field and leij 2014 chung et al 2016 in this work the two site nonequilibrium transport model was used to describe cd2 transport in the sand column the two site nonequilibrium transport model assumes that sorption sites in porous media can be classified into two sites i e an equilibrium site and a kinetic site nkedi kizza et al 1984 the dimensionless form of the cde for two site nonequilibrium transport model can be written as nkedi kizza et al 1984 2 β r c 1 t 1 p 2 c 1 x 2 c 1 x ω c 1 c 2 3 1 β r c 2 t ω c 1 c 2 where the dimensionless parameters are defined as follows 4 x x l 5 p v l d 6 r 1 ρ b θ k d 7 β θ f ρ b k d θ ρ b k d 8 ω α 1 β r l v in the above the subscripts 1 and 2 represent equilibrium and kinetic sites respectively c 1 and c 2 mg l are the relative concentration of solutes in equilibrium and kinetic sites respectively t is the dimensionless time and l m is the column length x is dimensionless versions of the axial distance p is the peclet number ρ b g cm3 and θ are the sorbent bulk density and porosity of the sand column k d l kg is the partition coefficient β is the fraction of instantaneous retardation to the total retardation wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 f is the fraction of type 1 sites ω is the dimensionless mass transfer coefficient kuntz and grathwohl 2009 and α h 1 is the first order rate for kinetics at type 2 sites to obtain the value of dispersion coefficient d the breakthrough curves btcs of the conservative tracer kbr were fitted with the one dimensional steady state advection dispersion equation fig s2 using cxtfit 2 1 code a published computer program for estimating the solute transport parameters in the subsurface toride et al 1999 bromide concentrations were measured using an ics 2100 ion chromatograph dionex corporation sunnyvale ca usa as expected the fitted retardation factors r for the tracer were equal to 1 0 the cde model showed a good agreement with the tracer btcs fig s2 that meant that the immobile water region in the pore structure seemed to be small thus the physical nonequilibrium caused by immobile water region during transport could be negligible in this study chung et al 2016 we assumed that the dispersion coefficient of cd2 was as same as that of the tracer 0 498 m2 d in the column chen et al 2011 the parameters r β and ω were obtained by fitting the breakthrough curve of cd2 the values of k d f and α were calculated using equations 6 8 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of lmwoas on the transport of cd2 under acidic conditions the cd2 mobility affected by lmwoas is shown in fig 1 in general lmwoas could inhibit the transport of cd2 at lower concentrations of organic acids i e 0 05 and 0 1 mm under acidic conditions i e ph 5 0 in the absence of lmwoas the breakthrough of cd2 ions reached 92 after 10 pv fig 1a on the basis of previous studies the surface hydroxyl groups si oh approximately 4 5 5 0 hydroxyls nm 2 on silicon dioxide surfaces morrow and mcfarlan 1991 can be ionized and provide the net negative charge si o on the sand surface at ph 5 0 jada et al 2006 thus the positively charged cd2 without organic acids could bind to the negatively charged hydroxyl groups of sand grains uyusur et al 2014 with the addition of organic acids acetic acid had a slightly inhibitory effect on the transport of cd2 in comparison the maximum c c 0 values increased to essentially 84 with 11 pv in the presence of 0 1 mm citric acid fig 1b these observations that lmwoas inhibited the transport of cd2 can be understood via the following mechanisms on one hand at ph 5 0 acetic acid denoted as hl l represents ligand tartaric acid denoted as h2l and citric acid denoted as h3l present hl hl or hl2 hence they also may be adsorbed on sand surface by hydrogen bond formation malandrino et al 2006 christy 2010 kong et al 2018 additionally although the porous media was cleaned before column experiments there were still some traces of metal oxides e g fe al oxides on the sand surface which may provide favorable sites for the adsorption of lmwoas dong et al 2016 as shown in table s3 in the presence of organic acids a part of lmwoas were adsorbed onto grain surfaces resulting in more negative charges on the sand surfaces table s4 huang et al 2003 yuan et al 2007 thus more positively charged cd2 deposited on the porous media in addition the slightly higher ph values in effluents i e ph 5 2 5 5 in comparison with the corresponding ph values in influents i e ph 5 0 thus it may also be an indication of organic acid adsorption onto sand surfaces under the test conditions due to the decrease of lmwoas in effluents fig s1b note that the deposition of lmwoas on porous media could also be influenced by aquifer properties e g the pore scale heterogeneity in flow the surface roughness of sand particles the blocking effect during the transport process liu et al 2015 morales et al 2009 akbour et al 2013 on the other hand the adsorbed lmwoas may offer new deposition sites for cd2 hu et al 2007 it might be due to electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged dissociated acid anions and the porous media huang et al 2010 and then the amounts of lmwoas adsorbed onto sand were small 0 19 0 32 mmol kg table s3 as mentioned above 15 2 g of the sands were packed into the columns thus approximately 2 89 4 86 μmol lmwoas were adsorbed onto sand during the transport process it is noteworthy that the injected concentration of cd2 was 3 mg l the influent volume was 55 ml thus the influent solution contained about 1 35 μmol cd ions hence the amounts of adsorbed lmwoas onto sand were greater than those of cd2 in the aqueous phase in this case cd2 could bind to lmwoas in the form of sand lmwoa cd instead of sio cd because lmwoas are rich in oxygen containing functional groups table 1 and are able to form a complex with cd2 especially for citric acid which has three cooh and one oh tsang et al 2007 najafi and jalali 2015 huang et al 2010 collins et al 1999 parfitt et al 1977 lee et al 1996 holm et al 2003 wang et al 2012 consequently lmwoas inhibited the transport of cd2 in the sand columns moreover considering the fact that carbon dioxide present in the air can be dissolved in water it is always in equilibrium with h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 sadhukhan et al 2014 some previous studies have demonstrated that cd2 could form complexes with bicarbonate and carbonate chada et al 2005 pivovarov 2005 foti et al 2011 however cd2 carbonato complexes had negligible effect on transport of cd2 under the test conditions possibly due to the low concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonate in the prepared background solution the concentrations of bicarbonate the predominant species of dissolved co2 in the aqueous phase were 0 013 0 002 mm and 0 025 0 001 mm at ph 5 0 and ph 7 0 respectively the concentration of bicarbonate was determined by the titration method with hydrochloric acid methyl orange as indicators fletcher and staden 2003 fig s3 to further prove the importance of organic acids adsorption on porous media we conducted an additional experiment by saturating the porous media with the citric acid solution before injecting cd2 solution through the column yang et al 2012 in this case all the sands were coated with citric acid the transport of cd2 in the citric acid saturated columns was significantly more inhibited in comparison with the transport of cd2 in the presence of citric acid fig 2 judging from the relative positions of points in the breakthrough curves it was possible to verify that organic acids adsorption on sand grains contributed to the transport inhibition effects of organic acids under acidic conditions note that the transport inhibition effects of lmwoas on cd2 transport were dependent on organic acid species at lower concentrations of organic acids the inhibition effects followed the order of citric acid tartaric acid acetic acid these obvious different effects on the transport of cd2 among the three organic acids may be due to their different molecular structures i e amount and type of functional groups and their strengths of complex formation wu et al 2011 reported that surface coverage on the grain surface usually depended on the molecular weights of organic acid for example organic acids with higher molecular weight such as citric acid usually have broader and larger surface coverage than those with lower molecular weight huang et al 2003 jing et al 2007 thereby more number of cd2 ions could bind with the citric acid which adsorbed on the sand surface in addition the amount of heavy metals complexion by lmwoas depends on the type of organic acid number of functional groups najafi and jalali 2015 compared with acetic acid and tartaric acid citric acid has more carboxylic and hydroxyl groups table 1 in general increasing the number of carboxylic acid groups in the lmwoas will result in the formation of more stable complexes between lmwoas and metal ions liu et al 2017 according to the pk a of organic acids table 1 the predominant species of citric acid tartaric acid and acetic acid were hl2 l2 and l at ph 5 0 respectively in this case the logarithms of complex stability constants log k between citric acid tartaric acid and acetic acid with cd2 were found to be 3 32 2 15 and 1 30 respectively bunting and thong 1970 janoš 1993 the larger the complex stability constants results in the more stable metal organic acid complexes consequently the transport of cd2 could be more strongly inhibited by citric acid as compared with others this result previously demonstrates that the stability of metal organic acid complexes affects the mobility of cd2 the distribution coefficients k d also indicated that the strongest adsorption of cd2 on the sand was observed in the presence of citric acid table s2 furthermore we also investigated the transport of cd2 at lower concentration 1 mg l through saturated sand columns in the presence of lmwoas similar patterns were observed at lower concentration of cd2 fig s4 it is already known that nonequilibrium transport behavior results from rate limited sorption exhibits early breakthrough and long tailing tsang et al 2007 some previous studies found that the corresponding chemical characteristics of porous media e g phenolic and carboxylate content could influence the rate limited cd2 sorption christl et al 2001 tsang et al 2007 it is not surprising that the simulation of the transport data was also well fitted with the two site nonequilibrium transport model in this study r 2 0 982 0 998 table 2 the optimized parameters are given in table 2 as expected from the breakthrough curves the r values of cd2 followed the order of citric acid 8 53 tartaric acid 8 37 acetic acid 6 90 in the presence of 0 1 mm organic acid fig 3 the result was well in agreement with the increasing complex stability constants between cd2 and lmwoas furthermore the f parameter of cd2 followed the order of citric acid tartaric acid acetic acid at lower concentration of organic acid which was consistent with the transport results as mentioned above the higher values of f 0 5 indicate that the mechanism of cd2 sorption onto quartz sand appears to be changed from the nonequilibrium sorption to the equilibrium sorption wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 this phenomenon was also observed for the parameter β which represents the fraction of instantaneous retardation to the total retardation fig s5b florido et al 2010 the value of β revealed that a larger amount of cd2 ions were adsorbed at equilibrium sites rather than at nonequilibrium sites candela et al 2007 the first order rate coefficient α of cd2 followed the sequence citric acid tartaric acid acetic acid fig s5c the α value reflects the rate of sorption reaction to reach the equilibrium condition here the higher α value means the lower transport at the lower concentration of cd2 in the aqueous phase wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 furthermore for a given organic acid the inhibition effects of tartaric acid or citric acid depended on the concentrations of organic acids fig s6 interestingly the inhibition effects increased with the increasing concentration of organic acids from 0 05 mm to 0 1 mm but then the effects decreased with the further increase in organic acid concentration 0 5 mm this observation may be explained via the following mechanisms on one hand when the organic acid concentrations increased the deposition sites for organic acids on the sand are saturated at higher organic acid concentrations more free organic acids remained in the aqueous phase and the remaining organic acids in solutions can then form a complex with cd2 liao 2006 the water soluble cd2 complexes were not more likely to deposit on the sand surfaces kong et al 2018 on the other hand the remaining organic acids and the cd2 complexed organic acids e g cdl cdhl and cdh2l in the system may directly compete with cd2 for new deposition sites as mentioned above hu et al 2007 hence less cd2 could be deposited on sand surface at high concentrations of organic acids this is evidenced by the transport of cd2 at higher acetic acid concentration as shown in fig 1c cd2 mobility in the sand column increased slightly in the presence of 0 5 mm acetic acid on the basis of the discussion above we propose that the slightly transport enhancement of acetic acid was likely attributable to the weaker complexing strength of acetic acid the log k value was only 1 30 for cd acetic acid complexes and deposition site competition 3 2 effects of lmwoas on the transport of cd2 under neutral conditions marked effects of lmwoas on the cd2 btcs were observed under neutral conditions fig 4 in the absence of lmwoas cd2 was detected after 9 pv fig 4a the maximum c c 0 in the effluent was less than 65 indicating that transport of cd2 decreased with ph fig s7 the effect of ph on cd2 mobility is consistent with the results of published research chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 the ζ potential values of sand at ph 7 0 were more negative than that at ph 5 0 table s4 therefore more cd2 could be adsorbed via the electrostatic adsorption reactions liao 2006 and cd2 may be irreversibly adsorbed to grains at ph 7 0 dijkstra et al 2004 thus the potential mobility of cd2 is lower under neutral conditions interestingly unlike ph 5 0 lmwoas could enhance the transport of cd2 under neutral conditions i e ph 7 0 fig 4 similarly this phenomenon was also observed for the lower concentration of cd2 1 mg l fig s8 moreover for a given organic acid the transport enhancement effects increased with increasing organic acid concentrations fig s9 these observations are evident from the decrease of r values in fig 3 we propose that the transport enhancement effects were likely attributable to the formation of stable aqueous non adsorbing cd organic acid complexes huang et al 2010 hizal et al 2009 malandrino et al 2006 shirvani et al 2015 kong et al 2018 organic acids were deprotonated at ph 7 0 see the pk a of organic acids in table 1 wei et al 2011 for example the main form of citric acid denoted as h3l changed from h3l to h2l then to hl2 and finally to l3 with increasing solution ph it has already known that l3 the predominant species of acetic acid at ph 7 0 had higher chelating ability to heavy metals and efficiently inhibited the hydrolysis of heavy metals than h2l and hl2 ding et al 2014 in this case the formation of stable aqueous non adsorbing complexes reduced the concentration of free cd2 and thus the transport of metal ions increased similarly hizal et al 2009 found that the possibility of metal ions e g cd2 and pb2 to form soluble i e non adsorbable metal ion humic acid complexes increased at higher ph moreover with the addition of organic acid cd2 could form cdl cdl and cdl complexes with acetic acid tartaric acid and citric acid at ph 7 0 respectively therefore the electrostatic attraction between complexes and sands becomes weaker as compared with that between cd2 and grains in addition it has been reported that the adsorption of organic acids on aquifer media e g soil sand and clay minerals decreased with increasing ph due to the repulsive effects hizal et al 2009 ward and brady 1998 xu et al 2007 for example when 0 5 mm citric acid presented in the background solution the adsorbed mass of citric acid onto sand grains decreased from 0 24 mmol kg to 0 17 mmol kg with increasing ph from 5 0 to 7 0 table s3 in other words compared with acidic conditions most organic acids remained in the aqueous phase at ph 7 0 consequently more stable aqueous complexes formed under these test conditions hence organic acids would facilitate cd2 transport more readily under neutral conditions regardless of high or low lmwoa concentrations in the background solutions transport enhancement effects followed the order of citric acid tartaric acid acetic acid for example from the breakthrough curve of cd2 only approximate 8 pv were needed with 0 1 mm acetic acid comparing with about 6 pv in the presence of 0 1 mm citric acid fig 4a in addition the maximum value of c c 0 reached 76 in the presence of acetic acid lower than the 93 in the presence of citric acid when the concentration of organic acid was 0 5 mm fig 4b the maximum breakthrough reached 83 and 97 in the presence of acetic acid and citric acid respectively as mentioned above such a trend may be ascribed to the differences in structure complexing capability and molecular weight of the two organic acids organic acid that has a higher molecular weight i e citric acid can attract and or chelate more cd2 because it carries more negative charges and has a larger surface area than a lower molecular weight organic acid i e acetic acid wang et al 2012 jing et al 2007 liao 2006 resulting in a larger number of cd2 being retained in the aqueous phase accordingly complexes formed by cd2 with citric acid have higher stability constants the log k values were 3 77 capone et al 1986 than those formed by cd2 with acetic acid the log k values were 1 30 bunting and thong 1970 under neutral conditions consequently citric acid is more effective in enhancing the transport of cd2 under neutral conditions similarly huang et al 2010 investigated the influence of lmwoas on cd2 adsorption on montmorillonite the results showed that the concentration of cd2 in the liquid phase in the presence of citric acid was higher than that in the presence of acetic acid the experimental data under neutral conditions was also fitted with the two site nonequilibrium transport model data in table 2 and fig 3 show that the retardation factors the r values for cd2 decreased when concentrations of organic acids increased indicating that lmwoas can retard cd2 deposition in contrast f tended to increase from 0 715 in the absence of organic acid to 0 771 in the presence of citric acid fig s5a likewise β of cd2 increased from 0 735 to 0 812 implying that the degree of nonequilibrium decreased chung et al 2016 the results of β 0 5 suggested that the transport of cd2 was dominated by equilibrium conditions because the majority of cd2 adsorption sites were equilibrium at ph 7 0 fig s5b pang et al 2004 this was in agreement with the results of previous studies fonseca et al 2011 in addition the value of the first order rate coefficient α obtained from cd2 was the highest in the presence of citric acid fig s5c indicating that cd2 was the most likely to enter into type 2 nonequilibrium sites during transport due to the strongest complexing capacity among the three organic acids liu et al 2013 k d distribution coefficients also decreased with increasing organic acid concentrations table s2 the trends implied that higher organic acid concentrations had a stronger effect on the adsorption of cd2 in addition the k d values of cd2 calculated from the fitted r value using equation 6 were compared with the values obtained from the batch sorption experiments the results showed that the fitted values agreed reasonably with the experimentally observed values in this study which are consistent with other published studies kookana and naidu 1998 3 3 effects of citric acid on the transport of cd2 in the presence of competing cation cd2 mobility affected by citric acid in the presence of competitive ion i e pb2 is shown in fig 5 interestingly citric acid could markedly inhibit the transport of cd2 in the presence of 3 mg l pb2 in the absence of citric acid the maximum c c 0 reached 98 within 5 pv note that the transport of cd2 in column experiments tend to increase in the presence of 3 mg l pb2 compared with that of cd2 without competing cations fig s10 this observation might be attributed to the strong competition of pb2 with cd2 for the deposition sites fonseca et al 2011 naidu et al 1994 jiang et al 2010 in the presence of citric acid the btcs of cd2 nearly overlapped at two different concentrations and cd2 was detected after 5 pv the value of the retardation factor r with organic acids was smaller than that without organic acids table 2 the phenomena can be ascribed to different complex affinities of citric acid to pb2 and cd2 as evident from the comparison between the transport of pb2 and cd2 fig s11 it has been reported that organic acids had greater complexing strength for pb2 comparing with cd2 fonseca et al 2011 kalmykova et al 2008 wang et al 2013 appel and ma 2002 for example the stability constant of citric acid cd complex log k 3 32 is lower than that of the citric acid pb complex log k 4 10 janoš 1993 the different complexing strengths could lead to the redistribution of metals between citric acid and aqueous system he et al 2018 in aqueous system the preferential binding of pb2 by dissolved citric acid i e not adsorbed by sand can keep more pb2 in the solution accordingly less cd2 complex with citric acid consequently as one might expect citric acid could markedly enhance the transport of pb2 and inhibit the transport of cd2 fig 5 and fig s12 in addition a certain amount of pb2 complex with citric acid in the influent resulting in binding of more cd2 to oh groups and the adsorbed lmwoas on the sand surfaces yuan et al 2007 meanwhile the negatively charged organic acids adsorbed to sand will facilitate the cd2 deposition to sand due to the electrostatic interaction he et al 2018 finally the formation of sand organic acid cd ternary complex may also contribute to the inhibition of cd2 in the presence of citric acid heidmann et al 2005 the results imply that cadmium may pose a lesser threat to groundwater in the presence of lmwoas than that in the absence of lmwoas under the competitive transport conditions 4 conclusions laboratory column experiments were conducted to study the effects of lmwoas on the transport of cd2 under acidic and neutral conditions this study has demonstrated that lmwoas such as acetic acid tartaric acid and citric acid played an important role in cd2 transport in saturated porous media in general lmwoas inhibited the transport of cd2 at lower concentrations of organic acids i e 0 05 and 0 1 mm under acidic conditions this observation was attributed to the development of new deposition sites and the increase in electrostatic interaction interestingly cd2 mobility in the sand column increased slightly in the presence of 0 5 mm acetic acid we proposed that the result was likely attributable to the weaker complexing strength of acetic acid and deposition site competition notably at lower concentrations of organic acids under acidic conditions the transport inhibition effects of lmwoas on cd2 transport followed the order of citric acid tartaric acid acetic acid which was in agreement with the decreasing complex stability constants between lmwoas and cd2 this statement may be related to their different molecular structures and their complex forming ability conversely lmwoas could enhance the transport of cd2 under neutral conditions i e ph 7 0 the transport enhancement of lmwoas was probably due to the formation of stable aqueous non adsorbing cd organic acid complexes furthermore citric acid could markedly inhibit the transport of cd2 in the presence of competing cation i e pb2 this phenomenon was due to the different complex affinities of citric acid to pb2 and cd2 from this perspective whether inhibition or enhancement the transport behaviors were mainly dependent on the concentration of organic acids ph organic acid species and also surrounding conditions such as competitive transport conditions finally this study is expected to provide critical knowledge to evaluate the fate and transport of cd2 in subsurface environments and to provide the evidence based strategies for the remediation of cadmium contaminated soil obviously natural aquatic environments contain many different heavy metal ions these ions may have a significant difference in complex forming ability hydrated radii and charge density it is probably reasonable to expect that the different effects of lmwoas on the transport behaviors of metal ions may also possibly vary with different species of metal ions therefore more studies are required to get a better understanding of the transport of various metal ions e g pb2 cu2 and zn2 as a function of different lmwoas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18414,lubricant lube oil discharge from ships has been widely considered as normal operational consumption but is now deemed to be oil pollution despite the chronic contamination of the marine

introduction marine oil spills have been identified as one of the most important threats to ecosystems causing major environmental and economic damage worldwide the degree of damage caused by a spill depends upon its source location type discharge volume season and environmental conditions nrc 2003 petroleum both in the form of crude oil and refined products such as lubricant lube oil fuel oil gasoline and kerosene has diverse properties and contains numerous different toxic compounds with harmful environmental effects nrc 1985 lube oil is used primarily in marine engines and other machines it plays a critical role in reducing friction and wear between moving surfaces and removing heat to ensure efficiency and high power output mao et al 2009 the major component 75 90 of conventional lube oil is base oil consisting of thousands of individual petroleum hydrocarbons mostly in the c20 to c40 range the remaining portion consists of performance enhancing additives lube oil represents 10 of the total oil input into marine waters usepa 2011 most ocean going ships operate using oil lubricated stern tubes and also employ lube oil with a wide range of on deck and underwater submerged machinery oil discharge from stern tubes was once considered normal operational consumption of oil but is now regarded as oil pollution lube oil discharge through stern tube leakage is a significant source of oil pollution in the aquatic environment etkin 2010 usepa 2011 it is estimated that as much as 4 6 28 6 million liters of oil is introduced to port waters annually from stern tubes and 32 3 million liters from other operational discharges if the same rates of discharge were to occur at sea then total worldwide inputs from all operational discharges and leaks would add up to about 130 244 million liters annually etkin 2010 pure lube oils are infrequently observed in cases of oil pollution and instead constitute some proportion of waste oil pollution as it is common practice on board ships to first collect waste oil of all kinds in sludge and bilge tanks european committee for standardization 2012 hence oil characterization using chemical fingerprinting and investigation of the changes induced by weathering are essential steps to determine the ecological consequences of lube oil discharge however the number of studies conducted on lube oil chemical fingerprinting and weathering to date is limited once lube oil is discharged into the ocean it begins to spread increasing the exposed area and accelerating subsequent weathering processes such as evaporation dispersion emulsification dissolution photooxidation sedimentation and biodegradation nrc 2003 conventional mineral based lube oils vary greatly in their chemical properties weathering processes and the chemical properties of the oil determine the rate of degradation weathering under natural conditions is complicated and its effects may differ among oil components a fundamental understanding of weathering processes is essential for assessment of the ecological impact of weathering one key aspect of the mechanism of toxicity that must be examined is the components produced through photooxidation garrett et al 1998 photooxidation is a light catalyzed reaction in which the reduced carbon in petroleum hydrocarbons is oxidized the primary photooxidation pathways include direct photoionization direct reaction of the excited triplet state with molecular oxygen and electron transfer to molecular oxygen fasnacht and blough 2003 shankar et al 2015 photooxidation produces partially oxidized intermediates called oxyhydrocarbons aeppli et al 2012 ward et al 2018a 2018b which are more water soluble and thus have greater bioavailability and toxicity than the parent species carls and meador 2009 king et al 2014 numerous studies have been conducted in recent decades to investigate the effects of photooxidation on crude oil ali et al 1995 hansen 1975 d auria et al 2009 hall et al 2013 radovic et al 2014 white et al 2016 considering the enormous estimated volume of global lube oil inputs elucidating the effects of photooxidation on lube oil is crucial to date studies on the photooxidation of lube oil have been limited in this context the effects of photooxidation on lube oil and the lube water soluble fraction wsf temporal changes in petroleum hydrocarbons and the toxic effects of wsf on fish embryos of olive flounder paralichthys olivaceus were concurrently investigated in this study to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the environmental fate and toxicity of lube oil and the results of this study will improve our understanding of that topic 2 materials and methods 2 1 photooxidation experiment the mesocosm experiment was conducted at the pier

radiometric probes lp 9021 uv a lp 9021 uv b and lp 9021 uv c but visible radiation vis was not measured in this experiment due to unavailability of the vis radiometer the mesocosm experiment was

olive flounder p olivaceus were artificially fertilized in a commercial fishery facility eggs were transported to our laboratory 6 h after fertilization and allowed to acclimatize for 24 h in flowing seawater floating eggs were collected for exposure experiments embryos were examined under a dissecting microscope and abnormal or dead individuals were removed before the experiment developing embryos optic vesicle stage 2025 mpf minutes postfertilization were incubated in petri dishes three experimental groups were used 1 20 ml of filtered and autoclaved seawater as a negative control neg con 2 10 ml of wsf from mesocosm con after 96 h lube wsf 96 h con and 3 10 ml of wsf from mesocosm exp after 96 h lube wsf 96 h exp in each experimental group about 50 embryos were used in triplicate the incubation temperature was maintained at 16 c embryos were exposed to these treatments for 48 h toxicological end points based on a characteristic suite of morphological abnormalities were evaluated including pericardial edema pe dorsal curvature dc and tail fin fold defects tf imaging of embryos with confocal microscopy was carried out as described by jung et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of hydrocarbons and pahs in lube oil commercial lube oils consist primarily of base oils with small quantities of chemical additives yang et al 2016 lube oil is either mineral based of petroleum origin or synthetic and mineral based lube oils are the most widely used usepa 2011 to satisfy the performance requirements lube oils vary in their physical properties including their melting and boiling points viscosity and distillation range etkin 2010 usepa 2011 yang et al 2016 lube oil absorption spectrum is depicted in fig s18 it shows that lube oil absorption spectrum lies within the range of 220 350 nm with its maximum absorption at 275 nm and a shoulder peak at 240 nm this suggests that the light absorption of lube oil occurs mostly in uv b 280 315 nm and uv a 315 400 nm regions and considering the complexity and diversity of lube oil composition photosensitizers absorbing in the visible region could also be present in minor quantities the chemical composition of lube oils is complex and conventional techniques have limitations in terms of resolving them for this reason iranian heavy crude oil ihc was used as a reference oil for comparison with the chemical properties of lube oil in this study ihc has been the subject of numerous studies joo et al 2013 loh et al 2018 yim et al 2011 in our laboratory the chemical properties of fresh ihc and lube oils are presented in tables s1 and s2 and figs 1 and s2 lube oils generally contain very low concentrations of n alkanes and pahs yang et al 2015 2016 as shown in fig s2 the gc fid chromatogram of ihc fig s2a showed hydrocarbons ranging from c8 c37 with c13 c16 being most dominant in contrast lube fig s2b had unique chromatographic features including an unresolved complex mixture ucm hump eluted in the high boiling point hydrocarbon range this ucm in ihc accounted for 63 9 of the tph content while in lube it accounted for as much as 91 3 of tph tables s1 and s2 pah profiles fig 1 showed that pahs and alkylated pahs in ihc fig 1a ranged from naphthalene to benzo b fluoranthene bbf with alkylated naphthalene c1 c4n dibenzothiophene c1 c3d and phenanthrene c1 c3p being the most dominant in contrast the pahs and alkylated pahs fig 1b in lube were restricted to only naphthalene dibenzothiophene and phenanthrene with c0 c3d being the most dominant followed by c0 c4n and c0 c2p in the case of ihc 16 pahs and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons σpahs were abundant at around 368 and 12 687 μg g respectively table s1 meanwhile in lube 16 pahs 1 45 μg g and σpahs 84 1 μg g were present at insignificant levels table s2 approximately 250 and 150 times lower than those in ihc respectively 3 2 temporal changes of pahs in oil and wsf in the lube oil control group lube oil con the temporal change of σpahs did not show a particular trend from 0 to 96 h however in the lube oil exposure group lube oil exp the concentration of σpahs decreased gradually from 84 1 μg g at 0 h to 42 8 μg g after photooxidation for 96 h fig 2 a temporal changes of pahs from 0 to 96 h in lube oil con and lube oil exp are shown in fig s3 pahs were sequentially degraded according to their aromatic ring number and degree of alkylation in lube oil exp weathering ratios including naphthalene σpahs and c0n c1n c2n both representing evaporation and dissolution were calculated fig s5 yim et al 2011 greater differences were observed between con and exp with an increase in exposure time after 96 h the weathering ratio in exp was reduced more than threefold compared to that of con this result indicated that over time c0 c1n were more strongly affected by evaporation and dissolution than photooxidation also in the case of exp c0d and c0p were relatively resistant to photooxidation compared to their alkylated homologs concentrations of c1 c3d and c1 c2p gradually decreased from 0 to 96 h compared to those in con in particular c2 c3d in exp showed a substantial decrease after 96 h with its concentration decreasing nearly to half that in con in both the lube wsf control group lube wsf con and lube wsf exposure group lube wsf exp σpahs were very low at 0 25 and 0 45 μg l respectively after 96 h fig 2b temporal changes in both the con and exp groups indicated that pahs and alkylated pahs were limited to c0 c3n at 3 and 6 h with relatively higher concentrations in exp fig s4 c0 c1n of con and exp exhibited no particular trend between 3 and 24 h but a trend became apparent after 48 h wherein c0 c1n of exp had relatively low concentrations compared to those of con until 96 h because both evaporation and dissolution affect c0 c1n the relative effects of both processes combined with photooxidation appear to drive the differing trends observed at various time points c0 c1d and c0 c1p began appearing in wsf at 12 h in exp and at 24 h in con and continued to increase in concentration thereafter until 96 h c2d appeared both in con and exp from 24 h and increased until 96 h c3d and c2p appeared only in exp at 48 and 24 h respectively and increased in concentration until 96 h the profile of exp showed an increase of parent and alkylated homologs of pahs especially c0 c2n c0 c2d and c0 c1p in an increasing stairwell like trend with increasing alkyl number from 0 to 96 h in addition to naphthalene heterocompounds are more strongly affected by dissolution than most other aromatic hydrocarbons in a homologous series dissolution decreases with higher substitution in the following order c0 c1 c2 c3 european committee for standardization 2012 this explains the temporal trend of parent and alkyl pahs observed in lube wsf con from 3 to 96 h meanwhile the trend in lube wsf exp could be attributed to two phenomena in lube wsf con dissolution is the only process responsible for the gradual increase in pahs over time whereas in lube wsf exp the entrainment of oil droplets into the water column becomes more important at the higher wind speeds encountered in exp compared to con thus greater quantities of hydrocarbons would become dispersed leading to increased dissolution of pahs in exp gros et al 2014 secondly in lube wsf exp although the oil slick on the water surface was subjected to photooxidation the slick itself could act as a partial cover reducing the rate of photooxidation of pahs dissolved in the water column as indicated in fig s5 evaporation and dissolution appears to have played a significant role in oil degradation especially in oil exp the major difference between oil con and exp is that in case of con which was maintained in a close environment dissolution appears to have been driven only by gravity whereas in exp in addition to gravity wind could reduce the air and water boundary layer thicknesses and thus enhance mass transfer rates to both air and water gros et al 2014 consequently pahs composition in oil exp is relatively more reduced by evaporation and dissolution resulting in a corresponding increase of pahs concentration in wsf exp 3 3 temporal changes in chemical composition the tlc fid chromatogram of fresh lube oil indicated that the sara fractions contributed 88 8 5 6 0 9 and 4 7 respectively table s2 fig 3 saturates made up the most abundant fraction followed by small amounts of the aromatic and asphaltene fractions resin comprised the smallest fraction in comparison the tlc fid chromatogram of fresh ihc oil table s1 fig 3 showed a greater percentage of aromatics 47 6 than saturates 24 6 resins 11 9 and asphaltenes 15 9 examination of lube oil con and lube oil exp after photooxidation indicated that saturated hydrocarbons were less weathered over 96 h of photooxidation table s3 figs s6a and b meanwhile aromatics although low had no apparent trend in con showed a gradual decrease in their fractional composition from 5 6 at 0 h to 3 9 at 96 h in exp table s3 fig 3a and b this observation corresponds with the gradual increase in the resin fraction 0 9 at 0 h to 1 8 at 96 h emphasizing the effect of photooxidation on pahs the tlc fid chromatograms of lube wsf con and lube wsf exp showed that only the resin fraction was detectable in these samples fig 3c and d examination of all wsfs after photooxidation revealed a substantial increase of the resin fraction in exp with increased exposure time fig 3e and s6c and d the relative increase in the resin fraction in exp compared to that in con shown in fig 3e was calculated based on the resin response figs s6c and d observed in tlc fid analysis the resin fractions that were equally abundant in con and exp at 3 h showed a substantial increase in exp after 96 h with a content about 2 5 times greater than that of con 3 4 temporal changes in the bonding characteristics of oil and wsf a detailed description of ftir spectrum characterization before and after photooxidation in oil and wsf is provided in supplementary information changes in bond characteristics are represented in bands peaks a u smith 1999 table s4 in brief the ftir spectrum of fresh lube oil indicated several peaks and bands as shown in table s4 and fig s8 peaks c i j k and t represented alkane compounds oxygen containing functional groups were also observed in this spectrum band b peaks l m n and s indicated alcohols and phenols alcohols and phenols were also identified as major oxygen containing functional groups of fresh lube oil in gc ms spectra table s5 fig s10b peaks n and s could also correspond to amine and phosphate groups respectively although other representative peaks were not visible in the ftir spectra both amine table s5 peak 19 fig s10b and phosphate table s5 peak 16 fig s10b were identified in gc ms spectra peaks o and p were indicative of saturated esters the peaks h r and u were specific to aromatic groups and were weak with low intensity the principal features of changes in functional groups between 0 and 96 h of photooxidation in lube oil and wsf are shown in table s4 and fig 4 lube oil exp spectra fig 4a showed no appreciable changes in bond characteristics even after 96 h of photooxidation figs 4a 3 and appeared almost identical to that of lube oil con at both 96 h figs 4a 2 and 0 h figs 4a 1 in lube wsf con figs 4b 2 along with the peaks identified in fresh lube oil con and exp additional peaks were identified among these peaks the most distinctive was peak s corresponding to phenols increased in absorbance from 0 to 96 h figs 4b 1 b 2 and s9 a new peak f was also identified and is assigned to the carbonyl co stretching of carboxylic acid the appearance of peak f and the dominance of peak s indicate a temporal increase in the dissolution of polar groups such as phenols and carboxylic acids from oil into the water column in addition to phenols saturated alcohols were also identified represented by peak p a clear difference in the ftir spectra emerged between lube wsf exp and lube wsf con indicating changes induced by photooxidation along with the peaks identified in lube wsf con additional peaks were identified in exp figs 4b 3 the most prominent among them were peaks d e and g in the range of 1 760 1 700 cm 1 representing the carbonyl co groups of cyclic acid anhydrides saturated esters and carboxylic acids esters were also identified as one of the dominant groups of photoproducts in gc ms table 2 fig s10b and fig s11b the ftir spectral peak areas of peak a corresponding to the o h stretch and peaks d e and g corresponding to the co stretch in lube wsf con and lube wsf exp table s4 fig 4c and d were used to determine the trends in bond types present during photooxidation strong increases in o h fig 4c and co groups fig 4d were apparent with increased exposure time in exp indicative of photooxidation the o h group in con also showed a gradual increasing trend until 72 h suggesting a temporal increase in the dissolution of polar groups from oil into the water column 3 5 identification of products the gc ms chromatogram of fresh lube oil is shown in fig s10 the chromatogram revealed a bell shaped curve at 30 50 min fig s10a hindering peak identification on the other hand the chromatogram at 5 22 min fig s10b showed many peaks corresponding to different groups as indicated in table s5 silylation did not enhance product identification hence non silylated chromatogram is depicted in figs s10a and b products with no appropriate matches in the nist library and literature were labeled as unidentified peaks characteristic lube oil peaks including aliphatic hydrocarbons such as alkanes and branched alkanes were relatively prevalent in addition peaks specific to alcohol phenol ester carboxylic acid ketone phosphate and amine groups were also intense and dominant arising from lube oil additives generally multi functional additives are added to lube oils to improve their natural properties and performance oxygen containing functional groups such as alcohol phenol ester carboxylic acid and ketones are used as friction modifiers and detergent additives whereas tributyl phosphate and diphenyl amine are added as antioxidants kupareva et al 2013 after 96 h of photooxidation a comparison of gc ms chromatograms of both 96 h exp lube oil fig s17b to that of fresh oil fig s17a for photoproduct identification didn t produce discernible result however when comparing the chromatograms between retention times 5 and 20 min the 96 h exp lube oil chromatogram indicated formation of new photoproducts as depicted in fig s17d these photoproducts couldn t be identified as it didn t produce an appropriate match in nist library gc ms chromatograms of both lube wsf con and lube wsf exp collected after 0 3 6 12 24 48 72 and 96 h of photooxidation are shown in figs s11 and s12 the primary products identified after 96 h of photooxidation of lube wsf exp are shown in fig 5 these photoproducts were tentatively identified and were present at significant levels table 2 figs s13 s15 show the ms fragmentation of the fresh lube oil lube wsf con and lube wsf exp peaks respectively matched preliminarily to fragmentation patterns in the library due to the lack of commercial availability of most of the compounds identified in gc ms standards similar to the structure and molecular symmetry of the photoproducts were purchased and analyzed fig s16 fig 5a and b represents gc ms spectra of both lube wsf con and lube wsf exp collected between the retention times 24 30 and 30 35 min respectively after 0 and 96 h of photooxidation compared to the seawater spectrum the same peaks appeared at similar retention times in seawater and in 0 and 96 h samples of lube wsf con and exp and these peaks were ignored however peaks 1c 2c and 3c table 2 fig 5a and b representing hexadecanoic acid trimethylsilyl ester 1 dodecanol 2 methyl s and diisooctyl phthalate respectively were absent in seawater and gradually increased in abundance from 0 to 96 h generally polar compounds such as phenols and carboxylic acids as identified through ftir are common constituents of lube oil as a result over time polar constituents in oil such as 1c and 2c are gradually transferred from the oil phase and dissolve in water phthalic acids such as diisooctyl phthalate are also common additives in lube oil ji et al 2018 consequently peak 3c became more dominant over time in lube wsf con a clear difference in the gc ms spectra appears between lube wsf con figs 5a 3 and 5b 3 and exp figs 5a 4 and 5b 4 where a considerable number of peaks in exp resulted from photoproduct formation a wide range of intermediate photoproducts including carboxylic acids esters anhydrides phenols aldehydes and ketones were identified along with a few unidentified peaks table 2 peaks 1 22 figs 5a 4 and 5b 4 new peaks appeared even after 3 h of photooxidation emphasizing the speed of the effect of photooxidation on lube oil some peaks table 2 peaks 1 2 5 7 10 12 15 19 figs s11b and s12b identified at 3 h were consistent and were subsequently detected at 6 12 24 48 72 and 96 h other peaks table 2 peaks 3 6 8 9 13 14 16 18 figs s11b and s12b that were first observed in traces at 12 h persisted and were detected at 24 48 72 and 96 h majority of the products identified were oxy and hydroxy derivatives of mono di and tetra cyclic naphtheno aromatics cycloalkanes and aromatics which were formed from parent compounds in the oil as a result of photooxidation the photoproducts could not be quantified due to a lack of standards however temporal changes in peak abundance of the photoproducts are shown in fig 6 indicating variance in the abundance of the products as well as their time of formation most of the peaks 1 5 6 7 11 and 12 identified at 3 h showed an increase in relative abundance until 48 h after which it decreased suggesting further photooxidation of the dissolved photoproducts while peaks 15 20 showed a gradual increase in relative abundance from the time of appearance until 72 h which didn t show any sign of decrease after 96 h to elucidate the roles of biotic and abiotic processes in our current study as well as our earlier investigations we consistently found that seawater itself didn t have any products identifiable above the gc ms detection limit hence it could be inferred that the photoproducts produced and identified in wsf exp samples couldn t have formed solely due to the activity of photosynthetic organisms in seawater itself but only from oil furthermore as indicated in fig 6 the temporal change in the abundance of photoproducts clearly indicates that they are arising from a rich source like oil upon photooxidation and is highly unlikely to be produced in a no oil control not used in this study also in this study unlike photooxidation microbial degradation appeared to have played insignificant role this conclusion was drawn based on the facts that firstly no distinguishable products were observed in wsf con after 96 h and secondly microbial degradation is not significant until one week to two weeks after the spill european committee for standardization 2012 the photooxidation mechanism underlying the formation of the photoproducts identified in this study could be due to both indirect and direct photooxidation ehrhardt and petrick 1985 guiliano et al 1997 only a few petroleum hydrocarbons can absorb sunlight efficiently and participate in direct photoreactions nrc 2003 considering the low concentrations of aromatics in lube oil most photooxidation is presumed to occur via indirect photoreactions the formation of singlet oxygen from the energy transfer of the triplet excited state of natural organic matter in seawater could provide the primary oxidant for the reactions observed in this study nrc 2003 it is important to note that unlike crude oils which absorb both in uv and vis region ward et al 2018b lube oil doesn t absorb in the 350 nm range crude oils are generally rich in aromatic content whereas lube oil has relatively insignificant aromatic content as observed in their tlc fid chromatograms fig 3 tables s1 and s2 since aromatics are the most susceptible to photooxidative degradation a corresponding increase in resin and asphaltene will be more obvious in case of crude oils but not in lube oils therefore only a minor degree of photooxidation occurred for the lube oil as observed in the figs 3b and 4a yet interestingly significant changes were observed in the lube wsf figs 3d and 4b 3 6 morphological abnormalities in olive flounder embryos after lube wsf exposure in this study a preliminary embryo toxicity assessment was carried out for exploratory purposes hence only lube wsf con and lube wsf exp samples collected after the maximum period of photooxidation 96 h were investigated a suite of morphological defects including pe dc and tf were observed in the flounder embryos 48 h after exposure fig 7 a and b pe was observed at the following frequencies 8 7 8 3 15 4 4 9 and 16 1 2 1 neg con lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp respectively dc was observed at the following frequencies 8 7 8 3 9 3 2 0 and 11 2 7 0 neg con lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp respectively there was no statistically significant difference in pe or dc among the three groups tested however the frequency of tf which was zero in neg con was very high in both lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp 88 9 9 7 and 92 5 11 7 respectively neg con was found to differ significantly compared to both lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp although no statistically significant difference was observed between lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp the latter had a marginally higher frequency of occurrence generally pahs constitute a significant fraction of crude oils exposure to crude oil derived pahs causes major developmental defects and high mortality rates in fish embryos defects such as cardiotoxicity are specifically associated with 3 ring pahs incardona et al 2004 jung et al 2015 environmentally realistic exposures 1 15 μg l σpahs were determined to cause specific dose dependent defects in embryos of three pelagic fishes including cardiac function defects and secondary malformation incardona et al 2014 in other studies exposure to high pah concentrations caused extracardiac defects incardona et al 2013 jung et al 2013 in particular fin fold defects and reduced fin growth were reported as specific effects of crude oil exposure and were not necessarily due to developmental delays in embryos with severe edema in this study the σpahs concentration was measured at 0 25 and 0 45 μg l in lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp respectively fig 2b the frequency of defects such as pe and dc in neg con was not significantly different from those in lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp therefore attributing defects such as pe and dc to pahs at the concentrations determined in this study is difficult however a significant difference in tf was observed between neg con and both lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp which was intriguing considering that no significant difference was observed between lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp pahs and pah derived photoproducts is hypothesized to exert little influence on tf defects it was also interesting to note that regardless of prominent changes observed in lube wsf 96 h exp upon photooxidation figs 3d 4b 3 5a 4 5b 4 and 6 there was no significant difference in toxicity between lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp fig 7a designating the compound groups responsible for tf defects observed in both lube wsf con and exp is difficult at this moment oil itself including additives such as phenol compounds and dibutyl phthalate heudorf et al 2007 as well as the newly formed photoproducts in lube wsf con and lube wsf exp respectively are inferred to be the contributors to toxicity more thorough investigations are needed to determine the specific contributors to the observed morphological defects in particular tf 4 conclusion oil spill incidents pose a continuous threat to the aquatic environment worldwide one of the key aspects of an effective response to these spills is elucidating the fate of oil including its weathering processes and eco toxicological consequences weathering effects on crude oils have been investigated for decades due to the potential for toxicity especially from aromatics such as pahs lube oils are widely employed in various parts of ships significant volumes of lube oil discharge into the aquatic environment are estimated to occur and the volume of these discharges sometimes exceeds that of crude oil spills although lube oils have low aromatic content in comparison to crude oils the large volume of lube oil discharged demands detailed investigation of its weathering process despite this need the number of studies carried out to date is extremely limited this study provides a firsthand report of photooxidation effects on lube oil conducted in an in situ mesocosm over a period of 4 days a tiered approach using conventional techniques including tlc fid ftir and gc ms successfully identified temporal changes occurring in lube oil and lube wsf the concentration of σpahs was insignificant in lube wsf and was about two times higher in exp compared to that of the con group ftir and gc ms were found to be valuable tools for monitoring photooxidation and for effective characterization of photoproduct groups weathering effects on chemical composition that are specific to photooxidation were especially evident in lube wsf exp embryo toxicity tests of flounder using wsf of 96 h con and exp revealed compelling morphological defects specific to tf in both groups with marginally higher frequency in exp considering the diversity of compounds in fresh oil as well as newly formed products after photooxidation attributing compound groups responsible for morphological defects specific to tf is not possible at this point of time and requires further investigation the results of this study provide insights into an environmentally realistic assessment of the transformation and impacts of lube oil after its input into the marine environment however the group of compounds accountable for embryo morphological defects has yet to be fully identified the high incidence of tf defects in the con group suggested the toxic potential of lube oil in its un weathered state to understand the specific effects of photooxidation on embryo morphology further weathering studies that involve monitoring over a prolonged period of time are needed these findings warrant detailed investigation of the chemical compositional changes caused by weathering using

18414,lubricant lube oil discharge from ships has been widely considered as normal operational consumption but is now deemed to be oil pollution despite the chronic contamination of the marine

chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms demonstrated compositional changes in lube oil and the water soluble fraction wsf total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons σpahs in lube oil after 96 h of

identified in wsf toxic effects of wsf in both the con and exp groups obtained after 96 h of photooxidation were evaluated on olive flounder paralichthys olivaceus embryos morphological defects

introduction marine oil spills have been identified as one of the most important threats to ecosystems causing major environmental and economic damage worldwide the degree of damage caused by a spill depends upon its source location type discharge volume season and environmental conditions nrc 2003 petroleum both in the form of crude oil and refined products such as lubricant lube oil fuel oil gasoline and kerosene has diverse properties and contains numerous different toxic compounds with harmful environmental effects nrc 1985 lube oil is used primarily in marine engines and other machines it plays a critical role in reducing friction and wear between moving surfaces and removing heat to ensure efficiency and high power output mao et al 2009 the major component 75 90 of conventional lube oil is base oil consisting of thousands of individual petroleum hydrocarbons mostly in the c20 to c40 range the remaining portion consists of performance enhancing additives lube oil represents 10 of the total oil input into marine waters usepa 2011 most ocean going ships operate using oil lubricated stern tubes and also employ lube oil with a wide range of on deck and underwater submerged machinery oil discharge from stern tubes was once considered normal operational consumption of oil but is now regarded as oil pollution lube oil discharge through stern tube leakage is a significant source of oil pollution in the aquatic environment etkin 2010 usepa 2011 it is estimated that as much as 4 6 28 6 million liters of oil is introduced to port waters annually from stern tubes and 32 3 million liters from other operational discharges if the same rates of discharge were to occur at sea then total worldwide inputs from all operational discharges and leaks would add up to about 130 244 million liters annually etkin 2010 pure lube oils are infrequently observed in cases of oil pollution and instead constitute some proportion of waste oil pollution as it is common practice on board ships to first collect waste oil of all kinds in sludge and bilge tanks european committee for standardization 2012 hence oil characterization using chemical fingerprinting and investigation of the changes induced by weathering are essential steps to determine the ecological consequences of lube oil discharge however the number of studies conducted on lube oil chemical fingerprinting and weathering to date is limited once lube oil is discharged into the ocean it begins to spread increasing the exposed area and accelerating subsequent weathering processes such as evaporation dispersion emulsification dissolution photooxidation sedimentation and biodegradation nrc 2003 conventional mineral based lube oils vary greatly in their chemical properties weathering processes and the chemical properties of the oil determine the rate of degradation weathering under natural conditions is complicated and its effects may differ among oil components a fundamental understanding of weathering processes is essential for assessment of the ecological impact of weathering one key aspect of the mechanism of toxicity that must be examined is the components produced through photooxidation garrett et al 1998 photooxidation is a light catalyzed reaction in which the reduced carbon in petroleum hydrocarbons is oxidized the primary photooxidation pathways include direct photoionization direct reaction of the excited triplet state with molecular oxygen and electron transfer to molecular oxygen fasnacht and blough 2003 shankar et al 2015 photooxidation produces partially oxidized intermediates called oxyhydrocarbons aeppli et al 2012 ward et al 2018a 2018b which are more water soluble and thus have greater bioavailability and toxicity than the parent species carls and meador 2009 king et al 2014 numerous studies have been conducted in recent decades to investigate the effects of photooxidation on crude oil ali et al 1995 hansen 1975 d auria et al 2009 hall et al 2013 radovic et al 2014 white et al 2016 considering the enormous estimated volume of global lube oil inputs elucidating the effects of photooxidation on lube oil is crucial to date studies on the photooxidation of lube oil have been limited in this context the effects of photooxidation on lube oil and the lube water soluble fraction wsf temporal changes in petroleum hydrocarbons and the toxic effects of wsf on fish embryos of olive flounder paralichthys olivaceus were concurrently investigated in this study to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the environmental fate and toxicity of lube oil and the results of this study will improve our understanding of that topic 2 materials and methods 2 1 photooxidation experiment the mesocosm experiment was conducted at the pier facility of the korea institute of ocean science and technology a schematic representation of the mesocosm system is shown in figs s1a and b the experimental mesocosm facility consisted of two tanks exposure exp and control con which are rectangular in shape and made of polypropylene carbonate the two tanks were identical with a volume of 600 l and measurements of 1 355 mm length 830 mm width 600 mm height each tank was filled with seawater which was continuously circulated to maintain a constant temperature each tank was fitted with seven independent glass jars 12 l volume acting as a mesocosm system for periodic sampling at specified time intervals 0 3 6 12 24 48 72 and 96 h the glass jars were filled with 10 l of seawater and allowed to acclimatize as presented in fig s1a the mouth of the jar open directly to sunlight ranged about 15 cm in diameter lube oil 6 ml was injected onto the surface of the seawater in each mesocosm system in the exp and con groups the nominal

olive flounder p olivaceus were artificially fertilized in a commercial fishery facility eggs were transported to our laboratory 6 h after fertilization and allowed to acclimatize for 24 h in flowing seawater floating eggs were collected for exposure experiments embryos were examined under a dissecting microscope and abnormal or dead individuals were removed before the experiment developing

discussion 3 1 characterization of hydrocarbons and pahs in lube oil commercial lube oils consist primarily of base oils with small quantities of chemical additives yang et al 2016 lube oil is either mineral based of petroleum origin or synthetic and mineral based lube oils are the most widely used usepa 2011 to satisfy the performance requirements lube oils vary in their physical properties including their melting and boiling points viscosity and distillation range etkin 2010 usepa 2011 yang et al 2016 lube oil absorption spectrum is depicted in fig s18 it shows that lube oil absorption spectrum lies within the range of 220 350 nm with its maximum absorption at 275 nm and a shoulder peak at 240 nm this suggests that the light absorption of lube oil occurs mostly in uv b 280 315 nm and uv a 315 400 nm regions and considering the complexity and diversity of lube oil composition photosensitizers absorbing in the visible region could also be present in minor quantities the chemical composition of lube oils is complex and conventional techniques have limitations in terms of resolving them for this reason iranian heavy crude oil ihc was used as a reference oil for comparison with the chemical properties of lube oil in this study ihc has been the subject of numerous studies joo et al 2013 loh et al 2018 yim et al 2011 in our laboratory the chemical properties of fresh ihc and lube oils are presented in tables s1 and s2 and figs 1 and s2 lube oils generally contain very low concentrations of n alkanes and pahs yang et al 2015 2016 as shown in fig s2 the gc fid chromatogram of ihc fig s2a showed hydrocarbons ranging from c8 c37 with c13 c16 being most dominant in contrast lube fig s2b had unique chromatographic features including an unresolved complex mixture ucm hump eluted in the high boiling point hydrocarbon range this ucm in ihc accounted for 63 9 of the tph content while in lube it accounted for as much as 91 3 of tph tables s1 and s2 pah profiles fig 1 showed that pahs and alkylated pahs in ihc fig 1a ranged from naphthalene to benzo b fluoranthene bbf with alkylated naphthalene c1 c4n dibenzothiophene c1 c3d and phenanthrene c1 c3p being the most dominant in contrast the pahs and alkylated pahs fig 1b in lube were restricted to only naphthalene dibenzothiophene and phenanthrene with c0 c3d being the most dominant followed by c0 c4n and c0 c2p in the case of ihc 16 pahs and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons σpahs were abundant at around 368 and 12 687 μg g respectively table s1 meanwhile in lube 16 pahs 1 45 μg g and σpahs 84 1 μg g were present at insignificant levels table s2 approximately 250 and 150 times lower than those in ihc respectively 3 2 temporal changes of pahs in oil and wsf in the lube oil control group lube oil con the temporal change of σpahs did not show a particular trend from 0 to 96 h however in the lube oil exposure group lube oil exp the concentration of σpahs decreased gradually from 84 1 μg g at 0 h to 42 8 μg g after photooxidation for 96 h fig 2 a temporal changes of pahs from 0 to 96 h in lube oil con and lube oil exp are shown in fig s3 pahs were sequentially degraded according to their aromatic ring number and degree of alkylation in lube oil exp weathering ratios including naphthalene σpahs and c0n c1n c2n both representing evaporation and dissolution were calculated fig s5 yim et al 2011 greater differences were observed between con and exp with an increase in exposure time after 96 h the weathering ratio in exp was reduced more than threefold compared to that of con this result indicated that over time c0 c1n were more strongly affected by evaporation and dissolution than photooxidation also in the case of exp c0d and c0p were relatively resistant to photooxidation compared to their alkylated homologs concentrations of c1 c3d and c1 c2p gradually decreased from 0 to 96 h compared to those in con in particular c2 c3d in exp showed a substantial decrease after 96 h with its concentration decreasing nearly to half that in con in both the lube wsf control group lube wsf con and lube wsf exposure group lube wsf exp σpahs were very low at 0 25 and 0 45 μg l respectively after 96 h fig 2b temporal changes in both the con and exp groups indicated that pahs and alkylated pahs were limited to c0 c3n at 3 and 6 h with relatively higher concentrations in exp fig s4 c0 c1n of con and exp exhibited no particular trend between 3 and 24 h but a trend became apparent after 48 h wherein c0 c1n of exp had relatively low concentrations compared to those of con until 96 h because both evaporation and dissolution affect c0 c1n the relative effects of both processes combined with photooxidation appear to drive the differing trends observed at various time points c0 c1d and c0 c1p began appearing in wsf at 12 h in exp and at 24 h in con and continued to increase in concentration thereafter until 96 h c2d appeared both in con and exp from 24 h and increased until 96 h c3d and c2p appeared only in exp at 48 and 24 h respectively and increased in concentration until 96 h the profile of exp showed an increase of parent and alkylated homologs of pahs especially c0 c2n c0 c2d and c0 c1p in an increasing stairwell like trend with increasing alkyl number from 0 to 96 h in addition to naphthalene heterocompounds are more strongly affected by dissolution than most other aromatic hydrocarbons in a homologous series dissolution decreases with higher substitution in the following order c0 c1 c2 c3 european committee for standardization 2012 this explains the temporal trend of parent and alkyl pahs observed in lube wsf con from 3 to 96 h meanwhile the trend in lube wsf exp could be attributed to two phenomena in lube wsf con dissolution is the only process responsible for the gradual increase in pahs over time whereas in lube wsf exp the entrainment of oil droplets into the water column becomes more important at the higher wind speeds encountered in exp compared to con thus greater quantities of hydrocarbons would become dispersed leading to increased dissolution of pahs in exp gros et al 2014 secondly in lube wsf exp although the oil slick on the water surface was subjected to photooxidation the slick itself could act as a partial cover reducing the rate of photooxidation of pahs dissolved in the water column as indicated in fig s5 evaporation and dissolution appears to have played a significant role in oil degradation especially in oil exp the major difference between oil con and exp is that in case of con which was maintained in a close environment dissolution appears to have been driven only by gravity whereas in exp in addition to gravity wind could reduce the air and water boundary layer thicknesses and thus enhance mass transfer rates to both air and water gros et al 2014 consequently pahs composition in oil exp is relatively more reduced by evaporation and dissolution resulting in a corresponding increase of pahs concentration in wsf exp 3 3 temporal changes in chemical composition the tlc fid chromatogram of fresh lube oil indicated that the sara fractions contributed 88 8 5 6 0 9 and 4 7 respectively table s2 fig 3 saturates made up the most abundant fraction followed by small amounts of the aromatic and asphaltene fractions resin comprised the smallest fraction in comparison the tlc fid chromatogram of fresh ihc oil table s1 fig 3 showed a greater percentage of aromatics 47 6 than saturates 24 6 resins 11 9 and asphaltenes 15 9 examination of lube oil con and lube oil exp after photooxidation indicated that saturated hydrocarbons were less weathered over 96 h of photooxidation table s3 figs s6a and b meanwhile aromatics although low had no apparent trend in con showed a gradual decrease in their fractional composition from 5 6 at 0 h to 3 9 at 96 h in exp table s3 fig 3a and b this observation corresponds with the gradual increase in the resin fraction 0 9 at 0 h to 1 8 at 96 h emphasizing the effect of photooxidation on pahs the tlc fid chromatograms of lube wsf con and lube wsf exp showed that only the resin fraction was detectable in these samples fig 3c and d examination of all wsfs after photooxidation revealed a substantial increase of the resin fraction in exp with increased exposure time fig 3e and s6c and d the relative increase in the resin fraction in exp compared to that in con shown in fig 3e was calculated based on the resin response figs s6c and d observed in tlc fid analysis the resin fractions that were equally abundant in con and exp at 3 h showed a substantial increase in exp after 96 h with a content about 2 5 times greater than that of con 3 4 temporal changes in the bonding characteristics of oil and wsf a detailed description of ftir spectrum characterization before and after photooxidation in oil and wsf is provided in supplementary information changes in bond characteristics are represented in bands peaks a u smith 1999 table s4 in brief the ftir spectrum of fresh lube oil indicated several peaks and bands as shown in table s4 and fig s8 peaks c i j k and t represented alkane compounds oxygen containing functional groups were also observed in this spectrum band b peaks l m n and s indicated alcohols and phenols alcohols and phenols were also identified as major oxygen containing functional groups of fresh lube oil in gc ms spectra table s5 fig s10b peaks n and s could also correspond to amine and phosphate groups respectively although other representative peaks were not visible in the ftir spectra both amine table s5 peak 19 fig s10b and phosphate table s5 peak 16 fig s10b were identified in gc ms spectra peaks o and p were indicative of saturated esters the peaks h r and u were specific to aromatic groups and were weak with low intensity the principal features of changes in functional groups between 0 and 96 h of photooxidation in lube oil and wsf are shown in table s4 and fig 4 lube oil exp spectra fig 4a showed no appreciable changes in bond characteristics even after 96 h of photooxidation figs 4a 3 and appeared almost identical to that of lube oil con at both 96 h figs 4a 2 and 0 h figs 4a 1 in lube wsf con figs 4b 2 along with the peaks identified in fresh lube oil con and exp additional peaks were identified among these peaks the most distinctive was peak s corresponding to phenols increased in absorbance from 0 to 96 h figs 4b 1 b 2 and s9 a new peak f was also identified and is assigned to the carbonyl co stretching of carboxylic acid the appearance of peak f and the dominance of peak s indicate a temporal increase in the dissolution of polar groups such as phenols and carboxylic acids from oil into the water column in addition to phenols saturated alcohols were also identified represented by peak p a clear difference in the ftir spectra emerged between lube wsf exp and lube wsf con indicating changes induced by photooxidation along with the peaks identified in lube wsf con additional peaks were identified in exp figs 4b 3 the most prominent among them were peaks d e and g in the range of 1 760 1 700 cm 1 representing the carbonyl co groups of cyclic acid anhydrides saturated esters and carboxylic acids esters were also identified as one of the dominant groups of photoproducts in gc ms table 2 fig s10b and fig s11b the ftir spectral peak areas of peak a corresponding to the o h stretch and peaks d e and g corresponding to the co stretch in lube wsf con and lube wsf exp table s4 fig 4c and d were used to determine the trends in bond types present during photooxidation strong increases in o h fig 4c and co groups fig 4d were apparent with increased exposure time in exp indicative of photooxidation the o h group in con also showed a gradual increasing trend until 72 h suggesting a temporal increase in the dissolution of polar groups from oil into the water column 3 5 identification of products the gc ms chromatogram of fresh lube oil is shown in fig s10 the chromatogram revealed a bell shaped curve at 30 50 min fig s10a hindering peak identification on the other hand the chromatogram at 5 22 min fig s10b showed many peaks corresponding to different groups as indicated in table s5 silylation did not enhance product identification hence non silylated chromatogram is depicted in figs s10a and b products with no appropriate matches in the nist library and literature were labeled as unidentified peaks characteristic lube oil peaks including aliphatic hydrocarbons such as alkanes and branched alkanes were relatively prevalent in addition peaks specific to alcohol phenol ester carboxylic acid ketone phosphate and amine groups were also intense and dominant arising from lube oil additives generally multi functional additives are added to lube oils to improve their natural properties and performance oxygen containing functional groups such as alcohol phenol ester carboxylic acid and ketones are used as friction modifiers and detergent additives whereas tributyl phosphate and diphenyl amine are added as antioxidants kupareva et al 2013 after 96 h of photooxidation a comparison of gc ms chromatograms of both 96 h exp lube oil fig s17b to that of fresh oil fig s17a for photoproduct identification didn t produce discernible result however when comparing the chromatograms between retention times 5 and 20 min the 96 h exp lube oil chromatogram indicated formation of new photoproducts as depicted in fig s17d these photoproducts couldn t be identified as it didn t produce an appropriate match in nist library gc ms chromatograms of both lube wsf con and lube wsf exp collected after 0 3 6 12 24 48 72 and 96 h of photooxidation are shown in figs s11 and s12 the primary products identified after 96 h of photooxidation of lube wsf exp are shown in fig 5 these photoproducts were tentatively identified and were present at significant levels table 2 figs s13 s15 show the ms fragmentation of the fresh lube oil lube wsf con and lube wsf exp peaks respectively matched preliminarily to fragmentation patterns in the library due to the lack of commercial availability of most of the compounds identified in gc ms standards similar to the structure and molecular symmetry of the photoproducts were purchased and analyzed fig s16 fig 5a and b represents gc ms spectra of both lube wsf con and lube wsf exp collected between the retention times 24 30 and 30 35 min respectively after 0 and 96 h of photooxidation compared to the seawater spectrum the same peaks appeared at similar retention times in seawater and in 0 and 96 h samples of lube wsf con and exp and these peaks were ignored however peaks 1c 2c and 3c table 2 fig 5a and b representing hexadecanoic acid trimethylsilyl ester 1 dodecanol 2 methyl s and diisooctyl phthalate respectively were absent in seawater and gradually increased in abundance from 0 to 96 h generally polar compounds such as phenols and carboxylic acids as identified through ftir are common constituents of lube oil as a result over time polar constituents in oil such as 1c and 2c are gradually transferred from the oil phase and dissolve in water phthalic acids such as diisooctyl phthalate are also common additives in lube oil ji et al 2018 consequently peak 3c became more dominant over time in lube wsf con a clear difference in the gc ms spectra appears between lube wsf con figs 5a 3 and 5b 3 and exp figs 5a 4 and 5b 4 where a considerable number of peaks in exp resulted from photoproduct formation a wide range of intermediate photoproducts including carboxylic acids esters anhydrides phenols aldehydes and ketones were identified along with a few unidentified peaks table 2 peaks 1 22 figs 5a 4 and 5b 4 new peaks appeared even after 3 h of photooxidation emphasizing the speed of the effect of photooxidation on lube oil some peaks table 2 peaks 1 2 5 7 10 12 15 19 figs s11b and s12b identified at 3 h were consistent and were subsequently detected at 6 12 24 48 72 and 96 h other peaks table 2 peaks 3 6 8 9 13 14 16 18 figs s11b and s12b that were first observed in traces at 12 h persisted and were detected at 24 48 72 and 96 h majority of the products identified were oxy and hydroxy derivatives of mono di and tetra cyclic naphtheno aromatics cycloalkanes and aromatics which were formed from parent compounds in the oil as a result of photooxidation the photoproducts could not be quantified due to a lack of standards however temporal changes in peak abundance of the photoproducts are shown in fig 6 indicating variance in the abundance of the products as well as their time of formation most of the peaks 1 5 6 7 11 and 12 identified at 3 h showed an increase in relative abundance until 48 h after which it decreased suggesting further photooxidation of the dissolved photoproducts while peaks 15 20 showed a gradual increase in relative abundance from the time of appearance until 72 h which didn t show any sign of decrease after 96 h to elucidate the roles of biotic and abiotic processes in our current study as well as our earlier investigations we consistently found that seawater itself didn t have any products identifiable above the gc ms detection limit hence it could be inferred that the photoproducts produced and identified in wsf exp samples couldn t have formed solely due to the activity of photosynthetic organisms in seawater itself but only from oil furthermore as indicated in fig 6 the temporal change in the abundance of photoproducts clearly indicates that they are arising from a rich source like oil upon photooxidation and is highly unlikely to be produced in a no oil control not used in this study also in this study unlike photooxidation microbial degradation appeared to have played insignificant role this conclusion was drawn based on the facts that firstly no distinguishable products were observed in wsf con after 96 h and secondly microbial degradation is not significant until one week to two weeks after the spill european committee for standardization 2012 the photooxidation mechanism underlying the formation of the photoproducts identified in this study could be due to both indirect and direct photooxidation ehrhardt and petrick 1985 guiliano et al 1997 only a few petroleum hydrocarbons can absorb sunlight efficiently and participate in direct photoreactions nrc 2003 considering the low concentrations of aromatics in lube oil most photooxidation is presumed to occur via indirect photoreactions the formation of singlet oxygen from the energy transfer of the triplet excited state of natural organic matter in seawater could provide the primary oxidant for the reactions observed in this study nrc 2003 it is important to note that unlike crude oils which absorb both in uv and vis region ward et al 2018b lube oil doesn t absorb in the 350 nm range crude oils are generally rich in aromatic content whereas lube oil has relatively insignificant aromatic content as observed in their tlc fid chromatograms fig 3 tables s1 and s2 since aromatics are the most susceptible to photooxidative degradation a corresponding increase in resin and asphaltene will be more obvious in case of crude oils but not in lube oils therefore only a minor degree of photooxidation occurred for the lube oil as observed in the figs 3b and 4a yet interestingly significant changes were observed in the lube wsf figs 3d and 4b 3 6 morphological abnormalities in olive flounder embryos after lube wsf exposure in this study a preliminary embryo toxicity assessment was carried out for exploratory purposes hence only lube wsf con and lube wsf exp samples collected after the maximum period of photooxidation 96 h were investigated a suite of morphological defects including pe dc and tf were observed in the flounder embryos 48 h after exposure fig 7 a and b pe was observed at the following frequencies 8 7 8 3 15 4 4 9 and 16 1 2 1 neg con lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp respectively dc was observed at the following frequencies 8 7 8 3 9 3 2 0 and 11 2 7 0 neg con lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp respectively there was no statistically significant difference in pe or dc among the three groups tested however the frequency of tf which was zero in neg con was very high in both lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp 88 9 9 7 and 92 5 11 7 respectively neg con was found to differ significantly compared to both lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp although no statistically significant difference was observed between lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp the latter had a marginally higher frequency of occurrence generally pahs constitute a significant fraction of crude oils exposure to crude oil derived pahs causes major developmental defects and high mortality rates in fish embryos defects such as cardiotoxicity are specifically associated with 3 ring pahs incardona et al 2004 jung et al 2015 environmentally realistic exposures 1 15 μg l σpahs were determined to cause specific dose dependent defects in embryos of three pelagic fishes including cardiac function defects and secondary malformation incardona et al 2014 in other studies exposure to high pah concentrations caused extracardiac defects incardona et al 2013 jung et al 2013 in particular fin fold defects and reduced fin growth were reported as specific effects of crude oil exposure and were not necessarily due to developmental delays in embryos with severe edema in this study the σpahs concentration was measured at 0 25 and 0 45 μg l in lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp respectively fig 2b the frequency of defects such as pe and dc in neg con was not significantly different from those in lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp therefore attributing defects such as pe and dc to pahs at the concentrations determined in this study is difficult however a significant difference in tf was observed between neg con and both lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp which was intriguing considering that no significant difference was observed between lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp pahs and pah derived photoproducts is hypothesized to exert little influence on tf defects it was also interesting to note that regardless of prominent changes observed in lube wsf 96 h exp upon photooxidation figs 3d 4b 3 5a 4 5b 4 and 6 there was no significant difference in toxicity between lube wsf 96 h con and lube wsf 96 h exp fig 7a designating the compound groups responsible for tf defects observed in both lube wsf con and exp is difficult at this moment oil itself including additives such as phenol compounds and dibutyl phthalate heudorf et al 2007 as well as the newly formed photoproducts in lube wsf con and lube wsf exp respectively are inferred to be the contributors to toxicity more thorough investigations are needed to determine the specific contributors to the observed morphological defects in particular tf 4 conclusion oil spill incidents pose a continuous threat to the aquatic environment worldwide one of the key aspects of an effective response to these spills is elucidating the fate of oil including its weathering processes and eco toxicological consequences weathering effects on crude oils have been investigated for decades due to the potential for toxicity especially from aromatics such as pahs lube oils are widely employed in various parts of ships significant volumes of lube oil discharge into the aquatic environment are estimated to occur and the volume of these discharges sometimes exceeds that of crude oil spills although lube oils have low aromatic content in comparison to crude oils the large volume of lube oil discharged demands detailed investigation of its weathering process despite this need the number of studies carried out to date is extremely limited this study provides a firsthand report of photooxidation effects on lube oil conducted in an in situ mesocosm over a period of 4 days a tiered approach using conventional techniques including tlc fid ftir and gc ms successfully identified temporal changes occurring in lube oil and lube wsf the concentration of σpahs was insignificant in lube wsf and was about two times higher in exp compared to that of the con group ftir and gc ms were found to be valuable tools for monitoring photooxidation and for effective characterization of photoproduct groups weathering effects on chemical composition that are specific to photooxidation were especially evident in lube wsf exp embryo toxicity tests of flounder using wsf of 96 h con and exp revealed compelling morphological defects specific to tf in both groups with marginally higher frequency in exp considering the diversity of compounds in fresh oil as well as newly formed products after photooxidation attributing compound groups responsible for morphological defects specific to tf is not possible at this point of time and requires further investigation the results of this study provide insights into an environmentally realistic assessment of the transformation and impacts of lube oil after its input into the marine environment however the group of compounds accountable for embryo morphological defects has yet to be fully identified the high incidence of tf defects in the con group suggested the toxic potential of lube oil in its un weathered state to understand the specific effects of photooxidation on embryo morphology further weathering studies that involve monitoring over a prolonged period of time are needed these findings warrant detailed investigation of the chemical compositional changes caused by weathering using
