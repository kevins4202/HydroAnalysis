19320,the propane hydrate formation was proposed to have potentials in realizing free conditioning dewatering of sewage sludge with implications to simultaneous clean water extraction and highly efficient volume reduction primarily the investigation on phase equilibrium of propane hydrates found that the organic components of sewage sludge promoted the propane hydrate formation in terms of decreasing equilibrium pressure by up to 19 2 compared with that in pure water further the feasibility of hydrate based dewatering was verified through the observation of propane hydrate formation in sewage sludge and also the quality analysis of water generated from decomposition of up floated formed hydrates the formation of up floated propane hydrates extracted water molecules from sewage sludge into homogeneous crystal phase which actually excluded sludge particles from hydrate phase and realized the reduction of water in sludge phase the efficiency of water conversion into hydrates was determined by monitoring propane pressure which indicated that 14 batch runs decreased the water content of sludge from 98 81wt to 44 3wt under free conditioning conditions the chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen and total phosphorus of hydrate extracted water were measured to be 21 1 mg l 10 5 0 2 mg l and 0 4 0 mg l respectively which reflected the excellent separation performance and also indicated that the hydrate extracted water can be directly discharged without further treatments finally the unit energy consumption of hydrate based dewatering process based on a continuous operation mode was calculated to be 2673 96 kw h t dry solid of sewage sludge which was nearly half of that in thermal drying process therefore the propane hydrate based process is believed to maximize the green operation of enhanced sludge dewatering while minimizing the energy and additional material consumption graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage sludge propane hydrate dewatering solid liquid separation 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment is a core technology for water resource protection and reuse as is clearly demonstrated by its successful implementation in many countries worldwide bruus et al 1992 but sewage sludge an inevitable by product of biological wastewater treatment containing various toxic substances such as pathogens heavy metals and some organic contaminants is of concern to sustainable development of biological wastewater treatments feng et al 2015 the appropriate handling of sludge could reduce secondary pollution decrease operation costs and even recovery energy wu et al 2016 thus the safe and efficient utilization or disposal of sludge are crucial for the role of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in environmental quality improvement the energy utilization remains as one of the most attractive ways for sludge disposal due to the effective volume reduction potential contaminant destruction or energy recovery instead of input anaerobic digestion and hydrothermal liquefaction have both been documented as appropriate processes for energy conversion from sewage sludge joo et al 2016 wang et al 2018 however these two approaches can only convert about 20 35 of total organics into energy enriched products methane or bio crude nazari et al 2017 as a result the final disposals of residues and produced wastewater containing high strength of nitrogen and phosphorus are still needed to be further addressed shen et al 2015 therefore compared with the above two processes some potential advantages of incineration pyrolysis and gasification of sludge may stand out because these treatments can rapidly maximize the energy conversion of organic components and also minimize the final residues cao and pawłowski 2012 but the feedstock dewatering or drying is the essential pretreatment steps christensen et al 2015 wang et al 2017 due to the colloid stability of highly hydrated microbial aggregation it is generally difficult to dewater sludge without conditioning operations polyacrylamide pam polyferric chloride polymeric aluminum chloride pacl lime and some advanced oxidation processes aops reagents represented by fenton fenton like reagents feng et al 2015 fe ii activated persulfate zhen et al 2013 thermal iron activated peroxymonosulfate pms li et al 2018 and peroxydisulfate pds kim et al 2016 li et al 2016 have been widely reported as conditioning reagents in combination with a mechanical press to enhance the release of interstitial or intracellular water from sludge flocs christensen et al 2015 however the introduction of chlorine with conventional conditioning reagents would trigger a risk of forming dioxin or equipment corrosion in the subsequent thermochemical process lin et al 2015 in addition the dosage of these conditioning reagents is up to the range of 50 100 mg g dry solid ds which causes the substantial volume increase and calorific value reduction of dewatered sludge wu et al 2016 xia et al 2014 in order to minimize the negative effects of conditioning reagent addition alkaline hydrothermal pretreatment wang et al 2017 yu et al 2014 and electrolysis zhen et al 2013 were also associated with drying technologies and electro dewatering processes mahmoud et al 2011 respectively however these processes usually cause the serious lysis of sludge flocs and substantially increase pollutant concentration in the liquid phase of pretreated sludge hu et al 2016 as a result the wastewater produced from the dewatering units contains high strength nitrogen and phosphorus and should be recycled back to the influent of wwtps for further treatment which will require extra aeration and carbon source to achieve enhanced biological nutrient removal hu et al 2016 therefore the realization of free conditioning and efficient dewatering process with simultaneous clean water extraction can avoid the dependence on conditioning reagents of conventional solid liquid processes eliminate the potential secondary pollution and also minimize the caloric value decrease of dewatered sludge for better closed circuit energy recycle clathrate hydrates called hydrates from hereon are ice like inclusion compounds formed typically at moderately high pressure a few megapascals and low temperatures a few degrees above 273 15 k by combination of water host molecules and small molecules guest molecules such as nitrogen methane carbon dioxide propane tetrahydrofuran and cyclopentane jr and koh 2008 in hydrates cages of hydrogen bonded water molecules are occupied by small guest molecule s in other words it is feasible that due to the strong affinity to guest molecules water molecules could be extracted from sludge by forming hydrate cages through adding small guest molecules at conducive conditions because the equilibrium pressure of propane hydrates is relatively lower than those of other common guest molecules of clathrate hydrates such as methane ethane and carbon dioxide this study is aimed at exploring the potential of using propane as a water extractant to achieve enhanced dewatering of sludge the main features of propane hydrate based dewatering approach are as follows 1 propane exists as a gas at room temperature and ambient pressure it has a strong affinity to force water molecules to form cages resulting in facile formation of hydrates under 170 530 kpa and at temperatures of 273 15 278 15 k this can be also verified by using the molar gibbs free energy of 214 3 kj mol at 278 15k for the following reaction jr and koh 2008 1 c3h8 17h2o c3h8 17h2o 2 the continuous and dense propane hydrate formation mainly takes place on the gas liquid interface exchange for extracting water and the formed hydrates floas up to the sludge surface due to its lower density about 0 7 0 8 cm3 g than water jr and koh 2008 3 after the quick downward discharge of dewatered sludge propane hydrates are also gradually decomposed by depressurization and the released propane can be collected for direct multiple recycles or indirect reuse after easily purified through pressurized liquefaction which avoids the resource consumption caused by the conventional unrenewable conditioning reagents 4 the deeply dewatered sludge can be subsequently utilized as solid fuel for energy recovery therefore the in situ propane hydrate formation is believed to be a potential way of providing the incineration pyrolysis or gasification feedstock without external addition of pretreatment reagents it should also have a significant prospect in eliminating the negative impacts of conventional conditioning methods and maximizing the implementation of green operation for wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage sludge and extracellular polymeric substances eps analysis sewage sludge samples were obtained from a wastewater treatment plant located in northport ny usa that uses an anaerobic anoxia aerobic a2 o process and has a design capacity of 1500 m3 day the three parallel samples were collected at 24 h intervals and treated as one mixed sample the general characteristics were as follows ph 6 68 0 02 water content 98 81 0 01wt and by difference

infrared spectroscopy ft ir nicolet 5700 thermo fisher scientific ma usa analysis wang et al 2009b were referred to the previous studies 2 2 set up and instruments 2 2 1 tube reactor in order to accurately control and monitor the temperature and gas pressure the phase diagram of propane hydrates in sewage sludge was determined by a small volume tube reactor with high precision chiller the high pressure cell was fabricated from a 304 stainless steel tube 9 mm internal diameter total volume 10 cm3 as shown in fig 1 a the bottom of the tube could be plugged or used to insert a thermocouple the top was connected to a stainless steel quick connect for loading the sample a safety three way relief valve was employed to release pressure from the system at any time during the experiment the appropriate temperature for propane hydrate formation was maintained by a chiller julabo co ltd germany filled with ethylene glycol the chiller was fitted with a high precision temperature control system and the estimated error of temperature measurement was 0 01 k the fluctuation of the temperature control was 0 03 k pressure value was recorded with a pressure transducer omega engineering inc usa and the estimated error was 5 kpa 2 2 2 windowed reactor a reactor fitted with see through windows 30 cm high 1 5 cm wide along the reactor length on opposite sides was used for the propane hydrate based dewatering because it was ideal to observe the separation of hydrate and sludge phases during the propane hydrate formation fig 1b the height and inner diameter were 34 cm and 5 cm respectively the total reactor volume was about 667 ml a water bath was used to maintain the appropriate temperature a pressure transducer omega engineering inc usa measurement accuracy 5 kpa and thermocouple extech instruments inc usa measurement accuracy 0 1 k were installed at the top and bottom of the windowed reactor respectively ethylene glycol was used as coolant and pumped by the chiller thermo electron corporation usa into the cooling tube which was submerged in the water bath to maintain the reaction system at a desired temperature 275 2 0 5 k 2 3 determining phase diagram of propane hydrates formed in sewage sludge the simulated prediction of equilibrium conditions for propane hydrates in pure water was conducted using the csmhyd program developed by colorado school of mines golden co usa http hydrates mines edu chr software html the commonly used pressure search method was modified to determine the incipience of propane hydrate formation in sewage sludge peng et al 2010 and detailed in text s1 of supplementary materials 2 4 dewatering process of sewage sludge by propane hydrate formation 2 4 1 typical procedures for hydrate based sludge dewatering and hydrated water sampling in order to visualize the separation performance of propane hydrates from sludge the dewatering process was conducted in the windowed reactor described in section 2 2 2 the reactor with 200 ml sludge sample in it was cooled till it reached a temperature of 275 2 0 5 k and then the temperature was maintained during the dewatering process 40 ml hydrated water was sampled for water quality analysis but 40 ml raw sludge was also injected to make the headspace volume for the propane gas unchanged with the water sampling the detailed steps for hydrate based sludge dewatering and hydrated water sampling can be found in text s2 of supplementary materials 2 4 2 hydrated water quality analysis the chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp of the water samples from the hydrate based dewatering process and the supernatant from 30 min settling of raw sludge in a 1 l cylinder were measured using the hach method hach company usa in duplicate in order to evaluate whether the hydrated water can be discharged directly or not the measured results were compared with the chinese national standard for the effluent of wwtps chinese ministry of environmental protection 2002 and also the typical effluent qualities of wwtps in united states and europe 3 results and discussion 3 1 phase diagram of propane hydrates in sewage sludge the phase diagram is a useful tool for choosing the appropriate temperature for the hydrate based dewatering of sludge considering operation feasibility and energy consumption from fig 2 a it can be seen that the presence of sludge flocs promoted the formation of propane hydrates the equilibrium pressure of propane hydrates in sewage sludge was measured to be lower than its theoretical value in pure water the sludge flocs were composed of cell aggregations and the surrounding eps sponza 2002 ft ir spectra shown in fig 2b verified the presence of carboxyl groups 1690 1750 cm 1 c o stretch of carboxylic acids hydroxyl group 3200 3500 cm 1 h bonded o h stretch and ammonia groups 1580 1650 cm 1 n h bend of amine of eps due to these highly hydrophilic functional groups a large amount of interstitial water and interfacial water were bound in the fine pores of the porous and net like sludge flocs as discontinuously distributed phase li and yang 2007 neyens et al 2004 tsang and vesilind 1990 as a result expect for the interface between propane and sludge phase numbers of micro scale gas liquid exchange interfaces in sludge flocs may also exist once the propane gas was charged into the tube reactor at the appropriate temperature of 273 15 277 15 k the water trapped in sludge flocs could be converted into dispersed hydrates particles when these first hydrates particles were formed surrounding sludge floc particles the organic macromolecules in sludge flocs may continuously confer anti agglomeration properties to those hydrate particles therefore the presence of sludge particles actually acted as nucleation sites prevented the agglomeration of formed hydrates and provided more possibilities for the gas liquid exchanges ricaurte et al 2013 as a consequence the crystallization reactions among the guest molecules propane and the host molecules water were accelerated and promoted except for proteins and carbohydrates as the main components of eps more et al 2014 some other complex macromolecules containing various functional groups with different ionization characteristics and electrophilic properties are commonly detected in sludge e g heteropolysaccharides such as alginate xanthan gellan and hyaluronic acid humic acid and fulvic acid more et al 2014 surfactant vesicant from industrial pollution source such as phospholipid sodium alkyl sulfate octadecanoic acid or bio surfactants rhamnolipid soberón chávez et al 2005 or small molecules peptide l cysteine or glutamate flemming and wingender 2010 in this study cyclic ether c o stretch strong peak at 1000 1300 cm 1 czaczyk and myszka 2007 sulfate group s o deformation vibration peaks at 1096 cm 1 1122 cm 1 and 1150 1250 cm 1 soberón chávez et al 2005 and aromatic groups 1465 cm 1 c c stretch in aromatic ring zhou et al 2016 were detected in raw sludge and soluble eps respectively fig 2b sulfate group or cyclic ether could be adsorbed on the surface of formed hydrates as a result by preventing or limiting the agglomeration of hydrate particles the hydrophilic hydrophobic groups of eps helped form a porous hydrate open structure that is able to pump the water by capillarity action ricaurte et al 2013 this process is similar to the hydrate formation process in water with sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and tetrahydrofuran thf lo et al 2010 salako et al 2012 zhang et al 2008 the porosity of formed hydrates could also enhance the gas liquid solid exchanges and allow obtaining a high water to hydrate conversion ratio even in quiescent conditions gayet et al 2005 zhang and lee 2013 the porous structure accumulated principally along the cold reactor walls which was also apparent and persisted long enough to be visualized through the reactor windows during the dewatering process fig 4 batch runs 5 and 6 in total it can be deduced that the nucleation effect and surfactant effect of sludge flocs jointly governed the hydrate formation in sewage sludge and led to the observed drop of equilibrium pressure compared with that in pure water 3 2 application potential of propane hydrate formation in enhanced dewatering of sewage sludge the application potential of propane hydrate formation in enhanced dewatering of sewage sludge was validated in terms of the water extraction capacity by propane under free conditioning conditions and also the visual hydrate sludge separation performance 3 2 1 water conversion efficiency of propane hydrate based dewatering the water conversion efficiency was investigated based on the water distribution between sludge and hydrate phase which would verify the water removal capacity of propane hydrate based dewatering under free conditioning conditions the propane amount in gas phase was determined by monitoring the partial pressure of propane and accordingly the amount of converted water and residual water in each batch run can be determined based on the propane consumption as well as the density of propane hydrates is lower than water the conversion of water into hydrates would lead to the volume compression of headspace for propane gas phase jr and koh 2008 the quantification of converted propane in each batch run was conducted with considering this volume reduction of the gas phase the end pressure of each batch run was recorded as shown in fig 3a in the first 14 batch runs the final pressure of propane were all measured to be 207 5 kpa and it took about 30 min to see the pressure drop from the initial pressure 448 5 kpa to the finally constant value but in batch run 15 the propane pressure only dropped from 448 kpa to 403 kpa even though the process lasted for 24 h the initial gas volume vi at the beginning of the batch run i should be equal to the final gas volume of batch run i 1 vi 1 2 the moles of converted propane δni ni ni pvi p vi rt2 where ni and ni are the initial and final moles of propane in batch run i respectively r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t2 is the experimental temperature 275 2 k p and p are the initial and the final pressure of propane in each batch run the mass of water converted into hydrates is calculated according to the stoichiometry ratio of the reaction shown in equation 1 therefore the mass of converted water in batch run i 3 δmi 17δni m h2o considering the volume expansion of non gas phase due to the formation of propane hydrates the final gas volume of batch run i 4 vi vi ni ni m propane hydrates ρ propane hydrates 17 m h2o ρ h2o where m propane hydrates and m h2o are the molar mass of propane hydrates 350 g mol the molar mass of water 18 g mol respectively ρ propane hydrates and ρ h2o are the density of propane hydrates typical value 0 8 g cm3 and water respectively after solving equations 2 and 4 simultaneously it can be calculated that 5 v i v i 1 p r t 2 m p r o p a n e h y d r a t e s ρ p r o p a n e h y d r a t e s 17 m h 2 o ρ h 2 o 1 p r t 2 m p r o p a n e h y d r a t e s ρ p r o p a n e h y d r a t e s 17 m h 2 o ρ h 2 o therefore based on equations 2 3 and 5 the amount of hydrated water after each batch run is also shown in fig 3a and table s1 of supplementary materials accordingly the first 14 batch runs totally converted 195 3 g water into propane hydrates according to the dewatering process described in section 2 4 in total 240 ml sludge samples containing 2 86 g dry solid was loaded into the reactor and excluding 195 3 g hydrated water and the water taken out by water sampling steps only 2 3 g water was residual in the sludge phase after 14 batch runs therefore the water content of the sludge sample was decreased to 44 3wt at the end of batch run 14 also the pressure drop or the amount of converted propane in 15th batch run just accorded with the residual water 2 3 g after the 14th batch run additionally after re pressurizing the reactor to 448 kpa in batch run 16 no obvious pressure drop was observed all these phenomenon indicated that the in situ formation of propane hydrate had the ability to realize the full conversion of water in sludge under free conditioning conditions in addition it is mentionable that the reduction of extracellular water substantially increased the osmotic pressure difference between cell inside and outside as a result cell swelling caused the cell lysis and further decreased the sludge water content by converting intracellular water into propane hydrates thus in depth removing water from sewage sludge based on propane hydrate formation is feasible 3 2 2 time resolved visual observations of separation performance in propane hydrate based dewatering the separation of formed propane hydrates and dewatered sludge was displayed in fig 4 the hydrate based dewatering process of sewage sludge is actually an extraction process the extract is water and the extractant is propane peng et al 2010 purwanto et al 2014 through injecting the extractant propane gas into sewage sludge under high pressure and low temperature conditions the propane hydrates formed and the propane gas captured water into the formed homogeneous propane hydrate crystals which effectively decreased the water content of sewage sludge therefore with the increasing amount of formed propane hydrates the volume of sludge was reduced and the propane hydrates sludge interface was observed to move down gradually furthermore most of the formed propane hydrates accumulated upon the sludge gas interface which indicated that the crystallization process mainly occurred at the interface between gas and liquid phase and the separation of hydrates and sludge could be realized spontaneously nevertheless after 88 7 g water nearly half of the original water content in the sludge sample was converted into the hydrate phase in the first 6 batch runs it could be observed that some formed hydrates mixed in the sludge that phenomenon may be due to a significant decrease in the fluidity of sludge samples with the decreased water content forster 2002 li and yang 2007 the substantially decreased fluidity had an adverse effect on the separation of hydrates from sludge however the re injections of raw sludge at the end of batch run 3 6 9 and 12 were effective to force the floatation of hydrates by offering the local fluidity state in the sludge phase which was also especially verified by the improvement of hydrate and sludge separation in batch run 10 compared with batch run 9 also blowing propane into the sludge phase before each batch run may take effect in enhancing the separation in addition along with the attraction of the hydrogen bond during the formation of hydrates the fact that these strong bonds separating the water molecules rigidly causes the solid density to be less than that of the liquid in ice only 34 of the volume is occupied by water molecules in contrast to the 37 volume occupation by water molecules in liquid water this explains the unusual property of a decrease in density upon freezing and accounts for the tendency that the formed propane hydrates would float up from the sludge phase jr and koh 2008 based on all the above phenomenon 3 3 potential of propane hydrate based dewatering for implementing the green operation of wwtps 3 3 1 clean water discharge the hydrated water was sampled by the decomposition of formed propane hydrates after batch runs 3 6 9 and 12 the results of water quality analysis are listed in table 1 since the sludge sample was collected from the pre anaerobic tank for the subsequent anaerobic digestion process the hydrolysis of proteins and polysaccharides in sludge and the solubilization of the sludge solid phase led to an increase of soluble organic fractions in the liquid phase as a result the quality parameters of the supernatant from 30 min settling far exceeded the chinese emission limits on the contrary the three main contamination indices cod tn and tp of all the hydrated water samples met level i b of the chinese national standard for the effluent of wwtps and the hydrated water qualities of batch runs 6 9 and 12 met level i a of the discharge standard instead of the national uniform standard wwtps in united states and european countries adopt a wide range of standard limits according to the environmental capacity of corresponding receiving water bodies but the quality of hydrated water in this study also accorded with the typical effluent quality of wwtps in united states and european countries therefore it can be said that the water produced from the decomposition of propane hydrates can be discharged directly without further treatments which also reflected an excellent separation performance in hydrate based dewatering process the water decomposed from the formed hydrates should be pure water theoretically but as mentioned in section 3 1 due to the hydrophilicity of protein or heteropolyssacharides of eps these macromolecules could absorb on the hydrate particles and lead to the mixing of sludge components and formed hydrates ricaurte et al 2013 during propane hydrate formation the hydrate particles would gradually agglomerate to form a homogeneous hydrate phase and the fine sludge particles would be excluded peng et al 2010 it can be seen form fig 4 that compared with batch runs 5 or 6 less sludge agglomerates or visible pores can be identified in the hydrates at batch runs 11 14 and 15 with a prolonged dewatering process the hydrates tended to be a continuously homogeneous phase without sludge compositions involved instead of discrete hydrate particles thus the qualities of the hydrated water tended to be better 3 3 2 advantages in energy consumption the energy consumption of unit operation in propane hydrate based dewatering was analyzed to evaluate the potential energetic advantages and the application feasibility of this newly developed technology in order to make the calculation comparable with the existing energy consumption data of the widely used mechanical dewatering thermal drying process the energy consumption analysis should be conducted based on an engineering scale application instead of the bench scale experiment therefore a continuously operated propane hydrate based dewatering system was designed as shown in figure s1 of supplementary materials the total reactor volume is set as 6 m3 which can be used for decreasing the water content of 2 4 t sewage sludge from 95wt to 40wt the total occupation area of this system is 25 30 m2 which is smaller than that of the frame press dewatering equipment with similar treatment capacity qasim 2017 the detailed continuous operation mode for water extraction propane recycling and separation of formed hydrates and dewatered sludge are elaborated in text s2 of supplementary materials the corresponding energy consumption analysis based on the continuous operation mode is presented as following because the energy consumption for sludge and gas pumping transfer should depend on the specific layout of process units therefore the basic energy consumption of unit operation can be generally divided into the following four parts 1 heat released from the exothermic reaction 2 energy for feedstock cooling q cooling and 3 energy for gas compression w compression 4 energy loss during the cooling process e loss and can be written as 6 e consumption δh n consumed c3h8 q cooling w compression e loss where δh is the enthalpy change of the propane hydrate formation 126 kj mol gas jr and koh 2008 n consumed c3h8 7189 54 mol is the mole of consumed propane for decreasing the water content of 2 4 t sewage sludge from 95wt to 40wt q

system 275 2 k t ambient temperature is the ambient temperature 298 2 k m sludge is the mass of input sludge 2400 kg n c3h8 is the total molar amount of consumed propane and residual propane at the end of dewatering process according to the operation mode described in text s2 of supplementary materials the head space volume for residual propane at the equilibrium point of the final batch

reactor is the total volume of the reactor 6 m3 the gas compression is generally divided into the compressions of consumed propane n consumed c3h8 7189 54 mol and also residual propane n residual c3h8 271 4 mol at the end point of dewatering process the sludge input process and the pumping of propane by gas compression pump jointly realize the gas compression which can be both conducted at a constant temperature therefore the gas pressure during the gas compression process can be expressed as 9 p n c3h8 rt2 v accordingly the energy for gas compression w compression can be written as 10 w c o m p r e s s i o n v v n c 3 h 8 r t 2 v d v where v and v are the propane volumes before and after compression v n c3h8 rt2 p equilibrium 11 7460 94 mol 8 314 j mol k 275 2 k 207000 pa 82 5 m3 v n

determines the requirement on the temperature of cold bath the temperature difference between cold bath and ambient environment further determines the energy loss during the cooling process therefore the cooling time requirement on the input sludge should be used to determine the cooling rate and expressed as following 14 q sludge q1 a1 t c sludge 2 4 t t ambient temperature t2 where t is the expected cooling time of input sludge q1 and a1 are the density of heat flow rate and the heat exchange area for sludge respectively 15 a1 2 4 t ρ sludge π d2 4 4 8 m2 16 q1 q sludge a1 t 17 q1 λ1 t2

bath container respectively for the cold bath container covered by the thermal insulation material silica aerogel λ2 0 018 w m k wang et al 2009a zeng et al 1995 d2 0 3 m accordingly the power required for compensating the heat loss from the cold bath is 20 p refrigerating heat loss q2 a2 where a2 is the area for the heat exchange between cold bath and outer environment 21 a2 h cold bath container l cold bath container 2 h cold bath container w cold bath container 2 2 l cold bath container w cold bath container 115 32 m2 where h cold bath container l cold bath container and w cold bath container are the height 6 5 m length 3 8 m and width 3 2 m of the cold bath container respectively without modifying the properties of liquid phase by additives the rate of hydrate formation mainly depends on the stirring status or the gas liquid contact area bergeron and servio 2008 jr and koh 2008 lee et al 2007 veluswamy et al 2015 in the reactor designed for the continuous operation mode the unit propane sludge interface area was 397 89 kg sludge m2 which is even 4 times larger than that of lab scale experiment 101 86 kg sludge m2 therefore the batch reaction time of propane hydrate generation in continuous operation mode can be 1 4 of that in the lab scale experiment according to section 3 2 1 and text s2 of supplementary materials each batch run took up to 30 min 1800 s to reach equilibrium at lab scale and the dewatering of 2 4 t sludge needs less than 23 complete batch reaction in the continuous operation mode thus considering the most unfavorable conditions the heat loss during dewatering process can be calculated as following e loss p refrigerating heat loss 12t 450 s 23 22 λ2 t ambient temperature t2 q sludge d1 λ1a1 t d2 a2 12t 10350 s the minimal value of e loss can be reached when d e loss d t 0 w 23 therefore t is calculated to be 471 7 s accordingly the temperature of cold bath t1 is determined as 262 6 k by equation 18 and e loss should be 34177 66 j the total energy for 2 4 t sludge in the dewatering stage can be quantified as e consumption δh n consumed c3h8 q cooling w compression e loss 24 9 06 108 j 2 36 108 j 1 32 107 j 34177 66 j 1 16 109 j therefore the unit energy consumption can be normalized to e unit consumption dewatering stage e consumption 0 12 t ds of sewage sludge 25 2673 96 kw h t ds of sewage sludge according to the previous literatures bennamoun et al 2013 kim and parker 2008 the total energy consumption in unit operations of sludge conditioning mechanical dewatering and thermal drying is in the range of 4000 4500 kw h t ds of sewage sludge to realize the final water content of 40wt which is much higher than that of propane hydrate based dewatering therefore it can be concluded that propane hydrate based dewatering shows the obvious advantage in the total energy consumption relevant to sludge dewatering process furthermore it is mentionable that the construction cost and operation precision requirement of hydrate based dewatering probably increase the difficulties of engineering scale operation but its advantages in the secondary pollution reduction and energy saving could be beneficial for meeting the increasingly stringent environmental standards 4 conclusion the application potential of propane hydrate formation in the free conditioning dewatering of sewage sludge was analyzed in this study for the first time the constructed phase diagram of propane hydrates in sewage sludge indicated that the organic components in sludge may promote hydrate formation in terms of decreasing the equilibrium pressure by 12 1 19 2 of that in pure water the analysis on water conversion efficiency suggested that 14 batch runs decreased the water content of sludge from 98 81wt to 44 3wt under free conditioning conditions and the time resolved visual observations of propane hydrate formation in sludge showed that the formed hydrate phase could be well separated from the sludge phase and led to a substantial concentration of solid phase in sludge as expected the quality of hydrate extracted water accorded with the typical quality parameters of wwtps effluent which further reflected an excellent separation performance in hydrate based dewatering process and also indicated that the water from decomposition of up floated hydrates could be directly discharged without further treatments the unit energy consumption based on the developed continuous operation mode is 2673 96 kw h t ds of sewage sludge which is much lower than that of mechanical dewatering thermal drying process therefore it can be concluded that the propane hydrate based dewatering process exhibits the obvious advantage in the total energy and resource consumption relevant to sludge dewatering process and provides novel insights into the sustainable development of biological wastewater treatments through highly efficient sludge pretreatment declarations of interest none acknowledgement this study was

19320,the propane hydrate formation was proposed to have potentials in realizing free conditioning dewatering of sewage sludge with implications to simultaneous clean water extraction and highly efficient volume reduction primarily the investigation on phase equilibrium of propane hydrates found that the organic components of sewage sludge promoted the propane hydrate formation in terms of decreasing equilibrium pressure by up to 19 2 compared with that in pure water further the feasibility of hydrate based dewatering was verified through the observation of propane hydrate formation in sewage sludge and also the quality analysis of water generated from decomposition of up floated formed hydrates the formation of up floated propane hydrates extracted water molecules from sewage sludge into homogeneous crystal phase which actually excluded sludge particles from hydrate phase and realized the reduction of water in sludge phase the efficiency of water conversion into hydrates was determined by monitoring propane pressure which indicated that 14 batch runs decreased the water content of sludge from 98 81wt to 44 3wt under free conditioning conditions the chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen and total phosphorus of hydrate extracted water were measured to be 21 1 mg l 10 5 0 2 mg l and 0 4 0 mg l respectively which reflected the excellent separation performance and also indicated that the hydrate extracted water can be directly discharged without further treatments finally the unit energy consumption of hydrate based dewatering process based on a continuous operation mode was calculated to be 2673 96 kw h t dry solid of sewage sludge which was nearly half of that in thermal drying process therefore the propane hydrate based process is believed to maximize the green operation of enhanced sludge dewatering while minimizing the energy and additional material consumption graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage sludge propane hydrate dewatering solid liquid separation 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment is a core technology for water resource protection and reuse as is clearly demonstrated by its successful implementation in many countries worldwide bruus et al 1992 but sewage sludge an inevitable by product of biological wastewater treatment containing various toxic substances such as pathogens heavy metals and some organic contaminants is of concern to sustainable development of biological wastewater treatments feng et al 2015 the appropriate handling of sludge could reduce secondary pollution decrease operation costs and even recovery energy wu et al 2016 thus the safe and efficient utilization or disposal of sludge are crucial for the role of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in environmental quality improvement the energy utilization remains as one of the most attractive ways for sludge disposal due to the effective volume reduction potential contaminant destruction or energy recovery instead of input anaerobic digestion and hydrothermal liquefaction have both been documented as appropriate processes for energy conversion from sewage sludge joo et al 2016 wang et al 2018 however these two approaches can only convert about 20 35 of total organics into energy enriched products methane or bio crude nazari et al 2017 as a result the final disposals of residues and produced wastewater containing high strength of nitrogen and phosphorus are still needed to be further addressed shen et al 2015 therefore compared with the above two processes some potential advantages of incineration pyrolysis and gasification of sludge may stand out because these treatments can rapidly maximize the energy conversion of organic components and also minimize the final residues cao and pawłowski 2012 but the feedstock dewatering or drying is the essential pretreatment steps christensen et al 2015 wang et al 2017 due to the colloid stability of highly hydrated microbial aggregation it is generally difficult to dewater sludge without conditioning operations polyacrylamide pam polyferric chloride polymeric aluminum chloride pacl lime and some advanced oxidation processes aops reagents represented by fenton fenton like reagents feng et al 2015 fe ii activated persulfate zhen et al 2013 thermal iron activated peroxymonosulfate pms li et al 2018 and peroxydisulfate pds kim et al 2016 li et al 2016 have been widely reported as conditioning reagents in combination with a mechanical press to enhance the release of interstitial or intracellular water from sludge flocs christensen et al 2015 however the introduction of chlorine with conventional conditioning reagents would trigger a risk of forming dioxin or equipment corrosion in the subsequent thermochemical process lin et al 2015 in addition the dosage of these conditioning reagents is up to the range of 50 100 mg g dry solid ds which causes the substantial volume increase and calorific value reduction of dewatered sludge wu et al 2016 xia et al 2014 in order to minimize the negative effects of conditioning reagent addition alkaline hydrothermal pretreatment wang et al 2017 yu et al 2014 and electrolysis zhen et al 2013 were also associated with drying technologies and electro dewatering processes mahmoud et al 2011 respectively however these processes usually cause the serious lysis of sludge flocs and substantially increase pollutant concentration in the liquid phase of pretreated sludge hu et al 2016 as a result the wastewater produced from the dewatering units contains high strength nitrogen and phosphorus and should be recycled back to the influent of wwtps for further treatment which will require extra aeration and carbon source to achieve enhanced biological nutrient removal hu et al 2016 therefore the realization of free conditioning and efficient dewatering process with simultaneous clean water extraction can avoid the dependence on conditioning reagents of conventional solid liquid processes eliminate the potential secondary pollution and also minimize the caloric value decrease of dewatered sludge for better closed circuit energy recycle clathrate hydrates called hydrates from hereon are ice like inclusion compounds formed typically at moderately high pressure a few megapascals and low temperatures a few degrees above 273 15 k by combination of water host molecules and small molecules guest molecules such as nitrogen methane carbon dioxide propane tetrahydrofuran and cyclopentane jr and koh 2008 in hydrates cages of hydrogen bonded water molecules are occupied by small guest molecule s in other words it is feasible that due to the strong affinity to guest molecules water molecules could be extracted from sludge by forming hydrate cages through adding small guest molecules at conducive conditions because the equilibrium pressure of propane hydrates is relatively lower than those of other common guest molecules of clathrate hydrates such as methane ethane and carbon dioxide this study is aimed at exploring the potential of using propane as a water extractant to achieve enhanced dewatering of sludge the main features of propane hydrate based dewatering approach are as follows 1 propane exists as a gas at room temperature and ambient pressure it has a strong affinity to force water molecules to form cages resulting in facile formation of hydrates under 170 530 kpa and at temperatures of 273 15 278 15 k this can be also verified by using the molar gibbs free energy of 214 3 kj mol at 278 15k for the following reaction jr and koh 2008 1 c3h8 17h2o c3h8 17h2o 2 the continuous and dense propane hydrate formation mainly takes place on the gas liquid interface exchange for extracting water and the formed hydrates floas up to the sludge surface due to its lower density about 0 7 0 8 cm3 g than water jr and koh 2008 3 after the quick downward discharge of dewatered sludge propane hydrates are also gradually decomposed by depressurization and the released propane can be collected for direct multiple recycles or indirect reuse after easily purified through pressurized liquefaction which avoids the resource consumption caused by the conventional unrenewable conditioning reagents 4 the deeply dewatered sludge can be subsequently utilized as solid fuel for energy recovery therefore the in situ propane hydrate formation is believed to be a potential way of providing the incineration pyrolysis or gasification feedstock without external addition of pretreatment reagents it should also have a significant prospect in eliminating the negative impacts of conventional conditioning methods and maximizing the implementation of green operation for wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewage sludge and extracellular polymeric substances eps analysis sewage sludge samples were obtained from a wastewater treatment plant located in northport ny usa that uses an anaerobic anoxia aerobic a2 o process and has a design capacity of 1500 m3

infrared spectroscopy ft ir nicolet 5700 thermo fisher scientific ma usa analysis wang et al 2009b were referred to the previous studies 2 2 set up and instruments 2 2 1 tube reactor in order to accurately control and monitor the temperature and gas pressure the phase diagram of propane hydrates in sewage sludge was determined by a small volume tube reactor with high precision chiller the high pressure cell was fabricated from a 304 stainless steel tube 9 mm internal diameter total volume 10 cm3 as shown in fig 1 a the bottom of the tube could be plugged or used to insert a thermocouple the top was connected to a stainless steel quick connect for loading the sample a safety three way relief valve was employed to release pressure from the system at any time during the experiment the appropriate temperature for propane hydrate formation was maintained by a chiller julabo co ltd germany filled with ethylene glycol the chiller was fitted with a high precision temperature control system and the estimated error of temperature measurement was 0 01 k the fluctuation of the temperature control was 0 03 k pressure value was recorded with a pressure transducer omega engineering inc usa and the estimated error was 5 kpa 2 2 2 windowed reactor a reactor fitted with see through windows 30 cm high 1 5 cm wide along the reactor length on opposite sides was used for the propane hydrate based dewatering because it was ideal to observe the separation of hydrate and sludge phases during the propane hydrate formation fig 1b the height and inner diameter were 34 cm and 5 cm respectively the total reactor volume was about 667 ml a water bath was used to maintain the appropriate temperature a pressure transducer omega engineering inc usa measurement accuracy 5 kpa and thermocouple extech instruments inc usa measurement accuracy 0 1 k were installed at the top and bottom of the windowed reactor respectively ethylene glycol was used as coolant and pumped by the chiller thermo electron corporation usa into the cooling tube which was submerged in the water bath to maintain the reaction system at a desired temperature 275 2 0 5 k 2 3 determining phase diagram of propane hydrates formed in sewage sludge the simulated prediction of equilibrium conditions for propane hydrates in pure water was conducted using the csmhyd program developed by colorado school of mines golden co usa http hydrates mines edu chr software html the commonly used pressure search method was modified to determine the incipience of propane hydrate formation in sewage sludge peng et al 2010 and detailed in text s1 of supplementary materials 2 4 dewatering process of sewage sludge by propane hydrate formation 2 4 1 typical procedures for hydrate based sludge dewatering and hydrated water sampling in order to visualize the separation performance of propane hydrates from sludge the dewatering process was conducted in the windowed reactor described in section 2 2 2 the reactor with 200 ml sludge sample in it was cooled till it reached a temperature of 275 2 0 5 k and then the temperature was maintained during the dewatering process 40 ml hydrated water was sampled for water quality analysis but 40 ml raw sludge was also injected to make the headspace volume for the propane gas unchanged with the water sampling the detailed steps for hydrate based sludge dewatering and hydrated water sampling can be found in text s2 of supplementary materials 2 4 2 hydrated water quality analysis the chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp of the water samples from the hydrate based dewatering process and the supernatant from 30 min settling of raw sludge in a 1 l cylinder were measured using the hach method hach company usa in duplicate in order to evaluate whether the hydrated water can be discharged directly or not the measured results were compared with the chinese national standard for the effluent of wwtps chinese ministry of environmental protection 2002 and also the typical effluent qualities of wwtps in united states and europe 3 results and discussion 3 1 phase diagram of propane hydrates in sewage sludge the phase diagram is a useful tool for choosing the appropriate temperature for the hydrate based dewatering of sludge considering operation feasibility and energy consumption from fig 2 a it can be seen that the presence of sludge flocs promoted the formation of propane hydrates the equilibrium pressure of propane hydrates in sewage sludge was measured to be lower than its theoretical value in pure water the sludge flocs were composed of cell aggregations and the surrounding eps sponza 2002 ft ir spectra shown in fig 2b verified the presence of carboxyl groups 1690 1750 cm 1 c o stretch of carboxylic acids hydroxyl group 3200 3500 cm 1 h bonded o h stretch and ammonia groups 1580 1650 cm 1 n h bend of amine of eps due to these highly hydrophilic functional groups a large amount of interstitial water and interfacial water were bound in the fine pores of the porous and net like sludge flocs as discontinuously distributed phase li and yang 2007 neyens et al 2004 tsang and vesilind 1990 as a result expect for the interface between propane and sludge phase numbers of micro scale gas liquid exchange interfaces in sludge flocs may also exist once the propane gas was charged into the tube reactor at the appropriate temperature of 273 15 277 15 k the water trapped in sludge flocs could be converted into dispersed hydrates particles when these first hydrates particles were formed surrounding sludge floc particles the organic macromolecules in sludge flocs may continuously confer anti agglomeration properties to those hydrate particles therefore the presence of sludge particles actually acted as nucleation sites prevented the agglomeration of formed hydrates and provided more possibilities for the gas liquid exchanges ricaurte et al 2013 as a consequence the crystallization reactions among the guest molecules propane and the host molecules water were accelerated and promoted except for proteins and carbohydrates as the main components of eps more et al 2014 some other complex macromolecules containing various functional groups with different ionization characteristics and electrophilic properties are commonly detected in sludge e g heteropolysaccharides such as alginate xanthan gellan and hyaluronic acid humic acid and fulvic acid more et al 2014 surfactant vesicant from industrial pollution source such as phospholipid sodium alkyl sulfate octadecanoic acid or bio surfactants rhamnolipid soberón chávez et al 2005 or small molecules peptide l cysteine or glutamate flemming and wingender 2010 in this study cyclic ether c o stretch strong peak at 1000 1300 cm 1 czaczyk and myszka 2007 sulfate group s o deformation vibration peaks at 1096 cm 1 1122 cm 1 and 1150 1250 cm 1 soberón chávez et al 2005 and aromatic groups 1465 cm 1 c c stretch in aromatic ring zhou et al 2016 were detected in raw sludge and soluble eps respectively fig 2b sulfate group or cyclic ether could be adsorbed on the surface of formed hydrates as a result by preventing or limiting the agglomeration of hydrate particles the hydrophilic hydrophobic groups of eps helped form a porous hydrate open structure that is able to pump the water by capillarity action ricaurte et al 2013 this process is similar to the hydrate formation process in water with sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and tetrahydrofuran thf lo et al 2010 salako et al 2012 zhang et al 2008 the porosity of formed hydrates could also enhance the gas liquid solid exchanges and allow obtaining a high water to hydrate conversion ratio even in quiescent conditions gayet et al 2005 zhang and lee 2013 the porous structure accumulated principally along the cold reactor walls which was also apparent and persisted long enough to be visualized through the reactor windows during the dewatering process fig 4 batch runs 5 and 6 in total it can be deduced that the nucleation effect and surfactant effect of sludge flocs jointly governed the hydrate formation in sewage sludge and led to the observed drop of equilibrium pressure compared with that in pure water 3 2 application potential of propane hydrate formation in enhanced dewatering of sewage sludge the application potential of propane hydrate formation in enhanced dewatering of sewage sludge was validated in terms of the water extraction capacity by propane under free conditioning conditions and also the visual hydrate sludge separation performance 3 2 1 water conversion efficiency of propane hydrate based dewatering the water conversion efficiency was investigated based on the water distribution between sludge and hydrate phase which would verify the water removal capacity of propane hydrate based dewatering under free conditioning conditions the propane amount in gas phase was determined by monitoring the partial pressure of propane and accordingly the amount of converted water and residual water in each batch run can be determined based on the propane consumption as well as the density of propane hydrates is lower than water the conversion of water into hydrates would lead to the volume compression of headspace for propane gas phase jr and koh 2008 the quantification of converted propane in each batch run was conducted with considering this volume reduction of the gas phase the end pressure of each batch run was recorded as shown in fig 3a in the first 14 batch runs the final pressure of propane were all measured to be 207 5 kpa and it took about 30 min to see the pressure drop from the initial pressure 448 5 kpa to the finally constant value but in batch run 15 the propane pressure only dropped from 448 kpa to 403 kpa even though the process lasted for 24 h the initial gas volume vi at the beginning of the batch run i should be equal to the final gas volume of batch run i 1 vi 1 2 the moles of converted propane δni ni ni pvi p vi rt2 where ni and ni are the initial and final moles of propane in batch run i respectively r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t2 is the experimental temperature 275 2 k p and p are the initial and the final pressure of propane in each batch run the mass of water converted into hydrates is calculated according to the stoichiometry ratio of the reaction shown in equation 1 therefore the mass of converted water in batch run i 3 δmi 17δni m h2o considering the volume expansion of non gas phase due to the formation of propane hydrates the final gas volume of batch run i 4 vi vi ni ni m propane hydrates ρ propane hydrates 17 m h2o ρ h2o where m propane hydrates and m h2o are the molar mass of propane hydrates 350 g mol the molar mass of water 18 g mol respectively ρ propane hydrates and ρ h2o are the density of propane hydrates typical value 0 8 g cm3 and water respectively after solving equations 2 and 4 simultaneously it can be calculated that 5 v i v i 1 p r t 2 m p r o p a n e h y d r a t e s ρ p r o p a n e h y d r a t e s 17 m h 2 o ρ h 2 o 1 p r t 2 m p r o p a n e h y d r a t e s ρ p r o p a n e h y d r a t e s 17 m h 2 o ρ h 2 o therefore based on equations 2 3 and 5 the amount of hydrated water after each batch run is also shown in fig 3a and table s1 of supplementary materials accordingly the first 14 batch runs totally converted 195 3 g water into propane hydrates according to the dewatering process described in section 2 4 in total 240 ml sludge samples containing 2 86 g dry solid was loaded into the reactor and excluding 195 3 g hydrated water and the water taken out by water sampling steps only 2 3 g water was residual in the sludge phase after 14 batch runs therefore the water content of the sludge sample was decreased to 44 3wt at the end of batch run 14 also the pressure drop or the amount of converted propane in 15th batch run just accorded with the residual water 2 3 g after the 14th batch run additionally after re pressurizing the reactor to 448 kpa in batch run 16 no obvious pressure drop was observed all these phenomenon indicated that the in situ formation of propane hydrate had the ability to realize the full conversion of water in sludge under free conditioning conditions in addition it is mentionable that the reduction of extracellular water substantially increased the osmotic pressure difference between cell inside and outside as a result cell swelling caused the cell lysis and further decreased the sludge water content by converting intracellular water into propane hydrates thus in depth removing water from sewage sludge based on propane hydrate formation is feasible 3 2 2 time resolved visual observations of separation performance in propane hydrate based dewatering the separation of formed propane hydrates and dewatered sludge was displayed in fig 4 the hydrate based dewatering process of sewage sludge is actually an extraction process the extract is water and the extractant is propane peng et al 2010 purwanto et al 2014 through injecting the extractant propane gas into sewage sludge under high pressure and low temperature conditions the propane hydrates formed and the propane gas captured water into the formed homogeneous propane hydrate crystals which effectively decreased the water content of sewage sludge therefore with the increasing amount of formed propane hydrates the volume of sludge was reduced and the propane hydrates sludge interface was observed to move down gradually furthermore most of the formed propane hydrates accumulated upon the sludge gas interface which indicated that the crystallization process mainly occurred at the interface between gas and liquid phase and the separation of hydrates and sludge could be realized spontaneously nevertheless after 88 7 g water nearly half of the original water content in the sludge sample was converted into the hydrate phase in the first 6 batch runs it could be observed that some formed hydrates mixed in the sludge that phenomenon may be due to a significant decrease in the fluidity of sludge samples with the decreased water content forster 2002 li and yang 2007 the substantially decreased fluidity had an adverse effect on the separation of hydrates from sludge however the re injections of raw sludge at the end of batch run 3 6 9 and 12 were effective to force the floatation of hydrates by offering the local fluidity state in the sludge phase which was also especially verified by the improvement of hydrate and sludge separation in batch run 10 compared with batch run 9 also blowing propane into the sludge phase before each batch run may take effect in enhancing the separation in addition along with the attraction of the hydrogen bond during the formation of hydrates the fact that these strong bonds separating the water molecules rigidly causes the solid density to be less than that of the liquid in ice only 34 of the volume is occupied by water molecules in contrast to the 37 volume occupation by water molecules in liquid water this explains the unusual property of a decrease in density upon freezing and accounts for the tendency that the formed propane hydrates would float up from the sludge phase jr and koh 2008 based on all the above phenomenon 3 3 potential of propane hydrate based dewatering for implementing the green operation of wwtps 3 3 1 clean water discharge the hydrated water was sampled by the decomposition of formed propane hydrates after batch runs 3 6 9 and 12 the results of water quality analysis are listed in table 1 since the sludge sample was collected from the pre anaerobic tank for the subsequent anaerobic digestion process the hydrolysis of proteins and polysaccharides in sludge and the solubilization of the sludge solid phase led to an increase of soluble organic fractions in the liquid phase as a result the quality parameters of the supernatant from 30 min settling far exceeded the chinese emission limits on the contrary the three main contamination indices cod tn and tp of all the hydrated water samples met level i b of the chinese national standard for the effluent of wwtps and the hydrated water qualities of batch runs 6 9 and 12 met level i a of the discharge standard instead of the national uniform standard wwtps in united states and european countries adopt a wide range of standard limits according to the environmental capacity of corresponding receiving water bodies but the quality of hydrated water in this study also accorded with the typical effluent quality of wwtps in united states and european countries therefore it can be said that the water produced from the decomposition of propane hydrates can be discharged directly without further treatments which also reflected an excellent separation performance in hydrate based dewatering process the water decomposed from the formed hydrates should be pure water theoretically but as mentioned in section 3 1 due to the hydrophilicity of protein or heteropolyssacharides of eps these macromolecules could absorb on the hydrate particles and lead to the mixing of sludge components and formed hydrates ricaurte et al 2013 during propane hydrate formation the hydrate particles would gradually agglomerate to form a homogeneous hydrate phase and the fine sludge particles would be excluded peng et al 2010 it can be seen form fig 4 that compared with batch runs 5 or 6 less sludge agglomerates or visible pores can be identified in the hydrates at batch runs 11 14 and 15 with a prolonged dewatering process the hydrates tended to be a continuously homogeneous phase without sludge compositions involved instead of discrete hydrate particles thus the qualities of the hydrated water tended to be better 3 3 2 advantages in energy consumption the energy consumption of unit operation in propane hydrate based dewatering was analyzed to evaluate the potential energetic advantages and the application feasibility of this newly developed technology in order to make the calculation comparable with the existing energy consumption data of the widely used mechanical dewatering thermal drying process the energy consumption analysis should be conducted based on an engineering scale application instead of the bench scale experiment therefore a continuously operated propane hydrate based dewatering system was designed as shown in figure s1 of supplementary materials the total reactor volume is set as 6 m3 which can be used for decreasing the water content of 2 4 t sewage sludge from 95wt to 40wt the total occupation area of this system is 25 30 m2 which is smaller than that of the frame press dewatering equipment with similar treatment capacity qasim 2017 the detailed continuous operation mode for water extraction propane recycling and separation of formed hydrates and dewatered sludge are elaborated in text s2 of supplementary materials the corresponding energy consumption analysis based on the continuous operation mode is presented as following because the energy consumption for sludge and gas pumping transfer should depend on the specific layout of process units therefore the basic energy consumption of unit operation can be generally divided into the following four parts 1 heat released from the exothermic reaction 2 energy for feedstock cooling q cooling and 3 energy for gas compression w compression 4 energy loss during the cooling process e loss and can be written as 6 e consumption δh n consumed c3h8 q cooling w compression e loss where δh is the enthalpy change of the propane hydrate formation 126 kj mol gas jr and koh 2008 n consumed c3h8 7189 54 mol is the mole of consumed propane for decreasing the water content of 2 4 t sewage sludge from 95wt to 40wt q

system 275 2 k t ambient temperature is the ambient temperature 298 2 k m sludge is the mass of input sludge 2400 kg n c3h8 is the total molar amount of consumed propane and residual propane at the end of dewatering process according to the operation mode described in text s2 of supplementary materials the head space volume for residual propane at the equilibrium point of the final batch

reactor is the total volume of the reactor 6 m3 the gas compression is generally divided into the compressions of consumed propane n consumed c3h8 7189 54 mol and also residual propane n residual c3h8 271 4 mol at the end point of dewatering process the sludge input process and the pumping of propane by gas compression pump jointly realize the gas compression which can be both conducted at a constant temperature therefore the gas pressure during the gas compression process can be expressed as 9 p n c3h8 rt2 v accordingly the energy for gas compression w compression can be written as 10 w c o m p r e s s i o n v v n c 3 h 8 r t 2 v d v where v and v are the propane volumes before and after compression v n c3h8 rt2 p equilibrium 11 7460 94 mol 8 314 j mol k 275 2 k 207000 pa 82 5 m3 v n

determines the requirement on the temperature of cold bath the temperature difference between cold bath and ambient environment further determines the energy loss during the cooling process therefore the cooling time requirement on the input sludge should be used to determine the cooling rate and expressed as following 14 q sludge q1 a1 t c sludge 2 4 t t ambient temperature t2 where t is the expected cooling time of input sludge q1 and a1 are the density of heat flow rate and the heat exchange area for sludge respectively 15 a1 2 4 t ρ sludge π d2 4 4 8 m2 16 q1 q sludge a1 t 17 q1 λ1 t2

required for compensating the heat loss from the cold bath is 20 p refrigerating heat loss q2 a2 where a2 is the area for the heat exchange between cold bath and outer environment 21 a2 h cold bath

bath container are the height 6 5 m length 3 8 m and width 3 2 m of the cold bath container respectively without modifying the properties of liquid phase by additives the rate of hydrate formation mainly depends on the stirring status or the gas liquid contact area bergeron and servio 2008 jr and koh 2008 lee et al 2007 veluswamy et al 2015 in the reactor designed for the continuous operation mode the unit propane sludge interface area was 397 89 kg sludge m2 which is even 4 times larger than that of lab scale experiment 101 86 kg sludge m2 therefore the batch reaction time of propane hydrate generation in continuous operation mode can be 1 4 of that in the lab scale experiment according to section 3 2 1 and text s2 of supplementary materials each batch run took up to 30 min 1800 s to reach equilibrium at lab scale and the dewatering of 2 4 t sludge needs less than 23 complete batch reaction in the continuous operation mode thus considering the most unfavorable conditions the heat loss during dewatering process can be calculated as following e loss p refrigerating heat loss 12t 450 s 23 22 λ2 t ambient temperature t2 q sludge d1 λ1a1 t d2 a2 12t 10350 s the minimal value of e loss can be reached when d e loss d t 0 w 23 therefore t is calculated to be 471 7 s accordingly the temperature of cold bath t1 is determined as 262 6 k by equation 18 and e loss should be 34177

109 j therefore the unit energy consumption can be normalized to e unit consumption dewatering stage e consumption 0 12 t ds of sewage sludge 25 2673 96 kw h t ds of sewage sludge according to the previous literatures bennamoun et al 2013 kim and parker 2008 the total energy consumption in unit operations of sludge conditioning mechanical dewatering and thermal drying is in the range of 4000 4500 kw h t ds of sewage sludge to realize the final water content of 40wt which is much higher than that of propane hydrate based dewatering therefore it can be concluded that propane hydrate based dewatering shows the obvious advantage in the total energy consumption relevant to sludge dewatering process furthermore it is mentionable that the construction cost and operation precision requirement of hydrate based dewatering probably increase the difficulties of engineering scale operation but its advantages in the secondary pollution reduction and energy saving could be beneficial for meeting the increasingly stringent environmental standards 4 conclusion the application potential of propane hydrate formation in the free conditioning dewatering of sewage sludge was analyzed in this study for the first time the constructed phase diagram of propane hydrates in sewage sludge indicated that the organic components in sludge may promote hydrate formation in terms of decreasing the equilibrium pressure by 12 1 19 2 of that in pure water the analysis on water conversion efficiency suggested that 14 batch runs decreased the water content of sludge from 98 81wt to 44 3wt under free conditioning conditions and the time resolved visual observations of propane hydrate formation in sludge showed that the formed hydrate phase could be well separated from the sludge phase and led to a substantial concentration of solid phase in sludge as expected the quality of hydrate extracted water accorded with the typical quality parameters of wwtps effluent which further reflected an excellent separation performance in hydrate based dewatering process and also indicated that the water from decomposition of up floated hydrates could be directly discharged without further treatments the unit energy consumption based on the developed continuous operation mode is 2673 96 kw h t ds of sewage sludge which is much lower than that of mechanical dewatering thermal drying process therefore it can be concluded that the propane hydrate based dewatering process exhibits the obvious advantage in the total energy and resource consumption relevant to sludge dewatering process and provides novel insights into the sustainable development of biological wastewater treatments through highly efficient sludge pretreatment declarations of interest none acknowledgement this study was

19321,in this study we comparatively investigated the degradation of 12 trace organic chemicals torcs during uv h2o2 and uv peroxydisulfate pds processes second order rate constants for the reactions of iopromide phenytoin caffeine benzotriazole and primidone with sulfate radical so4 were determined for the first time experiments were conducted in buffered pure water and wastewater effluent with spiked torcs uv pds degraded all torcs more efficiently than uv h2o2 in buffered pure water due to the higher yield of so4 than that of hydroxyl radical oh at the same initial molar dose of pds and h2o2 respectively uv pds showed higher selectivity toward torcs removal than uv h2o2 in wastewater effluent compounds with electron rich moieties such as diclofenac venlafaxine and metoprolol were eliminated faster in uv pds whereas uv h2o2 was more efficient in degrading compounds with lower reactivity to so4 the fluence based rate constants k o b s u v h 2 o 2 of torcs in wastewater effluent linearly increased as a function of initial h2o2 dose during uv h2o2 possibly due to the constant scavenging impact of the wastewater matrix on oh however exponential increase of k o b s u v p d s with increasing pds dose was observed for most compounds during uv pds suggesting the decreasing scavenging effect of the water matrix electron rich site of effluent organic matter efom after initial depletion of so4 at low pds dose fulvic and humic like fluorophores appeared to be more persistent during uv h2o2 compared to aromatic protein and soluble microbial product like fluorophores in contrast uv pds efficiently degraded all identified fluorophores and showed less selectivity toward the fluorescent efom components removal pattern of torcs during pilot scale uv pds was consistent with lab scale experiments however overall removal rates were lower due to the presence of higher concentration of efom and nitrite graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv based advanced oxidation

belhaj et al 2015 insufficiently treated effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp is considered as one of the main sources of torcs to the aquatic environment many torcs are persistent during conventional biological and chemical treatment processes in wwtp the removal efficiency of torcs always depends on their physicochemical and biological properties as well as the removal

aop experiments h2o2 and pds were added directly from stock solutions before uv exposure 0 15 mm of oxidant was applied for buffered pure water experiments the oxidant doses used for wastewater effluent experiments were 0 15 0 30 0 45 and 0 60 mm dark experiments to investigate the effect of h2o2 and pds on torcs attenuation were conducted in duplicates for 30 min and 24 h with oxidant dose of 0 15 0 30 0 45 and 0 60 mm residual oxidants were quenched with excess sodium thiosulfate at the end of each experiment all samples were stored in amber glass bottles at 4 c and analyzed for torcs within 24 h the second order rate constants for the reaction of torcs with so4 were determined by competition kinetics based on the methods published before lutze et al 2015a lian et al 2017 para chlorobenzoic acid pcba was used as a probe compound k so4 pcba 3 6 108 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1977 experiments were conducted in phosphate buffer 2 5 mm at ph 7 with 20 μm of pcba and target compound so4 was generated by uv photolysis of pds 1 mm 10 mm of tert butanol was added as oh scavenger nitrobenzene 1 μm was monitored to confirm that oh was scavenged efficiently by 10 mm of tert butanol the concentrations of pcba and torcs were analyzed on a hplc agilent 1100 equipped with an agilent xdb c18 column 5 μm 4 6 150 mm details on competition kinetic experiments are provided in text s2 2 6 pilot scale experiments pilot scale uv pds investigations were conducted using a container based aop system designed by wedeco xylem germany consisting of two lp uv reactors wedeco lbx 90e and lbx 10 xylem germany operated to deliver the required fluence range the pilot system was fed with wastewater effluent delivered by an external process water pump station at wwtp gut marienhof munich germany directly after tertiary granular media filtration specific details about the pilot system are described elsewhere miklos et al 2018a for pilot scale experiments fluences were set by adjusting flow rates to current uv intensities and uvt in each reactor fluence of 200 400 and 800 mj cm2 were maintained in reactor lbx 10 while 1200 mj cm2 was maintained in reactor lbx 90e oxidant dosing was targeted at concentrations of 0 30 and 0 60 mm and was adjusted based on the flow rate the concentration of pds was determined iodometrically liang et al 2008 before sampling the system was constantly operated with a minimum of ten reactor volumes to establish steady state conditions samples from reactor influent and effluent were filled in amber glass bottles and stored at 4 c until analysis uvt as well as nitrate nitrite acid capacity and oxidant concentration were analyzed on site torcs and doc analysis were conducted within 24 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of selected torcs photolytic reactivity and rate constants with oh and so4 twelve torcs spanning a range of photolytic reactivity were selected based on their frequent detection in wastewater effluent and diverse physicochemical characteristics gerrity et al 2011 luo et al 2014 degradation of selected torcs by direct photolysis was investigated in wwtp effluent 115 1380 mj cm2 the relative removal of torcs is illustrated in fig s1 and their fluence based rate constants k o b s u v are presented in table 2 the percent removal of diclofenac iopromide and sulfamethoxazole were 90 at 1380 mj cm2 followed by phenytoin 68 and benzotriazole 30 about 9 of venlafaxine and 5 of metoprolol were eliminated at 1380 mj cm2 the removal of other torcs was negligible within the applied fluence the selected torcs were classified into 3 groups in accordance with literature miklos et al 2018a group i includes photo sensitive compounds i e diclofenac iopromide and sulfamethoxazole with k o b s u v 1 10 3 cm2 mj group ii are moderately photo sensitive compounds i e phenytoin and benzotriazole 1 10 4 k o b s u v 1 10 3 cm2 mj all other selected torcs belong to group iii and are considered as photo resistant compounds k o b s u v 1 10 4 cm2 mj the second order rate constants of selected torcs with oh and so4 are shown in table 2 the k oh values of torcs were obtained from literature unlike the well studied hydroxyl radical based oxidation processes k so 4 values of most torcs are not known to the best of our knowledge the k so 4 of iopromide phenytoin caffeine benzotriazole and primidone were determined for the first time in this study the k so 4 of venlafaxine metoprolol and carbamazepine are in good agreement with literature values matta et al 2011 lian et al 2017 the selected torcs have complex structures with multiple functional groups hydroxyl radicals react with almost all organic moieties with nearly diffusion controlled rates buxton et al 1988 as shown in table 2 oh reacts relatively slowly with tcep i e 5 6 108 m 1 s 1 watts and linden 2009 while all other torcs have k oh values greater than 1 109 m 1 s 1 in contrast so4 is a selective oxidant and preferentially reacts with electron rich groups neta et al 1988 compounds with activated aromatic ring and amine moieties such as diclofenac aromatic amine sulfamethoxazole aromatic amine venlafaxine methoxybenzene and tertiary amine metoprolol methoxybenzene and secondary amine are highly reactive with so4 among the selected torcs i e k so 4 3 89 109 m 1 s 1 carbamazepine olefin and caffeine imidazole exhibit slightly lower reactivity toward so4 i e k so 4 1 5 2 39 109 m 1 s 1 iopromide contains benzene ring substituted by multiple halogens and electron withdrawing amide group phenytoin and primidone are composed of weakly activated benzene ring as well as electron withdrawing amide group benzotriazole has a protonated triazole ring at ph 7 pk a 8 2 consequently these compounds might have limited electron transfer to so4 and their k so 4 values are 1 109 m 1 s 1 however phenytoin benzotriazole and primidone are still highly reactive towards oh with k oh values of one order of magnitude higher than their k so 4 values possibly due to the rapid benzene ring addition mechanism vel leitner and roshani 2010 lee et al 2014 the k so 4 of gabapentin and tcep were not determined by competition kinetics but estimated to be below 1 109 m 1 s 1 based on their removal in pure water during uv pds text s3 3 2 degradation of torcs in pure water during uv h2o2 and uv pds preliminary experiments indicated that the oxidation of selected torcs by h2o2 and pds in the dark was negligible fig s2 fig 1 presents the percent removal of torcs during uv h2o2 and uv pds in buffered pure water 57 5 mj cm2 0 15 mm oxidants radical oxidation significantly improved the degradation efficiency of torcs compared to direct photolysis about 40 70 removal of torcs except tcep was found during uv h2o2 while the concentration of all torcs except tcep reached the limit of quantification loq during uv pds within the same applied fluence and molar oxidant dose for this reason expected differences in torcs removal based on second order rate constants with so4 could not be illustrated in uv pds experiments the photolysis rate of pds is higher than that of h2o2 due to its higher quantum efficiency i e 0 7 mol e for pds and 0 5 mol e for h2o2 and higher molar extinction coefficient i e 21 1 m 1 cm 1 for pds and 18 6 m 1 cm 1 for h2o2 at 254 nm ike et al 2018 moreover the main radical scavengers in buffered pure water included the phosphate buffer ions i e mainly hpo4 2 and h2po4 at ph 7 pk a2 7 2 primary oxidants h2o2 or pds and torcs the scavenging capacity of each component was calculated by multiplying its molar concentration with its second order rate constants with radicals as shown in table s3 the overall scavenging capacity of the buffered pure water matrix on so4 3 4 103 s 1 was lower compared to that on oh 4 8 103 s 1 the product phosphate radicals e g hpo4 are known to be less reactive than oh and so4 neta et al 1988 thus their contribution to torcs removal should be insignificant and can be ignored therefore the more efficient removal of torcs during uv pds in buffered pure water was attributed to two factors the higher photolysis rate of pds at 254 nm and the lower scavenging effect of the water matrix on so4 which led to the higher steady state concentration of so4 than oh xiao et al 2016 pari et al 2017 tcep was degraded much slower than other compounds due to its low second order rate constants with radicals table 2 in buffered pure water experiments only about 10 of tcep was removed by uv h2o2 at 57 5 mj cm2 and the removal was increased to 43 at 920 mj cm2 fig s3 however the degradation of tcep was faster in uv pds and reached loq at 920 mj cm2 which was attributed to the high so4 exposure in pure water during uv pds 3 3 degradation of torcs in wastewater effluent during uv h2o2 and uv pds experiments with 0 15 mm of h2o2 or pds in wastewater effluent spiked with 1 μg l of each torc resulted in significantly reduced percent removal compared to pure water experiments e g 12 of degradation for group ii and iii compounds at 115 mj cm2 fig s4 indicating the strong scavenging effect of the water matrix e g efom inorganic species on both radicals the effect of the water matrix can be overcome by increasing the uv fluence and oxidant dose fig s5 presents the percent removal of torcs in wastewater effluent at 1380 mj cm2 and 0 6 mm of oxidant direct photolysis was effective for the degradation of group i compounds 90 uv h2o2 and uv pds substantially enhanced the removal of group ii and iii compounds except tcep tcep was persistent to both uv h2o2 and uv pds in wastewater effluent and less than 4 removal was obtained for the highest fluence 1380 mj cm2 and oxidant dose 0 6 mm applied ozonation was also reported to be inefficient for the elimination of tcep in municipal wwtp effluent e g 25 of removal at 1 5 mg o3 mg doc because of its low reaction rate constants with ozone and oh lee et al 2013 fig 2 presents the fluence based rate constants k o b s of torcs calculated for uv only k o b s u v uv h2o2 k o b s u v h 2 o 2 and uv pds k o b s u v p d s experiments performed in wastewater effluent 0 3 mm of oxidant k o b s was not calculated for tcep due to its low removal the k o b s u v k o b s u v a o p was calculated to be greater than 0 8 for group i compounds except diclofenac in uv pds indicating that their degradation was mainly attributed to direct photolysis during uv pds the removal rate of diclofenac was enhanced to 1 12 10 2 cm2 mj suggesting that both direct photolysis and radical oxidation contributed to its elimination i e k o b s u v k o b s u v p d s 0 6 the removal of group ii compounds followed both direct photodegradation and radical oxidation whereas the radical oxidation was the dominant process for group iii compounds the inset boxplot in fig 2 shows the fluence based rate constants of group iii compounds except tcep the k o b s u v p d s covered a wider range than k o b s u v h 2 o 2 suggesting that uv pds showed higher selectivity towards torcs removal than uv h2o2 similar results were reported on uv h2o2 and uv pds treatment of torcs in reverse osmosis brines yang et al 2016 and wastewater effluent lian et al 2017 moreover the removal pattern of group iii compounds during both processes was consistent with their second order rate constants with oh and so4 shown in table 2 group iii compounds with high k oh 7 109 m 1 s 1 such as venlafaxine metoprolol and carbamazepine had similar k o b s u v h 2 o 2 1 10 3 cm2 mj slightly lower removal rate was observed from caffeine 6 13 10 4 cm2 mj and primidone 7 20 10 4 cm2 mj which was consistent with their lower k oh 7 109 m 1 s 1 the k o b s u v h 2 o 2 of gabapentin was 5 31 10 4 cm2 mj suggesting that its k oh might have been overestimated previously i e 9 1 109 m 1 s 1 lee et al 2014 similarly compounds with higher k so 4 1 50 4 99 109 m 1 s 1 such as venlafaxine metoprolol carbamazepine and caffeine showed higher removal rate than those with lower k so 4 1 109 m 1 s 1 such as primidone and gabapentin fig 3 shows the evolution of fluence based rate constants of torcs as a function of initial oxidant dose the k o b s u v h 2 o 2 and k o b s u v p d s values of each torc except for iopromide gradually increased suggesting that the radical exposure was promoted with increasing h2o2 and pds dose rosario ortiz et al 2010 during uv h2o2 the k o b s u v h 2 o 2 values of torcs increased linearly as a function of initial h2o2 dose previous study showed that the log transformation of torcs i e log c co in wastewater effluent was linearly proportional to the initial h2o2 dose during uv h2o2 which indicated that the competition between torcs and the wastewater effluent matrix for oh consumption remained constant during the oxidation process lee and von gunten 2010 however the k o b s u v p d s values of torcs especially those with high reactivity towards so4 i e k so 4 1 109 m 1 s 1 such as diclofenac sulfamethoxazole venlafaxine metoprolol carbamazepine and caffeine exhibited exponential increase with increasing of pds dose our results are comparable with previous studies on the treatment of torcs in wastewater effluent using selective oxidants e g ozone chlorine lee and von gunten 2010 which are highly reactive with the electron rich organic moieties when selective oxidants are applied the degradation of torcs tends to have a lag phase at low oxidant dose due to the high competition between the targeted torc and the wastewater effluent matrix e g electron rich site of efom when the oxidant dose is increased to be above the initial water matrix demand the degradation rates of torcs can be enhanced significantly lee and von gunten 2010 to support our hypothesis the fluorescence intensities of feem regions see section 3 5 were progressively reduced with increasing initial pds concentration during uv pds about 62 76 fluorophores were degraded at 1380 mj cm2 and 0 6 mm of pds fig s6 indicating the large depletion of electron rich organic moieties in efom at high pds dose alternatively more so4 will be available in solution to oxidize torcs although about 43 77 of the fluorescence intensity were removed during uv h2o2 under the same experimental conditions fig s6 oh is a non selective oxidant and it might react with all fractions of efom and the transformation products of efom as fast as their initial compounds resulting in the constant scavenging rates of water matrix for oh during the entire oxidation processes lee and von gunten 2010 diclofenac venlafaxine and metoprolol were more efficiently eliminated by uv pds compared to uv h2o2 because they can more easily overcome the scavenging impact of efom due to their high reactivity with so4 the uv pds process was also reported to be more efficient than uv h2o2 for venlafaxine and metoprolol in wastewater effluent lian et al 2017 sulfamethoxazole was degraded faster in uv pds when pds dose was above 0 3 mm for caffeine and carbamazepine k o b s u v p d s was comparable with k o b s u v h 2 o 2 at 0 6 mm oxidant dose thus uv pds is expected to outcompete uv h2o2 for removal of these two compounds if higher pds dose is applied 0 6 mm for phenytoin benzotriazole primidone and gabapentin uv h2o2 was more efficient as they have low reactivity with so4 to overcome the scavenging effect of the water matrix during uv pds the k o b s u v h 2 o 2 of iopromide was only increased by less than 20 compared to k o b s u v and its k o b s u v p d s value was almost stable in various initial h2o2 and pds doses respectively this can be explained by the low reactivity of iopromide with oh and so4 table 2 hence direct photodegradation is mainly responsible for the removal of iopromide in wastewater effluent and upgrading uv process to uv h2o2 or uv pds will not contribute substantially to its removal efficiency 3 4 effect of wastewater matrix components the water matrix components e g doc bicarbonate nitrite and halides react with oh and so4 lowering the efficiency of uv h2o2 and uv pds processes table 1 shows the water quality parameters of wastewater effluent used in this study the exact concentration of chloride is not available but the annual average concentration in this wwtp effluent is provided the scavenging capacity of the known inorganic constituents were calculated by multiplying their concentrations with their second order reaction rate constants with oh and so4 rate constants and references are shown in table s2 doc and chloride were the most efficient scavengers for uv h2o2 and uv pds respectively the product radicals e g co3 no2 and cl2 generated from the reactions between inorganic components and oh or so4 table s2 might also participate in the degradation of torcs wols and hofman caris 2012 lian et al 2017 the product radicals are moderate oxidants i e 1 63 v 1 03 v and 2 0 v for co3 no2 and cl2 respectively and even more selective than so4 toward electron rich moieties i e activated aromatics like phenols and anilines olefines zuo et al 1999 guo et al 2017 ji et al 2017 the impact of individual inorganic ions i e bicarbonate nitrite nitrate and chloride on the removal pattern of torcs during uv h2o2 and uv pds was investigated in buffered pure water applying the concentration of each inorganic constituent in table 1 the influence of chloride was simulated by applying 35 and 350 mg l of chloride the fluence based rate constants of torcs are shown in fig s7 the effect of nitrate 10 6 mg n l was negligible for both processes the k o b s u v h 2 o 2 and k o b s u v p d s of torcs except for diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole in the presence of bicarbonate 307 mg l were lower than that in the presence of nitrite 0 028 mg n l indicating that bicarbonate scavenged radicals more efficiently than nitrite this is consistent with the calculated scavenging capacity of bicarbonate and nitrite shown in table 1 however nitrite was present at low concentration 0 028 mg n l in this specific wastewater sample the second order rate constant of nitrite with oh 1 0 1010 m 1 s 1 coddington et al 1999 and so4 8 8 108 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 is the highest among the known wastewater components in table 1 suggesting that the scavenging capacity of nitrite can be significant at higher concentration a previous study reported that the efficiency of torcs elimination during uv h2o2 was strongly influenced by nitrite concentration fluctuations in wwtp effluent miklos et al 2018a interestingly sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac were degraded faster in bicarbonate containing solution than in the presence of nitrite during both processes which suggests that co3 contributed to their removal recent studies also reported the degradation of sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac by co3 lu et al 2017 yang et al 2017 no significant reduction of k o b s u v h 2 o 2 was found for uv h2o2 in the presence of chloride this finding was expected because the reaction between chloride and oh is reversible and the rate constant of forward reaction 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 is even lower than that for the backward reaction 6 1 109 m 1 s 1 jayson et al 1973 table s2 the concentration of torcs reached loq at 57 5 mj cm2 during uv pds in the presence of 35 mg l of chloride when the chloride was increased to 350 mg l the removal rate of torcs decreased although the scavenging capacity of 350 mg l of chloride i e 3 106 s 1 is about two and three orders of magnitude higher than that of bicarbonate and nitrite respectively the k o b s u v p d s values in the presence of chloride were comparable or even higher than those in the presence of bicarbonate and nitrite for most compounds indicating that reactive chlorine species e g cl2 might promote the degradation of torcs consequently the presence of chloride in wastewater effluent reduces the steady state concentration of so4 during uv pds but might less affect the removal rate of torcs compared to bicarbonate and nitrite at similar scavenging capacity however the importance of inorganic ions might be different in wastewater effluent compared to the buffered pure water with individual inorganic components as shown in table 1 doc is a strong scavenger for oh and so4 resulting in lower steady state concentrations of primary radicals in wastewater effluent compared to pure water moreover the product radicals can also be scavenged by the wastewater components for instance bicarbonate is reactive with cl and cl2 to produce more co3 table s2 doc was reported to scavenge cl efficiently i e 1 3 104 mg c l 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 3 5 oxidative inactivation of fluorescent effluent organic matter components during uv h2o2 and uv pds figure s8 illustrates the feem spectra of wastewater effluent during uv h2o2 and uv pds processes the feem spectra of wastewater effluent before aop treatment exhibited 4 characteristic regions with maximum fluorescence intensity identified as follows table s2 aromatic protein like peak p ii excitation emission 242 358 nm fulvic like peak p iii 242 430 nm soluble microbial product like peak p iv 287 353 nm and humic like peak p v 329 412 nm chen et al 2003 the fluorescence intensity of p iv was reduced by 15 during direct photolysis at 920 mj cm2 suggesting the presence of relatively photo sensitive fluorophores in soluble microbial product like region the intensity of the other fluorescence peaks was stable during direct photolysis 115 1380 mj cm2 once adding h2o2 and pds the fluorescence intensities of all the selected peaks decreased following first order reaction kinetics indicating the contribution of oh and so4 respectively their fluence based reaction rate constants k o b s u v h 2 o 2 and k o b s u v p d s linearly increased as a function of initial oxidant dose fig 4 a except the k o b s u v p d s of p v which appeared to increase exponentially the fluorescence extinction of fulvic and humic like fluorophores were much slower than that of soluble microbial product like and aromatic protein like fluorophores during uv h2o2 this is in accordance with previous observation that some fluorophores in humic like region might be more resistant to oh attack than fluorophores from the protein like region abdelmelek et al 2011 interestingly unlike the removal of torcs uv pds reduced the fluorescence intensities of all identified fluorophores and showed less selectivity toward fluorophores removal this is consistent with the literature that so4 is a strong electrophile and preferentially oxidizes electron rich moieties e g unsaturated and aromatic compounds xiao et al 2015 which is the primary characteristic of fluorescent compounds świetlik and sikorska 2004 the fluorescence loss of humic and fulvic like fluorophores during uv pds were even faster than that during uv h2o2 addition and hydrogen abstraction are the main pathways for oh whereas the electron transfer is predominant for so4 neta et al 1988 during uv h2o2 humic substances might mainly undergo hydroxylation and breakdown of macromolecules into smaller ones but the main structural characteristic remains intact gonzález et al 2013 the direct electron transfer from aromatic rings to so4 followed by the hydroxylation in aqueous solution can generate similar hydroxylated aromatics as oh olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 however the electron transfer can also lead to the formation of unstable radical cation intermediates or the decarboxylation following the oxidation of aromatic ring which might induce the rapid ring cleavage during uv pds neta et al 1977 therefore the prevalence of radical reactions with efom can impact differently on fluorescence during uv h2o2 and uv pds several studies investigated fluorescence as a surrogate to predict the elimination of torcs during various water treatment processes gerrity et al 2012 park et al 2017 the possible correlation of fluence based rate constants between selected fluorescence peaks and individual group iii compounds except tcep was examined in this study fig 4b presents venlafaxine as an example other group iii compounds are shown in fig s9 s10 the k o b s u v h 2 o 2 value of individual group iii compounds was linearly correlated with that of selected fluorescence peaks suggesting that fluorescence may be a useful indicator for group iii compounds removal during uv h2o2 the k o b s u v p d s values of group iii compounds exponentially increased with respect to k o b s u v p d s of selected fluorescence peaks due to the selective oxidizing property of so4 the elimination of compounds that are less reactive with so4 can be eliminated much slower than fluorophores for example only about 28 of gabapentin was removed when 62 76 fluorophores were degraded during uv pds figs s5 and s6 therefore the development of compound specific surrogate model on fluorescence would be required during uv pds 3 6 degradation of torcs during pilot scale uv pds pilot scale uv pds treatment of torcs was conducted at wwtp the concentrations of torcs in wwtp effluent before uv pds treatment are shown in table 2 phenytoin 13 2 ng l and caffeine 71 32 ng l were present at very low initial concentrations which were close to loq and consequently showing large uncertainties therefore the elimination of phenytoin and caffeine was not monitored during pilot testing fig 5 shows the relative removal of torcs during uv only and uv pds processes group i compounds were efficiently removed more than 98 of diclofenac was degraded at 1200 mj cm2 when only uv was applied with the addition of 0 6 mm of pds the same removal of 98 was already achieved at 800 mj cm2 comparable to lab scale experiments the elimination of iopromide and sulfamethoxazole was mainly caused by direct photolysis with 94 and 91 removal at 1200 mj cm2 respectively no significant contribution of so4 was observed to iopromide within experimental uncertainties due to its low k so 4 i e 1 109 m 1 s 1 sulfamethoxazole is highly reactive with so4 i e k so 4 12 5 109 m 1 s 1 mahdi ahmed et al 2012 furthermore the potential inner filter effect of pds was excluded as the uv fluence was adjusted after pds spiking during pilot testing however the removal of sulfamethoxazole was slower during uv pds than direct uv photolysis for unknown reason venlafaxine and metoprolol were removed most efficiently among the group ii and iii compounds which was consistent with the lab scale experiments about 77 of venlafaxine 49 of metoprolol and 27 of carbamazepine were eliminated at 1200 mj cm2 and 0 6 mm pds compounds showing low reactivity toward so4 were less removed for instance about 58 of benzotriazole and 11 of primidone were degraded at 1200 mj cm2 with 0 6 mm pds similar to iopromide the direct photodegradation was mainly responsible for the elimination of benzotriazole due to its low k so 4 i e 1 109 m 1 s 1 fig s11 gabapentin and tcep appeared to be resistant to uv photolysis and uv pds in these experimental conditions the removal pattern of torcs during pilot testing was comparable to lab scale experiments but their removal rates were lower higher concentrations of doc and nitrite were observed during pilot scale tests compared to lab scale experiments resulting in about 1 7 and 5 3 times higher scavenging capacity of the wastewater matrix on so4 table 1 fluorescence intensity was reduced only by 35 54 at 1200 mj cm2 with 0 6 mm pds figure s12 s13 confirming the overall lower oxidation efficiency due to the scavengers during pilot testing 4 conclusion when the same molar dose of pds and h2o2 are applied uv pds can eliminate all torcs more efficiently than uv h2o2 in buffered pure water due to the higher yield of so4 so4 preferentially oxidizes torcs with electron rich moieties e g activated aromatic ring olefines and amines as well as the electron rich site of efom e g fluorophores while oh reacts with almost all organic moieties with nearly diffusion controlled rates high competition between the target torcs and the electron rich site of efom scavenger was observed at low pds dose however the initial oxidant demand was followed by an exponential increase in the fluence based rate constants of most compounds with increasing pds dose in contrast the scavenging impact of the water matrix on oh was constant during uv h2o2 leading to a linear increase of fluence based rate constants with increasing h2o2 dose selectivity of so4 results in more efficient removal of torcs with electron rich moieties by uv pds in wastewater effluent while uv h2o2 better oxidizes compounds with less reactivity toward so4 the scavenging capacities of doc and chloride were calculated to be the highest among the known water parameters during uv h2o2 and uv pds respectively experiments conducted in the presence of individual inorganic species indicated that co3 enhanced the degradation of diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole during both processes chlorine radicals might contribute to the degradation of most compounds during uv pds the efficiency of pilot scale uv pds was affected by the variation of doc and nitrite in wastewater effluent higher uv fluences and oxidant doses are needed to overcome the impact of the water matrix however the energy requirements and the effect of sulfate ion on the salinity of treated water should be evaluated prior to uv pds application in wastewater effluent acknowledgments curtin university curtin international postgraduate research scholarship and water research australia

19321,in this study we comparatively investigated the degradation of 12 trace organic chemicals torcs during uv h2o2 and uv peroxydisulfate pds processes second order rate constants for the reactions of iopromide phenytoin caffeine benzotriazole and primidone with sulfate radical so4 were determined for the first time experiments were conducted in buffered pure water and wastewater effluent with spiked torcs uv pds degraded all torcs more efficiently than uv h2o2 in buffered pure water due to the higher yield of so4 than that of hydroxyl radical oh at the same initial molar dose of pds and h2o2 respectively uv pds showed higher selectivity toward torcs removal than uv h2o2 in wastewater effluent compounds with electron rich moieties such as diclofenac venlafaxine and metoprolol were eliminated faster in uv pds whereas uv h2o2 was more efficient in degrading compounds with lower reactivity to so4 the fluence based rate constants k o b s u v h 2 o 2 of torcs in wastewater effluent linearly increased as a function of initial h2o2 dose during uv h2o2 possibly due to the constant scavenging impact of the wastewater matrix on oh however exponential increase of k o b s u v p d s with increasing pds dose was observed for most compounds during uv pds suggesting the decreasing scavenging effect of the water matrix electron rich site of effluent organic matter efom after initial depletion of so4 at low pds dose fulvic and humic like fluorophores appeared to be more persistent during uv h2o2 compared to aromatic protein and soluble microbial product like fluorophores in contrast uv pds efficiently degraded all identified fluorophores and showed less selectivity toward the fluorescent efom components removal pattern of torcs during pilot scale uv pds was consistent with lab scale experiments however overall removal rates were lower due to the presence of higher concentration of efom and nitrite graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv based advanced oxidation

aop experiments h2o2 and pds were added directly from stock solutions before uv exposure 0 15 mm of oxidant was applied for buffered pure water experiments the oxidant doses used for wastewater effluent experiments were 0 15 0 30 0 45 and 0 60 mm dark experiments to investigate the effect of h2o2 and pds on torcs attenuation were conducted in duplicates for 30 min and 24 h with oxidant dose of 0 15 0 30 0 45 and 0 60 mm residual oxidants were quenched with excess sodium thiosulfate at the end of each experiment all samples were stored in amber glass bottles at 4 c and analyzed for torcs within 24 h the second order rate constants for the reaction of torcs with so4 were determined by competition kinetics based on the methods published before lutze et al 2015a lian et al 2017 para chlorobenzoic acid pcba was used as a probe compound k so4 pcba 3 6 108 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1977 experiments were conducted in phosphate buffer 2 5 mm at ph 7 with 20 μm of pcba and target compound so4

pilot scale experiments pilot scale uv pds investigations were conducted using a container based aop system designed by wedeco xylem germany consisting of two lp uv reactors wedeco lbx 90e and lbx 10 xylem germany operated to deliver the required fluence range the pilot system was fed with wastewater effluent delivered by an external process water pump station at wwtp gut marienhof munich germany directly after tertiary granular media filtration specific details about the pilot system are described elsewhere miklos et al 2018a for pilot scale experiments fluences were set by adjusting flow rates to current uv intensities and uvt in each reactor fluence of 200 400 and 800 mj cm2 were maintained in reactor lbx 10 while 1200 mj cm2 was maintained in reactor lbx 90e oxidant dosing was targeted at concentrations of 0 30 and 0 60 mm and was adjusted based on the flow rate the concentration of pds was determined iodometrically liang et al 2008 before sampling the system was constantly operated with a minimum of ten reactor volumes to establish steady state conditions samples from reactor influent and effluent were filled in amber glass bottles and stored at 4 c until analysis uvt as well as nitrate nitrite acid capacity and oxidant concentration were analyzed on site torcs and doc analysis were conducted within 24 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of selected torcs photolytic reactivity and rate constants with oh and so4 twelve torcs spanning a range of photolytic reactivity were selected based on their frequent detection in wastewater effluent and diverse physicochemical characteristics gerrity et al 2011 luo et al 2014 degradation of selected torcs by direct photolysis was investigated in wwtp effluent 115 1380 mj cm2 the relative removal of torcs is illustrated in fig s1 and their fluence based rate constants k o b s u v are presented in table 2 the percent removal of diclofenac iopromide and sulfamethoxazole were 90 at 1380 mj cm2 followed by phenytoin 68 and benzotriazole 30 about 9 of venlafaxine and 5 of metoprolol were eliminated at 1380 mj cm2 the removal of other torcs was negligible within the applied fluence the selected torcs were classified into 3 groups in accordance with literature miklos et al 2018a group i includes photo sensitive compounds i e diclofenac iopromide and sulfamethoxazole with k o b s u v 1 10 3 cm2 mj group ii are moderately photo sensitive compounds i e phenytoin and benzotriazole 1 10 4 k o b s u v 1 10 3 cm2 mj all other selected torcs belong to group iii and are considered as photo resistant compounds k o b s u v 1 10 4 cm2 mj the second order rate constants of selected torcs with oh and so4 are shown in table 2 the k oh values of torcs were obtained from literature unlike the well studied hydroxyl radical based oxidation processes k so 4 values of most torcs are not known to the best of our knowledge the k so 4 of iopromide phenytoin caffeine benzotriazole and primidone were determined for the first time in this study the k so 4 of venlafaxine metoprolol and carbamazepine are in good agreement with literature values matta et al 2011 lian et al 2017 the selected torcs have complex structures with multiple functional groups hydroxyl radicals react with almost all organic moieties with nearly diffusion controlled rates buxton et al 1988 as shown in table 2 oh reacts relatively slowly with tcep i e 5 6 108 m 1 s 1 watts and linden 2009 while all other torcs have k oh values greater than 1 109 m 1 s 1 in contrast so4 is a selective oxidant and preferentially reacts with electron rich groups neta et al 1988 compounds with activated aromatic ring and amine moieties such as diclofenac aromatic amine sulfamethoxazole aromatic amine venlafaxine methoxybenzene and tertiary amine metoprolol methoxybenzene and secondary amine are highly reactive with so4 among the selected torcs i e k so 4 3 89 109 m 1 s 1 carbamazepine olefin and caffeine imidazole exhibit slightly lower reactivity toward so4 i e k so 4 1 5 2 39 109 m 1 s 1 iopromide contains benzene ring substituted by multiple halogens and electron withdrawing amide group phenytoin and primidone are composed of weakly activated benzene ring as well as electron withdrawing amide group benzotriazole has a protonated triazole ring at ph 7 pk a 8 2 consequently these compounds might have limited electron transfer to so4 and their k so 4 values are 1 109 m 1 s 1 however phenytoin benzotriazole and primidone are still highly reactive towards oh with k oh values of one order of magnitude higher than their k so 4 values possibly due to the rapid benzene ring addition mechanism vel leitner and roshani 2010 lee et al 2014 the k so 4 of gabapentin and tcep were not determined by competition kinetics but estimated to be below 1 109 m 1 s 1 based on their removal in pure water during uv pds text s3 3 2 degradation of torcs in pure water during uv h2o2 and uv pds preliminary experiments indicated that the oxidation of selected torcs by h2o2 and pds in the dark was negligible fig s2 fig 1 presents the percent removal of torcs during uv h2o2 and uv pds in buffered pure water 57 5 mj cm2 0 15 mm oxidants radical oxidation significantly improved the degradation efficiency of torcs compared to direct photolysis about 40 70 removal of torcs except tcep was found during uv h2o2 while the concentration of all torcs except tcep reached the limit of quantification loq during uv pds within the same applied fluence and molar oxidant dose for this reason expected differences in torcs removal based on second order rate constants with so4 could not be illustrated in uv pds experiments the photolysis rate of pds is higher than that of h2o2 due to its higher quantum efficiency i e 0 7 mol e for pds and 0 5 mol e for h2o2 and higher molar extinction coefficient i e 21 1 m 1 cm 1 for pds and 18 6 m 1 cm 1 for h2o2 at 254 nm ike et al 2018 moreover the main radical scavengers in buffered pure water included the phosphate buffer ions i e mainly hpo4 2 and h2po4 at ph 7 pk a2 7 2 primary oxidants h2o2 or pds and torcs the scavenging capacity of each component was calculated by multiplying its molar concentration with its second order rate constants with radicals as shown in table s3 the overall scavenging capacity of the buffered pure water matrix on so4 3 4 103 s 1 was lower compared to that on oh 4 8 103 s 1 the product phosphate radicals e g hpo4 are known to be less reactive than oh and so4 neta et al 1988 thus their contribution to torcs removal should be insignificant and can be ignored therefore the more efficient removal of torcs during uv pds in buffered pure water was attributed to two factors the higher photolysis rate of pds at 254 nm and the lower scavenging effect of the water matrix on so4 which led to the higher steady state concentration of so4 than oh xiao et al 2016 pari et al 2017 tcep was degraded much slower than other compounds due to its low second order rate constants with radicals table 2 in buffered pure water experiments only about 10 of tcep was removed by uv h2o2 at 57 5 mj cm2 and the removal was increased to 43 at 920 mj cm2 fig s3 however the degradation of tcep was faster in uv pds and reached loq at 920 mj cm2 which was attributed to the high so4 exposure in pure water during uv pds 3 3 degradation of torcs in wastewater effluent during uv h2o2 and uv pds experiments with 0 15 mm of h2o2 or pds in wastewater effluent spiked with 1 μg l of each torc resulted in significantly reduced percent removal compared to pure water experiments e g 12 of degradation for group ii and iii compounds at 115 mj cm2 fig s4 indicating the strong scavenging effect of the water matrix e g efom inorganic species on both radicals the effect of the water matrix can be overcome by increasing the uv fluence and oxidant dose fig s5 presents the percent removal of torcs in wastewater effluent at 1380 mj cm2 and 0 6 mm of oxidant direct photolysis was effective for the degradation of group i compounds 90 uv h2o2 and uv pds substantially enhanced the removal of group ii and iii compounds except tcep tcep was persistent to both uv h2o2 and uv pds in wastewater effluent and less than 4 removal was obtained for the highest fluence 1380 mj cm2 and oxidant dose 0 6 mm applied ozonation was also reported to be inefficient for the elimination of tcep in municipal wwtp effluent e g 25 of removal at 1 5 mg o3 mg doc because of its low reaction rate constants with ozone and oh lee et al 2013 fig 2 presents the fluence based rate constants k o b s of torcs calculated for uv only k o b s u v uv h2o2 k o b s u v h 2 o 2 and uv pds k o b s u v p d s experiments performed in wastewater effluent 0 3 mm of oxidant k o b s was not calculated for tcep due to its low removal the k o b s u v k o b s u v a o p was calculated to be greater than 0 8 for group i compounds except diclofenac in uv pds indicating that their degradation was mainly attributed to direct photolysis during uv pds the removal rate of diclofenac was enhanced to 1 12 10 2 cm2 mj suggesting that both direct photolysis and radical oxidation contributed to its elimination i e k o b s u v k o b s u v p d s 0 6 the removal of group ii compounds followed both direct photodegradation and radical oxidation whereas the radical oxidation was the dominant process for group iii compounds the inset boxplot in fig 2 shows the fluence based rate constants of group iii compounds except tcep the k o b s u v p d s covered a wider range than k o b s u v h 2 o 2 suggesting that uv pds showed higher selectivity towards torcs removal than uv h2o2 similar results were reported on uv h2o2 and uv pds treatment of torcs in reverse osmosis brines yang et al 2016 and wastewater effluent lian et al 2017 moreover the removal pattern of group iii compounds during both processes was consistent with their second order rate constants with oh and so4 shown in table 2 group iii compounds with high k oh 7 109 m 1 s 1 such as venlafaxine metoprolol and carbamazepine had similar k o b s u v h 2 o 2 1 10 3 cm2 mj slightly lower removal rate was observed from caffeine 6 13 10 4 cm2 mj and primidone 7 20 10 4 cm2 mj which was consistent with their lower k oh 7 109 m 1 s 1 the k o b s u v h 2 o 2 of gabapentin was 5 31 10 4 cm2 mj suggesting that its k oh might have been overestimated previously i e 9 1 109 m 1 s 1 lee et al 2014 similarly compounds with higher k so 4 1 50 4 99 109 m 1 s 1 such as venlafaxine metoprolol carbamazepine and caffeine showed higher removal rate than those with lower k so 4 1 109 m 1 s 1 such as primidone and gabapentin fig 3 shows the evolution of fluence based rate constants of torcs as a function of initial oxidant dose the k o b s u v h 2 o 2 and k o b s u v p d s values of each torc except for iopromide gradually increased suggesting that the radical exposure was promoted with increasing h2o2 and pds dose rosario ortiz et al 2010 during uv h2o2 the k o b s u v h 2 o 2 values of torcs increased linearly as a function of initial h2o2 dose previous study showed that the log transformation of torcs i e log c co in wastewater effluent was linearly proportional to the initial h2o2 dose during uv h2o2 which indicated that the competition between torcs and the wastewater effluent matrix for oh consumption remained constant during the oxidation process lee and von gunten 2010 however the k o b s u v p d s values of torcs especially those with high reactivity towards so4 i e k so 4 1 109 m 1 s 1 such as diclofenac sulfamethoxazole venlafaxine metoprolol carbamazepine and caffeine exhibited exponential increase with increasing of pds dose our results are comparable with previous studies on the treatment of torcs in wastewater effluent using selective oxidants e g ozone chlorine lee and von gunten 2010 which are highly reactive with the electron rich organic moieties when selective oxidants are applied the degradation of torcs tends to have a lag phase at low oxidant dose due to the high competition between the targeted torc and the wastewater effluent matrix e g electron rich site of efom when the oxidant dose is increased to be above the initial water matrix demand the degradation rates of torcs can be enhanced significantly lee and von gunten 2010 to support our hypothesis the fluorescence intensities of feem regions see section 3 5 were progressively reduced with increasing initial pds concentration during uv pds about 62 76 fluorophores were degraded at 1380 mj cm2 and 0 6 mm of pds fig s6 indicating the large depletion of electron rich organic moieties in efom at high pds dose alternatively more so4 will be available in solution to oxidize torcs although about 43 77 of the fluorescence intensity were removed during uv h2o2 under the same experimental conditions fig s6 oh is a non selective oxidant and it might react with all fractions of efom and the transformation products of efom as fast as their initial compounds resulting in the constant scavenging rates of water matrix for oh during the entire oxidation processes lee and von gunten 2010 diclofenac venlafaxine and metoprolol were more efficiently eliminated by uv pds compared to uv h2o2 because they can more easily overcome the scavenging impact of efom due to their high reactivity with so4 the uv pds process was also reported to be more efficient than uv h2o2 for venlafaxine and metoprolol in wastewater effluent lian et al 2017 sulfamethoxazole was degraded faster in uv pds when pds dose was above 0 3 mm for caffeine and carbamazepine k o b s u v p d s was comparable with k o b s u v h 2 o 2 at 0 6 mm oxidant dose thus uv pds is expected to outcompete uv h2o2 for removal of these two compounds if higher pds dose is applied 0 6 mm for phenytoin benzotriazole primidone and gabapentin uv h2o2 was more efficient as they have low reactivity with so4 to overcome the scavenging effect of the water matrix during uv pds the k o b s u v h 2 o 2 of iopromide was only increased by less than 20 compared to k o b s u v and its k o b s u v p d s value was almost stable in various initial h2o2 and pds doses respectively this can be explained by the low reactivity of iopromide with oh and so4 table 2 hence direct photodegradation is mainly responsible for the removal of iopromide in wastewater effluent and upgrading uv process to uv h2o2 or uv pds will not contribute substantially to its removal efficiency 3 4 effect of wastewater matrix components the water matrix components e g doc bicarbonate nitrite and halides react with oh and so4 lowering the efficiency of uv h2o2 and uv pds processes table 1 shows the water quality parameters of wastewater effluent used in this study the exact concentration of chloride is not available but the annual average concentration in this wwtp effluent is provided the scavenging capacity of the known inorganic constituents were calculated by multiplying their concentrations with their second order reaction rate constants with oh and so4 rate constants and references are shown in table s2 doc and chloride were the most efficient scavengers for uv h2o2 and uv pds respectively the product radicals e g co3 no2 and cl2 generated from the reactions between inorganic components and oh or so4 table s2 might also participate in the degradation of torcs wols and hofman caris 2012 lian et al 2017 the product radicals are moderate oxidants i e 1 63 v 1 03 v and 2 0 v for co3 no2 and cl2 respectively and even more selective than so4 toward electron rich moieties i e activated aromatics like phenols and anilines olefines zuo et al 1999 guo et al 2017 ji et al 2017 the impact of individual inorganic ions i e bicarbonate nitrite nitrate and chloride on the removal pattern of torcs during uv h2o2 and uv pds was investigated in buffered pure water applying the concentration of each inorganic constituent in table 1 the influence of chloride was simulated by applying 35 and 350 mg l of chloride the fluence based rate constants of torcs are shown in fig s7 the effect of nitrate 10 6 mg n l was negligible for both processes the k o b s u v h 2 o 2 and k o b s u v p d s of torcs except for diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole in the presence of bicarbonate 307 mg l were lower than that in the presence of nitrite 0 028 mg n l indicating that bicarbonate scavenged radicals more efficiently than nitrite this is consistent with the calculated scavenging capacity of bicarbonate and nitrite shown in table 1 however nitrite was present at low concentration 0 028 mg n l in this specific wastewater sample the second order rate constant of nitrite with oh 1 0 1010 m 1 s 1 coddington et al 1999 and so4 8 8 108 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 is the highest among the known wastewater components in table 1 suggesting that the scavenging capacity of nitrite can be significant at higher concentration a previous study reported that the efficiency of torcs elimination during uv h2o2 was strongly influenced by nitrite concentration fluctuations in wwtp effluent miklos et al 2018a interestingly sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac were degraded faster in bicarbonate containing solution than in the presence of nitrite during both processes which suggests that co3 contributed to their removal recent studies also reported the degradation of sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac by co3 lu et al 2017 yang et al 2017 no significant reduction of k o b s u v h 2 o 2 was found for uv h2o2 in the presence of chloride this finding was expected because the reaction between chloride and oh is reversible and the rate constant of forward reaction 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 is even lower than that for the backward reaction 6 1 109 m 1 s 1 jayson et al 1973 table s2 the concentration of torcs reached loq at 57 5 mj cm2 during uv pds in the presence of 35 mg l of chloride when the chloride was increased to 350 mg l the removal rate of torcs decreased although the scavenging capacity of 350 mg l of chloride i e 3 106 s 1 is about two and three orders of magnitude higher than that of bicarbonate and nitrite respectively the k o b s u v p d s values in the presence of chloride were comparable or even higher than those in the presence of bicarbonate and nitrite for most compounds indicating that reactive chlorine species e g cl2 might promote the degradation of torcs consequently the presence of chloride in wastewater effluent reduces the steady state concentration of so4 during uv pds but might less affect the removal rate of torcs compared to bicarbonate and nitrite at similar scavenging capacity however the importance of inorganic ions might be different in wastewater effluent compared to the buffered pure water with individual inorganic components as shown in table 1 doc is a strong scavenger for oh and so4 resulting in lower steady state concentrations of primary radicals in wastewater effluent compared to pure water moreover the product radicals can also be scavenged by the wastewater components for instance bicarbonate is reactive with cl and cl2 to produce more co3 table s2 doc was reported to scavenge cl efficiently i e 1 3 104 mg c l 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 3 5 oxidative inactivation of fluorescent effluent organic matter components during uv h2o2 and uv pds figure s8 illustrates the feem spectra of wastewater effluent during uv h2o2 and uv pds processes the feem spectra of wastewater effluent before aop treatment exhibited 4 characteristic regions with maximum fluorescence intensity identified as follows table s2 aromatic protein like peak p ii excitation emission 242 358 nm fulvic like peak p iii 242 430 nm soluble microbial product like peak p iv 287 353 nm and humic like peak p v 329 412 nm chen et al 2003 the fluorescence intensity of p iv was reduced by 15 during direct photolysis at 920 mj cm2 suggesting the presence of relatively photo sensitive fluorophores in soluble microbial product like region the intensity of the other fluorescence peaks was stable during direct photolysis 115 1380 mj cm2 once adding h2o2 and pds the fluorescence intensities of all the selected peaks decreased following first order reaction kinetics indicating the contribution of oh and so4 respectively their fluence based reaction rate constants k o b s u v h 2 o 2 and k o b s u v p d s linearly increased as a function of initial oxidant dose fig 4 a except the k o b s u v p d s of p v which appeared to increase exponentially the fluorescence extinction of fulvic and humic like fluorophores were much slower than that of soluble microbial product like and aromatic protein like fluorophores during uv h2o2 this is in accordance with previous observation that some fluorophores in humic like region might be more resistant to oh attack than fluorophores from the protein like region abdelmelek et al 2011 interestingly unlike the removal of torcs uv pds reduced the fluorescence intensities of all identified fluorophores and showed less selectivity toward fluorophores removal this is consistent with the literature that so4 is a strong electrophile and preferentially oxidizes electron rich moieties e g unsaturated and aromatic compounds xiao et al 2015 which is the primary characteristic of fluorescent compounds świetlik and sikorska 2004 the fluorescence loss of humic and fulvic like fluorophores during uv pds were even faster than that during uv h2o2 addition and hydrogen abstraction are the main pathways for oh whereas the electron transfer is predominant for so4 neta et al 1988 during uv h2o2 humic substances might mainly undergo hydroxylation and breakdown of macromolecules into smaller ones but the main structural characteristic remains intact gonzález et al 2013 the direct electron transfer from aromatic rings to so4 followed by the hydroxylation in aqueous solution can generate similar hydroxylated aromatics as oh olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 however the electron transfer can also lead to the formation of unstable radical cation intermediates or the decarboxylation following the oxidation of aromatic ring which might induce the rapid ring cleavage during uv pds neta et al 1977 therefore the prevalence of radical reactions with efom can impact differently on fluorescence during uv h2o2 and uv pds several studies investigated fluorescence as a surrogate to predict the elimination of torcs during various water treatment processes gerrity et al 2012 park et al 2017 the possible correlation of fluence based rate constants between selected fluorescence peaks and individual group iii compounds except tcep was examined in this study fig 4b presents venlafaxine as an example other group iii compounds are shown in fig s9 s10 the k o b s u v h 2 o 2 value of individual group iii compounds was linearly correlated with that of selected fluorescence peaks suggesting that fluorescence may be a useful indicator for group iii compounds removal during uv h2o2 the k o b s u v p d s values of group iii compounds exponentially increased with respect to k o b s u v p d s of selected fluorescence peaks due to the selective oxidizing property of so4 the elimination of compounds that are less reactive with so4 can be eliminated much slower than fluorophores for example only about 28 of gabapentin was removed when 62 76 fluorophores were degraded during uv pds figs s5 and s6 therefore the development of compound specific surrogate model on fluorescence would be required during uv pds 3 6 degradation of torcs during pilot scale uv pds pilot scale uv pds treatment of torcs was conducted at wwtp the concentrations of torcs in wwtp effluent before uv pds treatment are shown in table 2 phenytoin 13 2 ng l and caffeine 71 32 ng l were present at very low initial concentrations which were close to loq and consequently showing large uncertainties therefore the elimination of phenytoin and caffeine was not monitored during pilot testing fig 5 shows the relative removal of torcs during uv only and uv pds processes group i compounds were efficiently removed more than 98 of diclofenac was degraded at 1200 mj cm2 when only uv was applied with the addition of 0 6 mm of pds the same removal of 98 was already achieved at 800 mj cm2 comparable to lab scale experiments the elimination of iopromide and sulfamethoxazole was mainly caused by direct photolysis with 94 and 91 removal at 1200 mj cm2 respectively no significant contribution of so4 was observed to iopromide within experimental uncertainties due to its low k so 4 i e 1 109 m 1 s 1 sulfamethoxazole is highly reactive with so4 i e k so 4 12 5 109 m 1 s 1 mahdi ahmed et al 2012 furthermore the potential inner filter effect of pds was excluded as the uv fluence was adjusted after pds spiking during pilot testing however the removal of sulfamethoxazole was slower during uv pds than direct uv photolysis for unknown reason venlafaxine and metoprolol were removed most efficiently among the group ii and iii compounds which was consistent with the lab scale experiments about 77 of venlafaxine 49 of metoprolol and 27 of carbamazepine were eliminated at 1200 mj cm2 and 0 6 mm pds compounds showing low reactivity toward so4 were less removed for instance about 58 of benzotriazole and 11 of primidone were degraded at 1200 mj cm2 with 0 6 mm pds similar to iopromide the direct photodegradation was mainly responsible for the elimination of benzotriazole due to its low k so 4 i e 1 109 m 1 s 1 fig s11 gabapentin and tcep appeared to be resistant to uv photolysis and uv pds in these experimental conditions the removal pattern of torcs during pilot testing was comparable to lab scale experiments but their removal rates were lower higher concentrations of doc and nitrite were observed during pilot scale tests compared to lab scale experiments resulting in about 1 7 and 5 3 times higher scavenging capacity of the wastewater matrix on so4 table 1 fluorescence intensity was reduced only by 35 54 at 1200 mj cm2 with 0 6 mm pds figure s12 s13 confirming the overall lower oxidation efficiency due to the scavengers during pilot testing 4 conclusion when the same molar dose of pds and h2o2 are applied uv pds can eliminate all torcs more efficiently than uv h2o2 in buffered pure water due to the higher yield of so4 so4 preferentially oxidizes torcs with electron rich moieties e g activated aromatic ring olefines and amines as well as the electron rich site of efom e g fluorophores while oh reacts with almost all organic moieties with nearly diffusion controlled rates high competition between the target torcs and the electron rich site of efom scavenger was observed at low pds dose however the initial oxidant demand was followed by an exponential increase in the fluence based rate constants of most compounds with increasing pds dose in contrast the scavenging impact of the water matrix on oh was constant during uv h2o2 leading to a linear increase of fluence based rate constants with increasing h2o2 dose selectivity of so4 results in more efficient removal of torcs with electron rich moieties by uv pds in wastewater effluent while uv h2o2 better oxidizes compounds with less reactivity toward so4 the scavenging capacities of doc and chloride were calculated to be the highest among the known water parameters during uv h2o2 and uv pds respectively experiments conducted in the presence of individual inorganic species indicated that co3 enhanced the degradation of diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole during both processes chlorine radicals might contribute to the degradation of most compounds during uv pds the efficiency of pilot scale uv pds was affected by the variation of doc and nitrite in wastewater effluent higher uv fluences and oxidant doses are needed to overcome the impact of the water matrix however the energy requirements and the effect of sulfate ion on the salinity of treated water should be evaluated prior to uv pds application in wastewater effluent acknowledgments curtin university curtin international postgraduate research scholarship and water research australia

discussion 3 1 occurrence and removal of antibiotic residues it should be noted that data on the occurrence and fate of antibiotics in the water reclamation plant was recently published tran et al 2016b however data included in the current study was to gain a holistic overview in light of removal efficiency and co occurrence patterns between antibiotic residues and arb args briefly fig 2 shows the variation in the concentrations of antibiotics in raw influent inf the mixed liquor after mle tanks a1 and b1 secondary effluent a2 and mf permeate b2 most target antibiotics except ceftazidime and tylosin were ubiquitously detected in all raw wastewater samples the concentrations of antibiotics in raw influent varied substantially from below method quantification limit mql to a few tens of micrograms per liter for oxytetracycline chlortetracycline tetracycline ciprofloxacin azithromycin clarithromycin sulfamethoxazole minocycline amoxicillin and vancomycin their median concentration in the raw influent appeared to be higher than 1000 ng l fig 2 in contrast the median concentration of trimethoprim lincomycin chloramphenicol sulfamethazine and clindamycin in the raw influent samples was less than 100 ng l fig 2 in general the concentrations of target antibiotics declined significantly after physical and biological treatments at the primary clarifier and mle tanks in cas and mbr systems the median concentrations of the majority of target antibiotics in mixed liquor after mle tank a1 and b1 of cas and mbr systems were below 1000 ng l table s6 supplementary information showed that there was no significant difference t test p 0 05 in the concentrations between mixed liquor a1 and secondary effluent a2 samples in the cas system for most target antibiotics except trimethoprim ciprofloxacin clindamycin azithromycin and chlortetracycline similarly no significant differences in the concentrations between mixed liquor b1 and mf permeate b2 in mbr system were observed for the overwhelming majority of target antibiotics table s6 supplementary information these findings indicate that the secondary clarifier in cas system or mf membrane unit in the mbr system played an insignificant role in the overall removal of antibiotic residues in the wastewater treatment process fig 5 in other words the primary clarifier and mle tanks played a key role in the elimination of target antibiotics in the wastewater treatment processes of the investigated wrp in fact mle tanks in this study consist of anoxic and aerobic tanks which can be deemed as key biological treatment units in the cas and mbr systems for the degradation sorption of antibiotics the apparent negative removal efficiencies of an antibiotic could be a result of the cleavages of its conjugated forms osorio et al 2014 zonja et al 2016a 2016b into the original parent compound by microorganisms and or the grab sampling strategies radjenovic et al 2007 it is noted that the sampling campaign carried out here was by grab sampling i e hydraulic retention time hrt was not strictly considered for sampling within the wastewater treatment plant subsequently this sampling strategy could have led to an apparently false removal efficiency when comparing the concentrations between influent and secondary effluent or mf membrane permeate in general the median overall removal efficiency of most detected antibiotics e g amoxicillin azithromycin ciprofloxacin chloramphenicol meropenem minocycline oxytetracycline sulfamethazine and vancomycin was higher than 70 in both cas and mbr systems while two of other antibiotics i e trimethoprim and lincomycin exhibited persistence in the cas system with median removal efficiency 50 mbr system exhibited higher median removal efficiencies than cas system for many target antibiotics including azithromycin clarithromycin clindamycin chlortetracycline lincomycin sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine oxytetracycline tetracycline and trimethoprim fig 5 the removal of antibiotics in cas and mbr systems is attributed to biodegradation and biosorption onto activated sludge abegglen et al 2009 dorival garcia et al 2013 le minh et al 2010 plumet and gerlier 2005 for these reasons the removal efficiency of antibiotics in biological activated sludge processes seems to depend largely on the physicochemical properties i e pka log kow table s3 supplementary information ionization state chemical structures i e functional groups of target antibiotics and the presence of microbial population in the activated sludge tran and gin 2017 3 2 occurrence removal and identification of arb there was a significant reduction in arb concentrations across the whole treatment train for both the cas and mbr system fig 3 table s7 supplementary information the concentrations of arb in the raw influent ranged between 1 8 104 to 5 6 106 cfu ml with a significant reduction in the mixed liquor after the mle tank site a1 b1 ranging from 6 5 102 to 9 6 104 cfu ml 0 6 2 4 log removal value lrv in the cas system and from below method detection limit mdl to 1 4 105 cfu ml 0 1 5 0 lrv in the mbr system fig 3 fig 6 table s7 the concentration range of arb in the secondary effluent of the cas train site a2 was from mdl to 4 0 104 cfu ml with the removal efficiency for the secondary clarifier ranging from 0 1 to 4 1 lrv and the cumulative removal efficiency for the whole cas system ranging from 1 0 lrv to 5 3 lrv fig 3 fig 6 table s7 in the mbr system the concentration range of arb in the effluent of the microfiltration mf membrane unit site b2 resulted in complete removal of arb with removal efficiency of majority of arb ranging from 2 7 to 5 4 lrv and the cumulative removal efficiency for the whole mbr system ranging from 5 to 7 1 lrv this showed that the physical and biological treatment in the primary clarifier and mle tank in both the cas and mbr systems played an important role in the significant reduction up to 5 0 lrv of arb compared to the secondary clarifier treatment step up to 4 1 lrv fig 6 table s7 however the microfiltration membrane was observed to be the most efficient treatment with complete removal of arb up to 5 4 lrv which is significantly higher than removal in the secondary clarifier in the cas system p 0 05 table s8 it is worth noting that no significant differences of removal efficiency among bacteria resistant to 10 different target antibiotics were found in this study data not shown this suggests that the removal of all arb in this study was mainly due to the removal of total bacteria in both cas and mbr treatment systems this is consistent with the concentrations of 16s rrna gene representing the abundance of total bacteria detected in these water samples our qpcr quantification showed that removal efficiency of 16s rrna gene was highest in the mf permeate 1 6 3 6 lrv compared to the pc mle tank p 0 05 table s8 supplementary information and the secondary effluent fig 7 removal efficiency of arb by mf in this study showed a similar efficiency to a report where no e coli was detected in the permeate with an average log removal of 6 1 marti et al 2011 however it is worth noting that this membrane filtration stage can only retain bacteria which are larger than the pore size of the membrane i e 0 4 μm and can grow on lb agar in the scope of this study viruses bacteriophage and bacteria that were not retained by the membrane or other non culturable microorganisms were not considered and could possibly still be present in the effluent the cas treatment process showed high efficiency at removing total bacteria growing on unsupplemented lb media 2 4 log removal and arb resistant to ciprofloxacin 3 2 log removal erythromycin 2 4 log removal and clindamycin 2 3 log reduction with moderate reductions in arb resistant to other antibiotics 1 3 2 4 log removal value fig 6 table s7 on average the log removal values of total bacteria detected in our study were higher than in a wastewater treatment plant in saudi arabia which reported an average reduction of 1 4 logs after cas treatment al jassim et al 2015 culturing and phylogenetic analysis of arb isolates showed that aeromonas was the most abundant group of the arb 40 50 where n 50 per sampling point recovered in both the mixed liquor tanks sites a1 b1 and the secondary clarifier in cas system site a2 noting that no arb was detected in the mf permeate site b2 fig s1 table s11 supplementary information this was interesting given that the enterobacteriaceae group was more abundant 50 in the influent samples than aeromonas 30 we detected more pseudomonas resistant isolates in the effluent after pc mle treatment sites a1 and b1 3 10 than in the influent samples the enrichment of aeromonas and pseudomonas in the effluent of cas system was documented by ye and zhang 2013 using 16s rrna gene sequencing we found that aeromonas isolates cultured from a1 n 13 grew on plates containing 9 of the 10 antibiotics used in this study except for meropenem as members of aeromonas spp are the opportunistic food pathogens of humans and animals infections by these bacteria do not cause any serious effects to humans and animal health but they can be a potential vector of disseminating arg in the environment berendonk et al 2015 3 3 occurrence and removal of args in general all gene targets were detected in the raw wastewater samples except for mef a e gene fig 4 table s9 the highest concentrations of 16s rrna genes was detected in the influent ranging from 1 1 107 to 1 9 108 gene copy number gcn ml while other args such as tet o tet m sul1 sul2 ermb aac 6 ib and inti1 were detected at concentrations ranging from 2 4 104 to 2 5 107 gcn ml the rest of the arg genes including bla kpc bla ndm bla shv bla ctx m cfr dfra vana qnra and qnrb were detected at lower concentrations ranging from 10 to 1 3 105 gcn ml fig 4 table s9 the average concentration of 16s rrna genes representing the total bacteria population was 7 5 107 gcn ml which was about 1 2 orders of magnitude less than those reported from china and us chen and zhang 2013b munir et al 2011 however in comparison to the same studies the concentrations of tet and sul genes in our study fell in a similar range from 106 to 5 107 gcn ml chen and zhang 2013a b munir et al 2011 in another study of wwtps nearby the baltic sea north europe laht et al 2014 the concentrations of beta lactamase genes such as bla ctx m bla shv in raw wastewater were about 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than our results while those of sul1 sul2 and tet m were 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than those detected in singapore the levels of 16s rrna gene and all arg genes detected in the mixed liquor after the mle tank a1 and b1 ranged from mql to 1 5 107 gcn ml for the cas train and from mql to 1 8 107 gcn ml for the mbr train fig 4 table s9 this corresponded to removal efficiencies of the target antibiotic resistance genes up to 4 0 log removal value lrv for the mle effluent a1 in cas and up to 4 2 lrv for the mle effluent b1 in mbr respectively fig 7 table s9 the poor removal of 16s rrna and arg genes is attributed to the physical and biological processes in the primary clarifier and mle anoxic aerobic tanks which were observed to play an important role in the decline in levels of the 17 antibiotic residues and 10 antibiotic resistant bacteria at sites a1 and b1 in fact the antibiotic residues as selective pressure for arb were removed significantly in the mixed liquor after the mle tank which may have led to the reduction in arb and arg in the water samples in addition the mle anoxic aerobic tanks may not provide good conditions for the proliferation of arg carrying bacteria and hence the replication and dissemination of arg were not favored du et al 2015 pei et al 2007 after the primary clarifier and mle processes results showed that there was no significant reduction of almost args at the effluent of the secondary clarifier in the cas train site a2 except for sul2 while significant decreases about 2 orders of magnitude in the concentrations of 16s rrna genes and many args p 0 01 table s10 including aac 6 ib bla ctx m bla shv ermb sul1 sul2 tet m tet o and inti1 were found in the permeate of the microfiltration membrane unit site b2 in the mbr train with the removal efficiency up to 4 8 lrv fig 7 table s9 this finding is consistent with previous studies where membrane filtration was demonstrated to have a high capability to separate microorganisms and genes from the filtrate and therefore keeping the concentrations of arb and args low in the mbr effluent du et al 2015 munir et al 2011 however unlike arb which were completely removed by mbr treatment some antibiotic resistance genes such as bla kpc bla ndm bla shv ermb inti1 sul1 and teto were still detected at average concentrations of 19 0 1 2 3 6 250 0 29 0 9 0 103 and 5 6 103 gcn ml respectively fig 4 table s9 it is possible that these genes existed as free dna without any association to sheltering cells or were present in viruses bacteriophages and bacteria which are smaller than membrane pore size and thus not retained by the membrane or non culturable bacteria which were not measured in this study 3 4 relationships among antibiotic residues arb and arg the principal component analysis pca was used to investigate the relationships among the target antibiotic resistance components i e ab arb arg and inti1 since the total number of water samples n 20 used in this study was less than the total number of antibiotic resistance components including 19 antibiotic residues 10 arb 15 arg and inti1 gene n 45 it was not recommended to perform only one pca for all of these components instead 4 groups of related antibiotic residues arb and args were selected to be presented in 4 pca plots fig 8 a b 8c 8d the antibiotic resistance components skewed toward the influent but were in opposite direction for all the treated samples relative to the origin this is not surprising due to the high abundance of antibiotic residues arb and args in the influent as compared to water samples at the various treatment stages of pc mle secondary clarifier in cas system and mf in mbr system in general the results showed that there are no clear relationships between the antibiotic residues and corresponding arb and args except for trimethoprim sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole fig 8b the clustering pattern between the concentrations of trimethoprim sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole and the level of arb resistant to trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole mix may indicate a potential correlation supporting the hypothesis that the abundance of these antibiotic residues acts as selective pressure contributing to the overall resistance level to these antibiotics in the wastewater and treated water samples in addition the vectors of some corresponding args such as aac 6 ib dfra sul1 and sul2 were found to be clustered to each other and this was consistent with the co existence of antibiotic residues and bacteria resistant to amikacin trimethoprim sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole across all wastewater samples the integrase class 1 gene intl1 tended to clustered with selected args such as bla kpc bla ndm1 bla ctx m qnra aac 6 ib drfa sul1 and sul2 fig 8a and 8b this result indicates a possible relatedness between these args and integrase suggesting potential dissemination of the antibiotic resistance genes via horizontal gene transfer in bacterial communities during the treatment processes for some antibiotic groups such as tetracycline chlortetracycline vancomycin minocycline trimethoprim sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole individual components tended to clustered with each other for the same group of antibiotic resistance components e g antibiotic residues cluster with other antibiotic residues arg genes cluster with other genes and arb cluster with other arb but were separate for those in different groups although these differences were not significant in statistical analysis fig 8b and d this probably resulted from the different removal efficiencies of each treatment step on individual antibiotic resistance components suggesting that the physical chemical and biological conditions of treatment processes could be optimized further to obtain the best removal of selected groups of antibiotic residues antimicrobial resistant bacteria and genes 4 conclusions antibiotic resistance has become one of the biggest threats to human and environmental health municipal wastewater receiving discharges from residential hospital and agricultural areas can be hotspot environments for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance to receiving waters information on the co occurrences of the three important components of antibiotic resistance i e antibiotic residues ab arb and args in the water samples is essential to understand the removal efficacy of antimicrobial resistance in these environments and the potential correlations of the amr components this study compared different classes of ab arb and args in a water reclamation treatment plant after cas and mbr treatment processes with the following main findings this study provided comprehensive baseline data on the occurrence and removal of antibiotic resistance vectors in wastewater and treated effluents from a water reclamation plant in a tropical southeast asian country the physical and biological treatments in the primary clarifier and mle anoxic aerobic tanks played an important role in eliminating most of the ab arb and args after these treatment stages the majority of amr components were removed significantly with more than 70 for antibiotic residues up to 5 0 log removal value lrv for arb and up to 4 2 lrv for arg the microfiltration membrane treatment was observed to completely remove arb effectively reducing concentration of args up to 4 8 lrv for mbr treatment and up to 7 1 lrv for the whole mrb train but insignificantly decreasing concentrations of antibiotic residues in comparison to the treatment of the secondary clarifier a detectable quantity of selected args up to 103 gcn ml persisted in the mf permeate which could possibly be in free dna form or associated with other non retained microorganisms therefore further studies should focus on additional treatment to

19322,antibiotic residues antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args are considered new classes of water contaminants due to their potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health this paper provides comprehensive data on the occurrences of 19 antibiotics bacteria resistant to 10 antibiotics and 15 args in raw influent and different treatment stages of conventional activated sludge cas and membrane bioreactor mbr systems seventeen out of the 19 target antibiotics were detected in raw influent with concentrations of up to ten micrograms per liter concentrations of antibiotics measured in the secondary effluent were much lower compared to those in the raw influent among the antibiotics amoxicillin azithromycin ciprofloxacin chloramphenicol meropenem minocycline oxytetracycline sulfamethazine and vancomycin had highest removal by cas or mbr systems with median removal efficiency re 70 while trimethoprim and lincomycin were recalcitrant in the cas system with median re 50 similarly the target arb and args were omnipresent in the raw influent samples with average concentrations as high as 2 6 106 cfu ml and 2 0 107 gene copies ml respectively the concentrations of arb in secondary effluent of the cas system declined relative to the raw influent i e lower than raw influent by 2 3 orders of magnitude and no arb were detected in

public and environmental health for example a detection frequency of 50 has been observed for klebsiella pneumoniae showing resistance to carbapenems and third generation cephalosporins in the south east asia region cdc 2013 who 2014 it is widely believed that continuous improper and high usage of antibiotics in hospitals the general population and livestock aquaculture rearing practices have

reclamation and treatment processes to counter water stress hence understanding the co occurrence patterns and fate of ab arb and args in the wastewater treatment train will help to shed light on the extent of amr removal by current wastewater treatment technology employed in local municipal wwtp this study compares the presence of several different classes of ab arb and args in wastewaters along parallel cas and mbr treatment trains in a water reclamation plant wrp the concentrations of 19 antibiotics arb resistant to 10 antibiotics and 15 arg targets were measured using hplc ms ms arb culture based methods and quantitative pcr assay respectively we investigated the removal efficiencies of these antibiotic resistance components after wastewater treatment processes in parallel cas and mbr systems at the same water reclamation plant based on these datasets and the correlations among the ab arb args and the inti1 gene in wastewater along the different treatment trains we were able to assess the type of antibiotic resistance components that persist in the effluents 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sample collection five types of wastewater samples were collected from

target antibiotics in the dissolved phase of wastewater samples were measured using solid phase extraction spe coupled with high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms and isotope dilution the methodology of sample pretreatment was adopted from our earlier studies tran et al 2016a tran et al 2016b briefly 100 ml of raw wastewater or 250 ml of treated wastewater

for 15 s 60 c for 1 min and 95 c for 15 s only amplicons with a single peak in the melting curve analysis were considered as specific amplified products of targeted genes and taken into account for arg quantification all qpcr assays were performed according to the manufacturer s specifications calculation of the absolute gene copies followed previously described procedures le et al 2014 2016 relative gene abundance was calculated by normalizing the absolute number of arg copies to that of 16s rrna gene copies 2 5 calculations of removal efficiencies removal efficiency of antibiotic

the raw influent appeared to be higher than 1000 ng l fig 2 in contrast the median concentration of trimethoprim lincomycin chloramphenicol sulfamethazine and clindamycin in the raw influent samples was less than 100 ng l fig 2 in general the concentrations of target antibiotics declined significantly after physical and biological treatments at the primary clarifier and mle tanks in cas and mbr systems the median concentrations of the majority of target antibiotics in mixed liquor after mle tank a1 and b1 of cas and mbr systems were below 1000 ng l table s6 supplementary information showed that there was no significant difference t test p 0 05 in the concentrations between mixed liquor a1 and secondary effluent a2 samples in the cas system for most target antibiotics except trimethoprim ciprofloxacin clindamycin azithromycin and chlortetracycline similarly no significant differences in the concentrations between mixed liquor b1 and mf permeate b2 in mbr system were observed for the overwhelming majority of target antibiotics table s6 supplementary information these findings indicate that the secondary clarifier in cas system or mf membrane unit in the mbr system played an insignificant role in the overall removal of antibiotic residues in the wastewater treatment process fig 5 in other words the primary clarifier and mle tanks played a key role in the elimination of target antibiotics in the wastewater treatment processes of the investigated wrp in fact mle tanks in this study consist of anoxic and aerobic tanks which can be deemed as key biological treatment units in the cas and mbr systems for the degradation sorption of antibiotics the apparent negative removal efficiencies of an antibiotic could be a result of the cleavages of its conjugated forms osorio et al 2014 zonja et al 2016a 2016b into the original parent compound by microorganisms and or the grab sampling strategies radjenovic et al 2007 it is noted that the sampling campaign carried out here was by grab sampling i e hydraulic retention time hrt was not strictly considered for sampling within the wastewater treatment plant subsequently this sampling strategy could have led to an apparently false removal efficiency when comparing the concentrations between influent and secondary effluent or mf membrane permeate in general the median overall removal efficiency of most detected antibiotics e g amoxicillin azithromycin ciprofloxacin chloramphenicol meropenem minocycline oxytetracycline sulfamethazine and vancomycin was higher than 70 in both cas and mbr systems while two of other antibiotics i e trimethoprim and lincomycin exhibited persistence in the cas system with median removal efficiency 50 mbr system exhibited higher median removal efficiencies than cas system for many target antibiotics including azithromycin clarithromycin clindamycin chlortetracycline lincomycin sulfamethoxazole sulfamethazine oxytetracycline tetracycline and trimethoprim fig 5 the removal of antibiotics in cas and mbr systems is attributed to biodegradation and biosorption onto activated sludge abegglen et al 2009 dorival garcia et al 2013 le minh et al 2010 plumet and gerlier 2005 for these reasons the removal efficiency of antibiotics in biological activated sludge processes seems to depend largely on the physicochemical properties i e pka log kow table s3 supplementary information ionization state chemical structures i e functional groups of target antibiotics and the presence of microbial population in the activated sludge tran and gin 2017 3 2 occurrence removal and identification of arb there was a significant reduction in arb concentrations across the whole treatment train for both the cas and mbr system fig 3 table s7 supplementary information the concentrations of arb in the raw influent ranged between 1 8 104 to 5 6 106 cfu ml with a significant reduction in the mixed liquor after the mle tank site a1 b1 ranging from 6 5 102 to 9 6 104 cfu ml 0 6 2 4 log removal value lrv in the cas system and from below method detection limit mdl to 1 4 105 cfu ml 0 1 5 0 lrv in the mbr system fig 3 fig 6 table s7 the concentration range of arb in the secondary effluent of the cas train site a2 was from mdl to 4 0 104 cfu ml with the removal efficiency for the secondary clarifier ranging from 0 1 to 4 1 lrv and the cumulative removal efficiency for the whole cas system ranging from 1 0 lrv to 5 3 lrv fig 3 fig 6 table s7 in the mbr system the concentration range of arb in the effluent of the microfiltration mf membrane unit site b2 resulted in complete removal of arb with removal efficiency of majority of arb ranging from 2 7 to 5 4 lrv and the cumulative removal efficiency for the whole mbr system ranging from 5 to 7 1 lrv this showed that the physical and biological treatment in the primary clarifier and mle tank in both the cas and mbr systems played an important role in the significant reduction up to 5 0 lrv of arb compared to the secondary clarifier treatment step up to 4 1 lrv fig 6 table s7 however the microfiltration membrane was observed to be the most efficient treatment with complete removal of arb up to 5 4 lrv which is significantly higher than removal in the secondary clarifier in the cas system p 0 05 table s8 it is worth noting that no significant differences of removal efficiency among bacteria resistant to 10 different target antibiotics were found in this study data not shown this suggests that the removal of all arb in this study was mainly due to the removal of total bacteria in both cas and mbr treatment systems this is consistent with the concentrations of 16s rrna gene representing the abundance of total bacteria detected in these water samples our qpcr quantification showed that removal efficiency of 16s rrna gene was highest in the mf permeate 1 6 3 6 lrv compared to the pc mle tank p 0 05 table s8 supplementary information and the secondary effluent fig 7 removal efficiency of arb by mf in this study showed a similar efficiency to a report where no e coli was detected in the permeate with an average log removal of 6 1 marti et al 2011 however it is worth noting that this membrane filtration stage can only retain bacteria which are larger than the pore size of the membrane i e 0 4 μm and can grow on lb agar in the scope of this study viruses bacteriophage and bacteria that were not retained by the membrane or other non culturable microorganisms were not considered and could possibly still be present in the effluent the cas treatment process showed high efficiency at removing total bacteria growing on unsupplemented lb media 2 4 log removal and arb resistant to ciprofloxacin 3 2 log removal erythromycin 2 4 log removal and clindamycin 2 3 log reduction with moderate reductions in arb resistant to other antibiotics 1 3 2 4 log removal value fig 6 table s7 on average the log removal values of total bacteria detected in our study were higher than in a wastewater treatment plant in saudi arabia which reported an average reduction of 1 4 logs after cas treatment al jassim et al 2015 culturing and phylogenetic analysis of arb isolates showed that aeromonas was the most abundant group of the arb 40 50 where n 50 per sampling point recovered in both the mixed liquor tanks sites a1 b1 and the secondary clarifier in cas system site a2 noting that no arb was detected in the mf permeate site b2 fig s1 table s11 supplementary information this was interesting given that the enterobacteriaceae group was more abundant 50 in the influent samples than aeromonas 30 we detected more pseudomonas resistant isolates in the effluent after pc mle treatment sites a1 and b1 3 10 than in the influent samples the enrichment of aeromonas and pseudomonas in the effluent of cas system was documented by ye and zhang 2013 using 16s rrna gene sequencing we found that aeromonas isolates cultured from a1 n 13 grew on plates containing 9 of the 10 antibiotics used in this study except for meropenem as members of aeromonas spp are the opportunistic food pathogens of humans and animals infections by these bacteria do not cause any serious effects to humans and animal health but they can be a potential vector of disseminating arg in the environment berendonk et al 2015 3 3 occurrence and removal of args in general all gene targets were detected in the raw wastewater samples except for mef a e gene fig 4 table s9 the highest concentrations of 16s rrna genes was detected in the influent ranging from 1 1 107 to 1 9 108 gene copy number gcn ml while other args such as tet o tet m sul1 sul2 ermb aac 6 ib and inti1 were detected at concentrations ranging from 2 4 104 to 2 5 107 gcn ml the rest of the arg genes including bla kpc bla ndm bla shv bla ctx m cfr dfra vana qnra and qnrb were detected at lower concentrations ranging from 10 to 1 3 105 gcn ml fig 4 table s9 the average concentration of 16s rrna genes representing the total bacteria population was 7 5 107 gcn ml which was about 1 2 orders of magnitude less than those reported from china and us chen and zhang 2013b munir et al 2011 however in comparison to the same studies the concentrations of tet and sul genes in our study fell in a similar range from 106 to 5 107 gcn ml chen and zhang 2013a b munir et al 2011 in another study of wwtps nearby the baltic sea north europe laht et al 2014 the concentrations of beta lactamase genes such as bla ctx m bla shv in raw wastewater were about 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than our results while those of sul1 sul2 and tet m were 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than those detected in singapore the levels of 16s rrna gene and all arg genes detected in the mixed liquor after the mle tank a1 and b1 ranged from mql to 1 5 107 gcn ml for the cas train and from mql to 1 8 107 gcn ml for the mbr train fig 4 table s9 this corresponded to removal efficiencies of the target antibiotic resistance genes up to 4 0 log removal value lrv for the mle effluent a1 in cas and up to 4 2 lrv for the mle effluent b1 in mbr respectively fig 7 table s9 the poor removal of 16s rrna and arg genes is attributed to the physical and biological processes in the primary clarifier and mle anoxic aerobic tanks which were observed to play an important role in the decline in levels of the 17 antibiotic residues and 10 antibiotic resistant bacteria at sites a1 and b1 in fact the antibiotic residues as selective pressure for arb were removed significantly in the mixed liquor after the mle tank which may have led to the reduction in arb and arg in the water samples in addition the mle anoxic aerobic tanks may not provide good conditions for the proliferation of arg carrying bacteria and hence the replication and dissemination of arg were not favored du et al 2015 pei et al 2007 after the primary clarifier and mle processes results showed that there was no significant reduction of almost args at the effluent of the secondary clarifier in the cas train site a2 except for sul2 while significant decreases about 2 orders of magnitude in the concentrations of 16s rrna genes and many args p 0 01 table s10 including aac 6 ib bla ctx m bla shv ermb sul1 sul2 tet m tet o and inti1 were found in the permeate of the microfiltration membrane unit site b2 in the mbr train with the removal efficiency up to 4 8 lrv fig 7 table s9 this finding is consistent with previous studies where membrane filtration was demonstrated to have a high capability to separate microorganisms and genes from the filtrate and therefore keeping the concentrations of arb and args low in the mbr effluent du et al 2015 munir et al 2011 however unlike arb which were completely removed by mbr treatment some antibiotic resistance genes such as bla kpc bla ndm bla shv ermb inti1 sul1 and teto were still detected at average concentrations of 19 0 1 2 3 6 250 0 29 0 9 0 103 and 5 6 103 gcn ml respectively fig 4 table s9 it is possible that these genes existed as free dna without any association to sheltering cells or were present in viruses bacteriophages and bacteria which are smaller than membrane pore size and thus not retained by the membrane or non culturable bacteria which were not measured in this study 3 4 relationships among antibiotic residues arb and arg the principal component analysis pca was used to investigate the relationships among the target antibiotic resistance components i e ab arb arg and inti1 since the total number of water samples n 20 used in this study was less than the total number of antibiotic resistance components including 19 antibiotic residues 10 arb 15 arg and inti1 gene n 45 it was not recommended to perform only one pca for all of these components instead 4 groups of related antibiotic residues arb and args were selected to be presented in 4 pca plots fig 8 a b 8c 8d the antibiotic resistance components skewed toward the influent but were in opposite direction for all the treated samples relative to the origin this is not surprising due to the high abundance of antibiotic residues arb and args in the influent as compared to water samples at the various treatment stages of pc mle secondary clarifier in cas system and mf in mbr system in general the results showed that there are no clear relationships between the antibiotic residues and corresponding arb and args except for trimethoprim sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole fig 8b the clustering pattern between the concentrations of trimethoprim sulfamethazine sulfamethoxazole and the level of arb resistant to trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole mix may indicate a potential correlation supporting the hypothesis that the abundance of these antibiotic residues acts as selective pressure contributing to the overall resistance level to these antibiotics in the wastewater and treated water samples in addition the vectors of some corresponding args such as aac 6 ib dfra sul1 and sul2 were found to be clustered to each other and this was consistent with the co existence of antibiotic residues and bacteria resistant to amikacin trimethoprim sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole across all wastewater samples the integrase class 1 gene intl1 tended to clustered with selected args such as bla kpc bla ndm1 bla ctx m qnra aac 6 ib drfa sul1 and sul2 fig 8a and 8b this result indicates a possible relatedness between these args and integrase suggesting potential dissemination of the antibiotic resistance genes via horizontal gene transfer in bacterial communities during the treatment processes for some antibiotic groups such as tetracycline chlortetracycline vancomycin minocycline trimethoprim sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole individual components tended to clustered with each other for the same group of antibiotic resistance components e g antibiotic residues cluster with other antibiotic residues arg genes cluster with other genes and arb cluster with other arb but were separate for those in different groups although these differences were not significant in statistical analysis fig 8b and d this probably resulted from the different removal efficiencies of each treatment step on individual antibiotic resistance components suggesting that the physical chemical and biological conditions of treatment processes could be optimized further to obtain the best removal of selected groups of antibiotic residues antimicrobial resistant bacteria and genes 4 conclusions antibiotic resistance has become one of the biggest threats to human and environmental health municipal wastewater receiving discharges from residential hospital and agricultural areas can be hotspot environments for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance to receiving waters information on the co occurrences of the three important components of antibiotic resistance i e antibiotic residues ab arb and args in the water samples is essential to understand the removal efficacy of antimicrobial resistance in these environments and the potential correlations of the amr components this study compared different classes of ab arb and args in a water reclamation treatment plant after cas and mbr treatment processes with the following main findings this study provided comprehensive baseline data on the occurrence and removal of antibiotic resistance vectors in wastewater and treated effluents from a water reclamation plant in a tropical southeast asian country the physical and biological treatments in the primary clarifier and mle anoxic aerobic tanks played an important role in eliminating most of the ab arb and args after these treatment stages the majority of amr components were removed significantly with more than 70 for antibiotic residues up to 5 0 log removal value lrv for arb and up to 4 2 lrv for arg the microfiltration membrane treatment was observed to completely remove arb effectively reducing concentration of args up to 4 8 lrv for mbr treatment and up to 7 1 lrv for the whole mrb train but insignificantly decreasing concentrations of antibiotic residues in comparison to the treatment of the secondary clarifier a detectable quantity of selected args up to 103 gcn ml persisted in the mf permeate which could possibly be in free dna form or associated with other non retained microorganisms therefore further studies should focus on additional treatment to the mbr process for efficient removal of free dna in the treated wastewater acknowledgements funding was provided by the public utilities board pub administered under the environment water industry

19323,this paper studies the hydraulic performance of two swales composed of filters for stormwater management filtering swales in a large scale experimental study and compares them to the performance of a swale composed of traditional bioretention soil bioswale using experimental data dimensionless formulations are derived to reflect the influence of swale design parameters on hydraulic performance the developed formulas can be used to design swales accounting for practical factors for decision makers such as local rainfall patterns volume capture requirements and drainage area the experimental data show that while the bioswale is characterized by large overland flows the tested filtering swales manage in the majority of cases the complete inflow volume without overland flow the longitudinal slope of the swales does not affect the infiltration capacity of the filtering swales for the tested experimental boundary conditions only the inflow rate and media water content are found to be statistically significant as an example filtering swales tested in this study captured 90 of the runoff generated by a 12 2 mm h storm approximately a 5 year return period 1 h duration storm event in the city of trondheim on a road 40 times larger than the swale this highlights the capacity of such swales for handling infrequent events keywords stormwater runoff roadside filters hydrological balance swale design infiltration performance 1 introduction urban runoff is well known for carrying a wide range of pollutants hoffman et al 1985 huber et al 2016c lefevre et al 2014 and the sources of pollution differ across locations and seasons gunawardana et al 2014 moghadas et al 2015 infiltration based solutions for the management of urban runoff have shown a good performance with regard to pollution mitigation and volume reduction i e retention generally treatment swales represent such an infiltration based solution adopted as a low tech practice to deal with roadway runoff burack et al 2008 they collect polluted runoff generated on impervious surfaces such as roads and convey it to a downstream wastewater network or a receiving water after a minimum hydraulic residence time within the swale sedimentation infiltration filtration adsorption and vegetation uptake are the main processes occurring in these systems therefore they provide multiple environmental benefits such as volume retention pollutant removal and percolation which helps to maintain the pre development hydrologic balance of a site cizek and hunt 2013 factors such as the ratio of the impervious road area to the swale area the size of the storm event and the longitudinal slope determine the overland discharge and flow depth and hence the flow characteristics winston et al 2016 the overland flow in swales can be either super or subcritical supercritical flows increase erosion reduce volume and pollution retention and should therefore be avoided subcritical flows can be obtained by constructing specific design elements increasing the hydraulic resistance such design elements include check dams e g davis et al 2012 winston et al 2018 stones e g narsimlu et al 2004 and grass coverage e g mishra et al 2006 the embankment slopes of swales can provide a bonus for volume retention which in turn is positively impacted by the infiltration capacity of the media soil moisture deficit and side slope length garcía serrana et al 2017 for vegetated swales the type of vegetation such as deep rooted grass species and proliferation of root and earthworm channels improve infiltration abu zreig et al 2004 blanco canqui et al 2004 regarding soil composition bioswales are generally composed of soils such as loamy sands loams or sandy loams providing infiltration rates higher than recommended by bio filter design guidelines le coustumer et al 2009 in some cases larger infiltration capacities are required to 1 handle larger runoff events 2 consider cold climate constraints such as reduced winter infiltration capacity paus and braskerud 2014 or 3 runoff from large impervious areas to swales by keeping a certain removal capacity to meet discharge regulations huber et al 2016b in addition a good drainage capacity guarantees low initial moisture in the media which has been shown to positively impact volume retention lucke et al 2014 these facts have motivated the investigation of materials for the construction of swales offering an added performance in terms of filtration capacity pollutant removal or both kalmykova et al 2008 wium andersen et al 2012 ilyas and muthanna 2017 huber et al 2016a the end user urban drainage engineer practitioner is generally interested in mathematical models that reconcile laboratory findings to field implementation for example trava is a 1 d deterministic model based on green ampt and kinematic wave equations for non submerged flow conditions and simulates the generation of runoff and sediment transport deletic 2001 the comparison of simulation results with data from laboratory and field experiments showed that the hydraulic conductivity of the soil is the most sensitive parameter in the simulations deletic 2005 deletic and fletcher 2006b moreover the application of vfsmod muñoz carpena et al 1999 a model for similar purposes showed that the type of soil and its initial water content determines the runoff retention the application of vfsmod further showed grass spacing to be an important parameter regarding sediment removal han et al 2005 both these models require extensive input parameters which are typically not available for the engineers designing swales for stormwater management purposes this makes empirical models generally more attractive for the user because of their simplicity in input parameters while providing good predictions of for example trapping efficiency for specific swale designs and residence times bäckström 2002 winston et al 2016 this motivation based on the end user applicability resulted in testing a series of empirical equations with the aim to find the dominant design factors more specifically the research questions in this study are as follows 1 what are the hydrological benefits of adsorbent amended filters for roadside filters referred to as filtering swales from this point on in comparison to bioswales 2 which are the dominant design factors influencing the hydrological response of filtering swales 3 how can hydrological benefits be compared using a practical approach such as the capture of storm events in order to answer these questions a full scale swale setup was designed to evaluate factors determining the hydrological balance of swales composed of filters studied by monrabal martinez et al 2017 these filters are constructed with a pure sand which was amended with either olivine or pine bark at the first phase of column scale tests the filters showed high removal rates for the fours metals of concern cu pb ni and zn the column test also included several different hydraulic loadings and periods of infrequent storm events rapid inflows followed by longer dry periods these results in turn were the motivation for the present study to understand the hydrological response of full scale filters in order to confirm their potential for use in stormwater management the experimental data was used to propose empirical equations for the evaluation of hydrological processes at the full scale for the filters also including a comparison with a swale composed of commonly used soil for bioretention the results from this study provides new and much needed improved understanding of the dominant processes and factors for infiltration based treatment filters and bioswales 2 material and methods three tiltable 500 cm long 45 cm deep and 80 cm wide swales see fig 1 were built at the hydraulic laboratory of the norwegian university of science and technology ntnu each swale had an underdrain layer composed of two perforated pipes with a diameter of 5 cm embedded in a 10 cm thick gravel layer filtering swale 1 was composed of a clean homogeneous sand layer with a thickness of d 40 cm d50 0 33 mm which is the intercept for 50 of the cumulative mass of the particle size distribution uniformity coefficient d60 d10 2 22 overlying a 5 cm thick layer of pine bark filtering swale 2 was composed of the same 40 cm quartz sand layer but was overlying a 5 cm thick layer of granulated olivine d50 1 4 mm uniformity coefficient 1 66 swale 3 built as bioswale had its entire 45 cm thickness composed of a traditional soil for bioretention classified as a sandy loam usda 2017 swales 1 and 2 were superficially protected with boulders d50 70 mm approximately 256 boulders m2 placed to reduce filter exposure swale 3 was seeded 10 gr m2 with festuca rubra rubra leik a cold tolerant species with a high salinity tolerance which is favourable for roadside vegetation high pressure sodium lamps were arranged in order to provide a photosynthetic active radiation of approximately 300 w m2 during 18 h day the height of grass was intended at 7 cm during the experiments unlike most roadside swales the swale media in this study were not mechanically compacted during filling as they are meant for infiltrating runoff and no traffic is expected over them each swale was equipped with 6 profile probes pr2 4 sdi 12 from delta t devices ltd and each profile had three moisture dielectric sensors distributed along the vertical axis fig 1 resulting in a total of 18 moisture sensors per swale the moisture sensors measured the permittivity of the surrounding soils with a sampling frequency of 0 5 hz and were specifically calibrated for each media errors of 4 including installation and sampling errors can be expected according to the manufacturer of the sensors each swale was divided in 18 volumetric sectors with a volume vi m3 according to the distribution of the media moisture sensors the total moisture present in the swale at time t vw t m3 was computed as 1 v w t i 1 18 θ i t v i where θi t is the volumetric water content in sector i measured by the associated moisture sensor at time t for the determination of the saturated moisture content vsat m3 by equation 1 the swales were flooded by closing the valve on the underdrain during the experiments the degree of saturation in the swale at time t sr t was defined as the ratio of the total moisture at time t vw t and the saturated water content of the swale vsat a 1 m3 tank filled with tap water served as upstream reservoir for the experiments from the tank the water was pumped into a small reservoir at the upstream end of the swale that was equipped with a rectangular weir allowing for an even distribution of the inflow run in over the swale width the inflow rates were measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter siemens sitrans fm mag 5000 accuracy 0 4 of the flow rate and controlled with a valve the overland flow at the end of the swale run out and the infiltrated water were collected separately in two downstream tanks with volumes of 0 72 m3 1 1 m wide 1 1 m long and 0 6 m high and 0 21 m3 0 5 m diameter and 1 1 m high respectively the water surface level in these tanks was measured with two ultrasonic sensors microsonic mic 130 iu tc average resolution 0 4 mm and 1 accuracy with a sampling frequency of 1 hz allowing for the determination of the accumulated water volume in the tanks as a function of time due to volume limitations of the downstream tanks they had to be emptied during some experiments as a consequence linear extrapolation based on previous filling data was used in order to fill the data gap during emptying the experiments with swales 1 3 were carried out for a range of boundary conditions table 1 by varying the initial degree of saturation sr0 the longitudinal slope j and the inflow rate qrun in each filter media was characterized by its saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat m s which was determined based on three measurements along its length using the mpd infiltrometer method ahmed et al 2015 swale slopes of 2 3 and 4 were used in the experiments such slopes are common in road design in norway vegvesen 2008 the ratio i p between impervious i and pervious areas p is often used to size systems for stormwater runoff khan et al 2012 in order to mimic practical implications qrun in was chosen as the equivalent runoff generated by an event with a given storm intensity si mm h occurring over an impervious area i p times as large as the swale area as m2 by using the following relationship which is based on the rational method kuichling 1889 2 s i q r u n i n c i p 1 a s 36 10 5 the empirical runoff coefficient c can be assumed to be close to 1 because of the imperviousness of road surfaces equation 2 considers also the precipitation that falls on the swale itself which might be of relevance for small i p ratios the inflow rates ranged from 0 2 10 3 m3 s to 1 10 3 m3 s which corresponds for an i p 40 and c 0 9 with storm intensities from 5 to 25 mm h respectively each test run was subdivided into a pre loading quasi equilibrium and drainage phase fig 2 the pre loading phase was defined as the time required to reach quasi equilibrium saturation of the soil from the start of water inflow during this phase the water mainly filled the non saturated pore space in the media which explains the quicker increase in the degree of saturation of the media δs r with regard to the subsequent phase the quasi equilibrium condition was assumed to be reached when δs r was less than 4 in four consecutive minutes this definition was adopted in order to avoid an early change of phase because δs r followed in some cases a distribution with several steps during the preloading phase fig 2b during the quasi equilibrium phase the media moisture was nearly constant and the run in water could be computed as the sum of the infiltration and run out water collected downstream the quasi equilibrium phase was hence defined by the time period in which the media moisture was nearly constant the drainage phase was defined as starting when a decrease of the media moisture was monitored and delimited to 20 min after stopping the inflow the latter definition was chosen in order to limit the duration of the experiment and because visually this rate drainage typically decreased 20 min after the inflow ceased dimensionless analysis is a powerful tool and its application is common in hydraulic engineering applications derived relationships can be upscaled since results are dimensionally homogenous therefore the data were analyzed in a dimensionless framework using π parameters buckingham 1914 constructed using the depth d m and width w m of the swales as well as the acceleration of gravity g m2 s as returning variables see below the operational parameters considered in the analysis were the swale slope j the inflow rate qrun in and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the different media as these parameters have been shown to impact the infiltration performance of swales deletic and fletcher 2006a garcía serrana et al 2017 during the quasi equilibrium phase the moisture content was considered constant and the hydrological performance of the swale was evaluated by the flow rate qinf this flow rate was determined from the water collected at the infiltration tank which corresponded approximately to the difference between run in and run out flow rate based on the derived π parameters the infiltration rate was parameterized according to 3 q i n f g 1 2 w d 5 4 a k s a t g 1 2 w d 1 4 α j β q r u n i n g 1 2 w d 5 4 γ where a α β and γ are dimensionless coefficients experimental data were used to determine these coefficients by regression analyses to characterize swale performance in the final phase the decrease in media moisture in the first 20 min after stopping the inflow δsr20 was adopted as parameter to assess the drainage capacity of the swale the type of media the swale slope and the media moisture at the time the inflow stopped were used to model the drainage capacity of the swale the acquired data were hence used to parameterize the coefficients ρ b σ and τ in the empirical relationship 4 δs r 20 b k s a t g 1 2 w d 1 4 ρ j σ s r max τ which follows from the dimensional analysis the relationships given by equations 3 and 4 were transformed into log log space to facilitate multiple linear regression analysis data from 37 experiments performed under different boundary conditions were used for anova analysis to obtain statistically significant hydrological variables as well as associated coefficients composing the empirical models p value 5 a total of 16 independent experiments were used to validate the derived relationships the r2 values were used to assess the goodness of fit of the models 3 results and discussions the hydrological response of swale 1 and 2 differed to a great extent from the response of swale 3 traditional soil for bioretention this can be observed in figs 2 and 3 showing the degree of media saturation over time and the degree of media saturation together with the measured volumes of run in infiltration and run out respectively as indicated by fig 2a and b the initial degree of saturation was different between swale 3 and 1 which makes the pre loading phase not comparable despite the fact the tests had similar boundary conditions i e run in rate and slope however compared to swale 3 swale 1 showed a considerably quicker degree of saturation response during the 20 min drainage phase δsr min was 0 64 in swale 1 and 0 17 in swale 3 this can be associated with the high drainage capacity of the filter which quickly empties the water stored in the media in addition unlike swale 3 that reached full saturation during the quasi equilibrium phase swale 1 only reached 73 of its storage capacity for the same experimental conditions the occurrence of saturation implies the appearance of overland flow in the swale i e some of the run in water will not be captured by the swale or treated by the media however full saturation was not reached in the filtering swales srmax 1 table 1 even though run out was collected in tests where qrun in 1 10 3 m3 s in these tests the run in discharge was so large that there was not enough hydraulic retention time to saturate the filter media before run out was observed fig 3 presents the time development of the degree of saturation and cumulative run in infiltration and run out volumes for the three swales for an experiment with 4 slope and qrun in 0 3 10 3 m3 s fig 3a and b shows that the slope of the cumulative inflow volume and the infiltrated volume are equal for swales 1 and 2 with quasi equilibrium conditions being satisfied this can be explained by the fact that after a lag time corresponding to approximately the time to reach quasi equilibrium practically all run in was infiltrated as no overland outflow was observed the differences between the inflow and infiltrated volume are associated with the change in the media moisture which in average is equivalent to 5 6 of the run in volume table 2 in contrast in the experiments with swale 3 overland flow was registered at the downstream end fig 3c thus only swale 1 and 2 could completely infiltrate the event represented in fig 3 additionally table 2 shows that the amount of run in used in swale 1 and 2 was around 20 larger than in swale 3 in these experiments it was decided to extend the duration of inflow to observe run out however the media moisture analysis confirmed that after reaching quasi equilibrium the water balance in the swale remained practically stable and therefore no run out would have happened regardless of the duration of the inflow in addition the infiltration volume presented in table 2 highlights a similar response of swale 1 and 2 towards run in flows regardless of the adsorbent used in the media note that full saturation in swale 3 can lead to larger uncertainties in the moisture sensors because in such cases the sensors are operating outside their factory given range 0 40 volumetrically this uncertainty could lead to an under estimation of the moisture increase in the media which explains the larger imbalance that was observed in swale 3 the porosity of the soil composing swale 3 volumetric field saturated water content 52 table 1 was larger than the porosity of the sand used in swale 1 and 2 volumetric field saturated water content 30 which apparently should allow for retaining larger water volumes however the overall capacity of swale 3 for handling run in discharges was considerably less evaluated by the fact that the presence of run out was observed with qrun in 0 2 10 3 m3 s in swale 3 and qrun in 1 10 3 m3 s in swales 1 and 2 several points can be used to explain this observation 1 the hydraulic gradient responsible of the driving forces for water infiltration was lower in swale 3 from the beginning of the experiments due to high initial soil water contents 0 71 sr0 0 91 in contrast to the filtering swales where 0 51 sr0 0 72 2 for swale 3 srmax was close to 1 table 1 in all experiments implying that vw at quasi equilibrium conditions equals vsat at saturation the infiltration rate reaches a constant value ksat and overflow occurs when the run in rate exceeds this value it was observed that run in discharges used during the experiments exceeded the infiltration capacity of swale 3 ksat 6 53 10 5 m s which was approximately 10 times lower than the infiltration capacity of the alternative filters in average ksat 6 10 4 m s see table 3 3 the soil nature of swale 3 might be susceptible of developing surface crusting sealing which in turn reduces the infiltration despite the fact that the swales were drained in a similar manner the lowest initial degree of saturation in swale 3 was 0 71 table 1 which practically corresponds to the highest initial degree of saturation observed in swale 2 0 72 and which is still higher than the highest initial degree of saturation in swale 1 0 67 note that volume retention is positively impacted by low initial moisture in the media lucke et al 2014 this may be explained by the presence of fines silt and clay particles composing the soil ke and takahashi 2012 which were absent in swales 1 and 2 the presence of fines and organic matter will favor the retention of gravimetric capillary and adsorbed water and will subsequently be detrimental to the effective porosity and impede a low initial degree of saturation overall swale 3 had lower handling capacity as well as initial storage which accelerated the appearance of run out this has direct consequences for handling the first and generally most polluted fraction of runoff an early run out appearance might pose an important risk to receiving water bodies due to large untreated pollutant loads associated with the first flush sansalone and buchberger 1997 festuca rubra shows a mean root diameter similar to species that have been shown to improve soil hydraulic conductivity by the creation of macro pores fort et al 2012 le coustumer et al 2012 in addition the observed flow depth was always lower than the grass height which favors its hydraulic resistance and subsequently the infiltration potential of the swale winston et al 2016 however these enhancing effects were observed insufficient to counteract the presence of fines the statistically significant factors p value 5 in the empirical models defined by equations 3 and 4 were used to reproduce the behaviors of the swales table 3 the model defined by equation 3 describing the quasi equilibrium phase performed well for the sandy filters non vegetated swales 1 and 2 but poor for the traditional media swale 3 due to the insufficient infiltration capacity of the soil for the experimental boundary conditions two different responses were observed with regard to the influence of slope on infiltration fig 4 shows that qinf for the filtering swales is only affected by qrun in and the slope has no effect on infiltration however for the bioswale qrun in is independent of qinf and the slope has an impact on qinf i e gentler slopes allow for higher infiltration as muñoz carpena et al 1993 showed this confirms the hypotheses that 1 the critical slope over which the peak runoff becomes constant was not achieved in swale 3 nassif and wilson 1975 2 the filtering swales 1 and 2 have not developed any surface sealing in the absence of surface sealing the slope does not influence the infiltration rate poesen 1984 it is worth mentioning that conflicting conclusions have been reported in the literature regarding the role of the slope for infiltration due to many confounding factors such as incoming runoff micro topography vegetation type soil texture and vertical and horizontal heterogeneity in soil properties morbidelli et al 2018 the media moisture content is an important factor for considerations of the transition phases i e pre loading and drainage the time to reach stationary conditions depends on the soil type as well as the initial water content fig 2 the water content of the media at the end of the storm event strongly impacted the drainage capacity of swales 1 and 2 in these cases the slope was not statistically significant when parameterizing the models table 3 as mentioned above swale 3 reached practically in all tests full saturation i e srmax 1 this fact might explain that swale 3 did not depend on the degree of saturation and its behavior could not be explained by any of the proposed variables in the model defined by equation 4 however the drainage capacity of the alternative filters can be well predicted with equation 4 the drainage capacity of swales is an important design factor because it influences the capacity for handling the next storm event in cold climates drainage gains more relevance because of the importance of avoiding high water content under negative temperatures which can lead to the formation of concrete frost with practically absent infiltration muthanna et al 2007 in this context figs 2 and 3 show a steeper drainage slope in the alternative filters δs r min 0 64 0 77 and 0 17 in swale 1 2 and 3 respectively and therefore a more desirable drainage response for stormwater management in cold climates guidelines for sizing sustainable urban drainage systems suds vary widely guo et al 2013 generally a water quality volume capture can be adopted as a design parameter in order to guarantee the removal of the majority of stormwater pollution on an average annual basis this runoff volume capture generally refers to the volume of runoff generated from a given percentile normally between 80th and 90th of individual 24 h rain events schueler and claytor 1996 urbonas et al 1989 swales are flow based treatment practices and instead water quality flow rates should be used for sizing burack et al 2008 therefore the run in rates qrun in used in this study were extrapolated using equation 2 to estimate the road runoff generated by a rainfall event subsequently the coefficients reported in table 3 swale 1 2 were used in equation 3 to compute the percentage of run in that will be infiltrated captured and treated by the media it is noteworthy to mention that monrabal martinez et al 2017 showed an effective treatment of polluted water spiked with 1 g l of pb zn cu and ni through the rapidly flowing filters used in swale 1 and 2 table 4 can be used as a guideline for dimensioning swales composed of alternative filters similar to swales 1 and 2 it presents the rain intensity events that can be captured at a given percentage according to the size of the road defined by the ratio i p as an example for a 100 volume capture and a design storm event of 5 mm h the filtering swale will handle the runoff from a catchment 40 times its size if the capture requirement is set at 90 a 12 2 mm h storm event could be handled by the system for the same i p ratio the latter storm intensity is slightly less intense than a 5 year 1 h rainfall for the city of trondheim therefore table 4 can help to design filtering swales according to local rainfall patterns and volume capture requirements note that infiltration systems with large ratio i p make better use and advantage of urban space although such i p ratios might accelerate clogging due to high sediment loading rates le coustumer et al 2012 the infiltration capacity of the media is an important design factor for filtering swales additionally preventative measures against clogging are crucial for assuring long term service life and functioning according to design requirements established vegetation can counteract the clogging phenomena because of the development of a root network as well as the activity of earthworms paus et al 2013 therefore systems that lack vegetation will require a closer study and control with regard to sediment pretreatment clogging prevention and maintenance for example pretreatment swales have been found to be efficient for downstream treatment systems with regard to suspended particles lucke et al 2014 and periodic replacement of the 5 10 cm layer of top media has been shown enough for hydraulic conductivity restoration li and davis 2008 several considerations must be accounted for when interpreting results from this study which could differ from field conditions the maximum slope tested in this study was 4 however as a treatment system is often placed parallel to road slopes are not expected to exceed this value filtering practices should avoid steep slopes for optimal performance and therefore should be implemented in nearby flatter areas yousef et al 1987 samani and kouwen 2002 by using the rational method to relate storm intensities si to runoff generated which is the run in flow in the experiments it is assumed that the rainfall intensity is constant over time and over the impervious area in real conditions rainfall intensity oscillations and the existence of lag time until full catchment contribution will provide a runoff discharge pattern that favours the infiltration response by design the runoff was assumed to flow directly into the upstream end of the swale therefore no initial abstraction of water by filter strips or side slopes was taken into account which would have contributed to a better overall performance flanagan et al 2017 unlike in field scenarios the water used in this study was sediment free sediments carried by real runoff will to some extent affect the infiltration capacity due to clogging of pore space however for a long term service life it is highly recommended to maximize the retention of sediments prior to entering the adsorbent amended section of the treatment train swale 3 showed that the traditional soil used in bioretention was unpredictable using our modelling methods within the studied boundary conditions 4 conclusions the hydrological processes occurring in three swales designed for stormwater management were studied under controlled laboratory conditions two of the swales were composed of promising filters for stormwater management while the third swale was composed of a typical soil used for bioretention areas boundary conditions that varied among the experiments were the type of media the initial degree of saturation the swale slope and the inflow rate in addition to the previously demonstrated metal removal capacity the filtering swales showed a considerably improved hydrological response compared to the traditional bioswale this was evaluated for a common boundary setup by the overland flow collected at the end of the swale volume retention in addition to the drainage capacity the swale composed of traditional bioretention soil registered large run out volumes for all the inflow intensities of qrun in while the filtering swales managed the run in volume completely up to qrun in 0 7 10 3 m3 s in addition the initial degree of saturation was considerably higher in the bioswale which negatively impacted the retention capacity of the infiltration based system with earlier onset of run out flow overflow the models derived in this study explained the variability of the target variables used to assess the performance in the alternative media satisfactory however the application range is limited to the experimental boundary conditions slope 2 4 run in 0 2 10 3 1 10 3 m3 s and rock coverage the infiltration capacity of the media ksat was found to play a significant role in each phase longitudinal slope showed to have no influence on the filtering swales in any of the studied phases i e only the inflow rate and media water content were statistically significant the proposed dimensionless empirical models can be used along with the rational method for dimensioning and performance predictions of filtering swales as an example the filtering swales presented in this study might capture 90 of the runoff generated by a 12 2 mm h storm event for on a road with a surface area 40 times larger than the swale this storm intensity corresponds approx with a 5 year return period 1 h duration rainfall in the city of trondheim which highlights the capacity of these swales to also handle higher return period events this will of course be a function of local rainfall pattern but it does show the capacity to handle at the minimum the first flush and significantly more for many climatic regions acknowledgements the authors wish to acknowledge the national public road administration of norway and the norwat program project number 603019 for their financial support for this project the authors also want to show their gratitude to vladimir hamouz phd student at ntnu for helping in the construction of the experimental setup 
19323,this paper studies the hydraulic performance of two swales composed of filters for stormwater management filtering swales in a large scale experimental study and compares them to the performance of a swale composed of traditional bioretention soil bioswale using experimental data dimensionless formulations are derived to reflect the influence of swale design parameters on hydraulic performance the developed formulas can be used to design swales accounting for practical factors for decision makers such as local rainfall patterns volume capture requirements and drainage area the experimental data show that while the bioswale is characterized by large overland flows the tested filtering swales manage in the majority of cases the complete inflow volume without overland flow the longitudinal slope of the swales does not affect the infiltration capacity of the filtering swales for the tested experimental boundary conditions only the inflow rate and media water content are found to be statistically significant as an example filtering swales tested in this study captured 90 of the runoff generated by a 12 2 mm h storm approximately a 5 year return period 1 h duration storm event in the city of trondheim on a road 40 times larger than the swale this highlights the capacity of such swales for handling infrequent events keywords stormwater runoff roadside filters hydrological balance swale design infiltration performance 1 introduction urban runoff is well known for carrying a wide range of pollutants hoffman et al 1985 huber et al 2016c lefevre et al 2014 and the sources of pollution differ across locations and seasons gunawardana et al 2014 moghadas et al 2015 infiltration based solutions for the management of urban runoff have shown a good performance with regard to pollution mitigation and volume reduction i e retention generally treatment swales represent such an infiltration based solution adopted as a low tech practice to deal with roadway runoff burack et al 2008 they collect polluted runoff generated on impervious surfaces such as roads and convey it to a downstream wastewater network or a receiving water after a minimum hydraulic residence time within the swale sedimentation infiltration filtration adsorption and vegetation uptake are the main processes occurring in these systems therefore they provide multiple environmental benefits such as volume retention pollutant removal and percolation which helps to maintain the pre development hydrologic balance of a site cizek and hunt 2013 factors such as the ratio of the impervious road area to the swale area the size of the storm event and the longitudinal slope determine the overland discharge and flow depth and hence the flow characteristics winston et al 2016 the overland flow in swales can be either super or subcritical supercritical flows increase erosion reduce volume and pollution retention and should therefore be avoided subcritical flows can be obtained by constructing specific design elements increasing the hydraulic resistance such design elements include check dams e g davis et al 2012 winston et al 2018 stones e g narsimlu et al 2004 and grass coverage e g mishra et al 2006 the embankment slopes of swales can provide a bonus for volume retention which in turn is positively impacted by the infiltration capacity of the media soil moisture deficit and side slope length garcía serrana et al 2017 for vegetated swales the type of vegetation such as deep rooted grass species and proliferation of root and earthworm channels improve infiltration abu zreig et al 2004 blanco canqui et al 2004 regarding soil composition bioswales are generally composed of soils such as loamy sands loams or sandy loams providing infiltration rates higher than recommended by bio filter design guidelines le coustumer et al 2009 in some cases larger infiltration capacities are required to 1 handle larger runoff events 2 consider cold climate constraints such as reduced winter infiltration capacity paus and braskerud 2014 or 3 runoff from large impervious areas to swales by keeping a certain removal capacity to meet discharge regulations huber et al 2016b in addition a good drainage capacity guarantees low initial moisture in the media which has been shown to positively impact volume retention lucke et al 2014 these facts have motivated the investigation of materials for the construction of swales offering an added performance in terms of filtration capacity pollutant removal or both kalmykova et al 2008 wium andersen et al 2012 ilyas and muthanna 2017 huber et al 2016a the end user urban drainage engineer practitioner is generally interested in mathematical models that reconcile laboratory findings to field implementation for example trava is a 1 d deterministic model based on green ampt and kinematic wave equations for non submerged flow conditions and simulates the generation of runoff and sediment transport deletic 2001 the comparison of simulation results with data from laboratory and field experiments showed that the hydraulic conductivity of the soil is the most sensitive parameter in the simulations deletic 2005 deletic and fletcher 2006b moreover the application of vfsmod muñoz carpena et al 1999 a model for similar purposes showed that the type of soil and its initial water content determines the runoff retention the application of vfsmod further showed grass spacing to be an important parameter regarding sediment removal han et al 2005 both these models require extensive input parameters which are typically not available for the engineers designing swales for stormwater management purposes this makes empirical models generally more attractive for the user because of their simplicity in input parameters while providing good predictions of for example trapping efficiency for specific swale designs and residence times bäckström 2002 winston et al 2016 this motivation based on the end user applicability resulted in testing a series of empirical equations with the aim to find the dominant design factors more specifically the research questions in this study are as follows 1 what are the hydrological benefits of adsorbent amended filters for roadside filters referred to as filtering swales from this point on in comparison to bioswales 2 which are the dominant design factors influencing the hydrological response of filtering swales 3 how can hydrological benefits be compared using a practical approach such as the capture of storm events in order to answer these questions a full scale swale setup was designed to evaluate factors determining the hydrological balance of swales composed of filters studied by monrabal martinez et al 2017 these filters are constructed with a pure sand which was amended with either olivine or pine bark at the first phase of column scale tests the filters showed high removal rates for the fours metals of concern cu pb ni and zn the column test also included several different hydraulic loadings and periods of infrequent storm events rapid inflows followed by longer dry periods these results in turn were the motivation for the present study to understand the hydrological response of full scale filters in order to confirm their potential for use in stormwater management the experimental data was used to propose empirical equations for the evaluation of hydrological processes at the full scale for the filters also including a comparison with a swale composed of commonly used soil for bioretention the results from this study provides new and much needed improved understanding of the dominant processes and factors for infiltration based treatment filters and bioswales 2 material and methods three tiltable 500 cm long 45 cm deep and 80 cm wide swales see fig 1 were built at the hydraulic laboratory of the norwegian university of science and technology ntnu each swale had an underdrain layer composed of two perforated pipes with a diameter of 5 cm embedded in a 10 cm thick gravel layer filtering swale 1 was composed of a clean homogeneous sand layer with a thickness of d 40 cm d50 0 33 mm which is the intercept for 50 of the cumulative mass of the particle size distribution uniformity coefficient d60 d10 2 22 overlying a 5 cm thick layer of pine bark filtering swale 2 was composed of the same 40 cm quartz sand layer but was overlying a 5 cm thick layer of granulated olivine d50 1 4 mm uniformity coefficient 1 66 swale 3 built as bioswale had its entire 45 cm thickness composed of a traditional soil for bioretention classified as a sandy loam usda 2017 swales 1 and 2 were superficially protected with boulders d50 70 mm approximately 256 boulders m2 placed to reduce filter exposure swale 3 was seeded 10 gr m2 with festuca rubra rubra leik a cold tolerant species with a high salinity tolerance which is favourable for roadside vegetation high pressure sodium lamps were arranged in order to provide a photosynthetic active radiation of approximately 300 w m2 during 18 h day the height of grass was intended at 7 cm during the experiments unlike most roadside swales the swale media in this study were not mechanically compacted during filling as they are meant for infiltrating runoff and no traffic is expected over them each swale was equipped with 6 profile probes pr2 4 sdi 12 from delta t devices ltd and each profile had three moisture dielectric sensors distributed along the vertical axis fig 1 resulting in a total of 18 moisture sensors per swale the moisture sensors measured the permittivity of the surrounding soils with a sampling frequency of 0 5 hz and were specifically calibrated for each media errors of 4 including installation and sampling errors can be expected according to the manufacturer of the sensors each swale was divided in 18 volumetric sectors with a volume vi m3 according to the distribution of the media moisture sensors the total moisture present in the swale at time t vw t m3 was computed as 1 v w t i 1 18 θ i t v i where θi t is the volumetric water content in sector i measured by the associated moisture sensor at time t for the determination of the saturated moisture content vsat m3 by equation 1 the swales were flooded by closing the valve on the underdrain during the experiments the degree of saturation in the swale at time t sr t was defined as the ratio of the total moisture at time t vw t and the saturated water content of the swale vsat a 1 m3 tank filled with tap water served as upstream reservoir for the experiments from the tank the water was pumped into a small reservoir at the upstream end of the swale that was equipped with a rectangular weir allowing for an even distribution of the inflow run in over the swale width the inflow rates were measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter siemens sitrans fm mag 5000 accuracy 0 4 of the flow rate and controlled with a valve the overland flow at the end of the swale run out and the infiltrated water were collected separately in two downstream tanks with volumes of 0 72 m3 1 1 m wide 1 1 m long and 0 6 m high and 0 21 m3 0 5 m diameter and 1 1 m high respectively the water surface level in these tanks was measured with two ultrasonic sensors microsonic mic 130 iu tc average resolution 0 4 mm and 1 accuracy with a sampling frequency of 1 hz allowing for the determination of the accumulated water volume in the tanks as a function of time due to volume limitations of the downstream tanks they had to be emptied during some experiments as a consequence linear extrapolation based on previous filling data was used in order to fill the data gap during emptying the experiments with swales 1 3 were carried out for a range of boundary conditions table 1 by varying the initial degree of saturation sr0 the longitudinal slope j and the inflow rate qrun in each filter media was characterized by its saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat m s which was determined based on three measurements along its length using the mpd infiltrometer method ahmed et al 2015 swale slopes of 2 3 and 4 were used in the experiments such slopes are common in road design in norway vegvesen 2008 the ratio i p between impervious i and pervious areas p is often used to size systems for stormwater runoff khan et al 2012 in order to mimic practical implications qrun in was chosen as the equivalent runoff generated by an event with a given storm intensity si mm h occurring over an impervious area i p times as large as the swale area as m2 by using the following relationship which is based on the rational method kuichling 1889 2 s i q r u n i n c i p 1 a s 36 10 5 the empirical runoff coefficient c can be assumed to be close to 1 because of the imperviousness of road surfaces equation 2 considers also the precipitation that falls on the swale itself which might be of relevance for small i p ratios the inflow rates ranged from 0 2 10 3 m3 s to 1 10 3 m3 s which corresponds for an i p 40 and c 0 9 with storm intensities from 5 to 25 mm h respectively each test run was subdivided into a pre loading quasi equilibrium and drainage phase fig 2 the pre loading phase was defined as the time required to reach quasi equilibrium saturation of the soil from the start of water inflow during this phase the water mainly filled the non saturated pore space in the media which explains the quicker increase in the degree of saturation of the media δs r with regard to the subsequent phase the quasi equilibrium condition was assumed to be reached when δs r was less than 4 in four consecutive minutes this definition was adopted in order to avoid an early change of phase because δs r followed in some cases a distribution with several steps during the preloading phase fig 2b during the quasi equilibrium phase the media moisture was nearly constant and the run in water could be computed as the sum of the infiltration and run out water collected downstream the quasi equilibrium phase was hence defined by the time period in which the media moisture was nearly constant the drainage phase was defined as starting when a decrease of the media moisture was monitored and delimited to 20 min after stopping the inflow the latter definition was chosen in order to limit the duration of the experiment and because visually this rate drainage typically decreased 20 min after the inflow ceased dimensionless analysis is a powerful tool and its application is common in hydraulic engineering applications derived relationships can be upscaled since results are dimensionally homogenous therefore the data were analyzed in a dimensionless framework using π parameters buckingham 1914 constructed using the depth d m and width w m of the swales as well as the acceleration of gravity g m2 s as returning variables see below the operational parameters considered in the analysis were the swale slope j the inflow rate qrun in and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the different media as these parameters have been shown to impact the infiltration performance of swales deletic and fletcher 2006a garcía serrana et al 2017 during the quasi equilibrium phase the moisture content was considered constant and the hydrological performance of the swale was evaluated by the flow rate qinf this flow rate was determined from the water collected at the infiltration tank which corresponded approximately to the difference between run in and run out flow rate based on the derived π parameters the infiltration rate was parameterized according to 3 q i n f g 1 2 w d 5 4 a k s a t g 1 2 w d 1 4 α j β q r u n i n g 1 2 w d 5 4 γ where a α β and γ are dimensionless coefficients experimental data were used to determine these coefficients by regression analyses to characterize swale performance in the final phase the decrease in media moisture in the first 20 min after stopping the inflow δsr20 was adopted as parameter to assess the drainage capacity of the swale the type of media the swale slope and the media moisture at the time the inflow stopped were used to model the drainage capacity of the swale the acquired data were hence used to parameterize the coefficients ρ b σ and τ in the empirical relationship 4 δs r 20 b k s a t g 1 2 w d 1 4 ρ j σ s r max τ which follows from the dimensional analysis the relationships given by equations 3 and 4 were transformed into log log space to facilitate multiple linear regression analysis data from 37 experiments performed under different boundary conditions were used for anova analysis to obtain statistically significant hydrological variables as well as associated coefficients composing the empirical models p value 5 a total of 16 independent experiments were used to validate the derived relationships the r2 values were used to assess the goodness of fit of the models 3 results and discussions the hydrological response of swale 1 and 2 differed to a great extent from the response of swale 3 traditional soil for bioretention this can be observed in figs 2 and 3 showing the degree of media saturation over time and the degree of media saturation together with the measured volumes of run in infiltration and run out respectively as indicated by fig 2a and b the initial degree of saturation was different between swale 3 and 1 which makes the pre loading phase not comparable despite the fact the tests had similar boundary conditions i e run in rate and slope however compared to swale 3 swale 1 showed a considerably quicker degree of saturation response during the 20 min drainage phase δsr min was 0 64 in swale 1 and 0 17 in swale 3 this can be associated with the high drainage capacity of the filter which quickly empties the water stored in the media in addition unlike swale 3 that reached full saturation during the quasi equilibrium phase swale 1 only reached 73 of its storage capacity for the same experimental conditions the occurrence of saturation implies the appearance of overland flow in the swale i e some of the run in water will not be captured by the swale or treated by the media however full saturation was not reached in the filtering swales srmax 1 table 1 even though run out was collected in tests where qrun in 1 10 3 m3 s in these tests the run in discharge was so large that there was not enough hydraulic retention time to saturate the filter media before run out was observed fig 3 presents the time development of the degree of saturation and cumulative run in infiltration and run out volumes for the three swales for an experiment with 4 slope and qrun in 0 3 10 3 m3 s fig 3a and b shows that the slope of the cumulative inflow volume and the infiltrated volume are equal for swales 1 and 2 with quasi equilibrium conditions being satisfied this can be explained by the fact that after a lag time corresponding to approximately the time to reach quasi equilibrium practically all run in was infiltrated as no overland outflow was observed the differences between the inflow and infiltrated volume are associated with the change in the media moisture which in average is equivalent to 5 6 of the run in volume table 2 in contrast in the experiments with swale 3 overland flow was registered at the downstream end fig 3c thus only swale 1 and 2 could completely infiltrate the event represented in fig 3 additionally table 2 shows that the amount of run in used in swale 1 and 2 was around 20 larger than in swale 3 in these experiments it was decided to extend the duration of inflow to observe run out however the media moisture analysis confirmed that after reaching quasi equilibrium the water balance in the swale remained practically stable and therefore no run out would have happened regardless of the duration of the inflow in addition the infiltration volume presented in table 2 highlights a similar response of swale 1 and 2 towards run in flows regardless of the adsorbent used in the media note that full saturation in swale 3 can lead to larger uncertainties in the moisture sensors because in such cases the sensors are operating outside their factory given range 0 40 volumetrically this uncertainty could lead to an under estimation of the moisture increase in the media which explains the larger imbalance that was observed in swale 3 the porosity of the soil composing swale 3 volumetric field saturated water content 52 table 1 was larger than the porosity of the sand used in swale 1 and 2 volumetric field saturated water content 30 which apparently should allow for retaining larger water volumes however the overall capacity of swale 3 for handling run in discharges was considerably less evaluated by the fact that the presence of run out was observed with qrun in 0 2 10 3 m3 s in swale 3 and qrun in 1 10 3 m3 s in swales 1 and 2 several points can be used to explain this observation 1 the hydraulic gradient responsible of the driving forces for water infiltration was lower in swale 3 from the beginning of the experiments due to high initial soil water contents 0 71 sr0 0 91 in contrast to the filtering swales where 0 51 sr0 0 72 2 for swale 3 srmax was close to 1 table 1 in all experiments implying that vw at quasi equilibrium conditions equals vsat at saturation the infiltration rate reaches a constant value ksat and overflow occurs when the run in rate exceeds this value it was observed that run in discharges used during the experiments exceeded the infiltration capacity of swale 3 ksat 6 53 10 5 m s which was approximately 10 times lower than the infiltration capacity of the alternative filters in average ksat 6 10 4 m s see table 3 3 the soil nature of swale 3 might be susceptible of developing surface crusting sealing which in turn reduces the infiltration despite the fact that the swales were drained in a similar manner the lowest initial degree of saturation in swale 3 was 0 71 table 1 which practically corresponds to the highest initial degree of saturation observed in swale 2 0 72 and which is still higher than the highest initial degree of saturation in swale 1 0 67 note that volume retention is positively impacted by low initial moisture in the media lucke et al 2014 this may be explained by the presence of fines silt and clay particles composing the soil ke and takahashi 2012 which were absent in swales 1 and 2 the presence of fines and organic matter will favor the retention of gravimetric capillary and adsorbed water and will subsequently be detrimental to the effective porosity and impede a low initial degree of saturation overall swale 3 had lower handling capacity as well as initial storage which accelerated the appearance of run out this has direct consequences for handling the first and generally most polluted fraction of runoff an early run out appearance might pose an important risk to receiving water bodies due to large untreated pollutant loads associated with the first flush sansalone and buchberger 1997 festuca rubra shows a mean root diameter similar to species that have been shown to improve soil hydraulic conductivity by the creation of macro pores fort et al 2012 le coustumer et al 2012 in addition the observed flow depth was always lower than the grass height which favors its hydraulic resistance and subsequently the infiltration potential of the swale winston et al 2016 however these enhancing effects were observed insufficient to counteract the presence of fines the statistically significant factors p value 5 in the empirical models defined by equations 3 and 4 were used to reproduce the behaviors of the swales table 3 the model defined by equation 3 describing the quasi equilibrium phase performed well for the sandy filters non vegetated swales 1 and 2 but poor for the traditional media swale 3 due to the insufficient infiltration capacity of the soil for the experimental boundary conditions two different responses were observed with regard to the influence of slope on infiltration fig 4 shows that qinf for the filtering swales is only affected by qrun in and the slope has no effect on infiltration however for the bioswale qrun in is independent of qinf and the slope has an impact on qinf i e gentler slopes allow for higher infiltration as muñoz carpena et al 1993 showed this confirms the hypotheses that 1 the critical slope over which the peak runoff becomes constant was not achieved in swale 3 nassif and wilson 1975 2 the filtering swales 1 and 2 have not developed any surface sealing in the absence of surface sealing the slope does not influence the infiltration rate poesen 1984 it is worth mentioning that conflicting conclusions have been reported in the literature regarding the role of the slope for infiltration due to many confounding factors such as incoming runoff micro topography vegetation type soil texture and vertical and horizontal heterogeneity in soil properties morbidelli et al 2018 the media moisture content is an important factor for considerations of the transition phases i e pre loading and drainage the time to reach stationary conditions depends on the soil type as well as the initial water content fig 2 the water content of the media at the end of the storm event strongly impacted the drainage capacity of swales 1 and 2 in these cases the slope was not statistically significant when parameterizing the models table 3 as mentioned above swale 3 reached practically in all tests full saturation i e srmax 1 this fact might explain that swale 3 did not depend on the degree of saturation and its behavior could not be explained by any of the proposed variables in the model defined by equation 4 however the drainage capacity of the alternative filters can be well predicted with equation 4 the drainage capacity of swales is an important design factor because it influences the capacity for handling the next storm event in cold climates drainage gains more relevance because of the importance of avoiding high water content under negative temperatures which can lead to the formation of concrete frost with practically absent infiltration muthanna et al 2007 in this context figs 2 and 3 show a steeper drainage slope in the alternative filters δs r min 0 64 0 77 and 0 17 in swale 1 2 and 3 respectively and therefore a more desirable drainage response for stormwater management in cold climates guidelines for sizing sustainable urban drainage systems suds vary widely guo et al 2013 generally a water quality volume capture can be adopted as a design parameter in order to guarantee the removal of the majority of stormwater pollution on an average annual basis this runoff volume capture generally refers to the volume of runoff generated from a given percentile normally between 80th and 90th of individual 24 h rain events schueler and claytor 1996 urbonas et al 1989 swales are flow based treatment practices and instead water quality flow rates should be used for sizing burack et al 2008 therefore the run in rates qrun in used in this study were extrapolated using equation 2 to estimate the road runoff generated by a rainfall event subsequently the coefficients reported in table 3 swale 1 2 were used in equation 3 to compute the percentage of run in that will be infiltrated captured and treated by the media it is noteworthy to mention that monrabal martinez et al 2017 showed an effective treatment of polluted water spiked with 1 g l of pb zn cu and ni through the rapidly flowing filters used in swale 1 and 2 table 4 can be used as a guideline for dimensioning swales composed of alternative filters similar to swales 1 and 2 it presents the rain intensity events that can be captured at a given percentage according to the size of the road defined by the ratio i p as an example for a 100 volume capture and a design storm event of 5 mm h the filtering swale will handle the runoff from a catchment 40 times its size if the capture requirement is set at 90 a 12 2 mm h storm event could be handled by the system for the same i p ratio the latter storm intensity is slightly less intense than a 5 year 1 h rainfall for the city of trondheim therefore table 4 can help to design filtering swales according to local rainfall patterns and volume capture requirements note that infiltration systems with large ratio i p make better use and advantage of urban space although such i p ratios might accelerate clogging due to high sediment loading rates le coustumer et al 2012 the infiltration capacity of the media is an important design factor for filtering swales additionally preventative measures against clogging are crucial for assuring long term service life and functioning according to design requirements established vegetation can counteract the clogging phenomena because of the development of a root network as well as the activity of earthworms paus et al 2013 therefore systems that lack vegetation will require a closer study and control with regard to sediment pretreatment clogging prevention and maintenance for example pretreatment swales have been found to be efficient for downstream treatment systems with regard to suspended particles lucke et al 2014 and periodic replacement of the 5 10 cm layer of top media has been shown enough for hydraulic conductivity restoration li and davis 2008 several considerations must be accounted for when interpreting results from this study which could differ from field conditions the maximum slope tested in this study was 4 however as a treatment system is often placed parallel to road slopes are not expected to exceed this value filtering practices should avoid steep slopes for optimal performance and therefore should be implemented in nearby flatter areas yousef et al 1987 samani and kouwen 2002 by using the rational method to relate storm intensities si to runoff generated which is the run in flow in the experiments it is assumed that the rainfall intensity is constant over time and over the impervious area in real conditions rainfall intensity oscillations and the existence of lag time until full catchment contribution will provide a runoff discharge pattern that favours the infiltration response by design the runoff was assumed to flow directly into the upstream end of the swale therefore no initial abstraction of water by filter strips or side slopes was taken into account which would have contributed to a better overall performance flanagan et al 2017 unlike in field scenarios the water used in this study was sediment free sediments carried by real runoff will to some extent affect the infiltration capacity due to clogging of pore space however for a long term service life it is highly recommended to maximize the retention of sediments prior to entering the adsorbent amended section of the treatment train swale 3 showed that the traditional soil used in bioretention was unpredictable using our modelling methods within the studied boundary conditions 4 conclusions the hydrological processes occurring in three swales designed for stormwater management were studied under controlled laboratory conditions two of the swales were composed of promising filters for stormwater management while the third swale was composed of a typical soil used for bioretention areas boundary conditions that varied among the experiments were the type of media the initial degree of saturation the swale slope and the inflow rate in addition to the previously demonstrated metal removal capacity the filtering swales showed a considerably improved hydrological response compared to the traditional bioswale this was evaluated for a common boundary setup by the overland flow collected at the end of the swale volume retention in addition to the drainage capacity the swale composed of traditional bioretention soil registered large run out volumes for all the inflow intensities of qrun in while the filtering swales managed the run in volume completely up to qrun in 0 7 10 3 m3 s in addition the initial degree of saturation was considerably higher in the bioswale which negatively impacted the retention capacity of the infiltration based system with earlier onset of run out flow overflow the models derived in this study explained the variability of the target variables used to assess the performance in the alternative media satisfactory however the application range is limited to the experimental boundary conditions slope 2 4 run in 0 2 10 3 1 10 3 m3 s and rock coverage the infiltration capacity of the media ksat was found to play a significant role in each phase longitudinal slope showed to have no influence on the filtering swales in any of the studied phases i e only the inflow rate and media water content were statistically significant the proposed dimensionless empirical models can be used along with the rational method for dimensioning and performance predictions of filtering swales as an example the filtering swales presented in this study might capture 90 of the runoff generated by a 12 2 mm h storm event for on a road with a surface area 40 times larger than the swale this storm intensity corresponds approx with a 5 year return period 1 h duration rainfall in the city of trondheim which highlights the capacity of these swales to also handle higher return period events this will of course be a function of local rainfall pattern but it does show the capacity to handle at the minimum

19324,life cycle assessment lca is a beneficial tool to evaluate the performance of wastewater treatment plants wwtps and to compare different upgrading options the main objective of this study is to investigate the environmental impact of upgrading options of a preliminary wwtp in istanbul turkey the preliminary plant currently consists of mechanical treatment units and various upgrading options including primary treatment and high rate activated sludge system hras process as well as the addition of food waste to wastewater were compared results showed that the baseline scenario s0 had worse performance than all future scenarios s1 3 except for climate change the scenario of adding food waste to wastewater s3 has the best performance in climate change terrestrial acidification terrestrial ecotoxicity and fossil depletion increased addition of food waste was also tested in the sensitivity analysis and major improvements were obtained especially in climate change and terrestrial ecotoxicity keywords food waste high rate activated sludge process life cycle assessment primary treatment sludge wastewater treatment plant upgrading 1 introduction population growth and urbanization have increased dramatically during the last century and this situation has caused severe impacts on the total environment including water air and soil flores alsina et al 2010 within this scope wastewater treatment and municipal solid waste msw management have become important issues in many aspects such as public health ecological sustainability and aesthetics similar to other big cities in developing countries msw related issues are very crucial in istanbul and there still exist some problems in spite of the achievements kanat 2010 currently 40 of the total wastewater flow is treated at advanced wastewater treatment plants wwtps while the rest is treated only mechanically at preliminary wwtps and discharged to the sea via marine outfall systems even if discharge of preliminary treated wastewater to the sea and bosphorus strait is in agreement with the wastewater management plan of the city in the short and medium terms chemically enhanced treatment cet and high rate activated sludge hras processes will be implemented to the existing preliminary wwtps in the long term ozturk and altay 2015 despite wwtps are dedicated to remove pollutants from wastewater and improve water quality in receiving water bodies during the operation of the wwtps some other environmental impacts occur due to energy use chemicals consumption and excess sludge production wang et al 2015 it is therefore important that also indirect impact following e g energy turnover is included together with direct process emissions with respect to environmental impact categories such as greenhouse gas ghg emissions eutrophication and resource consumption in particular the environmental footprint of a wwtp should be addressed process by process to comprehend the existing situation subsequently life cycle assessment lca can assist to improve the process performance as well as to minimize the environmental loads bai et al 2018 as a matter of fact lca is regarded as a beneficial tool in the decision making process as it can quantify the potential impacts of a product or service from a holistic approach hernández padilla et al 2017 iso 2006 some impact categories are found to be dominant in overall lca results of a wwtp moreira et al 2018 such as global warming mainly due to energy use for aeration toxicity rising from heavy metal content of excess sludge and eutrophication caused by organic substances and nutrients in effluent moreover lca applications in assessing wwtps can be very useful to compare different treatment alternatives foley et al 2010a analyzed different process configurations and concluded that no treatment and primary treatment scenarios have the worst performances in terms of releasing methane and nitrous oxide emissions to the environment current technology promises the improvement in effluent quality and especially eutrophication potential can be mitigated whereas other impacts i e climate change ozone depletion acidification and ecotoxicity generally tend to increase due to intensive treatment rahman et al 2016 the dominance of discharge limits on environmental burdens was also exhibited by wang et al 2015 who stated that except eutrophication potential carrying out moderate level treatment is more favorable than high level treatment in terms of net environmental benefits conventional activated sludge cas system is one of the most commonly applied processes in municipal wastewater treatment piao et al 2016 however it requires much aeration energy and a significant share of organic matter present in wastewater is oxidized which can also be valorized in anaerobic digestion ad jimenez et al 2015 high energy exploitation increases environmental burdens and hence cas can show worse performance than other process configurations electricity use effluent pollutant concentrations and sludge processes are given as the main drivers determining lca results in cas plants but it should be noted that the results can vary spatially and local issues should not be overlooked corominas et al 2013 polruang et al 2018 stated that electricity use and its mix are the principal elements affecting the results of the whole impact categories excluding eutrophication and abiotic depletion garfí et al 2017 compared cas with constructed wetlands and high rate algal ponds and reported that cas had the highest environmental impacts in the whole impact categories due to the operational emissions postacchini et al 2016 conducted a similar study and they also reported higher impacts in cas treatment than those in trickling filter and high rate anaerobic aerobic digestion configurations high operational emissions in cas demonstrate that reducing operational energy demand can play an important role to mitigate environmental impacts high rate activated sludge hras process is a variant of cas systems which ensures lower energy consumption and higher energy recovery in ad by operation at low dissolved oxygen concentrations and minimal sludge residence times kinyua et al 2017 strass and wolfgangsee ischl wwtps in austria are some examples of full scale energy positive plants applying hras process shen et al 2015 which achieved this goal by means of optimizing aeration and diverting more organic matter to the anaerobic digesters nowak et al 2011 smith et al 2014 compared hras ad with cas ad and aerobic membrane bioreactor ad in terms of lca and they used a modeling tool to estimate effluent quality schaubroeck et al 2015 surveyed a lca study on a full scale wwtp having hras process but they focused on side stream treatment rather than evaluating the performance of hras process ad composting incineration and landfilling are the most common food waste management alternatives in developing countries thi et al 2015 however separate collection and transportation of food waste play a significant role for lca outcomes in different impact categories becker et al 2017 xu et al 2015 on the other hand treatment of food waste at wwtps is another option for food waste management nevertheless kitchen grinder installed in households is the prerequisite for such an option thomas 2011 as a matter of fact in the above mentioned studies becker et al 2017 xu et al 2015 the food waste is assumed to be transported by truck to the wwtp whereas the impact of transporting food waste by sewer lines or avoidance of road transport of food waste is not examined in addition to that none of those few existing lca studies becker et al 2017 xu et al 2015 dealing with inclusion of food waste with wastewater treatment assess the impact with respect to preliminary wastewater treatment together with traditional landfilling composting of food waste which is still widely applied in many regions including the region under this study to the best of our knowledge this work is the first to examine the hras ad system from the lca perspective in a turkish context by using site specific data different food waste management alternatives as well as using kitchen grinders have been evaluated by some authors however there are only a few studies becker et al 2017 lundie and peters 2005 morris et al 2017 on this issue and more experimental studies should be conducted to get a better picture as attempted in this study more importantly there have not been any studies in the literature that couples hras treatment with co treatment of municipal wastewater and food waste this study can be considered as the first attempt which assesses the possibility of co treatment by applying hras treatment from the lca perspective the aim of this study is to assess various wastewater treatment alternatives and to evaluate their environmental impacts in line with lca methodology for upgrading a preliminary wwtp located in istanbul turkey including primary treatment and hras as well as the possibility of treating food waste the results provide an insight into the change in the magnitude of environmental loads as well as beneficial contribution when a typical preliminary wwtp is upgraded to a secondary carbon removal wwtp in addition the effect of including food waste to wastewater is to be evaluated by considering not only the wwtp operations but also msw management operations the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the followed methodology is given by describing the goal and scope of the study investigated scenarios and life cycle inventory lci based on the defined life cycle impact assessment lcia method and selected impact categories in section 3 impacts from suggested alternative scenarios are described with a sensitivity analysis as well an improvement analysis following these in section 4 discussions are made on issues concerning uncertainty food waste inclusion as well as further improvements the summary and conclusions are given in section 5 2 methodology iso 14040 principles iso 2006 have been followed to perform the lca the methodological framework given by iso 14040 comprises of four stages goal and scope definition is the first and crucial stage which involves clear and consistent definition of the study the most time consuming stage of a lca is the life cycle inventory analysis and it requires a comprehensive data collection potential environmental impacts are calculated in the life cycle impact assessment stage by using the data obtained in the life cycle inventory stage combined with a state of the art impact assessment method the fourth and the last stage is the interpretation of the results and some conclusions as well as recommendations are drawn from a general perspective the stages in lca have been handled as described below in detail 2 1 goal and scope definition 2 1 1 aim and goal the overall aim of the study is to identify environmental impacts of the existing preliminary wwtp as well as to evaluate and compare different upgrading options the goal is to find out the environmental impacts of different wastewater treatment alternatives and to identify the environmental impacts of food waste management through treatment at wwtps or current practices of food waste treatment as given in the previous section primary treatment and hras are investigated as upgrading options and lastly the alternative of adding some part of food waste to wastewater is discussed 2 1 2 scenarios the following scenarios have been investigated scenario 0 s0 the current preliminary treatment scenario 1 s1 implementation of primary treatment scenario 2 s2 implementation of hras process scenario 3 s3 implementation of hras process as well as food waste addition to wastewater the detailed flow chart for the scenarios is found in supplementary information 1 si 1 fig 1 shows a simplified description of the scenarios in scenarios 1 3 excess sludge is treated by ad and the biogas is used for generating electricity at a combined heat and power chp plant the generated heat from the chp plant is assumed to be used internally for heating purposes in the sludge digestion as proposed by yoshida et al 2014 it was also assumed that 55 of heating demand in sludge drying is covered by the excess heat of the chp plant buonocore et al 2016 the digestate from ad is incinerated in an msw incinerator with energy recovery chp the digestate management is equal for scenarios 1 3 it should be noted that only a minor part of the generated food waste is treated together with wastewater while a certain amount of food waste is treated with wastewater the remaining part is treated with current msw practices in istanbul in order to have consistent scenarios to make fair comparisons the environmental burdens as well as gains should be taken into account for food waste management the scenarios have been transformed into comparable ones by adding compensatory processes food waste management processes as proposed in i e eriksson et al 2002 the details about current msw management in istanbul are presented in supplementary information 2 si 2 2 1 3 functional unit two separate functional units fu have been used since the lca covers both wastewater treatment and solid waste management for wastewater treatment processes the fu is set to 1 m3 of influent wastewater considering the wastewater generation and food waste production rates in istanbul the equivalence of 1 m3 of influent wastewater is calculated as 2 88 kg of food waste the calculation methodology for food waste equivalence of municipal wastewater as well as the characteristics of wastewater and food waste are provided in si 2 2 1 4 system boundaries several operational stages have been taken into account when making impact assessment i e wastewater treatment sludge treatment and food waste treatment processes construction and demolition phases are not considered in the study since their impacts are limited in relation to the overall impact bai et al 2017 garfí et al 2017 fig 2 depicts the system boundary and compensatory system used in this study on the other hand transportation of sludge and wwtp residues buonocore et al 2016 as well as food waste collection and transportation martinez blanco et al 2010 have been included in the system under study it should be pointed out that compost refuse derived fuel rdf fuel and avoided fertilizer transportation are also considered in transportation background processes in the study comprise energy supply and use of chemicals for running the processes morera et al 2017 2 1 5 allocation in order to avoid allocation problems system expansion approach is used eriksson et al 2016 avoided energy fuel and fertilizer usage from treatment processes have been credited generated and used electrical and heat energy are not accounted together but distinguished in the assessment for each of the multi output processes the outputs are investigated one by one as described in the lci 2 2 life cycle inventory a detailed lci was conducted by using various sources such as experimental results relevant scientific literature as well as reports and performance indicators of the existing treatment facilities in istanbul required data were primarily obtained from conducted experimental studies to find out more accurate results and different process configuration scenarios were studied in order to make a comparison between these some other required data have been derived from up to date reports and bulletins released by local foundations not to overlook current wastewater and waste management practices first of all the literature produced in turkey was used to estimate the parameters that were not measured experimentally in wastewater and food waste characterization as well as for background processes on the other hand it should be noted that the selection of technologies and their performance still should be considered to be generic as similar pre conditions exist elsewhere inventory data for the system are referred to the functional unit 1 m3 of influent wastewater and 2 88 kg of food waste 2 2 1 technologies existing in the scenarios for foreground processes in wastewater treatment a pilot scale treatment unit was operated under different operational conditions and inventory data were mainly provided by the pilot scale plant operation the pilot scale treatment unit was located in one of the preliminary wwtps in istanbul which consisted of a high rate biological treatment unit a settling tank and a waste pre treatment unit for feeding food waste the pilot scale plant was operated under different operational conditions and the treatment performance was investigated the excess sludge of the plant was digested in a laboratory scale digester and methane generation potential was monitored the details about the pilot scale plant and laboratory scale digester can be found in guven et al 2017a and guven et al 2017b respectively the laboratory scale digester was operated to investigate the digestibility of the excess sludge of the pilot scale plant the sludge was digested under mesophilic conditions at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days and the digestion performance was monitored while the experimental data were used for the scenarios of s2 and s3 literature data were used for s1 experimental data used are from the field pilot tests and consist mainly of process efficiency and design parameters which to a large extent should be realized also in full scale application on the other hand guven et al 2017a concluded that the removal efficiencies and operational parameters included in the lci in this study are consistent with the findings in full scale applications as described previously the only data from laboratory scale is for the digestibility of the excess sludge i e the cod removal in ad which is also a type of design parameter the summary of data inventory for wastewater and sludge treatment processes is shown in table 1 the data source to be used to prepare table 1 can be found in si 2 the inventory of food waste treatment processes comprises landfill composting and bio drying these processes have been investigated frequently for food waste management from an lca point of view by many researchers angelo et al 2017 buratti et al 2015 the data inventory for the waste treatment processes compost characteristics fertilizer application characteristics leachate characterization limit values for stack gas in incineration chemical consumption energy mix transportation is demonstrated in si 2 the summary of data inventory is shown in table 2 as mentioned in the scenario description food waste management is identical in scenarios 0 2 and thus the given inputs and outputs in table 2 are the same for these scenarios the magnitudes of the flows are also the same in scenario 3 but the signs of the values are opposite since food waste is treated together with municipal wastewater in this scenario meaning there is an avoidance of conventional food waste management processes sanitary landfilling bio drying and composting 2 2 2 flows not followed from cradle to grave and simplifications in the experimental studies food waste was carried to the experiment site manually and prior to feed to the system a waste shredder was used to make food waste pumpable along with wastewater in the full scale application it is assumed that food waste will reach the wwtps through the sewer line since reported energy and water consumption are quite low for kitchen grinders bolzonella et al 2003 marashlian and el fadel 2005 no environmental impact have been considered from the usage of kitchen grinders and it has been assumed there is no significant impact on sewer lines due to very low increase in hydraulic load it is also assumed that sludge thickener has one output as thickened sludge and anaerobic digester has two outputs as biogas and digestate meaning side wastewater streams thickener and digester supernatants are not included in the study the internal heating purpose of the digester and sludge drying have been taken into account to calculate the credits of heat recovery from the chp plant 2 3 life cycle impact assessment impact categories were chosen based on investigated processes and emissions from the processes the recipe method hierarchist approach at midpoint has been used as the lcia method in the assessment lorenzo toja et al 2015 the characterization factors for the method were mainly taken from ecoinvent database as implemented in simapro 8 4 pré consultants amersfoort netherlands the following midpoint impact categories have been investigated climate change terrestrial acidification freshwater acidification marine eutrophication human toxicity terrestrial ecotoxicity freshwater ecotoxicity marine ecotoxicity fossil depletion 2 4 life cycle interpretation the system boundary can change the lca results significantly and a sensitivity analysis can be beneficial to give insight into the influence of defining the system boundary and developing scenarios niero et al 2014 a modified assumption on inventory data may have a significant influence on the results thus the following alternative scenarios were tested in the sensitivity and improvement analyses using another fuel mix for electricity which includes more renewable energy sources increased food waste addition to the sewer system replacing simple settling with cet after hras the details about alternative scenarios are mentioned in si 2 3 results the results from the complete assessment consist of comprehensible datasets on various levels the results are presented for each scenario with focus on the impact categories in which the actual scenario performs best the change of various environmental impacts in different scenarios is discussed with reasons in this context environmental gains and burdens are distinguished in terms of their sources wastewater sludge treatment waste treatment and transportation and when necessary also with respect to sub compartments direct emissions chemicals energy fuels and diesel vehicles and pipeline and ultimately also the underlying contributing emissions 3 1 overall results in figs 3 4 all scenarios are plotted showing their relative contribution in relation to s0 the impact in s0 is set to 100 a contribution with 0 would mean no environmental impact negative numbers mean further improvement resulting in negative contribution i e saving emissions the largest improvements are observed for freshwater eutrophication and freshwater ecotoxicity see fig 3 the other impact categories are shown in fig 4 the best performing scenario is s1 all scenarios mean huge improvements in relation to current practice ranging from 2250 freshwater eutrophication for s1 to 1013 freshwater ecotoxicity for s3 all future scenarios 1 3 perform better than the current situation s0 for all impact categories except for climate change in s2 hras s3 hras with food waste performs best or equal to s2 hras in all categories except for human toxicity freshwater eutrophication and freshwater ecotoxicity for these categories the net result is negative for s3 but still somewhat higher than s1 primary treatment these findings are in line with previous lca studies on hras for instance schaubroeck et al 2015 assessed a lca study on the strass wwtp involving hras process and most of the impact categories had negative scores meaning environmental gains smith et al 2014 also evaluated the performance of hras process followed by ad from the lca perspective and negative scores were registered in climate change acidification and eutrophication for high strength concentrations at influent for the sake of transparency all results are shown in absolute numbers in table 3 3 1 1 scenario 1 primary treatment this scenario is the best performing with respect to freshwater eutrophication fig 5 human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity compared to s0 the future scenarios all include a sludge treatment the major benefit of that is that biogas will be produced in sludge treatment which is converted into electricity that replaces energy sources with higher emissions both at combustion and pre combustion since it is reported that freshwater eutrophication is probably attributed in the environmental effect chain to the fossil fuel based energy production and use slagstad and brattebø 2013 thus the energy from biogas production in scenarios 1 3 contributes to an avoided environment burden the lowest impact is found for s1 even if the share of sludge treatment is higher for scenarios 2 3 this is due to that emissions from wastewater treatment do not increase in s1 also human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity show the same pattern as freshwater eutrophication in terms of which scenario is most preferable and the contribution from main compartments this means that sludge treatment reduces the overall impact significantly regardless of scenario this result emphasizes the importance of a systems perspective as the main contributor is energy emissions that do not occur on site 3 1 2 scenario 2 high rate activated sludge process hras this scenario is the best performing with respect to marine eutrophication almost similar to s1 and s3 as shown in fig 6 and marine ecotoxicity fig 7 scenarios 1 3 do not show huge differences but they all perform better than s0 all scenarios mean resulting environmental impact i e all values are above zero this is because the hras treatment in scenarios 2 3 focuses only on carbon removal while it is known that marine eutrophication is attributed to n emission in the effluent in addition it is reported that eutrophication can also be caused by the production and use of chemicals niero et al 2014 as a result use of chemicals in sludge treatment in scenarios 1 3 are contributing with negative impact fig 6 in s2 and s3 the impact is cut by half compared to s0 this is due to that emissions of heavy metals from the wastewater treatment process are reduced in both primary treatment and by the use of hras a minor contribution from sludge treatment can be observed for scenarios 1 3 fig 7 3 1 3 scenario 3 high rate activated sludge process hras with food waste addition not surprisingly it has been observed in fig 8 that s3 has a beneficial contribution in terms of climate change whereas all the other scenarios experience negative impacts this is a result of saved direct emissions as well as chemical use as compared to waste treatment in all the other scenarios in addition by transporting some of the food waste via sewer lines it also contributes to a saving in the previous emissions from road transportation on the other hand it is also interesting to find that s2 performs worse than s0 this is because of methane emissions from hras in s2 there is some compensation in terms of energy from sludge treatment as the displacement of natural gas as a fuel with recovered methane from biogas production can indirectly relieve the climate change potential foley et al 2010b but it is not sufficient due to similar reasons as explained in the previous figure s3 has an advantage over not only s0 but also future scenarios 1 2 as shown in fig 9 although deployment of sludge treatment in scenarios 1 3 contributes positively to the terrestrial acidification as compared to s0 the impact from transportation plays a very important role when comparing future scenarios 1 3 it is also noticed in this category that s2 has a worse performance as compared with s1 this can be attributed to higher energy and fuel consumptions in the wwtp on the other hand in fig 10 even if s3 still performs best in the impact category of terrestrial ecotoxicity and s2 is a bit worse than s1 all the other scenarios i e scenarios 0 2 suggest negative impacts while the s3 indicates a benefit such a finding highlights again the strength of s3 by including food waste in the wastewater treatment this strength is mainly due to the fact that one important source to terrestrial ecotoxicity is from consumption of the coal based electricity niero et al 2014 toxic impacts from the heavy metals in wastewater and waste treatment exceed already the benefits of avoided coal based energy consumption by recovered biogas in scenarios 1 and 2 the avoided coal based fuel and diesel in transport of food waste in s3 as well as avoided leachate from waste treatment are resulting in a positive impact consequently it is also believed that a ranking of all scenarios in the impact category of fossil depletion should be as same as the one for terrestrial ecotoxicity towards that end this has been confirmed in fig 11 the fact that waste treatment including associated transports goes from emitting to saving emissions makes a major difference when comparing scenarios 2 and 3 for the impact categories climate change terrestrial ecotoxicity and fossil depletion the impact of such change is less for terrestrial acidification as only emissions from transports are affected 3 2 sensitivity analysis by setting a preliminary plant as a reference scenario different upgrading alternatives have been compared and assessed some important issues such as energy use with its origin addition of food waste the effect of enhanced settling after biological treatment should also be discussed with sensitivity and improvement analysis 3 2 1 the fuel mix for electricity s1 is not affected significantly since a primary settling process does not consume as much electricity as biological processes the difference compared to main results for scenarios 2 3 are depicted in fig 12 s2 shows an increase of 360 in terms of fossil depletion going from 1 5 to 7 22 g oil eq fu the main explanation is that the electricity from biogas combustion from sludge treatment will receive less credit in terms of emission reduction in addition some increase is noted for waste treatment due to a similar reason regarding landfill gas the effect is somewhat counteracted by decreased use of fossil fuels for electricity use in wastewater treatment climate change increases by 6 that is considerably lower than the figure for fossil depletion this is due to that emissions contributing to climate change are found also for treatment processes such as landfill etc making the contribution from electricity to be of minor importance freshwater eutrophication increases with 10 human toxicity 19 and terrestrial ecotoxicity 6 due to the same reason electricity based on a higher degree of renewables decreases the importance of electricity generation from the wastewater and waste treatment systems scenario 3 is not that sensitive to the energy mix with changes of 5 8 for climate change terrestrial acidification freshwater eutrophication and fossil depletion and for human toxicity 17 just as for s2 so why is the fossil depletion not that much affected in s3 the major difference between s2 and s3 is the shift for transports and waste treatment from netto emitting to saving emissions this shift means more in terms of fossil depletion than the impact of changing the electricity mix 3 2 2 increased addition of food waste changing from 10 to 50 food inclusion leads to dramatic changes in the results as presented in fig 13 compared to the original results major improvements are noticed for climate change 465 terrestrial ecotoxicity 208 fossil depletion 142 and terrestrial acidification 121 for other categories the impact is higher freshwater eutrophication 83 human toxicity 116 freshwater ecotoxicity 44 while some remain the same marine ecotoxicity 1 marine eutrophication 0 the profile is consistent with the impact of avoided transports and waste management dominated by landfill disposal taking into consideration counteracting effects in the wastewater treatment and sludge compartments changing from 10 to 50 blending is of course a major change but it provides a rule of thumb in terms of climate change reduction multiply the food waste addition by five and the climate change will improve as much 3 3 improvement analysis 3 3 1 chemically enhanced treatment cet as been described already a cet enhances sludge production due to the improvement in total suspended solids removal efficiency thus improvements are proposed for s2 and s3 where cet is implemented respectively in the settling tank after the hras as a result it shows in fig 14 that the proposed cet does not result in an overall improvement of environmental impacts in the case of s3 except marine eutrophication of 32 on the other hand the implemented cet reduces environmental impacts to a wider range in the case of s2 i e impacts in terrestrial acidification freshwater eutrophication marine eutrophication human toxicity as well as fossil depletion have all been improved since ferric chloride together with coagulant polymer is added to the wastewater treatment during a cet implementation when making insight into those impact categories that worsened one realizes that terrestrial ecotoxicity freshwater ecotoxicity and marine ecotoxicity have been deteriorated in both s2 and s3 on the contrary clear improvements have been suggested in the categories of freshwater eutrophication as well as marine eutrophication in both scenarios this can be understood that although chemical uses introduce negative impacts from the wastewater treatment the enhanced biogas production would compensate to a larger extent in those impacts resulting from the use of energy fuel and diesel in sludge treatment due to the similar reason s2 indicates a major improvement of 550 in the category of fossil depletion such a change has however not been experienced in s3 where the improvement shows only 15 difference 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties as described previously the generated heat from the chp plant was assumed to be used for internal heating purpose given that the recovered heat corresponds exactly to the heat needed for maintaining a mesophilic digestion consequently no credits have been taken into account from the use of sludge generated heat in the future scenarios 1 3 such an assumption has been also used in i e yoshida et al 2014 however care may be taken when one equalizes the generated heat with the heat needed for processes this is because the net energy consumption is an important influential parameter when calculating impacts among different scenarios in addition it was assumed that there is no reject water from sludge dewatering nor supernatant from the anaerobic digester meaning that side wastewater streams have not been investigated in this study as a result calculated impacts for respectively wastewater treatment and sludge treatment may not reflect the actual partition between those main compartments it should however be pointed out that the total impacts from the above mentioned compartments will not be influenced 4 2 addition of food waste in wwtp the results suggest there is a high environmental benefit of including food waste into the sewer it can of course be seen problematic to blend in a pure food waste fraction into a contaminated sewer but it is clearly a better option than the main practice of landfill disposal with less resource recovery rate a comparison to an alternative like a food waste digester is not included in this assessment but should be investigated further in such an assessment the difference in waste collection could be further highlighted as transportation has a huge impact on some categories and food waste addition to the sewer can help to reduce transportation emissions to a large extent 4 3 further improvements the reduced treatment efficiency in s3 proves that optimization of final settling after biological processes is very important improved settling can enhance energy recovery and consequently increase environmental benefits through sludge digestion as mentioned previously s3 showed the best performance in some impact categories moreover if final settling is improved with some modifications such as implementing membrane separation or lamella separators s3 could end up as being the best in each impact category 5 conclusion the proposed upgrading alternatives all perform better than the current situation for all impact categories except for climate change in s2 hras however scenarios 2 3 with carbon removal focused on hras do not suggest large improvement in marine eutrophication as compared to primary treatment and current practice the impact from food waste transportation plays a very important role s3 hras food waste addition has a beneficial contribution in terms of climate change as well as terrestrial ecotoxicity whereas all the other scenarios experience environmental burdens the overall results show that a systems perspective in lca has a great significance to evaluate environmental impacts of different wastewater treatment alternatives since some emissions such as energy transportation etc occur outside of wwtps appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data related to this article e supplementary information of this work can be found in online

19324,life cycle assessment lca is a beneficial tool to evaluate the performance of wastewater treatment plants wwtps and to compare different upgrading options the main objective of this study is to investigate the environmental impact of upgrading options of a preliminary wwtp in istanbul turkey the preliminary plant currently consists of mechanical treatment units and various upgrading options including primary treatment and high rate activated sludge system hras process as well as the addition of food waste to wastewater were compared results showed that the baseline scenario s0 had worse performance than all future scenarios s1 3 except for climate change the scenario of adding food waste to wastewater s3 has the best performance in climate change terrestrial acidification terrestrial ecotoxicity and fossil depletion increased addition of food waste was also tested in the sensitivity analysis and major improvements were obtained especially in climate change and terrestrial ecotoxicity keywords food waste high rate activated sludge process life cycle assessment primary treatment sludge wastewater treatment plant upgrading 1 introduction population growth and urbanization have increased dramatically during the last century and this situation has caused severe impacts on the total environment including water air and soil flores alsina et al 2010 within this scope wastewater treatment and municipal solid waste msw management have become important issues in many aspects such as public health ecological sustainability and aesthetics similar to other big cities in developing countries msw related issues are very crucial in istanbul and there still exist some problems in spite of the achievements kanat 2010 currently 40 of the total wastewater flow is treated at advanced wastewater treatment plants wwtps while the rest is treated only mechanically at preliminary wwtps and discharged to the sea via marine outfall systems even if discharge of preliminary treated wastewater to the sea and bosphorus strait is in agreement with the wastewater management plan of the city in the short and medium terms chemically enhanced treatment cet and high rate activated sludge hras processes will be implemented to the existing preliminary wwtps in the long term ozturk and altay 2015 despite wwtps are dedicated to remove pollutants from wastewater and improve water quality in receiving water bodies during the operation of the wwtps some other environmental impacts occur due to energy use chemicals consumption and excess sludge production wang et al 2015 it is therefore important that also indirect impact following e g energy turnover is included together with direct process emissions with respect to environmental impact categories such as greenhouse gas ghg emissions eutrophication and resource consumption in particular the environmental footprint of a wwtp should be addressed process by process to comprehend the existing situation subsequently life cycle assessment lca can assist to improve the process performance as well as to minimize the environmental loads bai et al 2018 as a matter of fact lca is regarded as a beneficial tool in the decision making process as it can quantify the potential impacts of a product or service from a holistic approach hernández padilla et al 2017 iso 2006 some impact categories are found to be dominant in overall lca results of a wwtp moreira et al 2018 such as global warming mainly due to energy use for aeration toxicity rising from heavy metal content of excess sludge and eutrophication caused by organic substances and nutrients in effluent moreover lca applications in assessing wwtps can be very useful to compare different treatment alternatives foley et al 2010a analyzed different process configurations and concluded that no treatment and primary treatment scenarios have the worst performances in terms of releasing methane and nitrous oxide emissions to the environment current technology promises the improvement in effluent quality and especially eutrophication potential can be mitigated whereas other impacts i e climate change ozone depletion acidification and ecotoxicity generally tend to increase due to intensive treatment rahman et al 2016 the dominance of discharge limits on environmental burdens was also exhibited by wang et al 2015 who stated that except eutrophication potential carrying out moderate level treatment is more favorable than high level treatment in terms of net environmental benefits conventional activated sludge cas system is one of the most commonly applied processes in municipal wastewater treatment piao et al 2016 however it requires much aeration energy and a significant share of organic matter present in wastewater is oxidized which can also be valorized in anaerobic digestion ad jimenez et al 2015 high energy exploitation increases environmental burdens and hence cas can show worse performance than other process configurations electricity use effluent pollutant concentrations and sludge processes are given as the main drivers determining lca results in cas plants but it should be noted that the results can vary spatially and local issues should not be overlooked corominas et al 2013 polruang et al 2018 stated that electricity use and its mix are the principal elements affecting the results of the whole impact categories excluding eutrophication and abiotic depletion garfí et al 2017 compared cas with constructed wetlands and high rate algal ponds and reported that cas had the highest environmental impacts in the whole impact categories due to the operational emissions postacchini et al 2016 conducted a similar study and they also reported higher impacts in cas treatment than those in trickling filter and high rate anaerobic aerobic digestion configurations high operational emissions in cas demonstrate that reducing operational energy demand can play an important role to mitigate environmental impacts high rate activated sludge hras process is a variant of cas systems which ensures lower energy consumption and higher energy recovery in ad by operation at low dissolved oxygen concentrations and minimal sludge residence times kinyua et al 2017 strass and wolfgangsee ischl wwtps in austria are some examples of full scale energy positive plants applying hras process shen et al 2015 which achieved this goal by means of optimizing aeration and diverting more organic matter to the anaerobic digesters nowak et al 2011 smith et al 2014 compared hras ad with cas ad and aerobic membrane bioreactor ad in terms of lca and they used a modeling tool to estimate effluent quality schaubroeck et al 2015 surveyed a lca study on a full scale wwtp having hras process but they focused on side stream treatment rather than evaluating the performance of hras process ad composting incineration and landfilling are the most common food waste management alternatives in developing countries thi et al 2015 however separate collection and transportation of food waste play a significant role for lca outcomes in different impact categories becker et al 2017 xu et al 2015 on the other hand treatment of food waste at wwtps is another option for food waste management nevertheless kitchen grinder installed in households is the prerequisite for such an option thomas 2011 as a matter of fact in the above mentioned studies becker et al 2017 xu et al 2015 the food waste is assumed to be transported by truck to the wwtp whereas the impact of transporting food waste by sewer lines or avoidance of road transport of food waste is not examined in addition to that none of those few existing lca studies becker et al 2017 xu et al 2015 dealing with inclusion of food waste with wastewater treatment assess the impact with respect to preliminary wastewater treatment together with traditional landfilling composting of food waste which is still widely applied in many regions including the region under this study to the best of our knowledge this work is the first to examine the hras ad system from the lca perspective in a turkish context by using site specific data different food waste management alternatives as well as using kitchen grinders have been evaluated by some authors however there are only a few studies becker et al 2017 lundie and peters 2005 morris et al 2017 on this issue and more experimental studies should be conducted to get a better picture as attempted in this study more importantly there have not been any studies in the literature that couples hras treatment with co treatment of municipal wastewater and food waste this study can be considered as the first attempt which assesses the possibility of co treatment by applying hras treatment from the lca perspective the aim of this study is to assess various wastewater treatment alternatives and to evaluate their environmental impacts in line with lca methodology for upgrading a preliminary wwtp located in istanbul turkey including primary treatment and hras as well as the possibility of treating food waste the results provide an insight into the change in the magnitude of environmental loads as well as beneficial contribution when a typical preliminary wwtp is upgraded to a secondary carbon removal wwtp in addition the effect of including food waste to wastewater is to be evaluated by considering not only the wwtp operations but also msw management operations the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the followed methodology is given by describing the goal and scope of the study investigated scenarios and life cycle inventory lci based on the defined life cycle impact assessment lcia method and selected impact categories in section 3 impacts from suggested alternative scenarios are described with a sensitivity analysis as well an improvement analysis following these in section 4 discussions are made on issues concerning uncertainty food waste inclusion as well as further improvements the summary and conclusions are given in section 5 2 methodology iso 14040 principles iso 2006 have been followed to perform the lca the methodological framework given by iso 14040 comprises of four stages goal and scope definition is the first and crucial stage which involves clear and consistent definition of the study the most time consuming stage of a lca is the life cycle inventory analysis and it requires a comprehensive data collection potential environmental impacts are calculated in the life cycle impact assessment stage by using the data obtained in the life cycle inventory stage combined with a state of the art impact assessment method the fourth and the last stage is the interpretation of the results and some conclusions as well as recommendations are drawn from a general perspective the stages in lca have been handled as described below in detail 2 1 goal and scope definition 2 1 1 aim and goal the overall aim of the study is to identify environmental impacts of the existing preliminary wwtp as well as to evaluate and compare different upgrading options the goal is to find out the environmental impacts of different wastewater treatment alternatives and to identify the environmental impacts of food waste management through treatment at wwtps or current practices of food waste treatment as given in the previous section primary treatment and hras are investigated as upgrading options and lastly the alternative of adding some part of food waste to wastewater is discussed 2 1 2 scenarios the following scenarios have been investigated scenario 0 s0 the current preliminary treatment scenario 1 s1 implementation of primary treatment scenario 2 s2 implementation of hras process scenario 3 s3 implementation of hras process as well as food waste addition to wastewater the detailed flow chart for the scenarios is found in supplementary information 1 si 1 fig 1 shows a simplified description of the scenarios in scenarios 1 3 excess sludge is treated by ad and the biogas is used for generating electricity at a combined heat and power chp plant the generated heat from the chp plant is assumed to be used internally for heating purposes in the sludge digestion as proposed by yoshida et al 2014 it was also assumed that 55 of heating demand in sludge drying is covered by the excess heat of the chp plant buonocore et al 2016 the digestate from ad is incinerated in an msw incinerator with energy recovery chp the digestate management is equal for scenarios 1 3 it should be noted that only a minor part of the generated food waste is treated together with wastewater while a certain amount of food waste is treated with wastewater the remaining part is treated with current msw practices in istanbul in order to have consistent scenarios to make fair comparisons the environmental burdens as well as gains should be taken into account for food waste management the scenarios have been transformed into comparable ones by adding compensatory processes food waste management processes as proposed in i e eriksson et al 2002 the details about current msw management in istanbul are presented in supplementary information 2 si 2 2 1 3 functional unit two separate functional units fu have been used since the lca covers both wastewater treatment and solid waste management for wastewater treatment processes the fu is set to 1 m3 of influent wastewater considering the wastewater generation and food waste production rates in istanbul the equivalence of 1 m3 of influent wastewater is calculated as 2 88 kg of food waste the calculation methodology for food waste equivalence of municipal wastewater as well as the characteristics of wastewater and food waste are provided in si 2 2 1 4 system boundaries several operational stages have been taken into account when making impact assessment i e wastewater treatment sludge treatment and food waste treatment processes construction and demolition phases are not considered in the study since their impacts are limited in relation to the overall impact bai et al 2017 garfí et al 2017 fig 2 depicts the system boundary and compensatory system used in this study on the other hand transportation of sludge and wwtp residues buonocore et al 2016 as well as food waste collection and transportation martinez blanco et al 2010 have been included in the system under study it should be pointed out that compost refuse derived fuel rdf fuel and avoided fertilizer transportation are also considered in transportation background processes in the study comprise energy supply and use of chemicals for running the processes morera et al 2017 2 1 5 allocation in order to avoid allocation problems system expansion approach is used eriksson et al 2016 avoided energy fuel and fertilizer usage from treatment processes have been credited generated and used electrical and heat energy are not accounted together but distinguished in the assessment for each of the multi output processes the outputs are investigated one by one as described in the lci 2 2 life cycle inventory a detailed lci was conducted by using various sources such as experimental results relevant scientific literature as well as reports and performance indicators of the existing treatment facilities in istanbul required data were primarily obtained from conducted experimental studies to find out more accurate results and different process configuration scenarios were studied in order to make a comparison between these some other required data have been derived from up to date reports and bulletins released by local foundations not to overlook current wastewater and waste management practices first of all the literature produced in turkey was used to estimate the parameters that were not measured experimentally in wastewater and food waste characterization as well as for background processes on the other hand it should be noted that the selection of technologies and their performance still should be considered to be generic as similar pre conditions exist elsewhere inventory data for the system are referred to the functional unit 1 m3 of influent wastewater and 2 88 kg of food waste 2 2 1 technologies existing in the scenarios for foreground processes in wastewater treatment a pilot scale treatment unit was operated under different operational conditions and inventory data were mainly provided by the pilot scale plant operation the pilot scale treatment unit was located in one of the preliminary wwtps in istanbul which consisted of a high rate biological treatment unit a settling tank and a waste pre treatment unit for feeding food waste the pilot scale plant was operated under different operational conditions and the treatment performance was investigated the excess sludge of the plant was digested in a laboratory scale digester and methane generation potential was monitored the details about the pilot scale plant and laboratory scale digester can be found in guven et al 2017a and guven et al 2017b respectively the laboratory scale digester was operated to investigate the digestibility of the excess sludge of the pilot scale plant the sludge was digested under mesophilic conditions at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 20 days and the digestion performance was monitored while the experimental data were used for the scenarios of s2 and s3 literature data were used for s1 experimental data used are from the field pilot tests and consist mainly of process efficiency and design parameters which to a large extent should be realized also in full scale application on the other hand guven et al 2017a concluded that the removal efficiencies and operational parameters included in the lci in this study are consistent with the findings in full scale applications as described previously the only data from laboratory scale is for the digestibility of the excess sludge i e the cod removal in ad which is also a type of design parameter the summary of data inventory for wastewater and sludge treatment processes is shown in table 1 the data source to be used to prepare table 1 can be found in si 2 the inventory of food waste treatment processes comprises landfill composting and bio drying these processes have been investigated frequently for food waste management from an lca point of view by many researchers angelo et al 2017 buratti et al 2015 the data inventory for the waste treatment processes compost characteristics fertilizer application characteristics leachate characterization limit values for stack gas in incineration chemical consumption energy mix transportation is demonstrated in si 2 the summary of data inventory is shown in table 2 as mentioned in the scenario description food waste management is identical in scenarios 0 2 and thus the given inputs and outputs in table 2 are the same for these scenarios the magnitudes of the flows are also the same in scenario 3 but the signs of the values are opposite since food waste is treated together with municipal wastewater in this scenario meaning there is an avoidance of conventional food waste management processes sanitary landfilling bio drying and composting 2 2 2 flows not followed from cradle to grave and simplifications in the experimental studies food waste was carried to the experiment site manually and prior to feed to the system a waste shredder was used to make food waste pumpable along with wastewater in the full scale application it is assumed that food waste will reach the wwtps through the sewer line since reported energy and water consumption are quite low for kitchen grinders bolzonella et al 2003 marashlian and el fadel 2005 no environmental impact have been considered from the usage of kitchen grinders and it has been assumed there is no significant impact on sewer lines due to very low increase in hydraulic load it is also assumed that sludge thickener has one output as thickened sludge and anaerobic digester has two outputs as biogas and digestate meaning side wastewater streams thickener and digester supernatants are not included in the study the internal heating purpose of the digester and sludge drying have been taken into account to calculate the credits of heat recovery from the chp plant 2 3 life cycle impact assessment impact categories were chosen based on investigated processes and emissions from the processes the recipe method hierarchist approach at midpoint has been used as the lcia method in the assessment lorenzo toja et al 2015 the characterization factors for the method were mainly taken from ecoinvent database as implemented in simapro 8 4 pré consultants amersfoort netherlands the following midpoint impact categories have been investigated climate change terrestrial acidification freshwater acidification marine eutrophication human toxicity terrestrial ecotoxicity freshwater ecotoxicity marine ecotoxicity fossil depletion 2 4 life cycle interpretation the system boundary can change the lca results significantly and a sensitivity analysis can be beneficial to give insight into the influence of defining the system boundary and developing scenarios niero et al 2014 a modified assumption on inventory data may have a significant influence on the results thus the following alternative scenarios were tested in the sensitivity and improvement analyses using another fuel mix for electricity which includes more renewable energy sources increased food waste addition to the sewer system replacing simple settling with cet after hras the details about alternative scenarios are mentioned in si 2 3 results the results from the complete assessment consist of comprehensible datasets on various levels the results are presented for each scenario with focus on the impact categories in which the actual scenario performs best the change of various environmental impacts in different scenarios is discussed with reasons in this context environmental gains and burdens are distinguished in terms of their sources wastewater sludge treatment waste treatment and transportation and when necessary also with respect to sub compartments direct emissions chemicals energy fuels and diesel vehicles and pipeline and ultimately also the underlying contributing emissions 3 1 overall results in figs 3 4 all scenarios are plotted showing their relative contribution in relation to s0 the impact in s0 is set to 100 a contribution with 0 would mean no environmental impact negative numbers mean further improvement resulting in negative contribution i e saving emissions the largest improvements are observed for freshwater eutrophication and freshwater ecotoxicity see fig 3 the other impact categories are shown in fig 4 the best performing scenario is s1 all scenarios mean huge improvements in relation to current practice ranging from 2250 freshwater eutrophication for s1 to 1013 freshwater ecotoxicity for s3 all future scenarios 1 3 perform better than the current situation s0 for all impact categories except for climate change in s2 hras s3 hras with food waste performs best or equal to s2 hras in all categories except for human toxicity freshwater eutrophication and freshwater ecotoxicity for these categories the net result is negative for s3 but still somewhat higher than s1 primary treatment these findings are in line with previous lca studies on hras for instance schaubroeck et al 2015 assessed a lca study on the strass wwtp involving hras process and most of the impact categories had negative scores meaning environmental gains smith et al 2014 also evaluated the performance of hras process followed by ad from the lca perspective and negative scores were registered in climate change acidification and eutrophication for high strength concentrations at influent for the sake of transparency all results are shown in absolute numbers in table 3 3 1 1 scenario 1 primary treatment this scenario is the best performing with respect to freshwater eutrophication fig 5 human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity compared to s0 the future scenarios all include a sludge treatment the major benefit of that is that biogas will be produced in sludge treatment which is converted into electricity that replaces energy sources with higher emissions both at combustion and pre combustion since it is reported that freshwater eutrophication is probably attributed in the environmental effect chain to the fossil fuel based energy production and use slagstad and brattebø 2013 thus the energy from biogas production in scenarios 1 3 contributes to an avoided environment burden the lowest impact is found for s1 even if the share of sludge treatment is higher for scenarios 2 3 this is due to that emissions from wastewater treatment do not increase in s1 also human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity show the same pattern as freshwater eutrophication in terms of which scenario is most preferable and the contribution from main compartments this means that sludge treatment reduces the overall impact significantly regardless of scenario this result emphasizes the importance of a systems perspective as the main contributor is energy emissions that do not occur on site 3 1 2 scenario 2 high rate activated sludge process hras this scenario is the best performing with respect to marine eutrophication almost similar to s1 and s3 as shown in fig 6 and marine ecotoxicity fig 7 scenarios 1 3 do not show huge differences but they all perform better than s0 all scenarios mean resulting environmental impact i e all values are above zero this is because the hras treatment in scenarios 2 3 focuses only on carbon removal while it is known that marine eutrophication is attributed to n emission in the effluent in addition it is reported that eutrophication can also be caused by the production and use of chemicals niero et al 2014 as a result use of chemicals in sludge treatment in scenarios 1 3 are contributing with negative impact fig 6 in s2 and s3 the impact is cut by half compared to s0 this is due to that emissions of heavy metals from the wastewater treatment process are reduced in both primary treatment and by the use of hras a minor contribution from sludge treatment can be observed for scenarios 1 3 fig 7 3 1 3 scenario 3 high rate activated sludge process hras with food waste addition not surprisingly it has been observed in fig 8 that s3 has a beneficial contribution in terms of climate change whereas all the other scenarios experience negative impacts this is a result of saved direct emissions as well as chemical use as compared to waste treatment in all the other scenarios in addition by transporting some of the food waste via sewer lines it also contributes to a saving in the previous emissions from road transportation on the other hand it is also interesting to find that s2 performs worse than s0 this is because of methane emissions from hras in s2 there is some compensation in terms of energy from sludge treatment as the displacement of natural gas as a fuel with recovered methane from biogas production can indirectly relieve the climate change potential foley et al 2010b but it is not sufficient due to similar reasons as explained in the previous figure s3 has an advantage over not only s0 but also future scenarios 1 2 as shown in fig 9 although deployment of sludge treatment in scenarios 1 3 contributes positively to the terrestrial acidification as compared to s0 the impact from transportation plays a very important role when comparing future scenarios 1 3 it is also noticed in this category that s2 has a worse performance as compared with s1 this can be attributed to higher energy and fuel consumptions in the wwtp on the other hand in fig 10 even if s3 still performs best in the impact category of terrestrial ecotoxicity and s2 is a bit worse than s1 all the other scenarios i e scenarios 0 2 suggest negative impacts while the s3 indicates a benefit such a finding highlights again the strength of s3 by including food waste in the wastewater treatment this strength is mainly due to the fact that one important source to terrestrial ecotoxicity is from consumption of the coal based electricity niero et al 2014 toxic impacts from the heavy metals in wastewater and waste treatment exceed already the benefits of avoided coal based energy consumption by recovered biogas in scenarios 1 and 2 the avoided coal based fuel and diesel in transport of food waste in s3 as well as avoided leachate from waste treatment are resulting in a positive impact consequently it is also believed that a ranking of all scenarios in the impact category of fossil depletion should be as same as the one for terrestrial ecotoxicity towards that end this has been confirmed in fig 11 the fact that waste treatment including associated transports goes from emitting to saving emissions makes a major difference when comparing scenarios 2 and 3 for the impact categories climate change terrestrial ecotoxicity and fossil depletion the impact of such change is less for terrestrial acidification as only emissions from transports are affected 3 2 sensitivity analysis by setting a preliminary plant as a reference scenario different upgrading alternatives have been compared and assessed some important issues such as energy use with its origin addition of food waste the effect of enhanced settling after biological treatment should also be discussed with sensitivity and improvement analysis 3 2 1 the fuel mix for electricity s1 is not affected significantly since a primary settling process does not consume as much electricity as biological processes the difference compared to main results for scenarios 2 3 are depicted in fig 12 s2 shows an increase of 360 in terms of fossil depletion going from 1 5 to 7 22 g oil eq fu the main explanation is that the electricity from biogas combustion from sludge treatment will receive less credit in terms of emission reduction in addition some increase is noted for waste treatment due to a similar reason regarding landfill gas the effect is somewhat counteracted by decreased use of fossil fuels for electricity use in wastewater treatment climate change increases by 6 that is considerably lower than the figure for fossil depletion this is due to that emissions contributing to climate change are found also for treatment processes such as landfill etc making the contribution from electricity to be of minor importance freshwater eutrophication increases with 10 human toxicity 19 and terrestrial ecotoxicity 6 due to the same reason electricity based on a higher degree of renewables decreases the importance of electricity generation from the wastewater and waste treatment systems scenario 3 is not that sensitive to the energy mix with changes of 5 8 for climate change terrestrial acidification freshwater eutrophication and fossil depletion and for human toxicity 17 just as for s2 so why is the fossil depletion not that much affected in s3 the major difference between s2 and s3 is the shift for transports and waste treatment from netto emitting to saving emissions this shift means more in terms of fossil depletion than the impact of changing the electricity mix 3 2 2 increased addition of food waste changing from 10 to 50 food inclusion leads to dramatic changes in the results as presented in fig 13 compared to the original results major improvements are noticed for climate change 465 terrestrial ecotoxicity 208 fossil depletion 142 and terrestrial acidification 121 for other categories the impact is higher freshwater eutrophication 83 human toxicity 116 freshwater ecotoxicity 44 while some remain the same marine ecotoxicity 1 marine eutrophication 0 the profile is consistent with the impact of avoided transports and waste management dominated by landfill disposal taking into consideration counteracting effects in the wastewater treatment and sludge compartments changing from 10 to 50 blending is of course a major change but it provides a rule of thumb in terms of climate change reduction multiply the food waste addition by five and the climate change will improve as much 3 3 improvement analysis 3 3 1 chemically enhanced treatment cet as been described already a cet enhances sludge production due to the improvement in total suspended solids removal efficiency thus improvements are proposed for s2 and s3 where cet is implemented respectively in the settling tank after the hras as a result it shows in fig 14 that the proposed cet does not result in an overall improvement of environmental impacts in the case of s3 except marine eutrophication of 32 on the other hand the implemented cet reduces environmental impacts to a wider range in the case of s2 i e impacts in terrestrial acidification freshwater eutrophication marine eutrophication human toxicity as well as fossil depletion have all been improved since ferric chloride together with coagulant polymer is added to the wastewater treatment during a cet implementation when making insight into those impact categories that worsened one realizes that terrestrial ecotoxicity freshwater ecotoxicity and marine ecotoxicity have been deteriorated in both s2 and s3 on the contrary clear improvements have been suggested in the categories of freshwater eutrophication as well as marine eutrophication in both scenarios this can be understood that although chemical uses introduce negative impacts from the wastewater treatment the enhanced biogas production would compensate to a larger extent in those impacts resulting from the use of energy fuel and diesel in sludge treatment due to the similar reason s2 indicates a major improvement of 550 in the category of fossil depletion such a change has however not been experienced in s3 where the improvement shows only 15 difference 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties as described previously the generated heat from the chp plant was assumed to be used for internal heating purpose given that the recovered heat corresponds exactly to the heat needed for maintaining a mesophilic digestion consequently no credits have been taken into account from the use of sludge generated heat in the future scenarios 1 3 such an assumption has been also used in i e yoshida et al 2014 however care may be taken when one equalizes the generated heat with the heat needed for processes this is because the net energy consumption is an important influential parameter when calculating impacts among different scenarios in addition it was assumed that there is no reject water from sludge dewatering nor supernatant from the anaerobic digester meaning that side wastewater streams have not been investigated in this study as a result calculated impacts for respectively wastewater treatment and sludge treatment may not reflect the actual partition between those main compartments it should however be pointed out that the total impacts from the above mentioned compartments will not be influenced 4 2 addition of food waste in wwtp the results suggest there is a high environmental benefit of including food waste into the sewer it can of course be seen problematic to blend in a pure food waste fraction into a contaminated sewer but it is clearly a better option than the main practice of landfill disposal with less resource recovery rate a comparison to an alternative like a food waste digester is not included in this assessment but should be investigated further in such an assessment the difference in waste collection could be further highlighted as transportation has a huge impact on some categories and food waste addition to the sewer can help to reduce transportation emissions to a large extent 4 3 further improvements the reduced treatment efficiency in s3 proves that optimization of final settling after biological processes is very important improved settling can enhance energy recovery and consequently increase environmental benefits through sludge digestion as mentioned previously s3 showed the best performance in some impact categories moreover if final settling is improved with some modifications such as implementing membrane separation or lamella separators s3 could end up as being the best in each impact category 5 conclusion the proposed upgrading alternatives all perform better than the current situation for all impact categories except for climate change in s2 hras however scenarios 2 3 with carbon removal focused on hras do not suggest large improvement in marine eutrophication as compared to primary treatment and current practice the impact from food waste transportation plays a very important role s3 hras food waste addition has a beneficial contribution in terms of climate change as well as terrestrial ecotoxicity whereas all the other scenarios experience environmental burdens the overall results show that a systems perspective in lca has a great significance to evaluate environmental impacts of different wastewater treatment alternatives since some emissions such as energy transportation etc occur outside of wwtps appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data related to this article e supplementary information of this work can be found in online
