7110,the optimization of the mixed reservoir system consisting of parallel and cascade reservoirs is a complex issue due to its nonlinear storage curves complex hydraulic connection and coordination this paper aims to derive optimal operating rules for the flood control of large scale mixed reservoir using a new algorithm known as weighted non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii wnsga ii which could efficiently locate the pareto front in the non dominated region due to directed searching with the weighted crowding distance a case study was performed in the xijiang river basin in china where there are eight flood control reservoirs and five flood control sections in four tributaries and the mainstream three scenarios including conventional operating rules cor single objective piecewise linear operating rules derived by genetic algorithm plo ga and multi objective piecewise linear operating rules derived by wnsga ii plo wnsga ii are compared and the resilience of three reservoir operating rules under inflow uncertainty is investigated as well the results indicate that 1 wnsga ii can locate non dominated solutions more efficiently and provide better pareto front than non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii due to the weighted crowding distance 2 plo wnsga ii outperforms cor and plo ga for the control of basin wide floods and 3 plo wnsga ii is more resilient under inflow uncertainty therefore plo wnsga ii is effective and efficient for the control of basin wide floods in a mixed reservoir system abbreviations cor conventional operating rules ga genetic

enormous economic losses worldwide cheng and chau 2002 reservoir is an effective and widely used measure for storing flood waters and reducing flood damage hui et al 2010 labadie 2004 plate 2002 however reservoir flood control operation rfco is a nonlinear convex problem with various constraints and high flood variability qi et al 2016 considerable attempts have been made to derive optimal operating rules to determine how much water should be released now and how much water should be retained for future use this can be achieved with the use of implicit stochastic optimization iso explicit stochastic optimization eso and parameterization simulation optimization pso celeste and billib 2009 each of which however has potential drawbacks that may limit its application for instance iso requires perfect inflow for deterministic reservoir operation which can be difficult to obtain in rfco eso incorporates probabilistic inflow directly into reservoir optimization model however as stochasticity is also included it is difficult to apply the complex mathematical output to rfco in contrast pso predefines the form of reservoir operating rules with a handful of parameters which could be optimized by evolution algorithms it is widely used in the derivation of reservoir operating rules koutsoyiannis and economou 2003 ming et al 2017 zhang et al 2016a pso offered significant theoretical computational and practical advantages over two alternative methods namely the high dimensional perfect foresight method and the simplified equivalent reservoir koutsoyiannis and economou 2003 zhang et al 2016a and ming et al 2017 also showed that pso performed very well in deriving reservoir operating rules different forms of reservoir operating rules such as piecewise linear regression pl reg and surface fitting surf have been applied in the pso framework celeste and billib 2009 momtahen and dariane 2007 zhang et al 2015 rfco can be roughly classified into single reservoir operation and multi reservoir operation the major objective for the single reservoir operation is to minimize the maximum flood peak for dam safety and the maximum release downstream streamflow for the safety of downstream flood control stations hsu and wei 2007 qi et al 2016 however for multi reservoir systems the major objectives are to minimize the maximum flood peak discharge of the most important sections and the maximum reservoir water level and to maximize the power generation multi reservoir systems can be classified into cascade reservoir parallel reservoir and mixed reservoir systems there is a close hydraulic connection in cascade reservoir system and thus the inflow of the downstream reservoir is largely determined by the release of the upstream reservoir however there is no hydraulic connection among parallel reservoirs and the safety of flood control sections in the mainstream depends heavily on the coordination of all parallel reservoirs heydari et al 2010 used nsga ii to solve the multi objective optimization model for two cascade reservoirs in ghezel ozan catchment and the objectives were to maximize revenue from the sale of energy produced by power plants and the flood control storage volume of the reservoir to control probable flood li and ouyang 2015 set two objectives for cascade reservoirs in the lower jinsha river and three gorges reservoir in the yangtze river including minimization of the maximum water level of reservoirs and the maximum flood peak discharge close to the flood protection area for parallel reservoir systems niewiadomska szynkiewicz et al 1996 presented some predictive methods such as variant cracow forecast model cfm proposed by the institute of meteorology and water management in cracow for real time flood optimization operation for the parallel reservoir system in the vistula river basin whereby multiple objectives were transformed into a single objective by weights zhang et al 2016b selected the safety of the flood control section in the mainstream as the only objective of three parallel flood control reservoirs in the xijiang river basin however to our knowledge no attempt is made to derive optimal reservoir operating rules for the flood control of a mixed reservoir system consisting of both parallel and cascade reservoirs clearly the complex hydraulic connection of water balance involved in cascade reservoirs and the coordination of asynchronous peak flows among parallel reservoirs should be considered simultaneously in the mixed reservoir operation optimization the objective of mixed reservoir operation optimization would be to minimize the flood risk at flood control sections in both tributaries and mainstream the complexity and computational burden of rfco can be attributed to its nonlinear storage curves various constraints and complex hydraulic connections jia et al 2016 heuristic algorithms are widely used in single multi objective reservoir operation optimization genetic algorithm ga holland 1992 li et al 2016a b wu et al 2016 particle swarm optimization algorithm psoa kennedy and eberhart 2002 morankar et al 2016 and chaotic particle swarm optimization cpso he et al 2014 are widely used in single objective reservoir operation optimization for multi objective optimization the weighted function or constrained approach is usually used to transform multiple objectives into single objective based on decision maker s preference niewiadomska szynkiewicz et al 1996 xing et al 2012 as the point by point searching method is used in the transformation a large number of iteration is needed to obtain abundant solutions furthermore if the objective for flood control is nonconvex a disconnected pareto front rather than the true pareto optimal front would be obtained hui et al 2010 this problem can be solved using multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas obviously multi objective optimization is much more difficult than single objective optimization as a large number of model runs are required to obtain the pareto optimal solutions using currently available multi objective optimization algorithms such as multiple objective genetic algorithms mogas fonseca and fleming 1993 niched pareto genetic algorithm npga horn et al 1994 non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 multiobjective shuffled complex evolution metropolis moscem vrugt et al 2003 and multi objective cultured differential evolution mocde hui et al 2010 resulting in extremely high computational cost nsga ii is a widely used multi objective optimization algorithm deb et al 2002 moosavian and lence 2016 fast non dominated sorting method and crowding distance are two important components of the optimization strategy the traditional crowding distance in nsga ii is replaced by the weighted crowding distance in weighted non dominated sorting genetic algorithm wnsga ii to obtain optimal pareto solutions with the directed search the weighted crowding distance could lead to generations from crossover and mutation to the non dominated region gong et al 2015 applied wnsga ii to solve the common land model colm a time consuming land surface model zhang et al 2016a found that wnsga ii outperformed the traditional nsga ii for large scale reservoir systems for hydropower generation and ecological preservation minimizing the flood risk in the tributaries and mainstream simultaneously is more economically and preferred for reservoir managers this paper aims to derive piecewise linear operating rules plo considering the trade offs for flood risk among tributaries in the large scale mixed reservoir system a modified multi objective algorithm with weighted crowding distance i e wnsga ii is used for the multi objective optimization of mixed reservoir flood control system and the objective is to minimize the flood risk at multiple flood control sections rather than that only at the section in the mainstream compared with the traditional nsga ii wnsga ii could obtain better pareto solutions for more efficient flood control finally the resilience of large scale reservoir operating rules under inflow uncertainty is investigated a case study is performed in a large scale mixed reservoir system consisting of eight flood control reservoirs in the xijiang river basin china the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area flood data and conventional operating rules cor for the eight flood control reservoirs section 3 describes the methodology including piecewise linear operating rules plo optimization model and two optimization schemes single objective by ga and multi objective optimization by wnsga ii section 4 describes the results and discussion including the sensitivity analysis of parameters from plo ga and plo wnsga ii optimization results performance of five flood control sections and eight reservoirs and resilience of cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii under inflow uncertainty finally conclusions are given in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the xijiang river is the third longest river in china after the yangtze river and the yellow river with a total length of 2075 km and a drainage area of 352 400 km2 the xijiang river basin has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation ranging of 1250 1750 mm however the precipitation is temporally variable 75 of which occurs in the flood season from april to september also precipitation varies spatially for example the average annual precipitation in the liujiang sub basin varies between 1300 and 2200 mm but that of yujiang sub basin varies between 1077 and 1680 mm as shown in fig 1 the tributaries of the xijiang include yujiang hongshuihe liujiang guijiang qianjiang and xunjiang there will be a total of eight flood control reservoirs by the year 2020 hongshuihe is the mainstream of the xijiang with a length of 1553 km accounting for 38 of the total drainage area and its flood control reservoir is located at the longtan yujiang is the largest tributary with a length of 1152 km and a drainage area of 89 357 km2 and it has two cascade reservoirs at the baise and laokou respectively liujiang is the second largest tributary with a flood control reservoir located at the luojiu guijiang is the third largest tributary with four parallel flood control reservoirs located at the qingshitan fuzikou chuanjiang and xiaorongjiang respectively the schematic diagram of mixed reservoir system in the xijiang river basin is also added in fig 1 and the basic parameters are shown in table 1 the safe discharge of the flood control section is indicated by the maximum allowable discharge that will not cause flood risk at the flood control section during the flood season which is usually determined by the height of the river embankment five flood control sections are selected in this study nanning qianjiang liuzhou and guilin are the flood control sections in the yujiang hongshuihe liujiang and guijiang tributaries whose safe discharges are 14 750 m3 s 16 400 m3 s 18 100 m3 s and 4850 m3 s respectively wuzhou city the intersection of four tributaries yujiang hongshuihe liujiang and guijiang is the flood control section in the mainstream as wuzhou city is close to guangdong province which is one of the most developed provinces in china the flood control safety of wuzhou city could ensure no flood damage to guangdong province the safe discharge is 41 200 m3 s which is determined by the guangxi water and power design institute 2 2 flood data as there are hundreds of hydrological stations in the xijiang river basin it is difficult to obtain the flood data of all hydrological stations in this study flood hydrographs of eight reservoir five flood control sections and green hydrological stations in 15 years 1962 1966 1968 1970 1974 1976 1978 1983 1988 1994 1996 1998 2001 2002 and 2005 are obtained fig 1 where the time step is 1 h the streamflows of 15 typical flood hydrographs at five flood control sections in five representative rivers nanning yujiang qianjiang hongshuihe liuzhou liujiang guilin guijiang and wuzhou xunjiang see fig 1 are shown in supplementary data as the time horizon ranges from 1962 to 2005 the climate change has an impact on the flood process thus the validation period selects the early and late years to reduce the impact of mismatching reservoir operating rules by climate change the flood data in 1970 1974 1976 1978 1983 1988 1994 1996 1998 and 2001 are used for calibration while that in 1962 1966 1968 2002 and 2005 are used for validation besides the flood data in calibration and validation could also reflect the diversity of flood magnitude and the spatial distribution however it should be noted that these hydrographs were observed with the same time step 1 h but for different lengths of time the selected 15 typical flood hydrographs could well reflect the diversity of flood magnitude and spatial distribution it varied from 35 600 53 700 m3 s at the wuzhou section 7700 33 700 m3 s at the liuzhou section 9900 18 400 m3 s at the qianjiang section 3600 13 400 m3 s at the nanning section and 270 5900 m3 s at the guilin section respectively in addition the peak streamflow was 52 900 m3 s in 1998 calibration and 53 700 m3 s in 2005 validation at the wuzhou section 22 100 m3 s in 1962 validation and 25 900 m3 s in 1970 calibration at the liuzhou section 18 400 m3 s in 1988 calibration and 16 600 m3 s in 2005 validation at the qianjiang section 9020 m3 s in 1970 calibration and 9240 m3 s in 2002 validation at the nanning section and 3800 m3 s in 1978 calibration and 3150 m3 s in 2002 validation at the guilin section respectively for spatial distribution the flood hydrographs of the wuzhou section are the highest among the five sections as the wuzhou section is located in the mainstream the precipitation in the xijiang river basin varies spatially the average annual precipitation is 1750 mm in the liujiang sub basin but 1200 mm and 1400 mm in the yujiang sub basin and hongshuihe sub basin respectively the guilin section has the smallest flood hydrographs due to its smallest catchment area and low average annual precipitation thus the peak streamflow at the liuzhou section is higher than that at the qianjiang and nanning sections for most flood hydrographs such as in 1962 validation and 1970 calibration however the peak streamflow at the qianjiang section is occasionally the same as that at the nanning section or slightly higher than that at the liuzhou section such as in 2001 calibration and 2002 validation the peak streamflow at the qianjiang section is much the same as that at the liuzhou section in most instances such as in 1966 validation and 1968 calibration the saint venant equation is the complete equation for flood routing to obtain the downstream streamflow and water level however the finite difference method for numerically solving the saint venant equation is time consuming the muskingum model cunge 1969 gill 1984 1978 1992 hsu and wei 2007 tung 1985 windsor 1973 the simplified finite difference approximation method for the saint venant equation to obtain the streamflow was used as the flood routing method of the xijiang river basin 2 3 conventional operating rules conventional operating rules cor are designed separately for the eight flood control reservoirs the release of the longtan reservoir is dependent on its water level the amount and fluctuation of streamflow at the wuzhou section table 2 the release of the luojiu reservoir is dependent on its inflow the amount and fluctuation of streamflow at the liuzhou section table 3 the release of the baise reservoir is dependent on its water level the amount and fluctuation of streamflow at downstream cities chongzuo and nanning the release of the laokou reservoir is dependent on its inflow and water level the release of the four flood control reservoirs in the guijiang is dependent on their water level inflow and the amount and fluctuation of streamflow at the guilin section a potential drawback of cor is that the interactions among flood control sections have not been considered which can easily lead to floods at the wuzhou section therefore the trade offs for flood risk among the tributaries and the mainstream in the xijiang river basin should be considered in the derivation of optimal mixed reservoir operating rules given the possible occurrence of short term but devastating floods wnsga ii is used in this study as it could obtain pareto solutions more efficiently and effectively 3 methodology different piecewise linear operating rules plo are derived based on single objective and multi objective mixed reservoir operation optimization models respectively the procedure to derive the optimal plo considering the trade offs for flood risk among tributaries and the mainstream is shown in fig 2 the objective in single objective optimization is to minimize the flood risk at the section in the mainstream by ga whereas four objectives in multi objective optimization are to minimize the flood risk at four sections in the tributaries with the penalty term of the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream by wnsga ii the operation results obtained by cor serve as the reference point ref of wnsga ii and the optimal plo could be determined by comparing operation results from cor single objective piecewise linear operating rules derived by ga plo ga and multi objective piecewise linear operating rules derived by wnsga ii plo wnsga ii 3 1 piecewise linear operating rules the stepwise procedures for the derivation of plo in table 4 is shown as follows 1 determine the downstream flood control section near the reservoir and its safe discharge q s 2 with the historical maximum inflow of the reservoir determine the classified inflow i 1 and i 2 by trial and error method 3 set the six release schemes by forecasted flow fluctuation and rate at the downstream section and the forecasted reservoir inflow if the streamflow at the section is less than half of the safe discharge the release equals to the forecasted inflow otherwise one of three release schemes is implemented based on the comparison between forecasted and classified inflow as shown in table 4 as there are two classified inflows i 1 and i 2 three choices are made based on the comparison between forecasted inflow and classified inflow besides as the streamflow may increase or decrease under the three release schemes a total of six release choices parameters for a single reservoir and thus a total of 48 parameters need to be optimized for the eight flood control reservoirs as shown in table 2 the release of the longtan reservoir based on the cor is depended on the forecasted flow fluctuation and rate at the downstream wuzhou section however it needs approximately 106 h for floods to flow from the longtan reservoir to the wuzhou section resulting in asynchronous fluctuation as the flood fluctuation at the qianjiang section is synchronous with that at the longtan reservoir it is selected as the downstream flood control section for the longtan reservoir in this paper besides nanning liuzhou and guilin are selected as the downstream flood control sections for reservoirs in the yujiang liujiang and guijiang respectively 3 2 optimization model two optimization models are compared to investigate the trade offs for flood risk between different tributaries and the mainstream for the single objective optimization model the only objective is to ensure the safety of the wuzhou section in the mainstream which could be defined as follows 1 min f r w min t 1 t q w t q w s 2 n w t where f r w is the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream q w t is the streamflow at the wuzhou section at time period t q w s is the safe discharges at the wuzhou section n w t is a binary variable which is taken to be 1 when the streamflow exceeds the safe discharge and to be 0 when the streamflow is lower than the safe discharge so it indicates whether the wuzhou section is damaged or not at time period t and t is the number of time periods the safety of four sections in the tributaries and the wuzhou section in the mainstream are considered together for multi objective optimization as the safety of the wuzhou section is the coordination results of four tributaries it is not an individual objective to minimize the flood risk at the wuzhou section there are some trade offs for flood risk among the four flood control section as the flood risk in the mainstream is caused by the convergence of four tributaries it should be noted that the minimization of the flood risk at the four flood control sections in the tributaries is not equivalent to the minimization of the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream due to the interzone inflow and possible synchronous peak streamflow of four tributaries thus the flood risk at the wuzhou section is defined as a penalty term for the four sections in the tributaries it means that the flood risk at the wuzhou section is proportionally reflected in the objective functions of the four sections the objectives of the four flood control sections in the tributaries can be expressed as follows 1 nanning section 2 min f r n min t 1 t q n t q n s 2 n n t p n t 3 p n t q n t q w t q w t q w s 2 n w t 2 qianjiang section 4 min f r q min t 1 t q q t q q s 2 n q t p q t 5 p q t q q t q w t q w t q w s 2 n

q w s 2 n w t where f r n f r q f r l f r g are the flood risk at the four flood control sections nanning qianjiang liuzhou and guilin based on the flood risk at the wuzhou section p n t p q t p l t p

control sections at time period t n n t n q t n l t n g t are the binary variables which are taken to be 1 when the streamflow exceeds the safe discharge and to be 0 when the streamflow is lower than the safe discharge indicating whether the flood control sections are damaged or not at time period t q n s q q s q l s q g s are the safe discharges at the four flood control sections in the tributaries respectively the following constraints are considered in this study 1 water balance equation 10 i i t i i t 1 2 δ t r i t r i t 1 2 δ t v i t 1 v i t where i i t r i t v i t are the inflow release and storage of reservoir i at time period t respectively δ t is the time interval 2 reservoir storage limit 11 v i min v i t v i max where v i min v i max are the minimum and maximum allowable reservoir storage of reservoir i at time period t respectively 3 release capacity 12 r i t r i max t where r i max t are the maximum allowable release of reservoir i at time period t which is often associated with spillways 4 safe discharges of flood control stations 13 q m t q z t i in t q m s where q z t is the streamflow routing to the downstream flood control station at time period t and i in t is the local streamflow between upstream and downstream stations at time period t 5 boundary conditions 14 z i 1 z i i n i t where z i i n i t is the water level of reservoir i at the beginning of reservoir operation 6 channel routing 15 q z t c 0 r t c 1 r t 1 c 2 q z t 1 where c 0 c 1 c 2 are the channel routing coefficients in the muskingum method 7 streamflow at the wuzhou section 16 q w t α n q n t α q q q t α l q l t α g q g t α in i in t where α n α q α l α g α in are the channel routing coefficients of streamflow at the nanning qianjiang liuzhou guilin and local inflow to the wuzhou section precipitation has been transformed into the inflow of reservoirs in the mass balance equation the water loss due to evaporation in the mass balance equation is negligible as it differs from reservoir storage by thousands orders of magnitude for example the hourly average evaporation of the baise station recorded by the guangxi water and power design institute is only 0 23 mm which is 1 181 000 of the total storage of the baise reservoir thus it is assumed that there is no water loss from reservoir evaporation in the water balance equation as the time step of all flood data is 1 h the length of the optimization time interval δ t is also taken to be 1 h 3 3 optimization schemes 3 3 1 single objective optimization the primary consideration in the mixed reservoir operation optimization is to ensure the safety of the most important city in the mainstream thus the only objective in the single objective optimization scheme is to minimize the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream ga is used in this paper for single objective optimization whitley 1994 there are four parameters in ga that need to be determined including population size generation size crossover rate and mutation rate larger population size and generation size would lead to convergence to optimal solutions at the expense of an unacceptably long simulation time crossover and mutation are conducted to search for better solutions based on the fitness function based on the studies of grefenstette 1986 and srinivas and patnaik 1994 the population size and generation size are set to 100 which could obtain good results with an acceptable simulation time 8000 s and the crossover and mutation rates are determined empirically to be 0 9 and 0 1 respectively 3 3 2 multi objective optimization the minimization of flood risk at the four flood control sections in the tributaries with the penalty term of flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream are considered in the multi objective optimization scheme of the mixed reservoir system nsga ii is the most widely used multi objective optimization algorithm including two important components the fast non dominated sorting method and the crowding distance deb et al 2002 the fast non dominated sorting method can be used to determine the pareto rank of each individual based on its fitness function objective value such as the pareto rank 1 2 3 in fig 3 for the minimization problem in fig 3 individuals with larger pareto ranks such as pareto rank 3 are dominated by those with smaller ones such as pareto rank 1 and 2 which is closer to the true pareto front the crowding distance is defined as the sum of the edge length of the cuboid in fig 3 17 d k j 1 j f j k 1 f j k 1 where d k is the crowding distance of individual k j is the number of objectives and f j k 1 f j k 1 are the jth objective value of individual k 1 k 1 respectively in the same pareto rank individuals with larger crowding distances are preferred due to their representativeness and importance thus individuals with smaller pareto ranks and larger crowding distances have a higher chance in the true pareto front deb 2001 deb et al 2002 zhang et al 2016a b wnsga ii the modified version of nsga ii could more efficiently direct the evolution into the non dominated region by the weighted crowding distance than the traditional crowding distance in nsga ii as shown in fig 3 the plane could be divided into four regions by the reference point which is corresponding to conventional operation results for the minimization problem as the objective values of all individuals in region 1 are smaller than the reference point the individuals in region 1 are the non dominated solutions and region 1 is the non dominated area of the reference point when at least one objective of the individuals in the three regions is larger than the reference point the individuals in the three regions are the dominated solutions and the other three regions are the dominated regions the traditional crowding distance of individuals in the dominated regions region 2 3 4 are converted into the weighted crowding distance by multiplying a small weight factor δ 0 1 in wnsga ii while the crowding distance of individuals in the non dominated regions region 1 remain unchanged thus the individuals in the dominated regions with a smaller crowding distance are more likely to be abandoned while those in the non dominated region with a larger crowding distance are more likely to be selected for evolution individuals are quickly approached to the non dominated region with the weighted crowding distance under the same number of model runs more details about wnsga ii should be referred to gong et al 2015 and zhang et al 2016a as nsga ii is the modified version of ga deb 2001 deb et al 2002 the parameters for the model set up of nsga ii and wnsga ii such as population size and generation size are the same as those of ga in section 3 3 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa can screen out the sensitive parameters for the high dimensional nonlinear problems as there are totally 48 parameters for the eight reservoirs sa could determine the most influential parameters for the flood risk in the xijiang river basin multivariate adaptive regression splines mars is used for parameters screening due to its stability friedman 1991 gan et al 2014 the sensitivity of parameters could be quantified by generalized cross validation gcv score which could indicate the importance of each parameter steinberg et al 1999 4 1 1 sensitive parameters of plo ga as the only objective of plo ga is to minimize the flood risk at the wuzhou section the sensitive parameters of plo ga could be determined by the gcv score from mars with 10 000 samples as shown in fig 4 there are 10 sensitive parameters of plo ga including one parameter from the laokou reservoir in the yujiang sub basin five parameters from the longtan reservoir in the hongshuihe sub basin and four parameters from the luojiu reservoir in the liujiang sub basin the highest gcv scores are observed in the longtan reservoir indicating the importance of the longtan reservoir to the flood risk at the wuzhou section the variation of optimal sensitive parameters over 20 trials of ga are performed to investigate the reliability of optimal parameters from ga shown in fig 5 the values of optimal sensitive parameters are transformed into normalized values to reduce the influence of magnitude as the small range of each optimal sensitive parameter over 20 trials of ga the 60 confidence interval is used to indicate the reliability of optimal sensitive parameters a narrower interval indicates a better reliability of the parameters from ga the red curve located in the 60 confidence interval is selected as the optimal parameters of plo ga in table 5 4 1 2 sensitive parameters of plo wnsga ii as there are four objectives in the multi objective optimization scheme the sensitive parameters for the four objectives of plo wnsga ii are screened out in fig 6 there are four sensitive parameters from the baise and laokou reservoirs for flood risk at the nanning section in fig 6 a six sensitive parameters from the longtan reservoir for flood risk at the qianjiang section in fig 6 b five sensitive parameters from the luojiu reservoir for flood risk at the liuzhou section in fig 6 c and six sensitive parameters from the qingshitan fuzikou and chuanjiang reservoirs for flood risk at the guilin section in fig 6 d respectively however as the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream is taken as the penalty term of the four tributaries the sensitive parameters for the four objectives are not merely the parameters of reservoirs in the relevant tributaries for example the sensitive parameters for the flood risk at the nanning section are from the baise and laokou reservoirs in the yujiang sub basin the longtan reservoir in the hongshuihe sub basin and the luojiu reservoir in the liujiang sub basin the variation of optimal sensitive parameters corresponding to the minimum of the four objectives nanning qianjiang liuzhou and guilin sections over 20 trials of wnsga ii is shown in fig 7 a d respectively the 60 confidence interval of the normalized sensitive parameters is shown in fig 7 the narrow 60 confidence interval could indicate the reliability of the optimal sensitive parameters 4 2 optimization results 4 2 1 optimal reservoir operating rules by ga the 60 confidence interval red zone of the variation of flood risk at the wuzhou section from ga during the calibration period over 20 trials is shown in fig 8 the narrow distribution of the objective function could reflect the stability of ga clearly the flood risk at the wuzhou section decreases rapidly in the first 500 model runs but more slowly thereafter the optimal objective at the wuzhou section could be obtained at 10 000 model runs the blue curve is corresponding to the optimal parameters of plo ga of the eight flood control reservoirs shown in table 5 besides the flood risk at the other four flood control sections in the tributaries were simulated by plo ga and shown in table 6 in italics 4 2 2 pareto front by wnsga ii since there are four objectives in the multi objective optimization scheme the complex high dimensional pareto front is denoted by visualizing the projections of the four objectives in pairs which results in c 4 2 6 sub figures c 4 2 is the combination of an un ordered two objectives collection of four objectives the optimization results obtained by nsga ii and wnsga ii are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively there are totally 16 sub figures including 12 sub figures of the symmetrical combination of an un ordered collection of the four objectives and 4 diagonal sub figures about the distribution of the evaluated points and the pareto front solutions as shown in fig 10 all pareto front solutions obtained from wnsga ii are located in the non dominated region region 1 in fig 3 indicating that all the four objectives of pareto front solutions are better than conventional operation results reference point however the pareto front solutions obtained from nsga ii are widely distributed in both dominated and non dominated regions fig 9 thus it can be inferred that wnsga ii outperforms the traditional nsga ii the obtained pareto front obtained from wnsga ii over 20 trials is plotted in fig 11 to investigate its stability as there are four objectives six c 4 2 6 sub figures are plotted to describe the combination of two dimensional pareto front for example fig 11 a shows the trade offs for flood risk between the nanning and qianjiang sections as there are trade offs among four objectives the sub figures with two objectives cannot have the perfect pareto curve the points with different colors corresponds to different trials as shown in fig 11 the pareto front solutions do not overlap with each other and they are distributed in a small region rather than widely in a large region indicating the stability of wnsga ii reservoir manager could select the parameters based on their preference the parameters of plo wnsga ii are randomly selected from the pareto front in this paper shown in table 7 interestingly most parameters of plo ga table 5 are smaller than that of plo wnsga ii table 7 as only the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream rather than that at the other four sections in the tributaries is considered in plo ga the small parameters could reduce the flood risk at the wuzhou section due to the staggering peak in the tributaries however too small parameters of plo ga which differ significant from the inflow such as zero in the longtan and luojiu reservoirs could lead to a rapid increase of reservoir water level and thus cause dam breach a sudden increase of release is required to protect the dam but it can easily cause damage to downstream flood control sections as plo wnsga ii considers the flood risk at the four sections in the tributaries with the penalty term of the flood risk in the mainstream larger parameters of plo wnsga ii can avoid the sudden increase of release and consequent damages to the sections in the tributaries thus reasonable parameters of plo wnsga ii can not only effectively reduce the flood risk in the tributaries and the mainstream but also guarantee the safety of the reservoirs 4 2 3 objective distributions between nsga ii and wnsga ii the probability density function pdf of random variables is usually determined by parametric and non parametric density estimation with given sample points specific distributions of the random variables in parametric density estimation are assumed but such an assumption could be violated in actual operation kernel density estimation parzen window parzen 1962 rosenblatt 1956 a non parametric density estimation requires no prior knowledge of data distribution and avoids the influence of model and parameter estimation an important issue in kernel density estimation is the selection of bandwidth the distribution curve can be under smoothed with a small bandwidth and over smoothed with a large bandwidth the gaussian kernel function is widely used in kernel density estimation due to the smooth kernel with an optimal bandwidth in this study it is used to describe the probability density function of objectives the four objective distributions of pareto front solutions and evaluated points from nsga ii and wnsga ii are compared in fig 12 the area enclosed by the objective distribution curve equals 1 the upper and lower bounds from nsga ii and wnsga ii were determined separately fig 12 shows that 1 the pdf of evaluated points and pareto front solutions from nsga ii is smooth with a wide distribution and the directed searching strategy by weighted crowding distance from wnsga ii makes the pdf have a sharp peak and 2 the peaks of the four objectives from wnsga ii are much closer to the origin compared with those from nsga ii thus wnsga ii results in a sharp peak close to the origin while nsga ii results in a smooth distribution with peaks far away from the origin the reason is that most evaluated points and pareto front solutions from wnsga ii are located in the non dominated region by directed searching with the weighted crowding distance while that from nsga ii are dispersively distributed 4 3 damages to five flood control sections the flood risks at the five flood control sections obtained from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii in calibration and validation are compared in table 6 in calibration all the five flood control sections are damaged for cor and the flood risk at the four flood control sections in the tributaries nanning qianjiang liuzhou and guilin obtained from plo wnsga ii is lower than that obtained from plo ga with the maximum difference of 58 8 at the qianjiang section and the minimum difference of 2 0 at the liuzhou and guilin sections as the single objective of plo ga is to minimize the flood risk at the wuzhou section the flood risk at the wuzhou section obtained from plo ga is 3 2 smaller than that obtained from plo wnsga ii in validation nanning and guilin sections are not damaged due to small floods in yujiang and guijiang such as the flood process of 1962 in validation fig s1 in the supplementary data compared with the flood process of 2001 in calibration fig s13 in the supplementary data the difference between plo wnsga ii and plo ga at the qianjiang liuzhou and wuzhou sections is 73 0 8 2 and 3 3 respectively indicating that plo wnsga ii is better for flood control than plo ga in validation the damage period the accumulation period when the streamflow exceeds the safe discharges of the five flood control sections from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii are compared in table 8 cor has the maximum damage period for the nanning liuzhou and wuzhou sections followed by plo ga and plo wnsga ii in calibration in validation the nanning and guilin sections are not damaged which agrees with the results in table 6 more damage periods are observed at the qianjiang section in calibration and validation from plo ga and plo wnsga ii than that from cor because the maximum water level at the longtan reservoir from cor exceeds the flood control water level this is unacceptable for reservoirs during flood season the maximum flow damage the overflow between the maximum streamflow and the safe discharge of the five flood control sections from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii are compared in table 9 the maximum flow damage at the wuzhou section reaches a minimum by plo ga due to its single objective at the wuzhou section cor performs worst at the guilin and wuzhou sections but best at the nanning qianjiang and liuzhou sections plo wnsga ii outperforms cor at the guilin and wuzhou sections but worse at the nanning qianjiang and liuzhou sections indicating that cor and plo wnsga ii are comparable in calibration however the maximum flow damage at the qianjiang liuzhou and wuzhou sections from plo wnsga ii reaches a minimum in validation indicating its advantages over cor and plo ga as the nanning and guilin sections are not damaged in validation their maximum flow damage is zero 4 4 verification of reservoir simulation the simulation results including maximum water level and maximum release of the eight flood control reservoirs from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii are shown in figs 13 and 14 respectively as shown in fig 13 the upper limit of the maximum reservoir water level is lower than the flood control water level at the baise laokou luojiu and chuanjiang reservoirs however it should be noted that the maximum reservoir water level at the fuzikou and xiaorongjiang reservoirs from cor exceed the flood control water level by 8374 and 10 001 times accounting for 42 8 and 51 1 of the total period 19 572 h respectively besides the maximum reservoir water level at the qingshitan from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii exceeds the flood control water level 226 0 m but is below the dam breach water level 230 85 m the maximum reservoir water level from cor exceeds the flood control water level by 8355 times in the total period 19 572 h but by only 189 and 188 times for plo ga and plo wnsga ii respectively the median of the maximum reservoir water level at the qingshitan from cor is even higher than the flood control water level indicating that it has insufficient flood control capacity for future floods while plo wnsga ii gives the lowest median of the maximum reservoir water levels at the qingshitan and fuzikou reservoirs indicating that more flood control capacity can be reserved for future floods extremes are observed only in the box plots of the longtan and luojiu reservoirs from plo ga and plo wnsga ii indicating that plo ga and plo wnsga ii could effectively prevent the maximum reservoir water level from exceeding the flood control water level it is also noted that the extreme 380 9 m in the box plot of the longtan reservoir from cor is much higher than the flood control water level 376 0 m without restraint from cor fig 14 shows the maximum release for the eight flood control reservoirs from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii the median of the maximum release follows the order of cor plo ga plo wnsga ii indicating that plo wnsga ii could more effectively reduce the flood risk at the downstream flood control sections the variations of inflow release and water level at the longtan reservoir from cor and plo wnsga ii in 1970 are shown in fig 15 the coincidence of the release line with the inflow line indicates that all inflow is released resulting in no change in the reservoir water level the maximum inflow of the longtan reservoir is 19 880 m3 s in 1970 and the maximum release from cor is the same as that from plo wnsga ii resulting in a decrease of flood peak discharge by 5860 m3 s however the maximum water level of the longtan reservoir from cor 380 9 m is higher than that from plo wnsga ii 376 0 m and the flood control water level 376 0 m indicating that cor results in insufficient flood control capacity for future floods as the peak inflow and the reduced release occurs at july 14th the water level from cor and plo wnsga ii increase rapidly however the reservoir water level from cor increases continuously after the flood peak while that from plo wnsga ii remains unchanged the increasing water level from cor can be attributed to no restraint on reservoir water level from cor for plo wnsga ii the reservoir water level could be restrained within the allowed reservoir water level and thus plo wnsga ii is better than cor 4 5 resilience under inflow uncertainty as plo wnsga ii outperforms plo ga and cor with the historical deterministic 15 typical flood hydrographs the performances of cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii under inflow uncertainty were investigated in this part li et al 2016a b the inflow fluctuation was set to 10 and the inflow interval was from 90 to 110 the stochastic inflow of the five year period in validation was randomly generated from 90 to 110 inflow interval for ten trials the damage periods and the maximum flow damages at the five flood control sections for ten trials were recorded as the nanning and guilin sections are not damaged the box plots of damage periods and the maximum flow damage at other three sections qianjiang liuzhou and wuzhou from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii over ten trials are shown in fig 16 the range of damage periods and the maximum flow damage from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii indicate the resilience under inflow uncertainty the smaller range of the damage periods and the maximum flow damage are the more resilient the operating rules would be fig 16 shows that the damage period and the maximum flow damage at the qianjiang and liuzhou sections from plo wnsga ii have a smaller interquartile range for ten trials than those from cor and plo ga indicating that plo wnsga ii is more resilient and better able to deal with inflow uncertainty than cor and plo ga however plo ga has the smallest desperation of damage period and maximum flow damage at the wuzhou section due to the single objective besides all the maximum water levels of the eight flood control reservoirs from plo ga and plo wnsga ii for ten trials are lower than the flood control water level however the maximum water level at the longtan fuzikou xiaorongjiang and qingshitan reservoirs from cor exceeds the flood control water level by 442 2030 3388 and 1945 times in the total of 7032 periods in validation respectively which however are still within the dam breach flood level the variations of the streamflow at the qianjiang liuzhou and wuzhou sections from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii in the validation of 1 trial are shown in figs 17 19 respectively the flow damage depth from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii are indicated by the black blue and red histograms respectively for the qianjiang section in fig 16 the median of damage periods from cor is lower than those from plo ga and plo wnsga ii but its median of the maximum flow damage is higher this is because a small number of large flow damages from cor is replaced by a larger number of small flow damages from plo ga and plo wnsga ii as shown in fig 17 plo wnsga ii reduced the maximum flow damage but slightly increased the damage period compared with cor and plo ga for the liuzhou section in fig 16 plo wnsga ii has smaller damage periods and smaller maximum flow damage than cor and plo ga luojiu reservoir in the liujiang could reduce the flood peak effectively in 1966 validation for plo ga and plo wnsga ii as shown in fig 20 plo ga ran out of the flood control storage at the first flood peak while plo wnsga ii could use its flood control storage rationally for three flood peaks however the flood process at the liuzhou section from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii in validation is almost overlapping in fig 18 except the small difference for the flood peak the reason is that there is magnitude difference between reservoir inflow of the luojiu reservoir and interzone inflow of the liuzhou section in the liujiang the inflow peak in 1966 at the luojiu reservoir is only 3000 m3 s while the flood peak at the liuzhou section is even 25 000 m3 s for the wuzhou section in fig 16 plo ga has smaller damage period than cor and plo wnsga ii due to its single objective as shown in fig 19 the first small damage in 1966 at the wuzhou section is avoided by plo ga the flood peak from cor is larger than those from plo ga and plo wnsga ii the residence of plo ga and plo wnsga ii are comparable at the wuzhou section all larger than cor but plo wnsga ii has larger residence than cor and plo ga at the qianjiang and liuzhou sections in general plo wnsga ii is more resident than cor and plo ga under inflow uncertainty 5 conclusions the trade offs for flood risk among tributaries and the mainstream is considered in the derivation of plo a novel multi objective optimization algorithm wnsga ii in which the traditional crowding distance is replaced by the weighted crowding distance for directed searching is applied in the xijiang river basin and its performance is compared with that of cor and plo ga the following conclusions could be drawn from this study 1 the optimal sensitive parameters of plo ga and plo wnsga ii are reliable ga and wnsga ii could produce stable optimal parameters as the reservoir operating rules 2 wnsga ii is efficient in locating non dominated solutions and can provide better pareto front than the well known nsga ii due to the weighted crowding distance and it can result in the distribution of evaluated points and pareto front solutions with a sharp peak close to the origin 3 plo wnsga ii outperforms cor and plo ga for the control of basin wide floods the multi objective nature of wnsga ii makes it possible to protect multiple flood control sections on both tributaries and mainstream while ga only considers the safety of the wuzhou section 4 plo wnsga ii is more resilient under inflow uncertainty than cor and plo ga in which all the eight reservoirs in the xijiang river basin are considered whereas in cor each reservoir is considered separately and in plo ga only the wuzhou section is considered it should be noted that as plo ga only considers the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream rather than the whole basin plo wnsga ii performs slightly worse than plo ga at the wuzhou section besides this study only considers the piecewise linear reservoir operating rules and the performances of other types of operating rules should be compared to determine the most suitable reservoir operating rules for the control of basin wide floods in future studies finally the resilience of the operating rules under inflow uncertainty of the historical flood hydrographs is studied in this paper and future study should focus more on inflow uncertainties resulting from human activities and climate changes acknowledgements

7110,the optimization of the mixed reservoir system consisting of parallel and cascade reservoirs is a complex issue due to its nonlinear storage curves complex hydraulic connection and coordination this paper aims to derive optimal operating rules for the flood control of large scale mixed reservoir using a new algorithm known as weighted non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii wnsga ii which could efficiently locate the pareto front in the non dominated region due to directed searching with the weighted crowding distance a case study was performed in the xijiang river basin in china where there are eight flood control reservoirs and five flood control sections in four tributaries and the mainstream three scenarios including conventional operating rules cor single objective piecewise linear operating rules derived by genetic algorithm plo ga and multi objective piecewise linear operating rules derived by wnsga ii plo wnsga ii are compared and the resilience of three reservoir operating rules under inflow uncertainty is investigated as well the results indicate that 1 wnsga ii can locate non dominated solutions more efficiently and provide better pareto front than non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii due to the weighted crowding distance 2 plo wnsga ii outperforms cor and plo ga for the control of basin wide floods and 3 plo wnsga ii is more resilient under inflow uncertainty therefore plo wnsga ii is effective and efficient for the control of basin wide floods in a mixed reservoir system abbreviations cor conventional operating rules ga genetic algorithm nsga ii non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii pdf probability density function plo piecewise linear operating rules plo ga piecewise linear operating rules derived by genetic algorithm plo wnsga ii piecewise linear operating rules derived by weighted non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii rfco reservoir flood control operation wnsga ii weighted non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii keywords large scale mixed reservoir system piecewise linear operating rules wnsga ii multi objective flood control 1 introduction flood is a major natural disaster that can cause enormous economic losses worldwide cheng and chau 2002 reservoir is an effective and widely used measure for storing flood waters and reducing flood damage hui et al 2010 labadie 2004 plate 2002 however reservoir flood control operation rfco is a nonlinear convex problem with various constraints and high flood variability qi et al 2016 considerable attempts have been made to derive optimal operating rules to determine how much water should be released now and how much water should be retained for future use this can be achieved with the use of implicit stochastic optimization iso explicit stochastic optimization eso and parameterization simulation optimization pso celeste and billib 2009 each of which however has potential drawbacks that may limit its application for instance iso requires perfect inflow for deterministic reservoir operation which can be difficult to obtain in rfco eso incorporates probabilistic inflow directly into reservoir optimization model however as stochasticity is also included it is difficult to apply the complex mathematical output to rfco in contrast pso predefines the form of reservoir operating rules with a handful of parameters which could be optimized by evolution algorithms it is widely used in the derivation of reservoir operating rules koutsoyiannis and economou 2003 ming et al 2017 zhang et al 2016a pso offered significant theoretical computational and practical advantages over two alternative methods namely the high dimensional perfect foresight method and the simplified equivalent reservoir koutsoyiannis and economou 2003 zhang et al 2016a and ming et al 2017 also showed that pso performed very well in deriving reservoir operating rules different forms of reservoir operating rules such as piecewise linear regression pl reg and surface fitting surf have been applied in the pso framework celeste and billib 2009 momtahen and dariane 2007 zhang et al 2015 rfco can be roughly classified into single reservoir operation and multi reservoir operation the major objective for the single reservoir operation is to minimize the maximum flood peak for dam safety and the maximum release downstream streamflow for the safety of downstream flood control stations hsu and wei 2007 qi et al 2016 however for multi reservoir systems the major objectives are to minimize the maximum flood peak discharge of the most important sections and the maximum reservoir water level and to maximize the power generation multi reservoir systems can be classified into cascade reservoir parallel reservoir and mixed reservoir systems there is a close hydraulic connection in cascade reservoir system and thus the inflow of the downstream reservoir is largely determined by the release of the upstream reservoir however there is no hydraulic connection among parallel reservoirs and the safety of flood control sections in the mainstream depends heavily on the coordination of all parallel reservoirs heydari et al 2010 used nsga ii to solve the multi objective optimization model for two cascade reservoirs in ghezel ozan catchment and the objectives were to maximize revenue from the sale of energy produced by power plants and the flood control storage volume of the reservoir to control probable flood li and ouyang 2015 set two objectives for cascade reservoirs in the lower jinsha river and three gorges reservoir in the yangtze river including minimization of the maximum water level of reservoirs and the maximum flood peak discharge close to the flood protection area for parallel reservoir systems niewiadomska szynkiewicz et al 1996 presented some predictive methods such as variant cracow forecast model cfm proposed by the institute of meteorology and water management in cracow for real time flood optimization operation for the parallel reservoir system in the vistula river basin whereby multiple objectives were transformed into a single objective by weights zhang et al 2016b selected the safety of the flood control section in the mainstream as the only objective of three parallel flood control reservoirs in the xijiang river basin however to our knowledge no attempt is made to derive optimal reservoir operating rules for the flood control of a mixed reservoir system consisting of both parallel and cascade reservoirs clearly the complex hydraulic connection of water balance involved in cascade reservoirs and the coordination of asynchronous peak flows among parallel reservoirs should be considered simultaneously in the mixed reservoir operation optimization the objective of mixed reservoir operation optimization would be to minimize the flood risk at flood control sections in both tributaries and mainstream the complexity and computational burden of rfco can be attributed to its nonlinear storage curves various constraints and complex hydraulic connections jia et al 2016 heuristic algorithms are widely used in single multi objective reservoir operation optimization genetic algorithm ga holland 1992 li et al 2016a b wu et al 2016 particle swarm optimization algorithm psoa kennedy and eberhart 2002 morankar et al 2016 and chaotic particle swarm optimization cpso he et al 2014 are widely used in single objective reservoir operation optimization for multi objective optimization the weighted function or constrained approach is usually used to transform multiple objectives into single objective based on decision maker s preference niewiadomska szynkiewicz et al 1996 xing et al 2012 as the point by point searching method is used in the transformation a large number of iteration is needed to obtain abundant solutions furthermore if the objective for flood control is nonconvex a disconnected pareto front rather than the true pareto optimal front would be obtained hui et al 2010 this problem can be solved using multi objective evolutionary algorithms moeas obviously multi objective optimization is much more difficult than single objective optimization as a large number of model runs are required to obtain the pareto optimal solutions using currently available multi objective optimization algorithms such as multiple objective genetic algorithms mogas fonseca and fleming 1993 niched pareto genetic algorithm npga horn et al 1994 non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 multiobjective shuffled complex evolution metropolis moscem vrugt et al 2003 and multi objective cultured differential evolution mocde hui et al 2010 resulting in extremely high computational cost nsga ii is a widely used multi objective optimization algorithm deb et al 2002 moosavian and lence 2016 fast non dominated sorting method and crowding distance are two important components of the optimization strategy the traditional crowding distance in nsga ii is replaced by the weighted crowding distance in weighted non dominated sorting genetic algorithm wnsga ii to obtain optimal pareto solutions with the directed search the weighted crowding distance could lead to generations from crossover and mutation to the non dominated region gong et al 2015 applied wnsga ii to solve the common land model colm a time consuming land surface model zhang et al 2016a found that wnsga ii outperformed the traditional nsga ii for large scale reservoir systems for hydropower generation and ecological preservation minimizing the flood risk in the tributaries and mainstream simultaneously is more economically and preferred for reservoir managers this paper aims to derive piecewise linear operating rules plo considering the trade offs for flood risk among tributaries in the large scale mixed reservoir system a modified multi objective algorithm with weighted crowding distance i e wnsga ii is used for the multi objective optimization of mixed reservoir flood control system and the objective is to minimize the flood risk at multiple flood control sections rather than that only at the section in the mainstream compared with the traditional nsga ii wnsga ii could obtain better pareto solutions for more efficient flood control finally the resilience of large scale reservoir operating rules under inflow uncertainty is investigated a case study is performed in a large scale mixed reservoir system consisting of eight flood control reservoirs in the xijiang river basin china the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area flood data and conventional operating rules cor for the eight flood control reservoirs section 3 describes the methodology including piecewise linear operating rules plo optimization model and two optimization schemes single objective by ga and multi objective optimization by wnsga ii section 4 describes the results and discussion including the sensitivity analysis of parameters from plo ga and plo wnsga ii optimization results performance of five flood control sections and eight reservoirs and resilience of cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii under inflow uncertainty finally conclusions are given in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the xijiang river is the third longest river in china after the yangtze river and the yellow river with a total length of 2075 km and a drainage area of 352 400 km2 the xijiang river basin has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation ranging of 1250 1750 mm however the precipitation is temporally variable 75 of which occurs in the flood season from april to september also precipitation varies spatially for example the average annual precipitation in the liujiang sub basin varies between 1300 and 2200 mm but that of yujiang sub basin varies between 1077 and 1680 mm as shown in fig 1 the tributaries of the xijiang include yujiang hongshuihe liujiang guijiang qianjiang and xunjiang there will be a total of eight flood control reservoirs by the year 2020 hongshuihe is the mainstream of the xijiang with a length of 1553 km accounting for 38 of the total drainage area and its flood control reservoir is located at the longtan yujiang is the largest tributary with a length of 1152 km and a drainage area of 89 357 km2 and it has two cascade reservoirs at the baise and laokou respectively liujiang is the second largest tributary with a flood control reservoir located at the luojiu guijiang is the third largest tributary with four parallel flood control reservoirs located at the qingshitan fuzikou chuanjiang and xiaorongjiang respectively the schematic diagram of mixed reservoir system in the xijiang river basin is also added in fig 1 and the basic parameters are shown in table 1 the safe discharge of the flood control section is indicated by the maximum allowable discharge that will not cause flood risk at the flood control section during the flood season which is usually determined by the height of the river embankment five flood control sections are selected in this study nanning qianjiang liuzhou and guilin are the flood control sections in the yujiang hongshuihe liujiang and guijiang tributaries whose safe discharges are 14 750 m3 s 16 400 m3 s 18 100 m3 s and 4850 m3 s respectively wuzhou city the intersection of four tributaries yujiang hongshuihe liujiang and guijiang is the flood control section in the mainstream as wuzhou city is close to guangdong province which is one of the most developed provinces in china the flood control safety of wuzhou city could ensure no flood damage to guangdong province the safe discharge is 41 200 m3 s which is determined by the guangxi water and power design institute 2 2 flood data as there are hundreds of hydrological stations in the xijiang river basin it is difficult to obtain the flood data of all hydrological stations in this study flood hydrographs of eight reservoir five flood control sections and green hydrological stations in 15 years 1962 1966 1968 1970 1974 1976 1978 1983 1988 1994 1996 1998 2001 2002 and 2005 are obtained fig 1 where the time step is 1 h the streamflows of 15 typical flood hydrographs at five flood control sections in five representative rivers nanning yujiang qianjiang hongshuihe liuzhou liujiang guilin guijiang and wuzhou xunjiang see fig 1 are shown in supplementary data as the time horizon ranges from 1962 to 2005 the climate change has an impact on the flood process thus the validation period selects the early and late years to reduce the impact of mismatching reservoir operating rules by climate change the flood data in 1970 1974 1976 1978 1983 1988 1994 1996 1998 and 2001 are used for calibration while that in 1962 1966 1968 2002 and 2005 are used for validation besides the flood data in calibration and validation could also reflect the diversity of flood magnitude and the spatial distribution however it should be noted that these hydrographs were observed with the same time step 1 h but for different lengths of time the selected 15 typical flood hydrographs could well reflect the diversity of flood magnitude and spatial distribution it varied from 35 600 53 700 m3 s at the wuzhou section 7700 33 700 m3 s at the liuzhou section 9900 18 400 m3 s at the qianjiang section 3600 13 400 m3 s at the nanning section and 270 5900 m3 s at the guilin section respectively in addition the peak streamflow was 52 900 m3 s in 1998 calibration and 53 700 m3 s in 2005 validation at the wuzhou section 22 100 m3 s in 1962 validation and 25 900 m3 s in 1970 calibration at the liuzhou section 18 400 m3 s in 1988 calibration and 16 600 m3 s in 2005 validation at the qianjiang section 9020 m3 s in 1970 calibration and 9240 m3 s in 2002 validation at the nanning section and 3800 m3 s in 1978 calibration and 3150 m3 s in 2002 validation at the guilin section respectively for spatial distribution the flood hydrographs of the wuzhou section are the highest among the five sections as the wuzhou section is located in the mainstream the precipitation in the xijiang river basin varies spatially the average annual precipitation is 1750 mm in the liujiang sub basin but 1200 mm and 1400 mm in the yujiang sub basin and hongshuihe sub basin respectively the guilin section has the smallest flood hydrographs due to its smallest catchment area and low average annual precipitation thus the peak streamflow at the liuzhou section is higher than that at the qianjiang and nanning sections for most flood hydrographs such as in 1962 validation and 1970 calibration however the peak streamflow at the qianjiang section is occasionally the same as that at the nanning section or slightly higher than that at the liuzhou section such as in 2001 calibration and 2002 validation the peak streamflow at the qianjiang section is much the same as that at the liuzhou section in most instances such as in 1966 validation and 1968 calibration the saint venant equation is the complete equation for flood routing to obtain the downstream streamflow and water level however the finite difference method for numerically solving the saint venant equation is time consuming the muskingum model cunge 1969 gill 1984 1978 1992 hsu and wei 2007 tung 1985 windsor 1973 the simplified finite difference approximation method for the saint venant equation to obtain the streamflow was used as the flood routing method of the xijiang river basin 2 3 conventional operating rules conventional operating rules cor are designed separately for the eight flood control reservoirs the release of the longtan reservoir is dependent on its water level the amount and fluctuation of streamflow at the wuzhou section table 2 the release of the luojiu reservoir is dependent on its inflow the amount and fluctuation of streamflow at the liuzhou section table 3 the release of the baise reservoir is dependent on its water level the amount and fluctuation of streamflow at downstream cities chongzuo and nanning the release of the laokou reservoir is dependent on its inflow and water level the release of the four flood control reservoirs in the guijiang is dependent on their water level inflow and the amount and fluctuation of streamflow at the guilin section a potential drawback of cor is that the interactions among flood control sections have not been considered which can easily lead to floods at the wuzhou section therefore the trade offs for flood risk among the tributaries and the mainstream in the xijiang river basin should be considered in the derivation of optimal mixed reservoir operating rules given the possible occurrence of short term but devastating floods wnsga ii is used in this study as it could obtain pareto solutions more efficiently and effectively 3 methodology different piecewise linear operating rules plo are derived based on single objective and multi objective mixed reservoir operation optimization models respectively the procedure to derive the optimal plo considering the trade offs for flood risk among tributaries and the mainstream is shown in fig 2 the objective in single objective optimization is to minimize the flood risk at the section in the mainstream by ga whereas four objectives in multi objective optimization are to minimize the flood risk at four sections in the tributaries with the penalty term of the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream by wnsga ii the operation results obtained by cor serve as the reference point ref of wnsga ii and the optimal plo could be determined by comparing operation results from cor single objective piecewise linear operating rules derived by ga plo ga and multi objective piecewise linear operating rules derived by wnsga ii plo wnsga ii 3 1 piecewise linear operating rules the stepwise procedures for the derivation of plo in table 4 is shown as follows 1 determine the downstream flood control section near the reservoir and its safe discharge q s 2 with the historical maximum inflow of the reservoir determine the classified inflow i 1 and i 2 by trial and error method 3 set the six release schemes by forecasted flow fluctuation and rate at the downstream section and the forecasted reservoir inflow if the streamflow at the section is less than half of the safe discharge the release equals to the forecasted inflow otherwise one of three release schemes is implemented based on the comparison between forecasted and classified inflow as shown in table 4 as there are two classified inflows i 1 and i 2 three choices are made based on the comparison between forecasted inflow and classified inflow besides as the streamflow may increase or decrease under the three release schemes a total of six release choices parameters for a single reservoir and thus a total of 48 parameters need to be optimized for the eight flood control reservoirs as shown in table 2 the release of the longtan reservoir based on the cor is depended on the forecasted flow fluctuation and rate at the downstream wuzhou section however it needs approximately 106 h for floods to flow from the longtan reservoir to the wuzhou section resulting in asynchronous fluctuation as the flood fluctuation at the qianjiang section is synchronous with that at the longtan reservoir it is selected as the downstream flood control section for the longtan reservoir in this paper besides nanning liuzhou and guilin are selected as the downstream flood control sections for reservoirs in the yujiang liujiang and guijiang respectively 3 2 optimization model two optimization models are compared to investigate the trade offs for flood risk between different tributaries and the mainstream for the single objective optimization model the only objective is to ensure the safety of the wuzhou section in the mainstream which could be defined as follows 1 min f r w min t 1 t q w t q w s 2 n w t where f r w is the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream q w t is the streamflow at the wuzhou section at time period t q w s is the safe discharges at the wuzhou section n w t is a binary variable which is taken to be 1 when the streamflow exceeds the safe discharge and to be 0 when the streamflow is lower than the safe discharge so it indicates whether the wuzhou section is damaged or not at time period t and t is the number of time periods the safety of four sections in the tributaries and the wuzhou section in the mainstream are considered together for multi objective optimization as the safety of the wuzhou section is the coordination results of four tributaries it is not an individual objective to minimize the flood risk at the wuzhou section there are some trade offs for flood risk among the four flood control section as the flood risk in the mainstream is caused by the convergence of four tributaries it should be noted that the minimization of the flood risk at the four flood control sections in the tributaries is not equivalent to the minimization of the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream due to the interzone inflow and possible synchronous peak streamflow of four tributaries thus the flood risk at the wuzhou section is defined as a penalty term for the four sections in the tributaries it means that the flood risk at the wuzhou section is proportionally reflected in the objective functions of the four sections the objectives of the four flood control sections in the tributaries can be expressed as follows 1 nanning section 2 min f r n min t 1 t q n t q n s 2 n n t p n t 3 p n t q n t q w t q w t q w s 2 n w t 2 qianjiang section 4 min f r q min t 1 t q q t q q s 2 n q t p q t 5 p q t q q t q w t q w t q w s 2 n

q w s 2 n w t where f r n f r q f r l f r g are the flood risk at the four flood control sections nanning qianjiang liuzhou and guilin based on the flood risk at the wuzhou section p n t p q t p l t p g t are the penalty terms of the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream for four flood control sections at time period t q n t q q t q l t q g t are the streamflow at the four flood control sections at time period t n n t n q t n l t n g t are the binary variables which are taken to be 1 when the streamflow exceeds the safe discharge and to be 0 when the streamflow is lower than the safe discharge indicating whether the flood control sections are damaged or not at time period t q n s q q s q l s q g s are the safe discharges at the four flood control sections in the tributaries respectively the following constraints are considered in this study 1 water balance equation 10 i i t i i t 1 2 δ t r i t r i t 1 2 δ t v i t 1 v i t where i i t r i t v i t are the inflow release and storage of reservoir i at time period t respectively δ t is the time interval 2 reservoir storage limit 11 v i min v i t v i max where v i min v i max are the minimum and maximum allowable reservoir storage of reservoir i at time period t respectively 3 release capacity 12 r i t r i max t where r i max t are the maximum allowable release of reservoir i at time period t which is often associated with spillways 4 safe discharges of flood control stations 13 q m t q z t i in t q m s where q z t is the streamflow routing to the downstream flood control station at time period t and i in t is the local streamflow between upstream and downstream stations at time period t 5 boundary conditions 14 z i 1 z i i n i t where z i i n i t is the water level of reservoir i at the beginning of reservoir operation 6 channel routing 15 q z t c 0 r t c 1 r t 1 c 2 q z t 1 where c 0 c 1 c 2 are the channel routing coefficients in the muskingum method 7 streamflow at the wuzhou section 16 q w t α n q n t α q q q t α l q l t α g q g t α in i in t where α n α q α l α g α in are the channel routing coefficients of streamflow at the nanning qianjiang liuzhou guilin and local inflow to the wuzhou section precipitation has been transformed into the inflow of reservoirs in the mass balance equation the water loss due to evaporation in the mass balance equation is negligible as it differs from reservoir storage by thousands orders of magnitude for example the hourly average evaporation of the baise station recorded by the guangxi water and power design institute is only 0 23 mm which is 1 181 000 of the total storage of the baise reservoir thus it is assumed that there is no water loss from reservoir evaporation in the water balance equation as the time step of all flood data is 1 h the length of the optimization time interval δ t is also taken to be 1 h 3 3 optimization schemes 3 3 1 single objective optimization the primary consideration in the mixed reservoir operation optimization is to ensure the safety of the most important city in the mainstream thus the only objective in the single objective optimization scheme is to minimize the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream ga is used in this paper for single objective optimization whitley 1994 there are four parameters in ga that need to be determined including population size generation size crossover rate and mutation rate larger population size and generation size would lead to convergence to optimal solutions at the expense of an unacceptably long simulation time crossover and mutation are conducted to search for better solutions based on the fitness function based on the studies of grefenstette 1986 and srinivas and patnaik 1994 the population size and generation size are set to 100 which could obtain good results with an acceptable simulation time 8000 s and the crossover and mutation rates are determined empirically to be 0 9 and 0 1 respectively 3 3 2 multi objective optimization the minimization of flood risk at the four flood control sections in the tributaries with the penalty term of flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream are considered in the multi objective optimization scheme of the mixed reservoir system nsga ii is the most widely used multi objective optimization algorithm including two important components the fast non dominated sorting method and the crowding distance deb et al 2002 the fast non dominated sorting method can be used to determine the pareto rank of each individual based on its fitness function objective value such as the pareto rank 1 2 3 in fig 3 for the minimization problem in fig 3 individuals with larger pareto ranks such as pareto rank 3 are dominated by those with smaller ones such as pareto rank 1 and 2 which is closer to the true pareto front the crowding distance is defined as the sum of the edge length of the cuboid in fig 3 17 d k j 1 j f j k 1 f j k 1 where d k is the crowding distance of individual k j is the number of objectives and f j k 1 f j k 1 are the jth objective value of individual k 1 k 1 respectively in the same pareto rank individuals with larger crowding distances are preferred due to their representativeness and importance thus individuals with smaller pareto ranks and larger crowding distances have a higher chance in the true pareto front deb 2001 deb et al 2002 zhang et al 2016a b wnsga ii the modified version of nsga ii could more efficiently direct the evolution into the non dominated region by the weighted crowding distance than the traditional crowding distance in nsga ii as shown in fig 3 the plane could be divided into four regions by the reference point which is corresponding to conventional operation results for the minimization problem as the objective values of all individuals in region 1 are smaller than the reference point the individuals in region 1 are the non dominated solutions and region 1 is the non dominated area of the reference point when at least one objective of the individuals in the three regions is larger than the reference point the individuals in the three regions are the dominated solutions and the other three regions are the dominated regions the traditional crowding distance of individuals in the dominated regions region 2 3 4 are converted into the weighted crowding distance by multiplying a small weight factor δ 0 1 in wnsga ii while the crowding distance of individuals in the non dominated regions region 1 remain unchanged thus the individuals in the dominated regions with a smaller crowding distance are more likely to be abandoned while those in the non dominated region with a larger crowding distance are more likely to be selected for evolution individuals are quickly approached to the non dominated region with the weighted crowding distance under the same number of model runs more details about wnsga ii should be referred to gong et al 2015 and zhang et al 2016a as nsga ii is the modified version of ga deb 2001 deb et al 2002 the parameters for the model set up of nsga ii and wnsga ii such as population size and generation size are the same as those of ga in section 3 3 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis sa can screen out the sensitive parameters for the high dimensional nonlinear problems as there are totally 48 parameters for the eight reservoirs sa could determine the most influential parameters for the flood risk in the xijiang river basin multivariate adaptive regression splines mars is used for parameters screening due to its stability friedman 1991 gan et al 2014 the sensitivity of parameters could be quantified by generalized cross validation gcv score which could indicate the importance of each parameter steinberg et al 1999 4 1 1 sensitive parameters of plo ga as the only objective of plo ga is to minimize the flood risk at the wuzhou section the sensitive parameters of plo ga could be determined by the gcv score from mars with 10 000 samples as shown in fig 4 there are 10 sensitive parameters of plo ga including one parameter from the laokou reservoir in the yujiang sub basin five parameters from the longtan reservoir in the hongshuihe sub basin and four parameters from the luojiu reservoir in the liujiang sub basin the highest gcv scores are observed in the longtan reservoir indicating the importance of the longtan reservoir to the flood risk at the wuzhou section the variation of optimal sensitive parameters over 20 trials of ga are performed to investigate the reliability of optimal parameters from ga shown in fig 5 the values of optimal sensitive parameters are transformed into normalized values to reduce the influence of magnitude as the small range of each optimal sensitive parameter over 20 trials of ga the 60 confidence interval is used to indicate the reliability of optimal sensitive parameters a narrower interval indicates a better reliability of the parameters from ga the red curve located in the 60 confidence interval is selected as the optimal parameters of plo ga in table 5 4 1 2 sensitive parameters of plo wnsga ii as there are four objectives in the multi objective optimization scheme the sensitive parameters for the four objectives of plo wnsga ii are screened out in fig 6 there are four sensitive parameters from the baise and laokou reservoirs for flood risk at the nanning section in fig 6 a six sensitive parameters from the longtan reservoir for flood risk at the qianjiang section in fig 6 b five sensitive parameters from the luojiu reservoir for flood risk at the liuzhou section in fig 6 c and six sensitive parameters from the qingshitan fuzikou and chuanjiang reservoirs for flood risk at the guilin section in fig 6 d respectively however as the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream is taken as the penalty term of the four tributaries the sensitive parameters for the four objectives are not merely the parameters of reservoirs in the relevant tributaries for example the sensitive parameters for the flood risk at the nanning section are from the baise and laokou reservoirs in the yujiang sub basin the longtan reservoir in the hongshuihe sub basin and the luojiu reservoir in the liujiang sub basin the variation of optimal sensitive parameters corresponding to the minimum of the four objectives nanning qianjiang liuzhou and guilin sections over 20 trials of wnsga ii is shown in fig 7 a d respectively the 60 confidence interval of the normalized sensitive parameters is shown in fig 7 the narrow 60 confidence interval could indicate the reliability of the optimal sensitive parameters 4 2 optimization results 4 2 1 optimal reservoir operating rules by ga the 60 confidence interval red zone of the variation of flood risk at the wuzhou section from ga during the calibration period over 20 trials is shown in fig 8 the narrow distribution of the objective function could reflect the stability of ga clearly the flood risk at the wuzhou section decreases rapidly in the first 500 model runs but more slowly thereafter the optimal objective at the wuzhou section could be obtained at 10 000 model runs the blue curve is corresponding to the optimal parameters of plo ga of the eight flood control reservoirs shown in table 5 besides the flood risk at the other four flood control sections in the tributaries were simulated by plo ga and shown in table 6 in italics 4 2 2 pareto front by wnsga ii since there are four objectives in the multi objective optimization scheme the complex high dimensional pareto front is denoted by visualizing the projections of the four objectives in pairs which results in c 4 2 6 sub figures c 4 2 is the combination of an un ordered two objectives collection of four objectives the optimization results obtained by nsga ii and wnsga ii are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively there are totally 16 sub figures including 12 sub figures of the symmetrical combination of an un ordered collection of the four objectives and 4 diagonal sub figures about the distribution of the evaluated points and the pareto front solutions as shown in fig 10 all pareto front solutions obtained from wnsga ii are located in the non dominated region region 1 in fig 3 indicating that all the four objectives of pareto front solutions are better than conventional operation results reference point however the pareto front solutions obtained from nsga ii are widely distributed in both dominated and non dominated regions fig 9 thus it can be inferred that wnsga ii outperforms the traditional nsga ii the obtained pareto front obtained from wnsga ii over 20 trials is plotted in fig 11 to investigate its stability as there are four objectives six c 4 2 6 sub figures are plotted to describe the combination of two dimensional pareto front for example fig 11 a shows the trade offs for flood risk between the nanning and qianjiang sections as there are trade offs among four objectives the sub figures with two objectives cannot have the perfect pareto curve the points with different colors corresponds to different trials as shown in fig 11 the pareto front solutions do not overlap with each other and they are distributed in a small region rather than widely in a large region indicating the stability of wnsga ii reservoir manager could select the parameters based on their preference the parameters of plo wnsga ii are randomly selected from the pareto front in this paper shown in table 7 interestingly most parameters of plo ga table 5 are smaller than that of plo wnsga ii table 7 as only the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream rather than that at the other four sections in the tributaries is considered in plo ga the small parameters could reduce the flood risk at the wuzhou section due to the staggering peak in the tributaries however too small parameters of plo ga which differ significant from the inflow such as zero in the longtan and luojiu reservoirs could lead to a rapid increase of reservoir water level and thus cause dam breach a sudden increase of release is required to protect the dam but it can easily cause damage to downstream flood control sections as plo wnsga ii considers the flood risk at the four sections in the tributaries with the penalty term of the flood risk in the mainstream larger parameters of plo wnsga ii can avoid the sudden increase of release and consequent damages to the sections in the tributaries thus reasonable parameters of plo wnsga ii can not only effectively reduce the flood risk in the tributaries and the mainstream but also guarantee the safety of the reservoirs 4 2 3 objective distributions between nsga ii and wnsga ii the probability density function pdf of random variables is usually determined by parametric and non parametric density estimation with given sample points specific distributions of the random variables in parametric density estimation are assumed but such an assumption could be violated in actual operation kernel density estimation parzen window parzen 1962 rosenblatt 1956 a non parametric density estimation requires no prior knowledge of data distribution and avoids the influence of model and parameter estimation an important issue in kernel density estimation is the selection of bandwidth the distribution curve can be under smoothed with a small bandwidth and over smoothed with a large bandwidth the gaussian kernel function is widely used in kernel density estimation due to the smooth kernel with an optimal bandwidth in this study it is used to describe the probability density function of objectives the four objective distributions of pareto front solutions and evaluated points from nsga ii and wnsga ii are compared in fig 12 the area enclosed by the objective distribution curve equals 1 the upper and lower bounds from nsga ii and wnsga ii were determined separately fig 12 shows that 1 the pdf of evaluated points and pareto front solutions from nsga ii is smooth with a wide distribution and the directed searching strategy by weighted crowding distance from wnsga ii makes the pdf have a sharp peak and 2 the peaks of the four objectives from wnsga ii are much closer to the origin compared with those from nsga ii thus wnsga ii results in a sharp peak close to the origin while nsga ii results in a smooth distribution with peaks far away from the origin the reason is that most evaluated points and pareto front solutions from wnsga ii are located in the non dominated region by directed searching with the weighted crowding distance while that from nsga ii are dispersively distributed 4 3 damages to five flood control sections the flood risks at the five flood control sections obtained from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii in calibration and validation are compared in table 6 in calibration all the five flood control sections are damaged for cor and the flood risk at the four flood control sections in the tributaries nanning qianjiang liuzhou and guilin obtained from plo wnsga ii is lower than that obtained from plo ga with the maximum difference of 58 8 at the qianjiang section and the minimum difference of 2 0 at the liuzhou and guilin sections as the single objective of plo ga is to minimize the flood risk at the wuzhou section the flood risk at the wuzhou section obtained from plo ga is 3 2 smaller than that obtained from plo wnsga ii in validation nanning and guilin sections are not damaged due to small floods in yujiang and guijiang such as the flood process of 1962 in validation fig s1 in the supplementary data compared with the flood process of 2001 in calibration fig s13 in the supplementary data the difference between plo wnsga ii and plo ga at the qianjiang liuzhou and wuzhou sections is 73 0 8 2 and 3 3 respectively indicating that plo wnsga ii is better for flood control than plo ga in validation the damage period the accumulation period when the streamflow exceeds the safe discharges of the five flood control sections from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii are compared in table 8 cor has the maximum damage period for the nanning liuzhou and wuzhou sections followed by plo ga and plo wnsga ii in calibration in validation the nanning and guilin sections are not damaged which agrees with the results in table 6 more damage periods are observed at the qianjiang section in calibration and validation from plo ga and plo wnsga ii than that from cor because the maximum water level at the longtan reservoir from cor exceeds the flood control water level this is unacceptable for reservoirs during flood season the maximum flow damage the overflow between the maximum streamflow and the safe discharge of the five flood control sections from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii are compared in table 9 the maximum flow damage at the wuzhou section reaches a minimum by plo ga due to its single objective at the wuzhou section cor performs worst at the guilin and wuzhou sections but best at the nanning qianjiang and liuzhou sections plo wnsga ii outperforms cor at the guilin and wuzhou sections but worse at the nanning qianjiang and liuzhou sections indicating that cor and plo wnsga ii are comparable in calibration however the maximum flow damage at the qianjiang liuzhou and wuzhou sections from plo wnsga ii reaches a minimum in validation indicating its advantages over cor and plo ga as the nanning and guilin sections are not damaged in validation their maximum flow damage is zero 4 4 verification of reservoir simulation the simulation results including maximum water level and maximum release of the eight flood control reservoirs from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii are shown in figs 13 and 14 respectively as shown in fig 13 the upper limit of the maximum reservoir water level is lower than the flood control water level at the baise laokou luojiu and chuanjiang reservoirs however it should be noted that the maximum reservoir water level at the fuzikou and xiaorongjiang reservoirs from cor exceed the flood control water level by 8374 and 10 001 times accounting for 42 8 and 51 1 of the total period 19 572 h respectively besides the maximum reservoir water level at the qingshitan from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii exceeds the flood control water level 226 0 m but is below the dam breach water level 230 85 m the maximum reservoir water level from cor exceeds the flood control water level by 8355 times in the total period 19 572 h but by only 189 and 188 times for plo ga and plo wnsga ii respectively the median of the maximum reservoir water level at the qingshitan from cor is even higher than the flood control water level indicating that it has insufficient flood control capacity for future floods while plo wnsga ii gives the lowest median of the maximum reservoir water levels at the qingshitan and fuzikou reservoirs indicating that more flood control capacity can be reserved for future floods extremes are observed only in the box plots of the longtan and luojiu reservoirs from plo ga and plo wnsga ii indicating that plo ga and plo wnsga ii could effectively prevent the maximum reservoir water level from exceeding the flood control water level it is also noted that the extreme 380 9 m in the box plot of the longtan reservoir from cor is much higher than the flood control water level 376 0 m without restraint from cor fig 14 shows the maximum release for the eight flood control reservoirs from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii the median of the maximum release follows the order of cor plo ga plo wnsga ii indicating that plo wnsga ii could more effectively reduce the flood risk at the downstream flood control sections the variations of inflow release and water level at the longtan reservoir from cor and plo wnsga ii in 1970 are shown in fig 15 the coincidence of the release line with the inflow line indicates that all inflow is released resulting in no change in the reservoir water level the maximum inflow of the longtan reservoir is 19 880 m3 s in 1970 and the maximum release from cor is the same as that from plo wnsga ii resulting in a decrease of flood peak discharge by 5860 m3 s however the maximum water level of the longtan reservoir from cor 380 9 m is higher than that from plo wnsga ii 376 0 m and the flood control water level 376 0 m indicating that cor results in insufficient flood control capacity for future floods as the peak inflow and the reduced release occurs at july 14th the water level from cor and plo wnsga ii increase rapidly however the reservoir water level from cor increases continuously after the flood peak while that from plo wnsga ii remains unchanged the increasing water level from cor can be attributed to no restraint on reservoir water level from cor for plo wnsga ii the reservoir water level could be restrained within the allowed reservoir water level and thus plo wnsga ii is better than cor 4 5 resilience under inflow uncertainty as plo wnsga ii outperforms plo ga and cor with the historical deterministic 15 typical flood hydrographs the performances of cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii under inflow uncertainty were investigated in this part li et al 2016a b the inflow fluctuation was set to 10 and the inflow interval was from 90 to 110 the stochastic inflow of the five year period in validation was randomly generated from 90 to 110 inflow interval for ten trials the damage periods and the maximum flow damages at the five flood control sections for ten trials were recorded as the nanning and guilin sections are not damaged the box plots of damage periods and the maximum flow damage at other three sections qianjiang liuzhou and wuzhou from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii over ten trials are shown in fig 16 the range of damage periods and the maximum flow damage from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii indicate the resilience under inflow uncertainty the smaller range of the damage periods and the maximum flow damage are the more resilient the operating rules would be fig 16 shows that the damage period and the maximum flow damage at the qianjiang and liuzhou sections from plo wnsga ii have a smaller interquartile range for ten trials than those from cor and plo ga indicating that plo wnsga ii is more resilient and better able to deal with inflow uncertainty than cor and plo ga however plo ga has the smallest desperation of damage period and maximum flow damage at the wuzhou section due to the single objective besides all the maximum water levels of the eight flood control reservoirs from plo ga and plo wnsga ii for ten trials are lower than the flood control water level however the maximum water level at the longtan fuzikou xiaorongjiang and qingshitan reservoirs from cor exceeds the flood control water level by 442 2030 3388 and 1945 times in the total of 7032 periods in validation respectively which however are still within the dam breach flood level the variations of the streamflow at the qianjiang liuzhou and wuzhou sections from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii in the validation of 1 trial are shown in figs 17 19 respectively the flow damage depth from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii are indicated by the black blue and red histograms respectively for the qianjiang section in fig 16 the median of damage periods from cor is lower than those from plo ga and plo wnsga ii but its median of the maximum flow damage is higher this is because a small number of large flow damages from cor is replaced by a larger number of small flow damages from plo ga and plo wnsga ii as shown in fig 17 plo wnsga ii reduced the maximum flow damage but slightly increased the damage period compared with cor and plo ga for the liuzhou section in fig 16 plo wnsga ii has smaller damage periods and smaller maximum flow damage than cor and plo ga luojiu reservoir in the liujiang could reduce the flood peak effectively in 1966 validation for plo ga and plo wnsga ii as shown in fig 20 plo ga ran out of the flood control storage at the first flood peak while plo wnsga ii could use its flood control storage rationally for three flood peaks however the flood process at the liuzhou section from cor plo ga and plo wnsga ii in validation is almost overlapping in fig 18 except the small difference for the flood peak the reason is that there is magnitude difference between reservoir inflow of the luojiu reservoir and interzone inflow of the liuzhou section in the liujiang the inflow peak in 1966 at the luojiu reservoir is only 3000 m3 s while the flood peak at the liuzhou section is even 25 000 m3 s for the wuzhou section in fig 16 plo ga has smaller damage period than cor and plo wnsga ii due to its single objective as shown in fig 19 the first small damage in 1966 at the wuzhou section is avoided by plo ga the flood peak from cor is larger than those from plo ga and plo wnsga ii the residence of plo ga and plo wnsga ii are comparable at the wuzhou section all larger than cor but plo wnsga ii has larger residence than cor and plo ga at the qianjiang and liuzhou sections in general plo wnsga ii is more resident than cor and plo ga under inflow uncertainty 5 conclusions the trade offs for flood risk among tributaries and the mainstream is considered in the derivation of plo a novel multi objective optimization algorithm wnsga ii in which the traditional crowding distance is replaced by the weighted crowding distance for directed searching is applied in the xijiang river basin and its performance is compared with that of cor and plo ga the following conclusions could be drawn from this study 1 the optimal sensitive parameters of plo ga and plo wnsga ii are reliable ga and wnsga ii could produce stable optimal parameters as the reservoir operating rules 2 wnsga ii is efficient in locating non dominated solutions and can provide better pareto front than the well known nsga ii due to the weighted crowding distance and it can result in the distribution of evaluated points and pareto front solutions with a sharp peak close to the origin 3 plo wnsga ii outperforms cor and plo ga for the control of basin wide floods the multi objective nature of wnsga ii makes it possible to protect multiple flood control sections on both tributaries and mainstream while ga only considers the safety of the wuzhou section 4 plo wnsga ii is more resilient under inflow uncertainty than cor and plo ga in which all the eight reservoirs in the xijiang river basin are considered whereas in cor each reservoir is considered separately and in plo ga only the wuzhou section is considered it should be noted that as plo ga only considers the flood risk at the wuzhou section in the mainstream rather than the whole basin plo wnsga ii performs slightly worse than plo ga at the wuzhou section besides this study only considers the piecewise linear reservoir operating rules and the performances of other types of operating rules should be compared to determine the most suitable reservoir operating rules for the control of basin wide floods in future studies finally the resilience of the operating rules under inflow uncertainty of the historical flood hydrographs is studied in this paper and future study should focus more on inflow uncertainties resulting from human activities and climate changes acknowledgements

7111,the understanding of the impact of drought on the agricultural ecosystem is key to minimize drought related yield losses in this study we analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought events in the north china plain ncp based on the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and investigated the impact of drought on winter wheat and summer maize yields the results indicate an overall drought and wetting trend during the winter wheat growing season in the henan and shandong provinces respectively a significant wetting trend was detected in the ncp during the summer maize growing season at the 1 3 6 and 12 month scales moreover the drought episodes clearly reveal that the drought pattern has changed from summer and autumn droughts in the 1980s to autumn and winter droughts in the 1990s and to winter and spring droughts in the recent decade our results also show that the annual variations in the detrended spei can explain extensive fluctuations associated with both winter wheat and summer maize yields in the ncp furthermore considerable differences in the relationship between agricultural crop yields and the spei time series with different lags were observed the most correlated time scale increases with the advancement of the winter wheat growth stage the correlations between the winter wheat standardized yield residuals series syrs and detrended spei in three subperiods are consistently high and stable whereas a substantial decrease of the correlation was observed at all time scales for summer maize except for the 1 month lag our findings can help to better understand the drought evolution in the ncp in recent decades and hence provide stakeholders with references for the design of future drought mitigation plans keywords

water and food security threats and may lead to crop yield failure and financial challenges worldwide aghakouchak et al 2015 hao and singh 2015 zhao and running 2010 because of global warming droughts have occurred more frequently and larger areas in recent years liu et al 2015 wu et al 2013 2015 generally droughts can be classified into meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic droughts american meteorological society 2004 heim 2002 zhang et al 2015a b all drought types can be associated with a sustained precipitation deficit however different elements of the hydrologic cycle respond differently to drought aghakouchak et al 2015 this study only focuses on agricultural drought which is defined as the lack of soil moisture in a region for a certain period of time it is well known that china is one of the most densely populated agricultural countries in the world and agriculture plays a central role in ensuring food security in china piao et al 2010 drought hazards occur with increasing frequency and continuously in different regions of china and have a severe impact on crop yields wang et al 2014 the north china plain ncp is one of the main production areas of agriculture and one of the most drought prone areas in china thus this study focuses on the investigation of the impacts of the drought conditions on two main crops in the ncp winter wheat and summer maize a better understanding of the drought conditions in the ncp and their impacts is a key to minimize drought related yield losses and mitigate the food security threat in china over the past several decades drought has been the greatest threat to farmers cultivating field crops in many parts of the world du et al 2013 lobell et al 2011 potopová et al 2015 assessing the effects of drought on agriculture may help individuals and societies to properly anticipate these effects and adapt farming to maximize agricultural production fischer et al 2005 madadgar et al 2017 thus research on the effects of droughts on the crop yield has become a core issue related to comprehensive prevention and mitigation of disasters asseng et al 2013 chmielewski et al 2000 potop et al 2012 2014 numerous studies in the literature focused on the examination of the influence of climate extremes on the crop yield worldwide using both statistical methods and physical models alexandrov and hoogenboom 2000 hlavinka et al 2009 lobell and field 2007 olesen et al 2011 potopová et al 2015 roudier et al 2011 schlenker and lobell 2010 yang et al 2017a trnka et al 2012 liu et al 2016 most of those studies highlighted that climate extremes are dominant with respect to the variability of crop yields however the reported relationship between climate variability and crop yield is not consistent it varies from region to region and from one type of crop to another type several studies discussed the impacts of droughts on the crop yield particularly in the ncp ming et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a b however most of those studies focused mainly on a certain crop type or did not consider the difference between overwintering crops and other crops in the correlation between drought indices in other words it was assumed in these studies that the ncp is a single crop yielding area however in reality different crops are grown in the ncp in a rotating manner such as winter wheat and summer maize it should be noted that overwintering crops are related to the drought conditions of both the previous year and current year which has rarely been studied furthermore both the decadal evolution of droughts in the ncp and the relationship between drought conditions and the rotation crops i e winter wheat and summer maize in the ncp are rarely reported but deserve further investigation it has been proposed that drought indices meet the needs for an accurately assessment of drought conditions liu et al 2016 mishra and singh 2010 previous studies have reported that the palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei have been most commonly used in recent years mckee et al 1993 palmer 1965 vicente serrano et al 2010 among these indices the recently developed spei seems to outperform the other two indices vicente serrano et al 2010 however it should be noted that every index has its own strengths and weaknesses in addition various drought indices will lead to different values and patterns if the study areas are at regional scales and have fine resolution núñez et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2012 we compared the performance of the three drought indices pdsi spi and spei that are used the most for monitoring of droughts in the ncp area it has been suggested that the spei and spi outperform the pdsi in agricultural systems liu et al 2018 note that the spei index not only considers the effect of temperature on droughts but is also flexible in monitoring droughts at different time scales potop et al 2012 because of spei processes more detailed information on the influence of droughts on different growth stages of the crop growth season can be captured moorhead et al 2015 potopová et al 2015 thus in this study we selected the spei as the drought index considering the effect of temperature induced evapotranspiration on droughts the primary purposes of this study were to analyze the evolution of drought in the ncp and its impact on the winter wheat and summer maize yields in the rotation growing regions of the ncp specifically three aspects of drought monitoring and impacts on crops yields in the ncp are addressed in this study i the annual and monthly variation of the spei at multiple time scales over the ncp from 1982 to 2013 ii the influence of spei on the crop yield which was studied by correlation analysis between the detrended spei and standardized yield residuals series syrs at various lags for winter wheat and summer maize respectively iii the changes of the relationship between the detrended spei and syrs during three decades of the study period 1982 1990 1991 2000 and 2001 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the ncp located between 32 n and 43 n and 113 e and 123 e is the second largest plain in china it mainly formed by the sedimentation and river sourcing effects of the yellow huaihe haihe and luanhe rivers the ncp region covers many highly populated areas including beijing tianjin hebei henan shandong jiangsu and anhui the ncp has a flat terrain with a fertile soil type as a result the ncp is the main producing area of agricultural crops and the main food production base in china rotational growing of winter wheat and summer maize is the major cropping pattern in the ncp region hu et al 2010 the cultivated land area in the ncp accounts for 27 9 of the total arable land in china the downstream region of the yellow river extends across the central ncp and divides it into two parts the haihe plain in the north and the huanghuai plain in the south climatically the ncp has a warm temperate semi humid continental monsoon climate precipitation in the ncp ranges between 400 and 600 mm annually and most of the rainfalls occurs in the summer season from june to august hu 2013 however the precipitation has significant interannual and intraannual variations in the ncp areas as a result frequent drought and flood events occur in the ncp among the frequent natural hazards influencing the ncp area drought is the most prominent one occurring nine times in ten years in this study we selected the most drought prone areas in the ncp including beijing tianjin hebei shandong and henan as shown in fig 1 2 2 climate dataset the meteorological datasets from 60 meteorological stations in the ncp for 1982 2013 consist of daily mean temperature daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed and precipitation the meteorological data were collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn to eliminate the impact of non climatic factors all data were selected after rigorous quality inspection and control including extreme value tests and a time consistency review missing data were filled by linear interpolation we calculated the potential evapotranspiration for each station based on the penman monteith method monteith 1965 allen et al 1998 penman 1948 using all climate data except for precipitation please refer to allen et al 2006 wu et al 2005 and bai et al 2016 for details about the calculation of the potential evapotranspiration we selected 1982 2013 as our study period because this period is associated with an acceleration of temperature changes which were recorded in the ncp 2 3 crop yield data the annual regional level winter wheat and summer maize yield data for the ncp from 1982 to 2013 were obtained from the statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2014 statistical analyses of the crop yield evolution and spei variability were conducted using the average crop yields derived from all districts in the ncp note that the observed crop yield increases may include effects of all of the following factors mavromatis 2007 sun et al 2012 such as the advances in agricultural technology fertilizer application new crop varieties and better management thus to eliminate the bias attributed to non climatic factors we removed the trend of the data using a linear regression when calculating the yield variability and then used the residuals of the detrended series of the crop yield for analysis to compare the yield variability among crops with different mean values and standard deviations the yield residuals were standardized for the detrended crop yield time series using the z score transformation we then obtained the syrs with mean and standard deviation values equal to zero and one respectively based on the standard normal distribution the syrs values between 0 5 and 0 5 1 0 and 0 5 1 5 and 1 0 and below 1 5 are classified as normal condition low yield loss condition moderate yield loss condition and high yield loss condition respectively potopová et al 2015 table 1 it is worth mentioning that the growing season for winter wheat in the ncp range from october of the previous year to june of the following year thus we recognized the growing season as this entire period in the analysis of the effect of droughts on the winter wheat yield the growing season of the summer maize in the study area is relatively shorter than that of winter wheat it ranges from june to october of the current year 2 4 methods 2 4 1 calculation of the spei the newly developed spei was used to characterize the drought evolution in the ncp from 1982 to 2013 the detailed steps for the calculation of the spei were as follows first we estimated the monthly potential evapotranspiration based on the climate data and p m model for all stations during the study period we then retrieved the monthly water balance by calculating the difference between monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration finally the monthly water balance data for all stations were put into the spei r package http cran r project org web packages spei to calculate the spei values at multiple time scales please refer to mckee et al 1993 and vicente serrano et al 2010 for more detailed information on the principle and definitions of spei 2 4 2 trend analysis the spei trend in the study area was calculated using sen trend analysis sen 1968 the significance of the trend was further examined using the mann kendall statistical test kendall 1948 the advantage of sen trend analysis is that this method does not require a specific sample distribution and is free from interferences of outliers therefore this method is robust and resistant to measurement and outlier data errors the equation is as follows β m e d i a n x j x i j i j i where β represents the spei trend i and j denote the time steps of the time series xi and xj denote the spei value at time i or j respectively β 0 suggests an increasing trend of the spei value wetting trend and β 0 suggests a decreasing spei trend drought trend 2 4 3 correlation analysis the impact of the spei variability on the yields of winter wheat and summer maize was evaluated based on correlations of the non parametric spearman s rho coefficient with a significance threshold of p 0 05 the trend of each of the spei time series at different time scales was removed before calculating the correlation with the syrs to investigate the impact of the spei on the crop yields in different time periods we analyzed the relationship between the crop yield and spei using the data of the entire study period and that of particular segments that is 1982 1990 1991 2000 and 2001 2013 3 results and discussions 3 1 multi scale drought patterns fig 2 illustrates regional scale evolutions of the spei during the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons with 1 24 accumulation periods between 1982 and 2013 drought and wet episodes were observed during the growing seasons of the winter wheat and summer maize during the winter wheat growing season the main and most severe drought and wet episodes occurred at the middle long time scale as indicated by the lag of the spei value ranging from 8 to 18 months moreover a significant period of drought was detected during the late 1990s however based on the spei values at multiple temporal scales the main wet episodes occurred in 1989 1990 and 2003 fig 2a a similar pattern of drought and wetness was observed during the summer maize growing season it should be mentioned that the ncp experienced a rapid shift from severe drought to severe wet episodes during the period of 1997 1998 with 1 to 12 month lags this change may be related to the severe el niño event that occurred during that period the main wet episodes of the summer maize growing season occurred in 1990 1991 and 2003 2004 in addition a short term drought was detected during the winter wheat growing season in 2010 whereas a middle term drought occurred during the summer maize growing season in 2011 fig 2b to provide detailed insights into the evolution of the drought wet conditions in different provinces we further analyzed the monthly time series of the spei at three representative stations capitals of each province in fig 1 of three provinces the multiannual variability of the spei for the three stations was determined only for the 3 month lag because this study mainly focuses on agricultural drought previous studies have also reported that the temporal evolution of the spei with a 3 month lag represents short and medium term moisture conditions and provides seasonal estimates of the climatic water balance and that the 3 month spei might more effectively highlight the available moisture in regions with intensive agriculture lloyd hughes 2012 potopová et al 2015 on a decadal scale the jinan station mainly had a significant prevalence of drought episodes expressed by the frequency of drought months during the 1980s fig 3 c while alternate wet and dry episodes occurred at the zhengzhou station fig 3b in the latter 5 year period in the 1990s all three stations exhibit an increasing trend in intensity in association with climate warming more wet episodes were identified in the first decade of the 21st century especially at the jinan station followed by the zhengzhou station however drought episodes prevailed over wet episodes at the zhengzhou station from 2010 to 2014 on the contrary more wet episodes were identified at the shijiazhuang station fig 3a alternate severe wet and dry episodes occurred at the jinan station 3 2 spatial pattern of drought in the ncp to better understand the recent changes in the drought frequency we calculated the percentage of drought months spei 1 for each station at 1 3 6 and 12 month lags and spatially interpolated the results fig s1 the results show that the drought frequency in the ncp area is consistent mainly ranging between 15 and 20 however spatial differences were observed at different time scales high values mainly occurred in the northeastern part of the hebei province western part of the henan province and middle part of shandong province at a 1 month scale with respect to the 3 month and 6 month lags the eastern part of shandong province became the most severely affected area the impacted area expanded further to the northern part of the hebei province at a 12 month lag we also obtained the trends of the spei during the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons at different time lags for the ncp from 1982 to 2013 figs 4 and 5 notably opposite trends were captured between the henan and shandong provinces this relationship was particularly significant during the winter wheat growing season during the winter wheat growing season an overall drought trend was detected with high values in the northern and western parts of the henan province on the contrary a wetting trend was observed in the shandong province during the recent 30 years the magnitude of these trends gradually increased with increasing lag length this phenomenon suggests that the agricultural drought risk in the henan province has increased whereas the risk of droughts has been mitigated in the shandong province over the past 30 years based on our results regions with a dry tendency within the hebei province were distributed mainly in the northern area whereas regions with a wet tendency were observed mainly in the southern area during the summer maize growing season wetting trends were dominant in the ncp area indicating an overall decrease in the drought risk during the summer growing season however the drought risk in the northern southern and western parts of henan province remained it should be noted that the flood risk in the shandong province and increasing drought impact under global warming conditions should be studied in the future 3 3 frequency of droughts at the month scale fig 6 illustrates the monthly averaged percentage of drought over the ncp during different decades at 1 3 6 and 12 month lags the results suggest that the drought months depend on the accumulation period the drought months become equally distributed as the time scale increases for example the results detected by spei 12 were almost equally distributed this difference occurs because the short term spei reflects short term water deficit conditions and is sensitive and vulnerable to climate variability whereas the long term spei mainly reveals long term water deficit conditions in a certain region at the decadal scale the highest incidence of drought months was detected in the 1990s which is consistent with our previous results derived from fig 2 more importantly large differences were observed with respect to the annual distribution of drought months at short term lags of the spei values based on the spei 1 and spei 3 values the month with the highest frequency of drought is june in the 1980s followed by february and september in the 1990s whereas the spring drought march and april prevailed in the 21st century these results clearly show that the drought conditions in the ncp have evolved from summer and autumn droughts in the 1980s to autumn and winter droughts in the 1990s and to winter and spring droughts in the recent decade this phenomenon imposes serious challenges on the growth of winter wheat but suggests a reduced drought risk of the summer maize production it is worth mentioning that these conclusions were derived from the entire ncp area detailed patterns for each province that could be used to develop province level drought mitigation plans would require further exploration it is possible that each regional area has a different spei trend than that obtained for the entire ncp area as shown in figs 4 and 5 3 4 evolution of the standardized yield residual series based on our results the yields of both winter wheat and summer maize exhibit a significant increase from 1982 to 2013 with a linear increment of 95 69 and 74 43 kg y respectively the yields considerably increased from 1982 to 1995 which could be the result of improved technologies for crop production the yield increase of winter wheat and summer maize from 1982 to 1995 was 100 84 and 127 99 kg y respectively however extensive fluctuations of both crop yields were observed during 1995 2004 when drought episodes occurred simultaneously figs 2 and 3 statistical analyses indicate that 66 7 of the total drought years for winter wheat in the recent 30 years occurred after the year 2000 whereas the percentage for summer maize is 50 after 2000 the yields of both winter wheat and summer maize exhibit a continuous increase with a linear increment of 83 71 and 80 68 kg y respectively fig s2 to exclude non climatic factors that may influence the crop yield we further analyzed the temporal evolution of the syrs from 1982 to 2013 based on the threshold values listed in table 1 the years with high yield losses of winter wheat were 1982 and 2002 whereas they were 1986 1997 and 2003 for summer maize the years with moderate yield losses of winter wheat were 1988 and 2001 whereas the years were 2002 and 2004 for summer maize the year 2003 followed by 1997 ranks the highest in terms of crop failure of summer maize in the ncp it is worth to point out that clearly opposite trends were observed for winter wheat and summer maize whereby the winter wheat exhibits a high yield increment but the summer maize is associated with a high yield loss fig 7 a to investigate the possible reason for the failure of the summer maize yields we further analyzed the intraannual variation of the spei in 1997 with lags from 1 to 12 months fig 7b the spei exhibits a drought episode during the summer maize growing season june to october at all the time scales while wet conditions were detected during the winter wheat growing season october of the former year to june of the following year this phenomenon could explain why crop yield failure of summer maize occurred in 1997 it further demonstrates the severe impact of drought on crop yields in addition clear differences between the onsets of drought based on different time lags were observed in other words the short term spei detects the onset of drought sooner than the long term spei and recovers to normal even faster than the long term spei for example the onset of drought in 1997 was detected in the middle of may by the 1 month lag spei but it was detected two months later by the 12 month lag spei in addition the 1 month spei recovered to normal conditions in the middle of october whereas the 12 month lag spei did not recover until the next year thus there is a significant advantage of short term drought warning information in agricultural production practices the methods demonstrated in this study could be beneficial to develop appropriate timely measures for drought mitigation plans for winter wheat and summer maize in the ncp of china 3 5 analysis of the correlation between spei and syrs in the previous section we spatially and temporally analyzed the drought frequency and drought and yield evolution of winter wheat and summer maize in the ncp given the fact that the time scales at which different crop types respond to drought may notably differ ozturk and aydin 2004 we further analyze the effects of droughts on crop yields in this section fig 8 shows the spearman s rho correlation coefficients between the monthly detrended spei time series at 1 12 month lags and the syrs of winter wheat and summer maize from 1982 to 2013 it should be noted that winter wheat is an overwintering crop thus we calculated the correlation between the syrs and monthly detrended spei from october of the previous year to june of the following year the correlation period for summer maize ranges from june to october of the current year significant differences of the responses of the agricultural crops to different lags of the spei were identified a positive correlation was observed when drought conditions significantly influenced the crop yields indicating that the year to year variations of the crop production i e the syrs are related to the year to year variations of the detrended spei time series based on the phenological calendar of winter wheat in the ncp area the most sensitive period for winter wheat is the flowering april may followed by the period of jointing and heading drought conditions could cause substantial yield losses during the flowering period of winter wheat our results show a high sensitivity of the winter wheat yield to drought in may at 11 month lags furthermore the correlation coefficients between the syrs and drought in march and april at 9 to 12 month lags are consistently above 0 4 indicating that severe yield failure could be attributed to the spring drought similarly a less pronounced positive correlation was observed for october november and december and middle term droughts another interesting finding was that the most correlated time scale between the syrs and detrended spei in a certain month increases with the advancement of the winter wheat growth stage given that the crop yield is related to all growth stages in a growth cycle and that a later growth stage reflects a longer period of water deficit the correlation is more pronounced for long term droughts based on the phenological calendar of summer maize in the ncp the yields of summer maize were highly sensitive to drought conditions during the silking period this finding agrees with those of previous studies conducted by otegui et al 1995 our study indicates the short medium term droughts in july and august could have a serious impact on the summer maize yield in the ncp the highest correlation was recorded for the spei with 2 month lag in july and that with 3 month lag in august r 0 42 3 6 changes in the relationship between spei and syrs our results suggest that the crop yields might be significantly influenced by drought events however the correlation between the syrs and detrended spei change over time to better understand the relationship between the crop yield and spei we investigated the changes in the relationship between the syrs and detrended spei in three subperiods that is 1982 1990 1991 2000 and 2001 2013 the correlation coefficient between the yield of winter wheat and the detrended spei at the 1 month lag increases from the 1980s to the 1990s and then decreases from the 1990s to the 2000s on the contrary an opposite variation pattern was observed for the 12 month lag spei for the 3 and 6 month spei the greatest correlation was recorded in the 1990s followed by the 2000s fig 9 overall the correlations between the winter wheat syrs and detrended spei in the three subperiods are relatively stable indicating that the winter wheat yield is consistently influenced by drought these results are consistent with the aforementioned conclusion that the frequencies of winter and spring droughts increase based on fig 10 the correlation between the summer maize syrs and detrended spei during the summer maize growing season at all time scales shows a substantial decrease except for the 1 month lag this result indicates a less pronounced influence of droughts on the summer maize yield which may be related to rational allocation of water resources and progress in the drought resistance as reported in a previous study geng et al 2018 the evolution of drought episodes from summer and autumn droughts in the 1980s to autumn and winter droughts in the 1990s and to the winter and spring droughts in recent years in the ncp leads to similar results these findings reveal that the agricultural drought risk increased in the winter wheat growing season but decreased in the summer maize growing season from 1982 to 2013 in the ncp 3 7 features and uncertainties based on our experiments and results the pattern of drought episodes in the ncp shows a notable spatiotemporal variation the monthly detrended spei has a relatively strong association with important crop production stages which is in agreement with the conclusion in hlavinka et al 2009 several important features can be summarized based on our study first we calculated the spei based on the p m model rather than the thornthwaite method because the p m model provides a better estimate of the potential evapotranspiration and has been adopted by several international organizations jiang et al 2015 bai et al 2016 second we considered the drought evolution based on both different crop growing seasons and different crop growth stages a different drought evolution was determined when considering those factors finally one of the most important contributions of this study is that we identified the correlation between winter wheat yield and spei based on the actual growing season from october of the previous year to june of the following year instead of the a whole calendar year january to december the approach based on the entire calendar year results in uncertainties related to overwintering crop which was likely ignored or simplified in previous studies e g potopová et al 2015 the authors would like to note that this study has limitations for example the current experiments only consider climate variability conditions without anthropogenic influences such as farmer s adaptations to drought conditions irrigation and changing crops however the records required to conduct such analyses were very limited there are other uncertainties associated with the analysis of the evolution of the drought and its impact on crop yield based on the statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2014 the average irrigation ratio for the henan shandong and hebei provinces between 2000 and 2013 is 61 40 64 05 and 68 68 respectively thus most of the winter wheat and summer maize agricultural farms 60 in the ncp are irrigation areas which poses challenges on linking the drought indices to real agricultural impacts and on our ability of monitoring the drought impact on a specific cropping system however this does not affect our conclusions that droughts are closely related to the variability of winter wheat and summer maize fig 7 and can significantly threaten the food security in the ncp although the crop yield may be higher in a dry year if irrigation water is applied the amount of crop failure in an extreme drought year is large for example a severe summer of droughts occurred in the ncp in 2014 which resulted in a great amount of crop reduction or total crop failure due to water deficiency cai et al 2015 based on the increased amount of water consumption in various industrial and agricultural sectors the streamflow reduction in the yellow river and the continuously decreasing groundwater table in the ncp irrigation agriculture will be facing an even greater challenge in the future because long term regional crop yield data are rather limited in china one limitation of this study is that the conclusion of this study only applies to the province level of china however the sensitively analysis presented in this study already has a finer resolution than previous studies it might be possible to capture the detailed relationship between the drought and crop yield using a concept similar to that presented in this study if regional i e farm city or county level crop yield data become available in china another concern about the spatial resolution is that each province in china covers diverse climate regions therefore uncertainty exists in the current study because we assume spatial heterogeneity with respect to climate in the ncp for example although we found that the winter wheat production risk increased while summer maize production risk decreased these results were based on the assumption that the whole ncp has a uniform risk level the risk level of each province requires further verification lastly it is worth mentioning that other factors such as flooding insects reservoir operation climate anomaly policy or economics can also notably influence the crop yield zhang et al 2016 siad et al 2017 yang et al 2017b c nevertheless our study aims to link theoretical analysis of drought impacts to practical issues related to crop variability and different growing stages and seasonality in the ncp this is an important step to improve the understanding of the impact of droughts on the agriculture system worldwide the authors also suggest that future studies should focus on field experiment analysis such as drought impact monitoring and well designed crop growth process models the goal is to better understand the detail mechanism of drought impact on crop yields and to develop better prediction methods to quantify the crop failure under different drought conditions both at different regional and spatial domains 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the evolution of drought in the ncp and its impact on the winter wheat and summer maize yields from 1982 to 2013 our results indicate an overall drought trend and a wetting trend during the winter wheat growing season in the henan and shandong provinces respectively the wetting trend was dominant in the ncp during the growing season of summer maize at all 1 3 6 and 12 month scales moreover the drought episodes clearly revealed that the evolution of drought has changed from the summer and autumn droughts in the 1980s to autumn and winter droughts in the 1990s and to winter and spring droughts in the recent decades in the ncp in china our results also indicate that the year to year variations of the detrended spei can explain the extensive fluctuations in the yields of both winter wheat and summer maize in the ncp however considerable differences in the responses of the crops yield to different lags of the spei were observed the most correlated time scale increased with the advancement of the winter wheat growth stage finally the correlations between the winter wheat syrs and detrended spei in three subperiods are relatively stable whereas the correlations between the summer maize syrs and detrended spei show a substantial decrease at all time scales except for the 1 month lag although the above mentioned results only consider climate variability conditions without anthropogenic influences and are based on the whole ncp they lead to an improved understanding of the drought evolution in the ncp in recent decades and hence provide stakeholders with references to design future drought mitigation plans

7111,the understanding of the impact of drought on the agricultural ecosystem is key to minimize drought related yield losses in this study we analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought events in the north china plain ncp based on the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and investigated the impact of drought on winter wheat and summer maize yields the results indicate an overall drought and wetting trend during the winter wheat growing season in the henan and shandong provinces respectively a significant wetting trend was detected in the ncp during the summer maize growing season at the 1 3 6 and 12 month scales moreover the drought episodes clearly reveal that the drought pattern has changed from summer and autumn droughts in the 1980s to autumn and winter droughts in the 1990s and to winter and spring droughts in the recent decade our results also show that the annual variations in the detrended spei can explain extensive fluctuations associated with both winter wheat and summer maize yields in the ncp furthermore considerable differences in the relationship between agricultural crop yields and the spei time series with different lags were observed the most correlated time scale increases with the advancement of the winter wheat growth stage the correlations between the winter wheat standardized yield residuals series syrs and detrended spei in three subperiods are consistently high and stable whereas a substantial decrease of the correlation was observed at all time scales for summer maize except for the 1 month lag our findings can help to better understand the drought evolution in the ncp in recent decades and hence provide stakeholders with references for the design of future drought mitigation plans keywords

water and food security threats and may lead to crop yield failure and financial challenges worldwide aghakouchak et al 2015 hao and singh 2015 zhao and running 2010 because of global warming droughts have occurred more frequently and larger areas in recent years liu et al 2015 wu et al 2013 2015 generally droughts can be classified into meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic droughts american meteorological society 2004 heim 2002 zhang et al 2015a b all drought types can be associated with a sustained precipitation deficit however different elements of the hydrologic cycle respond differently to drought aghakouchak et al 2015 this study only focuses on agricultural drought which is defined as the lack of soil moisture in a region for a certain period of time it is well known that china is one of the most densely populated agricultural countries in the world and agriculture plays a central role in ensuring food security in china piao et al 2010 drought hazards occur with increasing frequency and continuously in different regions of china and have a severe impact on crop yields wang et al 2014 the north china plain ncp is one of the main production areas of agriculture and one of the most drought prone areas in china thus this study focuses on the investigation of the impacts of the drought conditions on two main crops in the ncp winter wheat and summer maize a better understanding of the drought conditions in the ncp and their impacts is a key to minimize drought related yield losses and mitigate the food security threat in china over the past several decades drought has been the greatest threat to farmers cultivating field crops in many parts of the world du et al 2013 lobell et al 2011 potopová et al 2015 assessing the effects of drought on agriculture may help individuals and societies to properly anticipate these effects and adapt farming to maximize agricultural production fischer et al 2005 madadgar et al 2017 thus research on the effects of droughts on the crop yield has become a core issue related to comprehensive prevention and mitigation of disasters asseng et al 2013 chmielewski et al 2000 potop et al 2012 2014 numerous studies in the literature focused on the examination of the influence of climate extremes on the crop yield worldwide using both statistical methods and physical models alexandrov and hoogenboom 2000 hlavinka et al 2009 lobell and field 2007 olesen et al 2011 potopová et al 2015 roudier et al 2011 schlenker and lobell 2010 yang et al 2017a trnka et al 2012 liu et al 2016 most of those studies highlighted that climate extremes are dominant with respect to the variability of crop yields however the reported relationship between climate variability and crop yield is not consistent it varies from region to region and from one type of crop to another type several studies discussed the impacts of droughts on the crop yield particularly in the ncp ming et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a b however most of those studies focused mainly on a certain crop type or did not consider the difference between overwintering crops and other crops in the correlation between drought indices in other words it was assumed in these studies that the ncp is a single crop yielding area however in reality different crops are grown in the ncp in a rotating manner such as winter wheat and summer maize it should be noted that overwintering crops are related to the drought conditions of both the previous year and current year which has rarely been studied furthermore both the decadal evolution of droughts in the ncp and the relationship between drought conditions and the rotation crops i e winter wheat and summer maize in the ncp are rarely reported but deserve further investigation it has been proposed that drought indices meet the needs for an accurately assessment of drought conditions liu et al 2016 mishra and singh 2010 previous studies have reported that the palmer drought severity index pdsi standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei have been most commonly used in recent years mckee et al 1993 palmer 1965 vicente serrano et al 2010 among these indices the recently developed spei seems to outperform the other two indices vicente serrano et al 2010 however it should be noted that every index has its own strengths and weaknesses in addition various drought indices will lead to different values and patterns if the study areas are at regional scales and have fine resolution núñez et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2012 we compared the performance of the three drought indices pdsi spi and spei that are used the most for monitoring of droughts in the ncp area it has been suggested that the spei and spi outperform the pdsi in agricultural systems liu et al 2018 note that the spei index not only considers the effect of temperature on droughts but is also flexible in monitoring droughts at different time scales potop et al 2012 because of spei processes more detailed information on the influence of droughts on different growth stages of the crop growth season can be captured moorhead et al 2015 potopová et al 2015 thus in this study we selected the spei as the drought index considering the effect of temperature induced evapotranspiration on droughts the primary purposes of this study were to analyze the evolution of drought in the ncp and its impact on the winter wheat and summer maize yields in the rotation growing regions of the ncp specifically three aspects of drought monitoring and impacts on crops yields in the ncp are addressed in this study i the annual and monthly variation of the spei at multiple time scales over the ncp from 1982 to 2013 ii the influence of spei on the crop yield which was studied by correlation analysis between the detrended spei and standardized yield residuals series syrs at various lags for winter wheat and summer maize respectively iii the changes of the relationship between the detrended spei and syrs during three decades of the study period 1982 1990 1991 2000 and 2001 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the ncp located between 32 n and 43 n and 113 e and 123 e is the second largest plain in china it mainly formed by the sedimentation and river sourcing effects of the yellow huaihe haihe and luanhe rivers the ncp region covers many highly populated areas including beijing tianjin hebei henan shandong jiangsu and anhui the ncp has a flat terrain with a fertile soil type as a result the ncp is the main producing area of agricultural crops and the main food production base in china rotational growing of winter wheat and summer maize is the major cropping pattern in the ncp region hu et al 2010 the cultivated land area in the ncp accounts for 27 9 of the total arable land in china the downstream region of the yellow river extends across the central ncp and divides it into two parts the haihe plain in the north and the huanghuai plain in the south climatically the ncp has a warm temperate semi humid continental monsoon climate precipitation in the ncp ranges between 400 and 600 mm annually and most of the rainfalls occurs in the summer season from june to august hu 2013 however the precipitation has significant interannual and intraannual variations in the ncp areas as a result frequent drought and flood events occur in the ncp among the frequent natural hazards influencing the ncp area drought is the most prominent one occurring nine times in ten years in this study we selected the most drought prone areas in the ncp including beijing tianjin hebei shandong and henan as shown in fig 1 2 2 climate dataset the meteorological datasets from 60 meteorological stations in the ncp for 1982 2013 consist of daily mean temperature daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed and precipitation the meteorological data were collected from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn to eliminate the impact of non climatic factors all data were selected after rigorous quality inspection and control including extreme value tests and a time consistency review missing data were filled by linear interpolation we calculated the potential evapotranspiration for each station based on the penman monteith method monteith 1965 allen et al 1998 penman 1948 using all climate data except for precipitation please refer to allen et al 2006 wu et al 2005 and bai et al 2016 for details about the calculation of the potential evapotranspiration we selected 1982 2013 as our study period because this period is associated with an acceleration of temperature changes which were recorded in the ncp 2 3 crop yield data the annual regional level winter wheat and summer maize yield data for the ncp from 1982 to 2013 were obtained from the statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2014 statistical analyses of the crop yield evolution and spei variability were conducted using the average crop yields derived from all districts in the ncp note that the observed crop yield increases may include effects of all of the following factors mavromatis 2007 sun et al 2012 such as the advances in agricultural technology fertilizer application new crop varieties and better management thus to eliminate the bias attributed to non climatic factors we removed the trend of the data using a linear regression when calculating the yield variability and then used the residuals of the detrended series of the crop yield for analysis to compare the yield variability among crops with different mean values and standard deviations the yield residuals were standardized for the detrended crop yield time series using the z score transformation we then obtained the syrs with mean and standard deviation values equal to zero and one respectively based on the standard normal distribution the syrs values between 0 5 and 0 5 1 0 and 0 5 1 5 and 1 0 and below 1 5 are classified as normal condition low yield loss condition moderate yield loss condition and high yield loss condition respectively potopová et al 2015 table 1 it is worth mentioning that the growing season for winter wheat in the ncp range from october of the previous year to june of the following year thus we recognized the growing season as this entire period in the analysis of the effect of droughts on the winter wheat yield the growing season of the summer maize in the study area is relatively shorter than that of winter wheat it ranges from june to october of the current year 2 4 methods 2 4 1 calculation of the spei the newly developed spei was used to characterize the drought evolution in the ncp from 1982 to 2013 the detailed steps for the calculation of the spei were as follows first we estimated the monthly potential evapotranspiration based on the climate data and p m model for all stations during the study period we then retrieved the monthly water balance by calculating the difference between monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration finally the monthly water balance data for all stations were put into the spei r package http cran r project org web packages spei to calculate the spei values at multiple time scales please refer to mckee et al 1993 and vicente serrano et al 2010 for more detailed information on the principle and definitions of spei 2 4 2 trend analysis the spei trend in the study area was calculated using sen trend analysis sen 1968 the significance of the trend was further examined using the mann kendall statistical test kendall 1948 the advantage of sen trend analysis is that this method does not require a specific sample distribution and is free from interferences of outliers therefore this method is robust and resistant to measurement and outlier data errors the equation is as follows β m e d i a n x j x i j i j i where β represents the spei trend i and j denote the time steps of the time series xi and xj denote the spei value at time i or j respectively β 0 suggests an increasing trend of the spei value wetting trend and β 0 suggests a decreasing spei trend drought trend 2 4 3 correlation analysis the impact of the spei variability on the yields of winter wheat and summer maize was evaluated based on correlations of the non parametric spearman s rho coefficient with a significance threshold of p 0 05 the trend of each of the spei time series at different time scales was removed before calculating the correlation with the syrs to investigate the impact of the spei on the crop yields in different time periods we analyzed the relationship between the crop yield and spei using the data of the entire study period and that of particular segments that is 1982 1990 1991 2000 and 2001 2013 3 results and discussions 3 1 multi scale drought patterns fig 2 illustrates regional scale evolutions of the spei during the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons with 1 24 accumulation periods between 1982 and 2013 drought and wet episodes were observed during the growing seasons of the winter wheat and summer maize during the winter wheat growing season the main and most severe drought and wet episodes occurred at the middle long time scale as indicated by the lag of the spei value ranging from 8 to 18 months moreover a significant period of drought was detected during the late 1990s however based on the spei values at multiple temporal scales the main wet episodes occurred in 1989 1990 and 2003 fig 2a a similar pattern of drought and wetness was observed during the summer maize growing season it should be mentioned that the ncp experienced a rapid shift from severe drought to severe wet episodes during the period of 1997 1998 with 1 to 12 month lags this change may be related to the severe el niño event that occurred during that period the main wet episodes of the summer maize growing season occurred in 1990 1991 and 2003 2004 in addition a short term drought was detected during the winter wheat growing season in 2010 whereas a middle term drought occurred during the summer maize growing season in 2011 fig 2b to provide detailed insights into the evolution of the drought wet conditions in different provinces we further analyzed the monthly time series of the spei at three representative stations capitals of each province in fig 1 of three provinces the multiannual variability of the spei for the three stations was determined only for the 3 month lag because this study mainly focuses on agricultural drought previous studies have also reported that the temporal evolution of the spei with a 3 month lag represents short and medium term moisture conditions and provides seasonal estimates of the climatic water balance and that the 3 month spei might more effectively highlight the available moisture in regions with intensive agriculture lloyd hughes 2012 potopová et al 2015 on a decadal scale the jinan station mainly had a significant prevalence of drought episodes expressed by the frequency of drought months during the 1980s fig 3 c while alternate wet and dry episodes occurred at the zhengzhou station fig 3b in the latter 5 year period in the 1990s all three stations exhibit an increasing trend in intensity in association with climate warming more wet episodes were identified in the first decade of the 21st century especially at the jinan station followed by the zhengzhou station however drought episodes prevailed over wet episodes at the zhengzhou station from 2010 to 2014 on the contrary more wet episodes were identified at the shijiazhuang station fig 3a alternate severe wet and dry episodes occurred at the jinan station 3 2 spatial pattern of drought in the ncp to better understand the recent changes in the drought frequency we calculated the percentage of drought months spei 1 for each station at 1 3 6 and 12 month lags and spatially interpolated the results fig s1 the results show that the drought frequency in the ncp area is consistent mainly ranging between 15 and 20 however spatial differences were observed at different time scales high values mainly occurred in the northeastern part of the hebei province western part of the henan province and middle part of shandong province at a 1 month scale with respect to the 3 month and 6 month lags the eastern part of shandong province became the most severely affected area the impacted area expanded further to the northern part of the hebei province at a 12 month lag we also obtained the trends of the spei during the winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons at different time lags for the ncp from 1982 to 2013 figs 4 and 5 notably opposite trends were captured between the henan and shandong provinces this relationship was particularly significant during the winter wheat growing season during the winter wheat growing season an overall drought trend was detected with high values in the northern and western parts of the henan province on the contrary a wetting trend was observed in the shandong province during the recent 30 years the magnitude of these trends gradually increased with increasing lag length this phenomenon suggests that the agricultural drought risk in the henan province has increased whereas the risk of droughts has been mitigated in the shandong province over the past 30 years based on our results regions with a dry tendency within the hebei province were distributed mainly in the northern area whereas regions with a wet tendency were observed mainly in the southern area during the summer maize growing season wetting trends were dominant in the ncp area indicating an overall decrease in the drought risk during the summer growing season however the drought risk in the northern southern and western parts of henan province remained it should be noted that the flood risk in the shandong province and increasing drought impact under global warming conditions should be studied in the future 3 3 frequency of droughts at the month scale fig 6 illustrates the monthly averaged percentage of drought over the ncp during different decades at 1 3 6 and 12 month lags the results suggest that the drought months depend on the accumulation period the drought months become equally distributed as the time scale increases for example the results detected by spei 12 were almost equally distributed this difference occurs because the short term spei reflects short term water deficit conditions and is sensitive and vulnerable to climate variability whereas the long term spei mainly reveals long term water deficit conditions in a certain region at the decadal scale the highest incidence of drought months was detected in the 1990s which is consistent with our previous results derived from fig 2 more importantly large differences were observed with respect to the annual distribution of drought months at short term lags of the spei values based on the spei 1 and spei 3 values the month with the highest frequency of drought is june in the 1980s followed by february and september in the 1990s whereas the spring drought march and april prevailed in the 21st century these results clearly show that the drought conditions in the ncp have evolved from summer and autumn droughts in the 1980s to autumn and winter droughts in the 1990s and to winter and spring droughts in the recent decade this phenomenon imposes serious challenges on the growth of winter wheat but suggests a reduced drought risk of the summer maize production it is worth mentioning that these conclusions were derived from the entire ncp area detailed patterns for each province that could be used to develop province level drought mitigation plans would require further exploration it is possible that each regional area has a different spei trend than that obtained for the entire ncp area as shown in figs 4 and 5 3 4 evolution of the standardized yield residual series based on our results the yields of both winter wheat and summer maize exhibit a significant increase from 1982 to 2013 with a linear increment of 95 69 and 74 43 kg y respectively the yields considerably increased from 1982 to 1995 which could be the result of improved technologies for crop production the yield increase of winter wheat and summer maize from 1982 to 1995 was 100 84 and 127 99 kg y respectively however extensive fluctuations of both crop yields were observed during 1995 2004 when drought episodes occurred simultaneously figs 2 and 3 statistical analyses indicate that 66 7 of the total drought years for winter wheat in the recent 30 years occurred after the year 2000 whereas the percentage for summer maize is 50 after 2000 the yields of both winter wheat and summer maize exhibit a continuous increase with a linear increment of 83 71 and 80 68 kg y respectively fig s2 to exclude non climatic factors that may influence the crop yield we further analyzed the temporal evolution of the syrs from 1982 to 2013 based on the threshold values listed in table 1 the years with high yield losses of winter wheat were 1982 and 2002 whereas they were 1986 1997 and 2003 for summer maize the years with moderate yield losses of winter wheat were 1988 and 2001 whereas the years were 2002 and 2004 for summer maize the year 2003 followed by 1997 ranks the highest in terms of crop failure of summer maize in the ncp it is worth to point out that clearly opposite trends were observed for winter wheat and summer maize whereby the winter wheat exhibits a high yield increment but the summer maize is associated with a high yield loss fig 7 a to investigate the possible reason for the failure of the summer maize yields we further analyzed the intraannual variation of the spei in 1997 with lags from 1 to 12 months fig 7b the spei exhibits a drought episode during the summer maize growing season june to october at all the time scales while wet conditions were detected during the winter wheat growing season october of the former year to june of the following year this phenomenon could explain why crop yield failure of summer maize occurred in 1997 it further demonstrates the severe impact of drought on crop yields in addition clear differences between the onsets of drought based on different time lags were observed in other words the short term spei detects the onset of drought sooner than the long term spei and recovers to normal even faster than the long term spei for example the onset of drought in 1997 was detected in the middle of may by the 1 month lag spei but it was detected two months later by the 12 month lag spei in addition the 1 month spei recovered to normal conditions in the middle of october whereas the 12 month lag spei did not recover until the next year thus there is a significant advantage of short term drought warning information in agricultural production practices the methods demonstrated in this study could be beneficial to develop appropriate timely measures for drought mitigation plans for winter wheat and summer maize in the ncp of china 3 5 analysis of the correlation between spei and syrs in the previous section we spatially and temporally analyzed the drought frequency and drought and yield evolution of winter wheat and summer maize in the ncp given the fact that the time scales at which different crop types respond to drought may notably differ ozturk and aydin 2004 we further analyze the effects of droughts on crop yields in this section fig 8 shows the spearman s rho correlation coefficients between the monthly detrended spei time series at 1 12 month lags and the syrs of winter wheat and summer maize from 1982 to 2013 it should be noted that winter wheat is an overwintering crop thus we calculated the correlation between the syrs and monthly detrended spei from october of the previous year to june of the following year the correlation period for summer maize ranges from june to october of the current year significant differences of the responses of the agricultural crops to different lags of the spei were identified a positive correlation was observed when drought conditions significantly influenced the crop yields indicating that the year to year variations of the crop production i e the syrs are related to the year to year variations of the detrended spei time series based on the phenological calendar of winter wheat in the ncp area the most sensitive period for winter wheat is the flowering april may followed by the period of jointing and heading drought conditions could cause substantial yield losses during the flowering period of winter wheat our results show a high sensitivity of the winter wheat yield to drought in may at 11 month lags furthermore the correlation coefficients between the syrs and drought in march and april at 9 to 12 month lags are consistently above 0 4 indicating that severe yield failure could be attributed to the spring drought similarly a less pronounced positive correlation was observed for october november and december and middle term droughts another interesting finding was that the most correlated time scale between the syrs and detrended spei in a certain month increases with the advancement of the winter wheat growth stage given that the crop yield is related to all growth stages in a growth cycle and that a later growth stage reflects a longer period of water deficit the correlation is more pronounced for long term droughts based on the phenological calendar of summer maize in the ncp the yields of summer maize were highly sensitive to drought conditions during the silking period this finding agrees with those of previous studies conducted by otegui et al 1995 our study indicates the short medium term droughts in july and august could have a serious impact on the summer maize yield in the ncp the highest correlation was recorded for the spei with 2 month lag in july and that with 3 month lag in august r 0 42 3 6 changes in the relationship between spei and syrs our results suggest that the crop yields might be significantly influenced by drought events however the correlation between the syrs and detrended spei change over time to better understand the relationship between the crop yield and spei we investigated the changes in the relationship between the syrs and detrended spei in three subperiods that is 1982 1990 1991 2000 and 2001 2013 the correlation coefficient between the yield of winter wheat and the detrended spei at the 1 month lag increases from the 1980s to the 1990s and then decreases from the 1990s to the 2000s on the contrary an opposite variation pattern was observed for the 12 month lag spei for the 3 and 6 month spei the greatest correlation was recorded in the 1990s followed by the 2000s fig 9 overall the correlations between the winter wheat syrs and detrended spei in the three subperiods are relatively stable indicating that the winter wheat yield is consistently influenced by drought these results are consistent with the aforementioned conclusion that the frequencies of winter and spring droughts increase based on fig 10 the correlation between the summer maize syrs and detrended spei during the summer maize growing season at all time scales shows a substantial decrease except for the 1 month lag this result indicates a less pronounced influence of droughts on the summer maize yield which may be related to rational allocation of water resources and progress in the drought resistance as reported in a previous study geng et al 2018 the evolution of drought episodes from summer and autumn droughts in the 1980s to autumn and winter droughts in the 1990s and to the winter and spring droughts in recent years in the ncp leads to similar results these findings reveal that the agricultural drought risk increased in the winter wheat growing season but decreased in the summer maize growing season from 1982 to 2013 in the ncp 3 7 features and uncertainties based on our experiments and results the pattern of drought episodes in the ncp shows a notable spatiotemporal variation the monthly detrended spei has a relatively strong association with important crop production stages which is in agreement with the conclusion in hlavinka et al 2009 several important features can be summarized based on our study first we calculated the spei based on the p m model rather than the thornthwaite method because the p m model provides a better estimate of the potential evapotranspiration and has been adopted by several international organizations jiang et al 2015 bai et al 2016 second we considered the drought evolution based on both different crop growing seasons and different crop growth stages a different drought evolution was determined when considering those factors finally one of the most important contributions of this study is that we identified the correlation between winter wheat yield and spei based on the actual growing season from october of the previous year to june of the following year instead of the a whole calendar year january to december the approach based on the entire calendar year results in uncertainties related to overwintering crop which was likely ignored or simplified in previous studies e g potopová et al 2015 the authors would like to note that this study has limitations for example the current experiments only consider climate variability conditions without anthropogenic influences such as farmer s adaptations to drought conditions irrigation and changing crops however the records required to conduct such analyses were very limited there are other uncertainties associated with the analysis of the evolution of the drought and its impact on crop yield based on the statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2014 the average irrigation ratio for the henan shandong and hebei provinces between 2000 and 2013 is 61 40 64 05 and 68 68 respectively thus most of the winter wheat and summer maize agricultural farms 60 in the ncp are irrigation areas which poses challenges on linking the drought indices to real agricultural impacts and on our ability of monitoring the drought impact on a specific cropping system however this does not affect our conclusions that droughts are closely related to the variability of winter wheat and summer maize fig 7 and can significantly threaten the food security in the ncp although the crop yield may be higher in a dry year if irrigation water is applied the amount of crop failure in an extreme drought year is large for example a severe summer of droughts occurred in the ncp in 2014 which resulted in a great amount of crop reduction or total crop failure due to water deficiency cai et al 2015 based on the increased amount of water consumption in various industrial and agricultural sectors the streamflow reduction in the yellow river and the continuously decreasing groundwater table in the ncp irrigation agriculture will be facing an even greater challenge in the future because long term regional crop yield data are rather limited in china one limitation of this study is that the conclusion of this study only applies to the province level of china however the sensitively analysis presented in this study already has a finer resolution than previous studies it might be possible to capture the detailed relationship between the drought and crop yield using a concept similar to that presented in this study if regional i e farm city or county level crop yield data become available in china another concern about the spatial resolution is that each province in china covers diverse climate regions therefore uncertainty exists in the current study because we assume spatial heterogeneity with respect to climate in the ncp for example although we found that the winter wheat production risk increased while summer maize production risk decreased these results were based on the assumption that the whole ncp has a uniform risk level the risk level of each province requires further verification lastly it is worth mentioning that other factors such as flooding insects reservoir operation climate anomaly policy or economics can also notably influence the crop yield zhang et al 2016 siad et al 2017 yang et al 2017b c nevertheless our study aims to link theoretical analysis of drought impacts to practical issues related to crop variability and different growing stages and seasonality in the ncp this is an important step to improve the understanding of the impact of droughts on the agriculture system worldwide the authors also suggest that future studies should focus on field experiment analysis such as drought impact monitoring and well designed crop growth process models the goal is to better understand the detail mechanism of drought impact on crop yields and to develop better prediction methods to quantify the crop failure under different drought conditions both at different regional and spatial domains 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the evolution of drought in the ncp and its impact on the winter wheat and summer maize yields from 1982 to 2013 our results indicate an overall drought trend and a wetting trend during the winter wheat growing season in the henan and shandong provinces respectively the wetting trend was dominant in the ncp during the growing season of summer maize at all 1 3 6 and 12 month scales moreover the drought episodes clearly revealed that the evolution of drought has changed from the summer and autumn droughts in the 1980s to autumn and winter droughts in the 1990s and to winter and spring droughts in the recent decades in the ncp in china our results also indicate that the year to year variations of the detrended spei can explain the extensive fluctuations in the yields of both winter wheat and summer maize in the ncp however considerable differences in the responses of the crops yield to different lags of the spei were observed the most correlated time scale increased with the advancement of the winter wheat growth stage finally the correlations between the winter wheat syrs and detrended spei in three subperiods are relatively stable whereas the correlations between the summer maize syrs and detrended spei show a substantial decrease at all time scales except for the 1 month lag although the above mentioned results only consider climate variability conditions without anthropogenic influences and are based on the whole ncp they lead to an improved understanding of the drought evolution in the ncp in recent decades and hence provide stakeholders with references to design future drought mitigation plans

7112,we analyze the diurnal cycle of maximum rainfall from 300 tcs from march 2014 through february 2017 by cross referencing the path of tropical cyclones tcs and high resolution rainfall estimates from imerg integrated multi satellite rainfall from gpm global precipitation measurement mission imerg is a gridded satellite product that offers high resolution rainfall estimates at a spatiotemporal resolution of 0 1 0 1 every 30 min which are particularly suitable for these analyses because of the nature of the data we use circular statistics circular statistics allows us to account for the natural periodicity of a random variable such as the time of the day at which maximum rainfall from tcs occurs we follow the non parametric approach of mixtures of von mises fisher distribution mvmf which enables an easy to interpret parameter identification of multimodal and anisotropic distributions of the tc rainfall we stratify our analysis by storm duration maturity and intensity basin of origin radial proximity to the center of the storm and whether the storm is over the ocean or land in general and across all scales we find that there are mainly two cycles of maximum tc rainfall one

14 and 18 h local time keywords tropical cyclones diurnal cycle rainfall circular statistics imerg 1 introduction tropical cyclones tcs are phenomena of paramount importance not only for the rain they produce but also for the havoc they unleash both in coastal and inland areas e g czajkowski et al 2017 khouakhi et al 2017 they are also considered the deadliest type of weather related disasters as the death toll from 2000 storms from 1995 through 2015 amounts to 242 000 fatalities unisdr and cred 2017 or 251 384 roughly equivalent to 40 of the total casualties from weather related disasters from 1980 to 2000 according to undp 2004 p 37 for instance in 2017 hurricane harvey brought almost 125 000 m3 of rain spread over four u s states fritz and samenow 2017 averaged over the houston area the lowest total precipitation in seven days brought by hurricane harvey was 700 2 mm which is more than double of any previous record 315 8 mm for seven days of rainfall between 1950 and 2016 risser and wehner 2017 put into perspective this amount of rainfall is the equivalent to the yearly average precipitation in houston burian and shepherd 2005 fritz and samenow 2017 overall hurricane harvey produced the largest rainfall ever recorded of any hurricane affecting the united states e g emanuel 2017 noaa wpc 2017 and samenow 2017 the number of fatalities caused by this storm is reported to be 80 people e g moravec 2017 van oldenborgh et al 2017 the impact exerted by tcs comes from the high wave storm surges extreme winds and floods and landslides associated with the torrential rains they produce e g mendelsohn et al 2012 peduzzi et al 2012 out of these three factors we devote our attention to the characterization of heavy rainfall from tcs given its direct relation to flooding which in the last two decades has affected 2 3 billion people unisdr and cred 2017 this is equivalent to 56 of the people affected by weather related disasters hence the characterization of heavy rainfall from tcs provides essential information to assess and evaluate the impact from landfalling tcs helping thus potential affected communities to be more resilient against such natural hazards several studies have focused on tc rainfall characterization for instance prat and nelson 2016 studied the contribution of tcs to extreme daily rainfall whereas prat and nelson 2013 established the contribution of tc rainfall to the seasonal precipitation totals for the southeastern united states jiang et al 2008 analyzed the rainfall distribution from landfalling tcs in the north atlantic basin all of the above studies were based on about one decade of satellite data lonfat et al 2004 and rios gaona et al 2018 are global studies in which tc rainfall is characterized and stratified by basin and intensity among other features also from global satellite data the focus of this work is to delve into the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall maxima the number of studies about the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall have grown in recent years due to the widespread development and availability of satellite rainfall estimates bowman and fowler 2015 carried out statistical analyses over 15 years of tmpa 3b42 tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis and ibtracs international best track archive for climate stewardship data to investigate the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall which they see as one potential component of precipitation variability in these storms wu et al 2015 studied the diurnal variations of oceanic tc rainfall in their inner core and outer rainbands their study was also based on 15 years 1998 2012 of tmpa 3b42 data 1401 tcs and focused only on oceanic storms i e beyond 300 km from coastlines leppert ii and cecil 2016 used trmm s microwave imager tmi and precipitation radar pr to study the diurnal cycle of 208 storms in the atlantic basin during the period 1998 2011 they stratified their analyses by radii from 100 to 1000 km every 100 km by intensity wind speed larger than 34 kt and 64 kt and by height 2 8 and 10 km more recently o neill et al 2017 examined cloud resolving tc simulations to understand the wavelike diurnal cycle responses on quasi steady tcs they found evidence of diurnal wave propagation in the upper troposphere in eddy temperature fields tang et al 2017 studied the sensitivity of hurricane secondary eyewall formation sef to solar insolation through a numerical simulation navarro et al 2017 determined the impact of periodic diurnal heating on a balanced vortex highlighting the importance of clouds the introductions of bowman and fowler 2015 leppert ii and cecil 2016 and o neill et al 2017 provide extensive literature and recounted details on the diurnal cycle of oceanic precipitation e g frank 1977 hai long et al 2013 of tc rainfall e g jiang et al 2011 wu et al 2015 and of cloud tops changes e g browner et al 1977 dunion et al 2014 kossin 2002 studies on the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall contribute to the characterization and understanding of tc rainfall variability from the diurnal insolation cycle on tcs such a variation is key to improve storm intensity prediction and tc modelling on global climate systems for instance our work advances the knowledge of the diurnal cycle of maximum tc rainfall because we use high resolution satellite data and circular statistics imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm global precipitation measurement mission is a follow up on almost two decades on continuous rainfall monitoring at global scales from trmm and its equivalent tmpa products huffman et al 2007 imerg is a gridded rainfall product with a spatiotemporal resolution of 0 1 0 1 every 30 min hou et al 2014 rainfall monitoring at high resolution from space nowadays serves as a key tool to develop and enhance societal applications such as fresh water availability flood forecasting landslide warning water borne disease propagation and storm tracking kirschbaum and patel 2016 stanley et al 2017 the main advantage with regard to storm tracking is that from global rainfall estimates such imerg one can track the precipitation path of such large scale storms that often are difficult to even quantify from ground based sensors like gauges and weather radars the ibtracs data set offers a detailed record of tc tracks and maximum sustained windspeed msw of all the tcs worldwide since 1842 and up to march 2017 by combining these two data sets we can obtain a detailed and accurate description of the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall from tcs this allows us to study the diurnal cycle of maximum rainfall for all the tcs 259 worldwide in a span of 3 years gpm launched its core satellite on february 2014 in addition to high resolution satellite data we use circular statistics which represents the appropriate statistical framework for analyses of this kind in circular statistics the data under analysis is represented as points over a unit circle which is the support for circular variables pewsey et al 2013 in a circular space all data is equally likely to be distributed over a segment equivalent to 2π this abstraction has the unique advantage to account for the intrinsic periodicity of circular and or directional variables such as time of the day at which rainfall occurs or the azimuthal direction of the maximum sustained windspeed of a hurricane for instance a basic example is that of the average of a random variable that took place at 01 00 and 23 00 for instance a linear analysis will tell us that the average time of such a random variable is 12 00 due to the proximity of 01 00 and 23 00 in a 24 h circular space the circular analysis will yield an average time of 00 00 which is a more correct approximation of the true nature of the random variable under analysis work on tc rainfall via circular statistics has not been carried out so far the common approach is to apply linear statistics to draw the cyclic patterns e g hu et al 2017 recent and related work on the implementation of circular analysis in hydrometeorological topics include those of dhakal et al 2015 masseran 2015 and villarini 2016 dhakal et al 2015 developed a non parametric circular statistics approach that optimizes the bandwidth s of a von mises distribution section 2 their approach assessed the non stationarity of 60 years of maximum daily precipitation at ten locations in the northeastern united states masseran 2015 used non parametric circular statistics to better characterize the wind regime in the northern region of borneo malaysia from almost one year of hourly wind direction data one station only they found that the finite mixture of von mises fisher approach section 2 systematically outperforms the one based on non negative trigonometric sums from annual maximum instantaneous peak discharges 7500 gage stations with at least 30 years of data villarini 2016 applied circular statistics to study the seasonality of flooding across the continental united states other examples of developments and implementations of circular statistics in earth sciences including mixtures of von mises fisher probability density functions mvmf pdfs include those by lark et al 2014 and oliveira et al 2012 to the best of our knowledge our work is the first of its kind that offers a comprehensive and quantitative characterization of the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall maxima analyzed via the circular statistics framework a detailed presentation of the theoretical framework of circular statistics is beyond the scope of this paper for that matter we point the interested reader to previous works carried out by fisher 1993b mardia 1972b mardia and jupp 2000 and pewsey et al 2013 where deep and comprehensive formulations details and references on the theory of circular statistics can be found our approach relies on the r packages movmf hornik and grün 2014 circular agostinelli and lund 2017 and directional tsagris et al 2017 r is a computing language and environment for statistical analysis r core team 2018 we stratify our analysis by tc duration maturity and intensity basin of origin distance from the center and whether the storm is over the ocean or land a thorough analysis of yet another characteristic of tc rainfall such as the diurnal cycle of maximum tc rainfall gets us closer to more realistic representations and models of the rainfall associated with tcs we consider our approach a better assessment of the diurnal cycle because not only the available high resolution data we use but also the circular framework offers a more accurate and appropriate approach for the statistical description of tc rainfall maxima this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the data we use and introduces the conceptual framework of circular statistics and its implementation section 3 presents the results and discussion alongside summary and conclusions are provided in section 4 2 data and methodology our data set is similar to that of rios gaona et al 2018 in which they analyzed 166 tcs for the period of march 2014 through march 2016 hence the analysis comes from the merging of two data sets ibtracs and imerg v04 final the ibtracs v03r10 is a worldwide collection of tc best track data knapp et al 2010 developed by the national climatic data center ncdc jointly with the world data center for meteorology it is a comprehensive project that gathers information from all the regional specialized meteorological centers rsmcs and tropical cyclone warning centres tcwcs members of the world meteorological organization wmo and other national agencies ibtracs data is freely available from the server ftp eclipse ncdc noaa gov pub ibtracs the ibtracs data set contains several attributes or variables one of them is the seven basins in which the earth s surface is divided into from a tc perspective north atlantic na eastern pacific ep western pacific wp northern indian ocean ni southern indian ocean si south pacific sp and south atlantic sa attributes such as msw the time at landfall if available and the longitude and latitude of the storm centers from which later we interpolate the tc track at 30 minute resolution are also included in this data set the temporal resolution of ibtracs is 6 hourly 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 utc imerg is a gridded rainfall product level 3 from the gpm mission this high resolution product provides rainfall intensities with a spatiotemporal resolution of 0 1 0 1 every 30 minuntes between 60 n and 60 s it is obtained by processing i e intercalibration merging and spatiotemporal interpolation all the microwave precipitation estimates available from the gpm constellation huffman et al 2017b imerg also incorporates infrared data from geostationary satellites and it is calibrated with global gauge analyses of precipitation schneider et al 2015a b with three flavors imerg products are developed to address different user requirements of latency and accuracy i e early run near real time late run reprocessed near real time and final run post real time up to the publication date of this manuscript imerg transitioned to v05 version 05 huffman et al 2018 nevertheless technical insights on imerg and its update imerg v04 final can still be found in huffman et al 2017a b c the availability of imerg final run goes from 12 march 2014 to the present with a latency of four months this availability limits the number of tcs that one can potentially analyze imerg products contain several attributes subsets we only focus on the precipitationcal subset which offers the most accurate rainfall estimates from here onwards we refer to imerg v04 final run precipitationcal only as imerg gpm rainfall datasets are freely available at the nasa with national aeronautics and space administration with portal http pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm any circular variable or observation represented as a unit vector x is equivalent to the complex number z e i θ cos θ i sin θ where i 1 such a unit vector can be placed in the complex plane with its real component cos θ on the horizontal axis and its imaginary component i sin θ on the vertical axis for a graphic interpretation consult mardia and jupp 2000 fig 2 1 and pewsey et al 2013 fig 3 1 summary statistics such as the sample mean direction θ and resultant length r and circular variance v can be computed from circular data on the complex plane the sample mean direction indicates the direction of the mean resultant unit vector of the sample pewsey et al 2013 ch 3 it is given by θ tan 1 b a 0 2 π where b j 1 n sin θ j n 1 and a j 1 n cos θ j n 1 only valid for a b 0 θ j represents the angle of a unit vector j with regard to the chosen zero north and n the sample size as noted by pewsey et al 2013 ch 3 the sample mean direction is a good measure of central location for unimodal samples that are close to symmetric the sample mean resultant length is defined by r b 2 a 2 0 1 and it is used as a measure of concentration for unimodal circular data pewsey et al 2013 ch 3 if all the unit vectors j are identical then r 1 conversely the more r approaches 0 the more evenly spread around the unit circle the data is a particular case where r 0 may imply that all unit vectors cancel each other out meaning that they all are evenly directed in the complex plane the sample circular variance is defined as v 1 r 0 1 κ is the concentration parameter equivalent to the reliability σ 2 of a normal distribution murray and morgenstern 2010 it can be obtained by linear interpolation from tabulated values of r e g mardia 1972b p 298 table appendix 2 3 or n and r e g mardia and jupp 2000 p 364 table appendix 2 5 several tests have been developed to evaluate or infer the uniformity and symmetry conditions of the sample pewsey et al 2013 ch 5 strongly recommend the rayleigh test for departure from uniformity in unimodal circular distributions for multimodal departures from uniformity they advise omnibus tests such as kuiper s v n watson s u 2 and rao s spacing test for instance all the previous tests are for continuous circular data i e data not grouped into bins dhakal et al 2015 noticed that while the rayleigh is a powerful test against unimodal alternatives of uniformity but not against multimodal alternatives as suggested by pewsey et al 2013 the rao s spacing and kuiper s v n tests are consistent against unimodal and multimodal alternatives of uniformity a parametric bootstrap adaptation of the watson s u 2 test is one alternative to test the goodness of fit of a specified distribution agostinelli and lund 2017 tsagris et al 2017 a sample can also be tested for two types of symmetry on the unit circle reflective symmetry and ℓ fold symmetry a distribution is reflectively symmetric about an angle θ if the reflection of the distribution over such an angle is identical to the original distribution pewsey et al 2013 ch 4 if a distribution is identical to the original distribution after being rotated through an angle 2 π ℓ such a distribution is said to be ℓ fold symmetric for simplicity we only test for reflective symmetry a mathematical description of all these tests is beyond the scope of the present work still we perform all of the above mentioned tests section 3 to improve on the summary statistics and gain a better perspective on the underlying distribution from which the sample is potentially drawn our data exhibits multimodality fig 1 therefore we follow the approach of a finite mixture of unimodal von mises fisher mvmf distributions non parametric approaches e g mvmf offer more complex alternatives to account for the multimodality and asymmetry of irregular samples the von mises distribution is a classic model in circular statistics and it is considered the equivalent to the normal distribution model for linear data fisher 1993b pewsey et al 2013 ch 4 it is also the most common and more investigated approach given its easy to interpret parameters pewsey et al 2013 ch 4 the cardiod wrapped cauchy von mises jones pewsey family and inverse batschelet family models are alternative unimodal distributions developed to fit continuous circular data for more details see pewsey et al 2013 ch 4 as clearly presented and explained by qin et al 2016 see also dhillon and sra 2003 hornik and grün 2014 the d variate von mises fisher distribution of a d dimensional unit random vector x for x r d in the unit hypersphere s d 1 and x 1 follows the probability density function 1 f x μ κ c d κ exp κ μ t x in eq 1 κ for κ 0 is the concentration parameter that quantifies how tightly the distribution is around the mean direction μ for μ 1 μ t x is the cosine similarity between x and μ i e cos x μ for x and μ expressed in radians and c d κ is a normalizing constant defined as c d κ κ d 2 1 2 π d 2 i d 2 1 κ where 2 i d 2 1 κ s 0 1 s γ s d 2 1 1 κ 2 2 s d 2 1 in eq 2 i d 2 1 κ is the infinite series form arfken et al 2013 eq 14 99 of the modified bessel function of the first kind with order d 2 1 and argument κ and γ s d 2 1 1 s d 2 1 the gamma function in our case d 2 and the d variate von mises fisher distribution eq 1 reduces to the von mises distribution for the unit circle fisher 1993a mardia 1972a pewsey et al 2013 the simplest and most common approach in multimodal probability density functions for circular statistics is that of a finite mixture of von mises fisher mvmf which is given by e g qin et al 2016 f x α μ κ h 1 h h 1 h α h f x μ h κ h for 3 0 α h 1 and α h 1 in eq 3 α h is the mixing proportion of the h unimodal von mises fisher distributions pdfs this equation has no analytical solution hence its parameters are computed via maximum likelihood estimates under an expectation maximization framework banerjee et al 2005 dhillon and sra 2003 the interested reader is pointed to the numerical solution implemented by hornik and grün 2014 given that is from the r package movmf that we compute the parameters α h μ h κ h of the assumed mvmf pdfs an objective assessment of the optimal best mixture number of h unimodal von mises fisher distributions is that of akaike s or bayesian information criterion aic or bic respectively pewsey et al 2013 p 114 ch 6 the idea behind these criteria is to select the least complex of all models providing equally good fits i e parsimony we use the bic criterion to select the number of distributions for a given mvmf pdfs as with rios gaona et al 2018 we downscaled ibtracs attributes to 30 minute imerg native resolution we interpolated the 6 hour tc centers to 30 minute resolution via cubic spline interpolation of latitudes and longitudes hence the interpolated tc centers are not absolutely accurate nevertheless the variability generated by such a method has no practical effect on the radii averaged precipitation bowman and fowler 2015 for every 30 minute tc center we extracted imerg rainfall up to a radius of 1000 km every 7 km from the tc center outwards i e 0 km 7 km 14 km for each radius we averaged all the rainfall depth from the tc center up to the radius under consideration following bowman and fowler 2015 and wu et al 2015 we compute the local time lst t lst of all radii as the difference from their utc t utc with regard to their longitude λ 180 180 i e t lst t utc λ 12 180 for each storm we select the lsts at which all maximum rainfall averages occur we stratify our analysis into six categories storm duration storm development storm intensity basin of origin radial proximity to the tc center and surface land or ocean the basin of origin and surface categories are entirely based on the coordinates of the tc center a tc is considered to be over land if its center is geographically located over land regardless of its proximity to the shore we define three radial intervals to further stratify our analysis of maximum rainfall with regard to its proximity to the tc center the storm duration category is based on the day relative to the storm beginning from which a lst or maximum tc rainfall was sampled whereas the storm development category is based on the quartile from which a given lst was sampled the intensity category is based on the msw of the storm for a given center the msw for a given 30 minute tc center corresponds to the previous 6 hourly step stored in the ibtracs we re categorized the tc intensity into four categories based on the saffir simpson hurricane scale sshs simpson 1974 for msw 64 kt 33 1 m s 1 ts for 64 msw 96 kt 33 1 msw 49 4 m s 1 cat12 for msw 96 kt cat35 and extra tropical cyclones et 3 results and discussion the summary statistics for the sample of 1024 unit vectors that represent the lsts at which maximum precipitation per storm for all the 259 tcs under analysis occurs are θ 1 952 h or 0 5111 rad sample mean direction r 0 131 sample mean resultant length and v 0 8693 sample circular variance the concentration parameter κ is 0 26375 bear in mind that as the sample of average rainfall per tc is really large multiple radii per several tc centers each storm can potentially have several rainfall estimates of equal maximum value especially if one uses up to two significant figures digits in the rounding up this is why in this case we have a 1024 maximum sample for 259 tcs the p value for the rayleigh was 0 which indicates the rejection of the null hypothesis of uniformity the p values for the kuiper s v n watson s u 2 and rao s spacing tests were smaller than 0 01 0 01 and 0 001 respectively which led us to the rejection of the null hypothesis of uniformity the goodness of fit test for the grouped data as presented in fig 1 a i e 6 min bins yielded p values of 0 026 and 0 743 for the null hypotheses of uniform and von mises distribution respectively therefore the null hypothesis of a uniform distribution that fits the sample is rejected with a 2 6 significance level the p value for the reflective symmetry test was 0 053 which implies the rejection of the null hypothesis of an assumed reflectively symmetric distribution at the 5 3 significance level the result of all these tests jointly with a visual evaluation of fig 1 a suggests that a priori assumptions of isotropy unimodality and reflective symmetry do not hold for our sample hence we must turn to non parametric circular statistics to evaluate and quantify the multimodality present in the diurnal cycle of maximum tc rainfall fig 1 for instance fig 1 a shows the distribution of the 1024 samples for tc rainfall maxima grouped into 6 min bins in both distributions either continuous or stacked one can see how the data is not equally distributed over the circular space anisotropy and multimodality maximum tc rainfall tends to concentrate roughly around five times i e 2 5 10 14 and 22 h and somewhat spread between 15 and 21 h 18 h average this figure also highlights how summary statistics are misleading if some a priori knowledge on the type of distribution is not known in section 2 we established the mvmf distributions as the appropriate approach for a non parametric multimodal fitting given its easy to interpret parameters a visual inspection of fig 1 a reveals that most likely a mixture of 5 vmf pdfs should be sufficient to describe well the sample distribution fig 1 c shows the bic values for different number of unimodal vmf pdfs mixtures six is the optimal number of unimodal vmf pdf for the overall distribution i e no stratification implemented as seen from fig 1 a a single unimodal vmf pdf is not suitable to identify the diurnal cycle on the other hand an 8 mvmf pdf offers a quite detailed and parametrized distribution at the expenses of parsimony nevertheless fig 1 c tells us that only 6 vmf pdfs are necessary to accurately account for the multimodality of the sample s distribution and thus to identify the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall this can be seen from fig 1 a on how the continuous dark blue curve 6 vmf pdfs simply and accurately comprises the information gathered by the continuous green curve 8 vmf pdfs fig 1 c also shows the bic values for the stratification of tc rainfall maxima given the intensity category i e ts green curve cat12 blue curve cat35 pink curve and et gold curve the optimal mixture for each of these distributions is 6 6 5 and 2 respectively this optimal fit can also be seen in fig 1 b in which the mvmf pdfs are plotted over the binned sample distribution of each intensity category numerical solutions for small size samples often yield large values of κ which consequently yield infinite values of probability f x μ κ eq 1 hence the mvmf pdfs here presented e g table 1 correspond to the lowest possible bic obtained from 1 to 9 components for which all of its unimodal vmf pdfs are finite and or defined the four predominant mean times μ s of the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall maxima are 2 22 5 20 9 88 and 21 75 h fig 1 a and table 1 all rows these times account for the largest κ s and α s i e the concentration parameter and mixing proportion of each unimodal vmf distribution which describe 72 of the mvmf pdf of tc rainfall maxima about 22 of the distribution is described by the mean direction μ 17 80 h which is spread between 15 and 21 h this distribution has the lowest concentration parameter κ 2 36 which is an indication of how sparse the sample is around its μ the remaining 6 belongs to μ 14 02 h with a high κ despite its lowest contribution to the mvmf pdf hence it seems that there are two main cycles of rainfall maxima in tcs one with mean directions μ of 9 88 and 21 75 h note the 12 h of difference referred to as the 10 22 h diurnal cycle the other with mean directions of 2 22 and 5 20 h referred to as the 2 5 h or 22 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle this latter is also perceived although very slightly in the afternoon hours i e 14 18 h or 10 14 18 h semi diurnal cycle navarro et al 2017 showed a cycle in storm intensity that reaches its peak in the early hours of the morning and lags a periodic response of 6 h from latent heat their results suggests that the axisymmetric tc diurnal cycle is primarily a balanced response driven by periodic heating such a signal is a function of the local solar time which can helps to explain our similar results regardless of stratification by basin or type of surface navarro et al 2017 also hint at the extension of the cycles arguing that long diurnal periods exhibit a more balanced solution with greater impact on the storm intensity whereas short diurnal periods project onto inertia buoyancy waves radiating energy away from the region of heating the general all mvmf pdf is quite representative of the samples over the ocean as 97 4 of all tc rainfall maxima correspond to tc centers located over ocean this can be seen from fig 2 f all and ocean curves and from the very similar mvmf pdf parameters in table 1 all and ocean rows for maximum tc rainfall from tc centers located inland its mean direction is 2 06 h with κ 0 45 table 1 land rows even though nothing conclusive can be inferred or concluded from such a small sample 2 6 of data it is widely known that tcs weaken as they move inland which complicates the identification of a diurnal cycle for inland maximum tc rainfall nesbitt and zipser 2003 found that tropical rainfall peaks in the early morning to predawn hours over the ocean whereas over land on average precipitation peaks in the afternoon especially in non mesoscale convective systems according to dai 2001 and wu et al 2015 convective precipitation over land tends to peak in the late afternoon to early evening hours most likely to a direct response to daytime heating of the surface and the planetary boundary layer whereas over oceans the peak is reached in the early morning hours they did not explore ocean land stratification though on the other hand bowman and fowler 2015 carried out an ocean land basin and intensity stratification they suggested that either the tc land interaction landfall has little incidence on the diurnal behavior of the storms or that as storms move inland they retain their oceanic pattern cycle until the land fraction is too large for this pattern to be present more generally bowman and fowler 2015 found a diurnal variation of tc rainfall with peak rainfall at 06 00 lst and a minimum at 18 00 lst although our results do show a lag of 12 h for both diurnal and semi diurnal cycles our results do not show maxima at 06 00 lst but rather at 9 88 h lst or even at 5 20 h nevertheless and as seen in table 1 all rows several maxima are scattered around μ 17 80 h a different and larger sample i e 15 years of tmpa 3b42 data and an alternative approach i e characterization of the diurnal cycle of rainfall in terms of fourier harmonics by sines and cosines fitting via least squares regression may be the reasons behind the discrepancy between our maxima 9 88 h and the one 06 00 of bowman and fowler 2015 such diurnal cycles of oceanic precipitation with maxima in early morning hours bowman and fowler 2015 are common in studies such as gray and jacobson jr 1977 kraus 1963 and serra and mcphaden 2004 just to cite a few jiang et al 2011 also performed an ocean land stratification in which they found two peaks for the diurnal variation of tc rainfall over land one at 01 30 07 30 lst and the other one at 16 30 19 30 lst minimum at 10 30 13 30 lst they also found maximum tc rainfall at 04 30 07 30 lst and minimum 19 30 22 30 lst for non stratified analyses as seen from fig 2 f and table 1 all rows the maximum by jiang et al 2011 is consistent with the second peak of the 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle i e μ 5 20 1 h with regard to our land stratification our results showed an absence of any diurnal cycle table 1 by surface rows and fig 2 f radial stratification as suggested by bowman and fowler 2015 is an alternative to reduce the impact on the diurnal cycle amplitude of averaged tc rainfall involving potentially non raining areas at large radii nevertheless a sensitivity analysis carried out by wu et al 2015 indicates that the decrease in average rainfall and diurnal variation in the outer rainbands is not attributable to such non raining averages short living storms only develop a semi diurnal cycle whereas intermediate and long lasting tcs develop stable diurnal and semi diurnal cycles of maximum rainfall a temporal stratification of maximum tc rainfall with regard to the number of days a given tc lasts shows that for short living tcs namely tcs that last up to five days there is mainly a 10 22 h diurnal cycle fig 2 a its μ s are clustered around 9 90 and 21 52 h with κ s of 98 15 and 65 51 respectively table 1 by duration rows fig 2 a also shows a 10 14 h semi diurnal cycle μ 14 01 with κ 73 61 for long lasting storms and a much less marked one κ 3 47 for short living storms as we show later this 10 14 h semi diurnal cycle is mainly characteristic of tcs developed in the wp basin fig 2 d intermediate and long lasting storms i e tcs lasting more than 10 days follow a similar dynamic in terms of both diurnal and semi diurnal cycles their 10 22 h diurnal cycles show μ s of 9 89 and 9 87 h and 21 77 and 21 76 h respectively for intermediate and long lasting tcs as the storm lasts longer e g more than 10 days maximum tc rainfall seems to be more concentrated at the end of the diurnal cycle than at its beginning this can be seen from the larger values of κ i e 60 14 and 116 60 at 22 h than those of 108 12 and 67 88 at 10 h table 1 by duration rows and fig 2 a intermediate and long lasting tcs have similar 22 2 5 h semi diurnal cycles i e μ s of 2 20 and 5 74 h for intermediate tcs and μ s of 2 23 and 4 97 h for long lasting tcs a second temporal stratification showed that as the storms reach their end maximum tc rainfall develops earlier in the day rather than later when the duration of all tcs were stratified into quartiles the first quartile i e the first 25 of any storm fig 2 b light blue curve and supplemental fig 2 q1 distinctively showed one diurnal 10 22 h cycle μ s of 9 86 and 21 72 h and two semi diurnal cycles which are distinctively marked around the μ s of 2 42 and 14 15 h the 5 h or 17 h component of the semi diurnal cycle does not fully develop for this quartile supplemental fig 2 q1 bear in mind that 22 and 2 h μ s are only characteristic of intermediate and long lasting storms fig 2 a the κ s for this first quartile are larger for 22 2 h i e 92 50 and 511 50 than for 10 14 h i e 76 98 and 40 06 this implies a larger concentration of maximum tc rainfall during night 22 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle than day hours 10 14 18 h semi diurnal cycle as the storms develop i e 2nd and 3rd quartiles the larger concentration of maximum tc rainfall shifts from 22 to 10 h fig 2 b or supplemental fig 2 q2 or q3 shows how the μ s for the 2nd and 3rd quartiles i e 9 90 and 9 87 h respectively present larger κ s 85 41 and 96 25 than those for the μ s of 21 66 and 21 83 h κ s of 91 63 and 51 08 respectively for the 2nd and 3rd quartiles it appears that the 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle is mostly characteristic of the 2nd and 3rd quartiles stronger for the 2nd quartile and weakening for the 3rd one with more samples concentrated at 2 than at 5 h table 1 by development rows and supplemental fig 2 q2 and q3 the 10 14 h semi diurnal cycle is not present anymore in the 3rd and 4th quartiles the absence of multimodality for the last 4th quartile given also the extension of the sample indicates that as the storm vanishes no diurnal or semi diurnal cycle of maximum tc rainfall can be identified supplemental fig 2 q4 our results for this alternative temporal stratification agree with the suggestion by navarro et al 2017 that the magnitude of the diurnal signal may vary throughout the lifetime of the storm according to them results in the literature are mixed about the impact of tc diurnal cycle with regard to storm maturity i e some advocate for impacts in the developing early stages e g hobgood 1986 melhauser and zhang 2014 sundqvist 1970 while others for impacts in the mature late stages e g craig 1996 tang and zhang 2016 tuleya and kurihara 1981 our results lay in both groups as the 2nd and 3rd and even the 1st quartiles show diurnal and semi diurnal cycles the stratification by intensity shows that the overall unstratified mvmf pdf is roughly based on the ts category this can be seen from figs 1 b and 2 c and the similar parameters in table 1 ts and all rows for the ts category the diurnal 10 22 h and semi diurnal 2 5 h cycles of maximum tc rainfall are equally distinctive this can be seen from its κ s of 36 88 9 31 85 00 and 87 92 respectively for μ s of 2 23 5 30 9 89 and 21 72 h all of the above four vmf unimodal distributions account for 75 of the mixture 20 is described by μ 17 54 h with κ 1 65 the lowest for any category of intensity ts is the only category with a weak 10 14 h semi diurnal cycle around μ 13 90 h as with the stratification by surface this behavior is expected for the ts category which accounts for 61 1 of the maximum rainfall analyzed cat12 and cat35 account for 24 7 and 13 1 of the sample respectively the mvmf pdf for cat12 is mainly described by a strong 10 22 h diurnal cycle with μ s of 9 89 and 21 65 h table 1 cat12 rows this strong diurnal cycle is responsible for 39 of the distribution about 33 of this mvmf pdf comes from the less marked 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle with μ s of 2 46 and 5 98 h given that the largest proportion of the mvmf pdf for cat35 74 comes from very diffused κ s of 5 87 and 6 31 mean directions μ s of 3 57 and 18 04 h respectively we can ascertain the absence of any semi diurnal cycle for extremely intense tcs one of the causes for this absence might be related to the random nature of such an extreme maximum rainfall this is yet to be proven as there are few cat35 samples 13 1 still our results for cat35 are in line with leppert ii and cecil 2016 who associated intense tcs with a weaker diurnal signal they based this assertion on studies such as browner et al 1977 and hobgood 1986 with only 1 1 of et storms no conclusive non parametric analysis was possible for the et category similar to bowman and fowler 2015 wu et al 2015 stratified oceanic tc rainfall inner core i e 0 100 km and outer rainbands i e 100 500 km by weak cat1 and ts and strong cat2 5 storms wu et al 2015 found that the daily maximum is reached at 02 30 05 00 utc inner core and at 05 00 08 00 utc rainbands for weak storms whereas for strong storms these periods are 01 30 04 00 utc inner core and 04 00 12 00 utc rainbands in our case all intensity categories encompass the early periods for either the inner core or rainbands i e 2 7 0 9 h and 5 6 0 4 h even though the early hours shifting is not as large as the one in wu et al 2015 nevertheless our analysis does not show correspondence with their late periods with regard to inner core or rainbands we later show that these periods remain the same for 0 200 km or 0 50 km with regard to the stratification by basin the two main diurnal cycles of maximum tc rainfall are provided by the pacific basin with 75 3 of the sample the sample percentages for the sp ep wp si ni and na basins are 15 4 21 2 38 7 8 5 8 1 and 8 1 respectively with μ s of 2 33 5 36 9 91 and 21 60 h the wp basin follows the 10 22 h diurnal and 2 5 h semi diurnal cycles fig 2 d dark blue curve it is also the only basin with a distinctive μ 14 12 h which suggests a late and light 10 14 18 h semi diurnal cycle for detailed κ values see table 1 by basin rows wp is the basin that resembles the overall all mvmf pdf the most fig 2 f light blue curve and fig 1 a continuous dark blue curve this is probably due to its highest percentage of sampled tcs 38 7 jiang et al 2011 also found that the wp basin has the largest number of deepest and most intense tropical cyclone precipitation cloud and convective cell features the ep and sp basins follow a pattern similar to the wp basin both present a distinctive 10 22 h cycle and a less marked 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle practically absent in the sp basin as seen from supplemental fig 1 it appears that the 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle is something really characteristic of the north pacific basin i e wp and ep basins see also table 1 by basin rows the non parametric analysis is less conclusive for the si ni and na basins which add the remaining quarter 24 7 of the sample altogether the indian basin si and ni presents a distinctive mean time 10 h with κ s of 123 52 and 113 71 respectively for si and ni the difference between the si and ni basins is that the latter shows a scattered sample κ 0 83 at μ 2 77 h whereas the scattered sample for the former is at μ 20 66 h κ 0 80 note the discordance of these μ s from the diurnal or semi diurnal cycles such a disagreement may be influenced by non parametric analyses based on few samples 8 3 on average for each indian basin the na basin fig 2 d red curve and supplemental fig 1 na has also one of the lowest samples 8 1 which does not allow a clear identification of any diurnal cycle when the analysis was stratified by radii the general pattern all mimicked that of the maximum tc rainfall within 200 km radii fig 2 e light blue curve thus the 10 22 h diurnal cycle and the 2 5 h and 14 18 h semi diurnal cycles are mainly present within 200 km from the tc center μ s of 2 22 5 19 9 88 14 02 and 21 75 h for radii between 200 and 500 km there is only a weak κ 3 33 μ 5 73 h this and the fact that no maximum tc rainfall was beyond 500 km radii suggest that tc maximum rainfall only develops within 200 km radii we stratify radii further down to three more intervals within 200 km i e 0 50 50 100 not presented here and 100 200 km as shown in table 1 by radii rows and fig 2 e 50 km is descriptive of the overall behavior for maximum tc rainfall within 200 km as these two radii 0 50 and 0 200 km follow almost identical diurnal and semi diurnal cycles almost the entire sample 98 2 is in the 0 50 km range whereas 99 7 is within 200 km wu et al 2015 suggested that the outward propagation of the diurnal signals is associated with the internal structure of tc convective systems regardless of the basins where they develop recent work presented by leppert ii and cecil 2016 is somewhat in agreement with our results for radial stratification they found that for 100 500 km radii tc rainfall clouds peaks in the morning 01 30 07 30 lst and that the minimum is reached between 10 30 19 30 lst from fig 2 e one can see the similarities of these peaks with the 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle for radii shorter than 500 km or even 200 km nevertheless in what they call minimum we have the 10 22 h diurnal cycle our 22 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle also appears in their inner core 0 100 km with a maximum at 22 30 04 30 lst associated with only upper levels 8 10 km according to leppert ii and cecil 2016 the peak between 01 30 07 30 lst is also found in several previous studies e g bowman and fowler 2015 lajoie and butterworth 1984 and muramatsu 1983 the mvmf pdfs in fig 2 e represent pdfs of maximum tc rainfall for several radii as presented in rios gaona et al 2018 the average maximum tc rainfall for the intervals 0 200 km 200 500 km and 500 1000 km are 48 07 11 61 and 3 41 mm respectively likewise the average maximum tc rainfall for the intervals 0 50 km 50 100 km and 100 200 km are 48 04 27 87 and 19 26 mm respectively about 48 mm of rainfall either for 0 50 or 0 200 km confirms the vast representativeness of tc rainfall maxima just within the first 50 km from the tc center such detailed statistics close to the tc centers are possible thanks to the high resolution rainfall retrievals offered by imerg 4 summary and conclusions the goal of this work was to quantitatively assess the diurnal cycle of maximum tc rainfall by means of non parametric circular statistics to do so we cross referenced the ibtracs v03r10 and imerg v04 data sets to accurately account for high resolution rainfall within a 2000 km wide swath along the path of a given tc we analyzed 259 tcs that occurred from march 2014 through february 2017 3 years of data the imerg data set is a gridded satellite product of high spatiotemporal rainfall estimates 0 1 0 1 every 30 min which makes it very suitable for analyses related to the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall circular statistics is a mathematical framework that allows statistical analyses accounting for the intrinsic periodicity of circular directional variables in our case such a circular random variable is the time of the day for which a tc rainfall maximum occurred we modelled the multimodality and anisotropy of tc rainfall maxima using the finite mixtures aggregations of unimodal von mises fisher distributions mvmf pdfs which is the most common approach given its easy to interpret parameters e g mean direction time μ concentration parameter κ and mixing proportion α we stratified our analysis by storm duration maturity and intensity basin of origin proximity of the tc rainfall maxima to the storm center i e by radii and whether the tc center was over the ocean or land on average when no stratification is implemented over the 259 tcs here analyzed there are two main cycles of maximum rainfall one with mean directions μ of 9 88 and 21 75 h κ s of 82 77 and 82 39 respectively referred as the 10 22 h diurnal cycle the other one with μ s of 2 22 and 5 20 h κ s of 31 98 and 8 90 respectively referred as the 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle this semi diurnal cycle appears to be also present at afternoon hours i e 14 18 h μ s of 14 02 and 17 80 h with respective κ s of 68 67 and 2 36 ocean ts tropical storms i e msw 64kt wp west pacific 0 200 km or even 0 50 km radii long lasting i e storms with duration longer than 10 days and 2nd quartile are the stratifications that resemble the general mvmf pdf of the 10 22 and 2 5 h cycles the most all of these particular stratifications average μ s of 2 23 5 26 9 89 and 21 70 h with standard deviations of 0 061 0 178 0 017 and 0 060 respectively this correspondence is mainly attributed to the large influence each of these stratifications exert on the sample that is out of the sample of 2014 values of maximum tc rainfall per storm 97 4 comes from ocean 61 1 from ts 38 7 from wp 98 2 from radii smaller than 50 km 39 5 from storms lasting more than 10 days and 31 8 from all their 2nd quartiles short lived tcs i e 1 5 days mainly develop a diurnal cycle of maximum rainfall around μ s of 9 90 and 21 52 h i e 10 22 h diurnal cycle intermediate and long lasting i e 5 10 days and longer than 10 days respectively tcs develop both diurnal 10 22 h and semi diurnal 2 5 h cycles long lasting storms show a weak 14 18 h semi diurnal at μ 14 01 h which is mainly characteristic of tcs from the wp basin as storms last longer the maximum tc rainfall distribution concentrates more at the end of the diurnal cycle 22 h than at its beginning 10 h at an earlier stage of a storm 1st quartile there is also a larger concentration of maximum tc rainfall at the end of the diurnal cycle μ 21 72 h than at its beginning μ 9 86 h this concentration shifts towards the beginning of the 10 22 h diurnal cycle as the storm progresses to its 2nd and 3rd quartiles the 22 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle is mainly characteristic of the 2nd μ s of 2 14 and 5 50 h and 3rd μ s of 1 93 and 4 69 h quartiles as the storm matures this semi diurnal cycle weakens no particular diurnal or semi diurnal cycle is developed at the end of the storm 4th quartile while cat12 storms show a distinctive 10 22 h diurnal cycle μ s of 9 89 and 21 65 h cat35 storms show an absence of any semi diurnal cycles which might be attributed to the very random nature of such an extreme maximum rainfall it is reminded that cat12 and cat35 respectively account for 24 7 and 13 1 of the sample and that nothing conclusive can be said for et storms as only few samples of tc rainfall maxima were within this category 1 1 all the pacific basins i e wp ep east pacific and sp south pacific show a distinctive 10 22 h diurnal cycle on average their μ s are at 9 86 and 21 77 h with wp the basin with the larger number of samples 38 7 of tc rainfall maxima wp is the only basin with two distinctive semi diurnal cycles i e 2 5 h with μ s of 2 33 and 5 36 h and 14 18 h with μ s of 14 12 and 17 23 h neither the north atlantic na nor the indian basins si south indian and ni north indian showed any distinctive diurnal and or semi diurnal cycles nevertheless it appears that both indian basins have predominant μ s 9 91 h with a tendency for the si basin to distribute maximum rainfall at μ 20 66 h and at μ 2 77 h for the ni basin these different values of μ s can be attributed to the lower number of samples the non parametric analysis was based on e g na ni and si represent just 24 7 of the sample when the analysis was stratified by radii the 10 22 h diurnal and 2 5 h semi diurnal cycles are rather similar among the 0 50 and 0 200 km radii given that 99 7 of the sample is within 200 km and 98 2 within 50 km radii this is a clear indication that the diurnal cycle of maximum tc rainfall takes place within the first 50 km from the tc center outwards no maximum tc rainfall was found for radii beyond 300 km the level of detail reached in this work was possible due to high resolution and quality data sets such as ibtracs and imerg despite their intrinsic and potential deficiencies the combination of such data sets offers a comprehensive record and a rather accurate evaluation of tc rainfall an accurate description or modelling of the diurnal cycle of maximum rainfall from tcs further propels better and more accurate tc rainfall models which in the end serves to increase our resilience against this type of natural hazards and their catastrophic consequences acknowledgements this material is based in part upon work supported by the national science foundation

7112,we analyze the diurnal cycle of maximum rainfall from 300 tcs from march 2014 through february 2017 by cross referencing the path of tropical cyclones tcs and high resolution rainfall estimates from imerg integrated multi satellite rainfall from gpm global precipitation measurement mission imerg is a gridded satellite product that offers high resolution rainfall estimates at a spatiotemporal resolution of 0 1 0 1 every 30 min which are particularly suitable for these analyses because of the nature of the data we use circular statistics circular statistics allows us to account for the natural periodicity of a random variable such as the time of the day at which maximum rainfall from tcs occurs we follow the non parametric approach of mixtures of von mises fisher distribution mvmf which enables an easy to interpret parameter identification of multimodal and anisotropic distributions of the tc rainfall we stratify our analysis by storm duration maturity and intensity basin of origin radial proximity to the center of the storm and whether the storm is over the ocean or land in general and across all scales we find that there are mainly two cycles of maximum tc rainfall one diurnal cycle with peaks at 10 and 22 h local time and one semi diurnal cycle with peaks at 2 and 5 h local time although in a smaller proportion the latter exhibits a weak afternoon alternative i e 14 and 18 h local time keywords tropical cyclones diurnal cycle rainfall circular statistics imerg 1 introduction tropical cyclones tcs are phenomena of paramount importance not only for the rain they produce but also for the havoc they unleash both in coastal and inland areas e g czajkowski et al 2017 khouakhi et al 2017 they are also considered the deadliest type of weather related disasters as the death toll from 2000 storms from 1995 through 2015 amounts to 242 000 fatalities unisdr and cred 2017 or 251 384 roughly equivalent to 40 of the total casualties from weather related disasters from 1980 to 2000 according to undp 2004 p 37 for instance in 2017 hurricane harvey brought almost 125 000 m3 of rain spread over four u s states fritz and samenow 2017 averaged over the houston area the lowest total precipitation in seven days brought by hurricane harvey was 700 2 mm which is more than double of any previous record 315 8 mm for seven days of rainfall between 1950 and 2016 risser and wehner 2017 put into perspective this amount of rainfall is the equivalent to the yearly average precipitation in houston burian and shepherd 2005 fritz and samenow 2017 overall hurricane harvey produced the largest rainfall ever recorded of any hurricane affecting the united states e g emanuel 2017 noaa wpc 2017 and samenow 2017 the number of fatalities caused by this storm is reported to be 80 people e g moravec 2017 van oldenborgh et al 2017 the impact exerted by tcs comes from the high wave storm surges extreme winds and floods and landslides associated with the torrential rains they produce e g mendelsohn et al 2012 peduzzi et al 2012 out of these three factors we devote our attention to the characterization of heavy rainfall from tcs given its direct relation to flooding which in the last two decades has affected 2 3 billion people unisdr and cred 2017 this is equivalent to 56 of the people affected by weather related disasters hence the characterization of heavy rainfall from tcs provides essential information to assess and evaluate the impact from landfalling tcs helping thus potential affected communities to be more resilient against such natural hazards several studies have focused on tc rainfall characterization for instance prat and nelson 2016 studied the contribution of tcs to extreme daily rainfall whereas prat and nelson 2013 established the contribution of tc rainfall to the seasonal precipitation totals for the southeastern united states jiang et al 2008 analyzed the rainfall distribution from landfalling tcs in the north atlantic basin all of the above studies were based on about one decade of satellite data lonfat et al 2004 and rios gaona et al 2018 are global studies in which tc rainfall is characterized and stratified by basin and intensity among other features also from global satellite data the focus of this work is to delve into the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall maxima the number of studies about the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall have grown in recent years due to the widespread development and availability of satellite rainfall estimates bowman and fowler 2015 carried out statistical analyses over 15 years of tmpa 3b42 tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis and ibtracs international best track archive for climate stewardship data to investigate the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall which they see as one potential component of precipitation variability in these storms wu et al 2015 studied the diurnal variations of oceanic tc rainfall in their inner core and outer rainbands their study was also based on 15 years 1998 2012 of tmpa 3b42 data 1401 tcs and focused only on oceanic storms i e beyond 300 km from coastlines leppert ii and cecil 2016 used trmm s microwave imager tmi and precipitation radar pr to study the diurnal cycle of 208 storms in the atlantic basin during the period 1998 2011 they stratified their analyses by radii from 100 to 1000 km every 100 km by intensity wind speed larger than 34 kt and 64 kt and by height 2 8 and 10 km more recently o neill et al 2017 examined cloud resolving tc simulations to understand the wavelike diurnal cycle responses on quasi steady tcs they found evidence of diurnal wave propagation in the upper troposphere in eddy temperature fields tang et al 2017 studied the sensitivity of hurricane secondary eyewall formation sef to solar insolation through a numerical simulation navarro et al 2017 determined the impact of periodic diurnal heating on a balanced vortex highlighting the importance of clouds the introductions of bowman and fowler 2015 leppert ii and cecil 2016 and o neill et al 2017 provide extensive literature and recounted details on the diurnal cycle of oceanic precipitation e g frank 1977 hai long et al 2013 of tc rainfall e g jiang et al 2011 wu et al 2015 and of cloud tops changes e g browner et al 1977 dunion et al 2014 kossin 2002 studies on the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall contribute to the characterization and understanding of tc rainfall variability from the diurnal insolation cycle on tcs such a variation is key to improve storm intensity prediction and tc modelling on global climate systems for instance our work advances the knowledge of the diurnal cycle of maximum tc rainfall because we use high resolution satellite data and circular statistics imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm global precipitation measurement mission is a follow up on almost two decades on continuous rainfall monitoring at global scales from trmm and its equivalent tmpa products huffman et al 2007 imerg is a gridded rainfall product with a spatiotemporal resolution of 0 1 0 1 every 30 min hou et al 2014 rainfall monitoring at high resolution from space nowadays serves as a key tool to develop and enhance societal applications such as fresh water availability flood forecasting landslide warning water borne disease propagation and storm tracking kirschbaum and patel 2016 stanley et al 2017 the main advantage with regard to storm tracking is that from global rainfall estimates such imerg one can track the precipitation path of such large scale storms that often are difficult to even quantify from ground based sensors like gauges and weather radars the ibtracs data set offers a detailed record of tc tracks and maximum sustained windspeed msw of all the tcs worldwide since 1842 and up to march 2017 by combining these two data sets we can obtain a detailed and accurate description of the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall from tcs this allows us to study the diurnal cycle of maximum rainfall for all the tcs 259 worldwide in a span of 3 years gpm launched its core satellite on february 2014 in addition to high resolution satellite data we use circular statistics which represents the appropriate statistical framework for analyses of this kind in circular statistics the data under analysis is represented as points over a unit circle which is the support for circular variables pewsey et al 2013 in a circular space all data is equally likely to be distributed over a segment equivalent to 2π this abstraction has the unique advantage to account for the intrinsic periodicity of circular and or directional variables such as time of the day at which rainfall occurs or the azimuthal direction of the maximum sustained windspeed of a hurricane for instance a basic example is that of the average of a random variable that took place at 01 00 and 23 00 for instance a linear analysis will tell us that the average time of such a random variable is 12 00 due to the proximity of 01 00 and 23 00 in a 24 h circular space the circular analysis will yield an average time of 00 00 which is a more correct approximation of the true nature of the random variable under analysis work on tc rainfall via circular statistics has not been carried out so far the common approach is to apply linear statistics to draw the cyclic patterns e g hu et al 2017 recent and related work on the implementation of circular analysis in hydrometeorological topics include those of dhakal et al 2015 masseran 2015 and villarini 2016 dhakal et al 2015 developed a non parametric circular statistics approach that optimizes the bandwidth s of a von mises distribution section 2 their approach assessed the non stationarity of 60 years of maximum daily precipitation at ten locations in the northeastern united states masseran 2015 used non parametric circular statistics to better characterize the wind regime in the northern region of borneo malaysia from almost one year of hourly wind direction data one station only they found that the finite mixture of von mises fisher approach section 2 systematically outperforms the one based on non negative trigonometric sums from annual maximum instantaneous peak discharges 7500 gage stations with at least 30 years of data villarini 2016 applied circular statistics to study the seasonality of flooding across the continental united states other examples of developments and implementations of circular statistics in earth sciences including mixtures of von mises fisher probability density functions mvmf pdfs include those by lark et al 2014 and oliveira et al 2012 to the best of our knowledge our work is the first of its kind that offers a comprehensive and quantitative characterization of the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall maxima analyzed via the circular statistics framework a detailed presentation of the theoretical framework of circular statistics is beyond the scope of this paper for that matter we point the interested reader to previous works carried out by fisher 1993b mardia 1972b mardia and jupp 2000 and pewsey et al 2013 where deep and comprehensive formulations details and references on the theory of circular statistics can be found our approach relies on the r packages movmf hornik and grün 2014 circular agostinelli and lund 2017 and directional tsagris et al 2017 r is a computing language and environment for statistical analysis r core team 2018 we stratify our analysis by tc duration maturity and intensity basin of origin distance from the center and whether the storm is over the ocean or land a thorough analysis of yet another characteristic of tc rainfall such as the diurnal cycle of maximum tc rainfall gets us closer to more realistic representations and models of the rainfall associated with tcs we consider our approach a better assessment of the diurnal cycle because not only the available high resolution data we use but also the circular framework offers a more accurate and appropriate approach for the statistical description of tc rainfall maxima this paper is organized as follows section 2 briefly describes the data we use and introduces the conceptual framework of circular statistics and its implementation section 3 presents the results and discussion alongside summary and conclusions are provided in section 4 2 data and methodology our data set is similar to that of rios gaona et al 2018 in which they analyzed 166 tcs for the period of march 2014 through march 2016 hence the analysis comes from the merging of two data sets ibtracs and imerg v04 final the ibtracs v03r10 is a worldwide collection of tc best track data knapp et al 2010 developed by the national climatic data center ncdc jointly with the world data center for meteorology it is a comprehensive project that gathers information from all the regional specialized meteorological centers rsmcs and tropical cyclone warning centres tcwcs members of the world meteorological organization wmo and other national agencies ibtracs data is freely available from the server ftp eclipse ncdc noaa gov pub ibtracs the ibtracs data set contains several attributes or variables one of them is the seven basins in which the earth s surface is divided into from a tc perspective north atlantic na eastern pacific ep western pacific wp northern indian ocean ni southern indian ocean si south pacific sp and south atlantic sa attributes such as msw the time at landfall if available and the longitude and latitude of the storm centers from which later we interpolate the tc track at 30 minute resolution are also included in this data set the temporal resolution of ibtracs is 6 hourly 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 utc imerg is a gridded rainfall product level 3 from the gpm mission this high resolution product provides rainfall intensities with a spatiotemporal resolution of 0 1 0 1 every 30 minuntes between 60 n

observation represented as a unit vector x is equivalent to the complex number z e i θ cos θ i sin θ where i 1 such a unit vector can be placed in the complex plane with its real component cos θ on the horizontal axis and its imaginary component i sin θ on the vertical axis for a graphic interpretation consult mardia and jupp 2000 fig 2 1 and pewsey et al 2013 fig 3 1 summary statistics such as the sample mean direction θ and resultant length r and circular variance v can be computed from circular data on the complex plane the sample mean direction indicates the direction of the mean resultant unit vector of the sample pewsey et al 2013 ch 3 it is given by θ tan 1 b a 0 2 π where b j 1 n sin θ j n 1 and a j 1 n cos θ j n 1 only valid for a b 0 θ j represents the angle of a unit vector j with regard to the chosen zero north and n the sample size as noted by pewsey et al 2013 ch 3 the sample mean direction is a good measure of central location for unimodal samples that are close to symmetric the sample mean resultant length is defined by r b 2 a 2 0 1 and it is used as a measure of concentration for unimodal circular data pewsey et al 2013 ch 3 if all the unit vectors j are identical then r 1 conversely the more r approaches 0 the more evenly spread around the unit circle the data is a particular case where r 0 may imply that all unit vectors cancel each other out meaning that they all are evenly directed in the complex plane the sample circular variance is defined as v 1 r 0 1 κ is the concentration parameter equivalent to the reliability σ 2 of a normal distribution murray and morgenstern 2010 it can be obtained by linear interpolation from tabulated values of r e g mardia 1972b p 298 table appendix 2 3 or n and r e g mardia and jupp 2000 p 364 table appendix 2 5 several tests have been developed to evaluate or infer the uniformity and symmetry conditions of the sample pewsey et al 2013 ch 5 strongly recommend the rayleigh test for departure from uniformity in unimodal circular distributions for multimodal departures from uniformity they advise omnibus tests such as kuiper s v n watson s u 2 and rao s spacing test for instance all the previous tests are for continuous circular data i e data not grouped into bins dhakal et al 2015 noticed that while the rayleigh is a powerful test against unimodal alternatives of uniformity but not against multimodal alternatives as suggested by pewsey et al 2013 the rao s spacing and kuiper s v n tests are consistent against unimodal and multimodal alternatives of uniformity a parametric bootstrap adaptation of the watson s u 2 test is one alternative to test the goodness of fit of a specified distribution agostinelli and lund 2017 tsagris et al 2017 a sample can also be tested for two types of symmetry on the unit circle reflective symmetry and ℓ fold symmetry a distribution is reflectively symmetric about an angle θ if the reflection of the distribution over such an angle is identical to the original distribution pewsey et al 2013 ch 4 if a distribution is identical to the original distribution after being rotated through an angle 2 π ℓ such a distribution is said to be ℓ fold symmetric for simplicity we only test for reflective symmetry a mathematical description of all these tests is beyond the scope of the present work still we perform all of the above mentioned tests section 3 to improve on the summary statistics and gain a better perspective on the underlying distribution from which the sample is potentially drawn our data exhibits multimodality fig 1 therefore we follow the approach of a finite mixture of unimodal von mises fisher mvmf distributions non parametric approaches e g mvmf offer more complex alternatives to account for the multimodality and asymmetry of irregular samples the von mises distribution is a classic model in circular statistics and it is considered the equivalent to the normal distribution model for linear data fisher 1993b pewsey et al 2013 ch 4 it is also the most common and more investigated approach given its easy to interpret parameters pewsey et al 2013 ch 4 the cardiod wrapped cauchy von mises jones pewsey family and inverse batschelet family models are alternative unimodal distributions developed to fit continuous circular data for more details see pewsey et al 2013 ch 4 as clearly presented and explained by qin et al 2016 see also dhillon and sra 2003 hornik and grün 2014 the d variate von mises fisher distribution of a d dimensional unit random vector x for x r d in the unit hypersphere s d 1 and x 1 follows the probability density function 1 f x μ κ c d κ exp κ μ t x in eq 1 κ for κ 0 is the concentration parameter that quantifies how tightly the distribution is around the mean direction μ for μ 1 μ t x is the cosine similarity between x and μ i e cos x μ for x and μ expressed in radians and c d κ is a normalizing constant defined as c d κ κ d 2 1 2 π d 2 i d 2 1 κ where 2 i d 2 1 κ s 0 1 s γ s d 2 1 1 κ 2 2 s d 2 1 in eq 2 i d 2 1 κ is the infinite series form arfken et al 2013 eq 14 99 of the modified bessel function of the first kind with order d 2 1 and argument κ and γ s d 2 1 1 s d 2 1 the gamma function in our case d 2 and the d variate von mises fisher distribution eq 1 reduces to the von mises distribution for the unit circle fisher 1993a mardia 1972a pewsey et al 2013 the simplest and most common approach in multimodal probability density functions for circular statistics is that of a finite mixture of von mises fisher mvmf which is given by e g qin et al 2016 f x α μ κ h 1 h h 1 h α h f x μ h κ h for 3 0 α h 1 and α h 1 in eq 3 α h is the mixing proportion of the h unimodal von mises fisher distributions pdfs this equation has no analytical solution hence its parameters are computed via maximum likelihood estimates under an expectation maximization framework banerjee et al 2005 dhillon and sra 2003 the interested reader is pointed to the numerical solution implemented by hornik and grün 2014 given that is from the r package movmf that we compute the parameters α h μ h κ h of the assumed mvmf pdfs an objective assessment of the optimal best mixture number of h unimodal von mises fisher distributions is that of akaike s or bayesian information criterion aic or bic respectively pewsey et al 2013 p 114 ch 6 the idea behind these criteria is to select the least complex of all models providing equally good fits i e parsimony we use the bic criterion to select the number of distributions for a given mvmf pdfs as with rios gaona et al 2018 we downscaled ibtracs attributes to 30 minute imerg native resolution we interpolated the 6 hour tc centers to 30 minute resolution via cubic spline interpolation of latitudes and longitudes hence the interpolated tc centers are not absolutely accurate nevertheless the variability generated by such a method has no practical effect on the radii averaged precipitation bowman and fowler 2015 for every 30 minute tc center we extracted imerg rainfall up to a radius of 1000 km every 7 km from the tc center outwards i e 0 km 7 km 14 km for each radius we averaged all the rainfall depth from the tc center up to the radius under consideration following bowman and fowler 2015 and wu et al 2015 we compute the local time lst t lst of all radii as the difference from their utc t utc with regard to their longitude λ 180 180 i e t lst t utc λ 12 180 for each storm we select the lsts at which all maximum rainfall averages occur we stratify our analysis into six categories storm duration storm development storm intensity basin of origin radial proximity to the tc center and surface land or ocean the basin of origin and surface categories are entirely based on the coordinates of the tc center a tc is considered to be over land if its center is geographically located over land regardless of its proximity to the shore we define three radial intervals to further stratify our analysis of maximum rainfall with regard to its proximity to the tc center the storm duration category is based on the day relative to the storm beginning from which a lst or maximum tc rainfall was sampled whereas the storm development category is based on the quartile from which a given lst was sampled the intensity category is based on the msw of the storm for a given center the msw for a given 30 minute tc center corresponds to the previous 6 hourly step stored in the ibtracs we re categorized the tc intensity into four categories based on the saffir simpson hurricane scale sshs simpson 1974 for msw 64 kt 33 1 m s 1 ts for 64 msw 96 kt 33 1 msw 49 4 m s 1 cat12 for msw 96 kt cat35 and extra tropical cyclones et 3 results and discussion the summary statistics for the sample of 1024 unit vectors that represent the lsts at which maximum precipitation per storm for all the 259 tcs under analysis occurs are θ 1 952 h or 0 5111 rad sample mean direction r 0 131 sample mean resultant length and v 0 8693 sample circular variance the concentration parameter κ is 0 26375 bear in mind that as the sample of average rainfall per tc is really large multiple radii per several tc centers each storm can potentially have several rainfall estimates of equal maximum value especially if one uses up to two significant figures digits in the rounding up this is why in this case we have a 1024 maximum sample for 259 tcs the p value for the rayleigh was 0 which indicates the rejection of the null hypothesis of uniformity the p values for the kuiper s v n watson s u 2 and rao s spacing tests were smaller than 0 01 0 01 and 0 001 respectively which led us to the rejection of the null hypothesis of uniformity the goodness of fit test for the grouped data as presented in fig 1 a i e 6 min bins yielded p values of 0 026 and 0 743 for the null hypotheses of uniform and von mises distribution respectively therefore the null hypothesis of a uniform distribution that fits the sample is rejected with a 2 6 significance level the p value for the reflective symmetry test was 0 053 which implies the rejection of the null hypothesis of an assumed reflectively symmetric distribution at the 5 3 significance level the result of all these tests jointly with a visual evaluation of fig 1 a suggests that a priori assumptions of isotropy unimodality and reflective symmetry do not hold for our sample hence we must turn to non parametric circular statistics to evaluate and quantify the multimodality present in the diurnal cycle of maximum tc rainfall fig 1 for instance fig 1 a shows the distribution of the 1024 samples for tc rainfall maxima grouped into 6 min bins in both distributions either continuous or stacked one can see how the data is not equally distributed over the circular space anisotropy and multimodality maximum tc rainfall tends to concentrate roughly around five times i e 2 5 10 14 and 22 h and somewhat spread between 15 and 21 h 18 h average this figure also highlights how summary statistics are misleading if some a priori knowledge on the type of distribution is not known in section 2 we established the mvmf distributions as the appropriate approach for a non parametric multimodal fitting given its easy to interpret parameters a visual inspection of fig 1 a reveals that most likely a mixture of 5 vmf pdfs should be sufficient to describe well the sample distribution fig 1 c shows the bic values for different number of unimodal vmf pdfs mixtures six is the optimal number of unimodal vmf pdf for the overall distribution i e no stratification implemented as seen from fig 1 a a single unimodal vmf pdf is not suitable to identify the diurnal cycle on the other hand an 8 mvmf pdf offers a quite detailed and parametrized distribution at the expenses of parsimony nevertheless fig 1 c tells us that only 6 vmf pdfs are necessary to accurately account for the multimodality of the sample s distribution and thus to identify the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall this can be seen from fig 1 a on how the continuous dark blue curve 6 vmf pdfs simply and accurately comprises the information gathered by the continuous green curve 8 vmf pdfs fig 1 c also shows the bic values for the stratification of tc rainfall maxima given the intensity category i e ts green curve cat12 blue curve cat35 pink curve and et gold curve the optimal mixture for each of these distributions is 6 6 5 and 2 respectively this optimal fit can also be seen in fig 1 b in which the mvmf pdfs are plotted over the binned sample distribution of each intensity category numerical solutions for small size samples often yield large values of κ which consequently yield infinite values of probability f x μ κ eq 1 hence the mvmf pdfs here presented e g table 1 correspond to the lowest possible bic obtained from 1 to 9 components for which all of its unimodal vmf pdfs are finite and or defined the four predominant mean times μ s of the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall maxima are 2 22 5 20 9 88 and 21 75 h fig 1 a and table 1 all rows these times account for the largest κ s and α s i e the concentration parameter and mixing proportion of each unimodal vmf distribution which describe 72 of the mvmf pdf of tc rainfall maxima about 22 of the distribution is described by the mean direction μ 17 80 h which is spread between 15 and 21 h this distribution has the lowest concentration parameter κ 2 36 which is an indication of how sparse the sample is around its μ the remaining 6 belongs to μ 14 02 h with a high κ despite its lowest contribution to the mvmf pdf hence it seems that there are two main cycles of rainfall maxima in tcs one with mean directions μ of 9 88 and 21 75 h note the 12 h of difference referred to as the 10 22 h diurnal cycle the other with mean directions of 2 22 and 5 20 h referred to as the 2 5 h or 22 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle this latter is also perceived although very slightly in the afternoon hours i e 14 18 h or 10 14 18 h semi diurnal cycle navarro et al 2017 showed a cycle in storm intensity that reaches its peak in the early hours of the morning and lags a periodic response of 6 h from latent heat their results suggests that the axisymmetric tc diurnal cycle is primarily a balanced response driven by periodic heating such a signal is a function of the local solar time which can helps to explain our similar results regardless of stratification by basin or type of surface navarro et al 2017 also hint at the extension of the cycles arguing that long diurnal periods exhibit a more balanced solution with greater impact on the storm intensity whereas short diurnal periods project onto inertia buoyancy waves radiating energy away from the region of heating the general all mvmf pdf is quite representative of the samples over the ocean as 97 4 of all tc rainfall maxima correspond to tc centers located over ocean this can be seen from fig 2 f all and ocean curves and from the very similar mvmf pdf parameters in table 1 all and ocean rows for maximum tc rainfall from tc centers located inland its mean direction is 2 06 h with κ 0 45 table 1 land rows even though nothing conclusive can be inferred or concluded from such a small sample 2 6 of data it is widely known that tcs weaken as they move inland which complicates the identification of a diurnal cycle for inland maximum tc rainfall nesbitt and zipser 2003 found that tropical rainfall peaks in the early morning to predawn hours over the ocean whereas over land on average precipitation peaks in the afternoon especially in non mesoscale convective systems according to dai 2001 and wu et al 2015 convective precipitation over land tends to peak in the late afternoon to early evening hours most likely to a direct response to daytime heating of the surface and the planetary boundary layer whereas over oceans the peak is reached in the early morning hours they did not explore ocean land stratification though on the other hand bowman and fowler 2015 carried out an ocean land basin and intensity stratification they suggested that either the tc land interaction landfall has little incidence on the diurnal behavior of the storms or that as storms move inland they retain their oceanic pattern cycle until the land fraction is too large for this pattern to be present more generally bowman and fowler 2015 found a diurnal variation of tc rainfall with peak rainfall at 06 00 lst and a minimum at 18 00 lst although our results do show a lag of 12 h for both diurnal and semi diurnal cycles our results do not show maxima at 06 00 lst but rather at 9 88 h lst or even at 5 20 h nevertheless and as seen in table 1 all rows several maxima are scattered around μ 17 80 h a different and larger sample i e 15 years of tmpa 3b42 data and an alternative approach i e characterization of the diurnal cycle of rainfall in terms of fourier harmonics by sines and cosines fitting via least squares regression may be the reasons behind the discrepancy between our maxima 9 88 h and the one 06 00 of bowman and fowler 2015 such diurnal cycles of oceanic precipitation with maxima in early morning hours bowman and fowler 2015 are common in studies such as gray and jacobson jr 1977 kraus 1963 and serra and mcphaden 2004 just to cite a few jiang et al 2011 also performed an ocean land stratification in which they found two peaks for the diurnal variation of tc rainfall over land one at 01 30 07 30 lst and the other one at 16 30 19 30 lst minimum at 10 30 13 30 lst they also found maximum tc rainfall at 04 30 07 30 lst and minimum 19 30 22 30 lst for non stratified analyses as seen from fig 2 f and table 1 all rows the maximum by jiang et al 2011 is consistent with the second peak of the 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle i e μ 5 20 1 h with regard to our land stratification our results showed an absence of any diurnal cycle table 1 by surface rows and fig 2 f radial stratification as suggested by bowman and fowler 2015 is an alternative to reduce the impact on the diurnal cycle amplitude of averaged tc rainfall involving potentially non raining areas at large radii nevertheless a sensitivity analysis carried out by wu et al 2015 indicates that the decrease in average rainfall and diurnal variation in the outer rainbands is not attributable to such non raining averages short living storms only develop a semi diurnal cycle whereas intermediate and long lasting tcs develop stable diurnal and semi diurnal cycles of maximum rainfall a temporal stratification of maximum tc rainfall with regard to the number of days a given tc lasts shows that for short living tcs namely tcs that last up to five days there is mainly a 10 22 h diurnal cycle fig 2 a its μ s are clustered around 9 90 and 21 52 h with κ s of 98 15 and 65 51 respectively table 1 by duration rows fig 2 a also shows a 10 14 h semi diurnal cycle μ 14 01 with κ 73 61 for long lasting storms and a much less marked one κ 3 47 for short living storms as we show later this 10 14 h semi diurnal cycle is mainly characteristic of tcs developed in the wp basin fig 2 d intermediate and long lasting storms i e tcs lasting more than 10 days follow a similar dynamic in terms of both diurnal and semi diurnal cycles their 10 22 h diurnal cycles show μ s of 9 89 and 9 87 h and 21 77 and 21 76 h respectively for intermediate and long lasting tcs as the storm lasts longer e g more than 10 days maximum tc rainfall seems to be more concentrated at the end of the diurnal cycle than at its beginning this can be seen from the larger values of κ i e 60 14 and 116 60 at 22 h than those of 108 12 and 67 88 at 10 h table 1 by duration rows and fig 2 a intermediate and long lasting tcs have similar 22 2 5 h semi diurnal cycles i e μ s of 2 20 and 5 74 h for intermediate tcs and μ s of 2 23 and 4 97 h for long lasting tcs a second temporal stratification showed that as the storms reach their end maximum tc rainfall develops earlier in the day rather than later when the duration of all tcs were stratified into quartiles the first quartile i e the first 25 of any storm fig 2 b light blue curve and supplemental fig 2 q1 distinctively showed one diurnal 10 22 h cycle μ s of 9 86 and 21 72 h and two semi diurnal cycles which are distinctively marked around the μ s of 2 42 and 14 15 h the 5 h or 17 h component of the semi diurnal cycle does not fully develop for this quartile supplemental fig 2 q1 bear in mind that 22 and 2 h μ s are only characteristic of intermediate and long lasting storms fig 2 a the κ s for this first quartile are larger for 22 2 h i e 92 50 and 511 50 than for 10 14 h i e 76 98 and 40 06 this implies a larger concentration of maximum tc rainfall during night 22 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle than day hours 10 14 18 h semi diurnal cycle as the storms develop i e 2nd and 3rd quartiles the larger concentration of maximum tc rainfall shifts from 22 to 10 h fig 2 b or supplemental fig 2 q2 or q3 shows how the μ s for the 2nd and 3rd quartiles i e 9 90 and 9 87 h respectively present larger κ s 85 41 and 96 25 than those for the μ s of 21 66 and 21 83 h κ s of 91 63 and 51 08 respectively for the 2nd and 3rd quartiles it appears that the 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle is mostly characteristic of the 2nd and 3rd quartiles stronger for the 2nd quartile and weakening for the 3rd one with more samples concentrated at 2 than at 5 h table 1 by development rows and supplemental fig 2 q2 and q3 the 10 14 h semi diurnal cycle is not present anymore in the 3rd and 4th quartiles the absence of multimodality for the last 4th quartile given also the extension of the sample indicates that as the storm vanishes no diurnal or semi diurnal cycle of maximum tc rainfall can be identified supplemental fig 2 q4 our results for this alternative temporal stratification agree with the suggestion by navarro et al 2017 that the magnitude of the diurnal signal may vary throughout the lifetime of the storm according to them results in the literature are mixed about the impact of tc diurnal cycle with regard to storm maturity i e some advocate for impacts in the developing early stages e g hobgood 1986 melhauser and zhang 2014 sundqvist 1970 while others for impacts in the mature late stages e g craig 1996 tang and zhang 2016 tuleya and kurihara 1981 our results lay in both groups as the 2nd and 3rd and even the 1st quartiles show diurnal and semi diurnal cycles the stratification by intensity shows that the overall unstratified mvmf pdf is roughly based on the ts category this can be seen from figs 1 b and 2 c and the similar parameters in table 1 ts and all rows for the ts category the diurnal 10 22 h and semi diurnal 2 5 h cycles of maximum tc rainfall are equally distinctive this can be seen from its κ s of 36 88 9 31 85 00 and 87 92 respectively for μ s of 2 23 5 30 9 89 and 21 72 h all of the above four vmf unimodal distributions account for 75 of the mixture 20 is described by μ 17 54 h with κ 1 65 the lowest for any category of intensity ts is the only category with a weak 10 14 h semi diurnal cycle around μ 13 90 h as with the stratification by surface this behavior is expected for the ts category which accounts for 61 1 of the maximum rainfall analyzed cat12 and cat35 account for 24 7 and 13 1 of the sample respectively the mvmf pdf for cat12 is mainly described by a strong 10 22 h diurnal cycle with μ s of 9 89 and 21 65 h table 1 cat12 rows this strong diurnal cycle is responsible for 39 of the distribution about 33 of this mvmf pdf comes from the less marked 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle with μ s of 2 46 and 5 98 h given that the largest proportion of the mvmf pdf for cat35 74 comes from very diffused κ s of 5 87 and 6 31 mean directions μ s of 3 57 and 18 04 h respectively we can ascertain the absence of any semi diurnal cycle for extremely intense tcs one of the causes for this absence might be related to the random nature of such an extreme maximum rainfall this is yet to be proven as there are few cat35 samples 13 1 still our results for cat35 are in line with leppert ii and cecil 2016 who associated intense tcs with a weaker diurnal signal they based this assertion on studies such as browner et al 1977 and hobgood 1986 with only 1 1 of et storms no conclusive non parametric analysis was possible for the et category similar to bowman and fowler 2015 wu et al 2015 stratified oceanic tc rainfall inner core i e 0 100 km and outer rainbands i e 100 500 km by weak cat1 and ts and strong cat2 5 storms wu et al 2015 found that the daily maximum is reached at 02 30 05 00 utc inner core and at 05 00 08 00 utc rainbands for weak storms whereas for strong storms these periods are 01 30 04 00 utc inner core and 04 00 12 00 utc rainbands in our case all intensity categories encompass the early periods for either the inner core or rainbands i e 2 7 0 9 h and 5 6 0 4 h even though the early hours shifting is not as large as the one in wu et al 2015 nevertheless our analysis does not show correspondence with their late periods with regard to inner core or rainbands we later show that these periods remain the same for 0 200 km or 0 50 km with regard to the stratification by basin the two main diurnal cycles of maximum tc rainfall are provided by the pacific basin with 75 3 of the sample the sample percentages for the sp ep wp si ni and na basins are 15 4 21 2 38 7 8 5 8 1 and 8 1 respectively with μ s of 2 33 5 36 9 91 and 21 60 h the wp basin follows the 10 22 h diurnal and 2 5 h semi diurnal cycles fig 2 d dark blue curve it is also the only basin with a distinctive μ 14 12 h which suggests a late and light 10 14 18 h semi diurnal cycle for detailed κ values see table 1 by basin rows wp is the basin that resembles the overall all mvmf pdf the most fig 2 f light blue curve and fig 1 a continuous dark blue curve this is probably due to its highest percentage of sampled tcs 38 7 jiang et al 2011 also found that the wp basin has the largest number of deepest and most intense tropical cyclone precipitation cloud and convective cell features the ep and sp basins follow a pattern similar to the wp basin both present a distinctive 10 22 h cycle and a less marked 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle practically absent in the sp basin as seen from supplemental fig 1 it appears that the 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle is something really characteristic of the north pacific basin i e wp and ep basins see also table 1 by basin rows the non parametric analysis is less conclusive for the si ni and na basins which add the remaining quarter 24 7 of the sample altogether the indian basin si and ni presents a distinctive mean time 10 h with κ s of 123 52 and 113 71 respectively for si and ni the difference between the si and ni basins is that the latter shows a scattered sample κ 0 83 at μ 2 77 h whereas the scattered sample for the former is at μ 20 66 h κ 0 80 note the discordance of these μ s from the diurnal or semi diurnal cycles such a disagreement may be influenced by non parametric analyses based on few samples 8 3 on average for each indian basin the na basin fig 2 d red curve and supplemental fig 1 na has also one of the lowest samples 8 1 which does not allow a clear identification of any diurnal cycle when the analysis was stratified by radii the general pattern all mimicked that of the maximum tc rainfall within 200 km radii fig 2 e light blue curve thus the 10 22 h diurnal cycle and the 2 5 h and 14 18 h semi diurnal cycles are mainly present within 200 km from the tc center μ s of 2 22 5 19 9 88 14 02 and 21 75 h for radii between 200 and 500 km there is only a weak κ 3 33 μ 5 73 h this and the fact that no maximum tc rainfall was beyond 500 km radii suggest that tc maximum rainfall only develops within 200 km radii we stratify radii further down to three more intervals within 200 km i e 0 50 50 100 not presented here and 100 200 km as shown in table 1 by radii rows and fig 2 e 50 km is descriptive of the overall behavior for maximum tc rainfall within 200 km as these two radii 0 50 and 0 200 km follow almost identical diurnal and semi diurnal cycles almost the entire sample 98 2 is in the 0 50 km range whereas 99 7 is within 200 km wu et al 2015 suggested that the outward propagation of the diurnal signals is associated with the internal structure of tc convective systems regardless of the basins where they develop recent work presented by leppert ii and cecil 2016 is somewhat in agreement with our results for radial stratification they found that for 100 500 km radii tc rainfall clouds peaks in the morning 01 30 07 30 lst and that the minimum is reached between 10 30 19 30 lst from fig 2 e one can see the similarities of these peaks with the 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle for radii shorter than 500 km or even 200 km nevertheless in what they call minimum we have the 10 22 h diurnal cycle our 22 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle also appears in their inner core 0 100 km with a maximum at 22 30 04 30 lst associated with only upper levels 8 10 km according to leppert ii and cecil 2016 the peak between 01 30 07 30 lst is also found in several previous studies e g bowman and fowler 2015 lajoie and butterworth 1984 and muramatsu 1983 the mvmf pdfs in fig 2 e represent pdfs of maximum tc rainfall for several radii as presented in rios gaona et al 2018 the average maximum tc rainfall for the intervals 0 200 km 200 500 km and 500 1000 km are 48 07 11 61 and 3 41 mm respectively likewise the average maximum tc rainfall for the intervals 0 50 km 50 100 km and 100 200 km are 48 04 27 87 and 19 26 mm respectively about 48 mm of rainfall either for 0 50 or 0 200 km confirms the vast representativeness of tc rainfall maxima just within the first 50 km from the tc center such detailed statistics close to the tc centers are possible thanks to the high resolution rainfall retrievals offered by imerg 4 summary and conclusions the goal of this work was to quantitatively assess the diurnal cycle of maximum tc rainfall by means of non parametric circular statistics to do so we cross referenced the ibtracs v03r10 and imerg v04 data sets to accurately account for high resolution rainfall within a 2000 km wide swath along the path of a given tc we analyzed 259 tcs that occurred from march 2014 through february 2017 3 years of data the imerg data set is a gridded satellite product of high spatiotemporal rainfall estimates 0 1 0 1 every 30 min which makes it very suitable for analyses related to the diurnal cycle of tc rainfall circular statistics is a mathematical framework that allows statistical analyses accounting for the intrinsic periodicity of circular directional variables in our case such a circular random variable is the time of the day for which a tc rainfall maximum occurred we modelled the multimodality and anisotropy of tc rainfall maxima using the finite mixtures aggregations of unimodal von mises fisher distributions mvmf pdfs which is the most common approach given its easy to interpret parameters e g mean direction time μ concentration parameter κ and mixing proportion α we stratified our analysis by storm duration maturity and intensity basin of origin proximity of the tc rainfall maxima to the storm center i e by radii and whether the tc center was over the ocean or land on average when no stratification is implemented over the 259 tcs here analyzed there are two main cycles of maximum rainfall one with mean directions μ of 9 88 and 21 75 h κ s of 82 77 and 82 39 respectively referred as the 10 22 h diurnal cycle the other one with μ s of 2 22 and 5 20 h κ s of 31 98 and 8 90 respectively referred as the 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle this semi diurnal cycle appears to be also present at afternoon hours i e 14 18 h μ s of 14 02 and 17 80 h with respective κ s of 68 67 and 2 36 ocean ts tropical storms i e msw 64kt wp west pacific 0 200 km or even 0 50 km radii long lasting i e storms with duration longer than 10 days and 2nd quartile are the stratifications that resemble the general mvmf pdf of the 10 22 and 2 5 h cycles the most all of these particular stratifications average μ s of 2 23 5 26 9 89 and 21 70 h with standard deviations of 0 061 0 178 0 017 and 0 060 respectively this correspondence is mainly attributed to the large influence each of these stratifications exert on the sample that is out of the sample of 2014 values of maximum tc rainfall per storm 97 4 comes from ocean 61 1 from ts 38 7 from wp 98 2 from radii smaller than 50 km 39 5 from storms lasting more than 10 days and 31 8 from all their 2nd quartiles short lived tcs i e 1 5 days mainly develop a diurnal cycle of maximum rainfall around μ s of 9 90 and 21 52 h i e 10 22 h diurnal cycle intermediate and long lasting i e 5 10 days and longer than 10 days respectively tcs develop both diurnal 10 22 h and semi diurnal 2 5 h cycles long lasting storms show a weak 14 18 h semi diurnal at μ 14 01 h which is mainly characteristic of tcs from the wp basin as storms last longer the maximum tc rainfall distribution concentrates more at the end of the diurnal cycle 22 h than at its beginning 10 h at an earlier stage of a storm 1st quartile there is also a larger concentration of maximum tc rainfall at the end of the diurnal cycle μ 21 72 h than at its beginning μ 9 86 h this concentration shifts towards the beginning of the 10 22 h diurnal cycle as the storm progresses to its 2nd and 3rd quartiles the 22 2 5 h semi diurnal cycle is mainly characteristic of the 2nd μ s of 2 14 and 5 50 h and 3rd μ s of 1 93 and 4 69 h quartiles as the storm matures this semi diurnal cycle weakens no particular diurnal or semi diurnal cycle is developed at the end of the storm 4th quartile while cat12 storms show a distinctive 10 22 h diurnal cycle μ s of 9 89 and 21 65 h cat35 storms show an absence of any semi diurnal cycles which might be attributed to the very random nature of such an extreme maximum rainfall it is reminded that cat12 and cat35 respectively account for 24 7 and 13 1 of the sample and that nothing conclusive can be said for et storms as only few samples of tc rainfall maxima were within this category 1 1 all the pacific basins i e wp ep east pacific and sp south pacific show a distinctive 10 22 h diurnal cycle on average their μ s are at 9 86 and 21 77 h with wp the basin with the larger number of samples 38 7 of tc rainfall maxima wp is the only basin with two distinctive semi diurnal cycles i e 2 5 h with μ s of 2 33 and 5 36 h and 14 18 h with μ s of 14 12 and 17 23 h neither the north atlantic na nor the indian basins si south indian and ni north indian showed any distinctive diurnal and or semi diurnal cycles nevertheless it appears that both indian basins have predominant μ s 9 91 h with a tendency for the si basin to distribute maximum rainfall at μ 20 66 h and at μ 2 77 h for the ni basin these different values of μ s can be attributed to the lower number of samples the non parametric analysis was based on e g na ni and si represent just 24 7 of the sample when the analysis was stratified by radii the 10 22 h diurnal and 2 5 h semi diurnal cycles are rather similar among the 0 50 and 0 200 km radii given that 99 7 of the sample is within 200 km and 98 2 within 50 km radii this is a clear indication that the diurnal cycle of maximum tc rainfall takes place within the first 50 km from the tc center outwards no maximum tc rainfall was found for radii beyond 300 km the level of detail reached in this work was possible due to high resolution and quality data sets such as ibtracs and imerg despite their intrinsic and potential deficiencies the combination of such data sets offers a comprehensive record and a rather accurate evaluation of tc rainfall an accurate description or modelling of the diurnal cycle of maximum rainfall from tcs further propels better and more accurate tc rainfall models which in the end serves to increase our resilience against this type of natural hazards and their catastrophic consequences acknowledgements this material is based in part upon work supported by the national science foundation

7113,with rapid urbanization rainstorm induced inundation losses are becoming increasingly severe research on urban inundation response to rainstorm patterns can help engineers and governments make appropriate decisions and mitigate property losses this paper introduces a new hydrodynamic model that couples the storm water management model swmm and the shallow water model swm and applies the validated model to the haidian island case to determine the inundation response to rainstorm patterns the results show that the coupled model can predict rainstorm induced inundation well and that different rainstorm patterns would result in different inundation patterns with increasing rainstorm peak position coefficients urban inundation events become more severe and inundation peaks appear sooner however the times at which inundation occurs do not change to determine the reasons for the differences in inundation among different rainstorm patterns correlations between the inundation volume and the fully filled pipes ratio were analyzed correlation analysis showed that inundation events are significantly related to the working state of the sewer system indicating that a higher fully filled pipes ratio prior to the rainstorm peak will result in more severe inundation this conclusion suggests that the range of rainstorm peak position coefficients in china is quite reasonable this result can provide insights to engineers and the government for urban design planning and maintenance keywords urban inundation rainstorm pattern coupled hydrodynamic model stormwater management 1 introduction urban inundation is among the most common and destructive natural hazards resulting in considerable direct losses hammond et al 2015 price and vojinovic 2008 this problem is not exclusive to china and is a challenge faced around the world coles et al 2017 marques et al 2017 in recent years escalating inundation hazards have gained public attention and led to increased fiscal expenditures on urban drainage management infrastructure due to the significant economic losses they cause in urban areas inundation management in urban areas is a growing priority due to the factors such as continuing migration of people from rural areas to cities unplanned development climate change and growing operational and maintenance costs urban resilience has also become a popular subject both for researchers and policymakers meerow et al 2016 enhancement of urban resilience has emerged as a challenging task for researchers worldwide with the development of numerical methods and computational technologies numerical modeling provides an opportunity to address these factors and has become the most popular method for providing engineers with detailed information on flood risk management and urban planning teng et al 2017 furthermore it is not only the rainstorm intensity that influences urban inundation but also the type of rainstorm using numerical modeling we can investigate the urban inundation response to rainstorm patterns avoid inundation risks in the urban design and planning phase and mitigate risks in the maintenance phase among the numerical models one dimensional 1d sewer hydraulic models are the most common ones because the required data are inexpensive and the process is highly efficient producing satisfactory results there are currently many 1d sewer software packages available for urban drainage simulations such as storm water management model swmm rossman 2010 and simulation of interaction between pipe flow and surface overland flow in networks sipson djordjević et al 2005 swmm is an open source software package developed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa globally it is the most popular model for hydraulic sewer characteristic analysis hsu et al 2000 krebs et al 2014 wijesiri et al 2016 because of its comprehensive functions and public availability swmm is widely adopted as a computational engine in commercial software programs such as infoworks icm innovyze 2014 pcswmm james et al 2003 and xp swmm elliott and trowsdale 2007 however most of these sewer hydraulic models cannot suitably model surface flooding because they use water stage volume curves method to determine the flood depths on the ground this method can be divided into two categories the first method predetermines the ponding area for each manhole before simulation and divides the flood volumes by ponding areas to obtain the inundation depth ji 1998 rossman 2010 the second method calculates the total flood volumes of the sewer system and uses the water stage volume curve for the whole area to determine inundation depths gouldby et al 2008 krupka et al 2007 in the water stage volume curve method flood waters can be reintroduced into the sewer system as allowed by the system s capacity although they are efficient and simple these methods contain too many subjective components and cannot accurately describe the movement of flood waters because they cannot predict flow velocity and surface water direction which are important factors in inundation risk analysis merz et al 2007 to address this issue hydrodynamic surface flow models were proposed for dual drainage systems there are two approaches frequently used to model overland flow in a dual drainage system the first approach assumes that overland flood waters are restricted to streets and that inundation events only occur in areas with a lower elevation the surface ground drainage system is simplified into a series of open channels and storage areas then the dual drainage system can be modeled using a 1d model djordjević et al 2005 the second method assumes that there is no restriction on overland flow and the flow can enter any area if the physical characteristics allow it with this method the streets depressions and buildings can be described in detail in a two dimensional 2d model noh et al 2016 zhang and pan 2014 the first method takes less time than the second but it is less accurate the second method is becoming increasingly popular due to its accuracy and advanced computational characteristic many studies have been conducted to simulate urban stormwater inundation following these approaches chen et al 2005 kang 2009 hsu et al 2000 first developed a coupled 1d and 2d model for urban inundation simulation the water exchange between the 1d and 2d models at that time was unidirectional i e water can overflow from the 1d sewer model to the 2d surface model but it cannot flow from the 2d model to the 1d model a bidirectional linkage method was first applied by chen et al 2005 in urban inundation modeling in recent years bidirectional linkage methods have becomes popular for coupling the 1d and 2d models leandro et al 2009 seyoum et al 2011 yu and huang 2014 developed a combined 1d and 2d model for shallow water flows in which an implicit dual time stepping method was applied to the 2d model to improve run time efficiency borsche and klar 2014 proposed a numerical model for a sewer network coupled to the surface flow wu et al 2017 outlined a coupled 1d 2d hydrodynamic model based on swmm and lisflood fp to simulate urban inundation commercial software developers provided various urban inundation models including mike flood flood 2011 and infoworks icm innovyze 2014 that can also properly simulate urban inundation apart from the studies on model theory and construction many researchers focused on urban inundation analysis or risk assessment the effect of key urban features the effect of model treatments and future scenario analyses huang et al 2017 martins et al 2016 savage et al 2016 vojinovic et al 2013 chen et al 2016 proposed a new research approach to study a dynamic process the overflow from sewer systems mainly starts at the inlet until the pressure head in the manhole is high enough to lift its cover up in the coupled surface and sewer flow modeling leandro et al 2016 presented a coupled model and investigated how the rainfall runoff dynamics of key urban features such as consist of buildings and permeable land surfaces taken from open street map haklay and weber 2008 can be conceptualized and included in urban flood models not all researchers study urban inundation using their own models some utilize commercial models abdullah et al 2012 provided an improved methodology for processing raw light detection and ranging lidar data and used mike11 mike21 to verify their methodology because of climate change and growing urban populations many researchers focus on the effects of rainfall intensity on urban inundation not on the effects of rainfall patterns on urban inundation furthermore urban drainage planning is particularly important and should contain above and below ground drainage systems most models require costly commercial modules that limit their use and open source academic research models have been relatively scarce until recently this paper first introduces a newly established model which is based on swmm and 2d shallow water model swm yu et al 2015 couples underground drainage systems river networks and surface flows this 2d model is efficient for shallow water flows and uses the lowe upper symmetric gauss seidel lu sgs implicit dual time stepping method based on unstructured grids then we explore the urban inundation response to rainstorm patterns in a case study of the haidian island finally we illustrate the relevance of the rainstorm peak coefficient of 0 35 0 45 in urban planning and design for single peak rainstorms in china cen et al 1998 through our results and provide recommendations for urban drainage planning and inundation modeling 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study site we selected haidian island in the northern hainan province of china as our research region fig 1 haidian island which constitutes the northern part of haikou is a typical delta island with an area of 13 8 km2 and is situated within the nandu river estuary the annual average temperature and rainfall are 24 3 c and 2067 mm respectively typical of the tropical oceanic monsoon climate haidian island is a highly urbanized area containing numerous businesses campuses and residential areas the coverage of impervious areas reaches 70 this island does not have industrial pollution problems its environmental quality creates the best living conditions in haikou city although haidian island is a newly developed area its sewer system is insufficient for its current drainage needs most of the sewer system is designed for one or two year return periods thus inundation is a normal occurrence during rainstorms in haidian island in 2011 a rainstorm hit the entire haikou city causing direct economic losses of 96 93 million haidian island experienced significant damage from that rainstorm and many streets were severely flooded therefore it is a suitable site to study the characteristics of rainfall induced inundations 2 2 data availability and processing 2 2 1 topographic data digital elevation models dem are derived by applying interpolations to previously measured scattered elevation points before interpolation incorrect elevation values were revised by deleting any incidental measurements of rooftops the incorrect points constituted a small proportion of the total dataset therefore therefore the deletions did not impact the accuracy of the dem the building profiles were distinguished through high resolution google remote sensing images further buildings were regarded as non flooding zones thus they were excluded from meshing to ensure that they were not modeled as flooding zones 2 2 2 drainage system data the drainage system data provided by the haikou drainage management bureau contained geographic and geometric information on the pipes manholes rivers and storage areas e g holding ponds rainwater and wastewater in the study area are drained separately the diameters of the pipes ranged from 0 15 to 2 00 m and the depths of the manholes ranged from 0 23 to 5 00 m there are three rivers in the research region the wuxi open channel and the yawei and baisha rivers these rivers have been improved artificially a few years ago and most of their cross sections are now rectangular thus the rivers were set as rectangular open channels in the model there are eight artificial lakes on the island which were set as storage nodes in the model consequently 2690 pipes and open channels 2677 manholes 60 outfalls and eight storages were included in the model fig 1 2 2 3 rainstorm data two recorded historical rainstorms storm 1 and storm 2 were used to calibrate and validate the coupled model these two rainstorms occurred on october 5 2011 and october 5 2010 respectively the rainstorm data were obtained from the china meteorological data service center http cdc nmic cn home do storm 1 started at 10 00 on october 5 2011 and ended at 1 00 the next day it is a unimodal rainstorm with the maximum intensity of 88 1 mm h occurred at 13 00 storm 2 started at 19 00 on october 5 2010 and lasted about 15 h different from storm 1 storm 2 is a bimodal rainstorm the first rainfall peak occurred at 8 00 with an intensity of 34 5 mm h and the second rainfall peak occurred at 1 00 with an intensity of 31 9 mm h fig 2 shows the hydrographs of the storms although these two rainstorms are both equivalent to less than 1a return period rainstorm based only on the rainstorm peak intensity the durations and rainfall totals of historical rainstorms exceed those of design rainstorms thus it is very likely that both rainstorms would cause severe inundation in fact according to a news report liang 2011 storm 1 caused severe inundation in many streets including wuxi road renmin road peace avenue and haida road with an average inundation depth of 0 5 m resulting in traffic disruption and severe economic losses in addition three patterns of rainstorms with return periods of 1a 5a 10a 20a 50a and 100a fig 3 were used as model inputs to study the inundation response according to the bureau of municipal and rural construction the rainfall intensity on haidian island can be summarized using eq 1 the chicago approach keifer and chu 1957 was used to redistribute the rainfall amounts before and after the peaks the main difference among the three rainstorm patterns is the position of the peak rainfall which is controlled by the rainfall peak position coefficient r the rainfall peak position coefficients were set to 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 we named these three rainstorms as pattern 1 pattern 2 and pattern 3 1 q 3245 114 1 0 2561 lg p t 17 172 0 654 where q is the rainfall intensity l s h a p is the return period of rainstorms yr and t is the rainstorm duration in minutes 2 2 4 observed historical inundation events observed historical inundation data are key to model calibration the haikou drainage management bureau provided the inundation data for rainstorms that occurred on october 5 2011 and october 5 2010 i e storm 1 and storm 2 several cameras were set up on the roadside near seven recorded inundation positions and the maximum inundation depths and inundation extents were obtained from video images fig 4 shows the observed historical inundation extents sea levels were also recorded during storm 1 and storm 2 which would be set as outfall conditions in the model thus in this analysis storm 1 was set for calibration while storm 2 was set for validation 2 3 swmm model in this study sewer flow in the underground drainage system and the rainfall runoff process were simulated using swmm developed by the usepa swmm is a dynamic hydrology hydraulic water quality simulation model that is used worldwide for planning analysis and design in relation to stormwater runoff rossman 2010 it conceptualizes a drainage system as a series of water and material flows between several environmental compartments these compartments include the atmosphere land surface groundwater and transport in general channel and pipe flow routings are governed by the saint venant equations de st venant 1871 saint venant equations consist of mass conservation eq 2 and momentum conservation eq 2 equations for gradually varying unsteady flow in the transport compartment swmm solves the saint venant equation using the implicit finite difference method and successive approximation 2 a t q x 0 3 q t q 2 a x g a h x g a s f 0 where q is the flow rate a is the flow cross sectional area h is the hydraulic head of water in the conduit z y z is the conduit invert elevation y is the conduit water depth x is the longitudinal distance v is the velocity t denotes time g is the acceleration of gravity and sf is the friction slope head loss per unit length 2 4 shallow water model the swm is an efficient and robust model for predicting shallow water flow following the lu sgs implicit dual time step method based on an unstructured mesh yu et al 2015 the governing equations are shown in a matrix form as follows 4 u t e x g y s where u e and g are vectors of conserved flow variables and fluxes in the x and y directions and s is a source vector containing the bed slope s b and friction s f sources the vectors are expressed as 5 u h h u h v e hu h u 2 g h 2 b 2 2 h u v g hv h u v h v 2 g h 2 b 2 2 s s b s f 0 g h b s ox g h s fx g h b s oy g h s fy where h u v and b represent water depth depth averaged velocity in the x and y directions and bottom elevation respectively g is the acceleration of gravity at 9 81 m s2 sox and soy are the bed slopes in the x and y directions respectively and s fx and s fy represent the friction slopes in the x and y directions respectively the fluxes and gravity terms are written in this form to mathematically balance them without the need for flux correction more details of this shallow water model can be found in yu et al 2015 2 5 coupled swmm swm we simultaneously simulated the flow dynamics in sewer networks rivers and on overland surfaces by coupling the swmm and swm models the two models were executed individually at every single time step and then connected through appropriate linkages chen et al 2007 to exchange information obtained at suitable locations at the end of every time step in general flow exchange occurs at the connection between the surface flows and pipe or river flows thus three types of linkages including vertical lateral and longitudinal linkages were implemented and studied here the relationships between these two models and the three linkages are presented in fig 5 note that swmm is not the best tool for river network modeling there are key differences between river network models and swmm in generally models divide the entire river into subsections the river network models which are more suitable for river network modeling than swmm set river cross sections as gradually varying in each subsection however swmm assumes that each subsection has a fixed cross profile rossman 2017 this assumption in swmm is not generally suitable for a natural river but it is suitable for urban rivers with similar cross profiles therefore the shortcomings of swmm for river network modeling have a negligible effect on this study if a third river network model were chosen to handle river network modeling in the coupled model the coupled model would be more complicated and a great deal of additional work would be needed moreover swmm can handle various hydraulic structures such as pumps orifices and water gates rossman 2010 which is commonly encountered in urban sewer pipes and rivers thus swmm was chosen for the river network modeling in the coupled model 2 5 1 vertical linkage in this study vertical linkages connected pipe flows and overland surface flows fig 6 furthermore we assumed that the grid elements containing manholes were the locations where these vertical interactions occurred linkage 1 in fig 6 is vertical linkage 2 5 1 1 drainage condition when the water level on the surface is higher than the water head at the manhole surface runoff flowing into the sewer system through the manhole is determined using the weir equation eq 6 if the pressure head in the manhole is below surface elevation or the orifice equation eq 7 if the pressure head in the manhole is above surface elevation 6 q ex c w w h 2 d 2 g h 2 d if h 1 d z 2 d h 2 d 7 q ex c o a mh 2 g h 2 d h 1 d if z 2 d h 1 d h 2 d where q ex represents the exchange flow rate c w denotes the weir discharge coefficient c o denotes the orifice discharge coefficient w is the perimeter of the manhole a mh is the area of the manhole h 2 d is the water level at the surface h 1 d is the pressure head in the manholes and z 2 d is surface ground elevation 2 5 1 2 flooding condition when the pressure head at the manhole is higher than the water level on the surface water in the sewer system floods onto the surface through manholes and the discharge is determined using the orifice equation eq 3 8 q ex c o a mh 2 g h 1 d h 2 d 2 5 2 lateral linkage linkage 2 in fig 6 is the lateral linkage where river and surface flows are linked via spills between them for this scenario it is assumed that the flow in the river has a primary direction the river flow assumption is still applicable despite overtopping of the river bank or the levee the momentum of the exchange flow is not considered in the surface flow thus the exchange flow is set to be the source term in the surface model for this linkage a simple weir equation is adopted to calculate the absolute value of the exchange flow rate the flow direction is determined from the higher value between the water level in the river and on the surface 9 q ex 0 35 b e h max 2 g h max if h min h max 2 3 0 91 b e h min 2 g h max h min if 2 3 h min h max 1 10 h max max h r h c z e h min min h r h c z e where h r represents the water level in the river h c is the water level on the surface z e denotes the elevation of the weir crest and b e is the width of the weir furthermore the spatial step in swmm is a river section and there may be several grids in connection with a river segment to obtain the position of h r in the corresponding grids linear interpolation was used in this study 2 5 3 longitudinal linkage linkage 3 in fig 6 is the longitudinal linkage where the surface is connected to one end of the river in this situation the swmm model acquired the water levels from the swm as the downstream boundary condition while the swmm model provides the flow rate as the inflow boundary condition there may be several grids relating to the river flow downstream boundary defined as follows 11 z 1 d k 1 m z k l k l where z 1 d is the water level boundary condition for swmm z k is the water level in the linking cell k l k is the linkage width of the linking cell k and l represents the total linkage width 2 5 4 linking steps there are some time step linking methods for coupling swmm and swm models these methods can be classified into three categories the first category considers linking at every time step in this scenario the time step is the minimum value between swmm and swm thus the minimum time step is the coupled model time step the synchronization time which is the time to calculate the water exchange for 1d and 2d models is set at the end of each coupled model time step the second category considers linking steps at certain intervals in this method the time step is still the minimum value between swmm and swm and the synchronization time can be defined as any value within reasonable limits the third category allows the two models to use their own time steps and uses swmm run time as the synchronization time the time steps of the pipe flow calculations are generally larger than those of the surface flow calculations fig 7 is the schematic diagram of three methods δ t coupled i δ t swmm i and δ t swm i refer to the i th time step of coupled model swmm and swm respectively t sync i is the synchronization time this study used the first method for the coupled model 2 5 5 linking strategy swmm is used worldwide for planning analysis and design related to stormwater runoff in sub catchments sewer pipes and rivers the most important reason for linking swmm with swm is that swmm is a free and open source model to flexibly establish the linkages a dynamic link library dll of the swmm source code was utilized although the original dll contains several interface functions for external calls we added some additional interface functions to establish our linkages with the improved source codes swmm was flexibly coupled with swm 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation two recorded historical rainstorms storms 1 and 2 were used to calibrate and validate the coupled model due to data limitations the calibration and validation criteria mainly focused on surface inundation depths and extent most of the parameters that need to be calibrated are in swmm the sensitivity of flow simulations to swmm model parameters has been analyzed and reported in earlier studies barco et al 2008 krebs et al 2013 plenty of researches pointed out that the key parameters for model performance are imperviousness impervious depression storage and manning s n for surface flow and pipe flow thus some parameters that include the sensitive parameters are calibrated by comparing model results with recorded data table 1 shows the calibrated parameters in the coupled model fig 4 presents the inundation extents recorded during storms 1 and 2 fig 8 shows the modeled inundation depths and extents of storm 1 from the coupled model the comparison of figs 9 and 4 shows that the modeled inundation extents were in line with the recorded ones the model results also contained unrecorded inundation extents the stations from which the data were obtained covered most of the areas vulnerable to flooding rather than the entire island thus it is acceptable that some inundation extents are not included in our records table 2 shows more detailed comparisons of maximum inundation depths in general the maximum inundation depths from the coupled model were very close to the recorded inundation values with a maximum absolute error ae of 0 13 m at renmin road and a minimum ae of 0 04 m at wuxi road and peace avenue the calibration results of the inundation extents and depths indicate that the coupled model and the actual values are consistent for storm 1 storm 2 is regarded as the validation scenario in this test case the recorded inundations were compared with the model results the results from the coupled model for storm 2 are presented in fig 9 which shows that both the inundation extents and depths are consistent with the recorded data more detailed inundation depth information is presented in table 3 as with the calibration scenario the modeled inundation depths were close to the recorded ones with a maximum ae of 0 10 m at peace avenue and a minimum ae of 0 m at sanxi road calibration and validation showed that although there are some minor differences between the modeled inundation results and the recorded data on haidian island the inundation extents were still predictable over a large area via coupled model simulations thus the coupled model in this study is relatively accurate for simulating inundations on haidian island 3 2 inundation results under different rainstorm patterns to determine the inundation response to rainstorm patterns three different rainstorm patterns were set as the input scenarios for the coupled model the spatiotemporal results are presented in sections 3 2 1 3 2 3 3 2 1 total inundation volumes total inundation volumes which can numerically reflect holistic severity were obtained during the simulation period and the related hydrograph is presented in fig 10 the red vertical lines represent the times of the rainstorm peaks and the data markers on the curves represent the inundation volume peaks the curve shapes of the inundation volume hydrographs were similar to the rainstorm curves which increase rapidly and then decrease table 4 presents the peak inundation volumes in each rainstorm which ranged from 16 857 57 m3 to 97 660 56 m3 30 664 72 m3 to 145 570 90 m3 and 39 285 32 m3 to 156 641 70 m3 for patterns 1 2 and 3 respectively the inundation volume peaks increase as the rainstorm peak position coefficients increase in the same return period as the return periods increase the inundation volume peaks increase furthermore to examine the inundation occurrence times the ascent stages of fig 10 are magnified in fig 11 in fig 11 the inundation occurrence times of all rainstorm scenarios were very similar the drainage capacities of certain areas of the sewer pipes do not meet drainage requirements thus even a low intensity rainstorm would cause urban flooding 3 2 2 peak appearance time for inundation volume the red vertical lines and marked points in fig 10show that all appearance times of peak inundation volumes were after the peak rainstorm appearance times table 5 presents the details of the time lags between the rainstorm and inundation volume peaks for all rainstorm scenarios pattern 1 had the longest time lags of at least one hour and pattern 3 had the shortest time lags which did not exceed 30 min during rainstorms with the same return period time lags decreased as the position coefficients r increased indicating that later rainstorm peaks result in shorter time lags 3 2 3 inundation positions and depths 3 2 3 1 spatial distribution of inundation fig 12 shows the spatial distributions of inundation under different design scenarios different rainstorm patterns produce different inundation volumes fig 12 highlights the differences in inundation volumes inundation extent and spatial distributions extensive flooding was observed in all design scenarios there are however some differences between them even during the same return period there were considerable differences in the inundation extent between different rainstorm patterns the inundation extents of pattern 1 were significantly lower than those of the other two rainstorm patterns which is consistent with the typical pattern of inundation volumes the inundation extents of pattern 2 were close to those of pattern 3 table 6 shows the total inundation areas for each scenario the inundation areas represent the total areas of cells with inundation depths exceeding 0 02 m as expected the inundation areas increased as the position coefficient r increased 3 2 3 2 inundation depth statistics to compare the differences in inundation depth at the same flood vulnerable positions between the three rainstorm patterns 100 inundation element cells were randomly selected as samples for each scenario the maximum inundation depths of these 100 cells in three different rainstorm patterns were obtained providing each cell with three maximum inundation depths the three inundation depths for each cell were set as its x y and z coordinates finally the 100 points for each return period are presented in fig 13 in fig 13 the x y and z axes represent the inundation depths of rainstorm patterns 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 13 not only shows the spatial distribution of these sampled points but also their projection in three planes in all scenarios on the x y and x z planes most points were located over the x y and x z lines respectively indicating that inundation depths of patterns 2 and 3 were higher than those of pattern 1 at the same position for the y z plane most sample points were located near the y z line indicating that the inundation depths of pattern 2 were very close to those of pattern 3 furthermore there was no significant change in this result as the return period increased 3 3 correlation analysis between inundation volume and fully filled pipes ratio ffpr to illustrate the effects of rainstorm patterns on inundation volume fully filled pipes ratios ffprs were obtained and correlations between inundation volume and ffpr were analyzed ffpr accounts for the total number of pipes in the area table 7 shows that all coefficients were significant at 0 01 indicating that there was a significant relationship between inundation volume and ffpr excluding rainstorm pattern 1 all correlation coefficients were greater than 0 5 for all three rainstorm patterns the correlation coefficients decreased as the return period increased the correlation between inundation volume and ffpr decreased as the rainstorm intensity increased because as the rainstorm intensity increases the number of fully filled pipes increases and the drainage system reaches its full capacity causing inundation however when the rainstorm intensity becomes large enough the contribution of the underground drainage system to the entire drainage system will decrease weakening the correlation the correlation between inundation volume and ffpr was largest for pattern 2 and smallest for pattern 1 because the antecedent rainstorm before the peak during pattern 2 caused most pipes to almost reach their capacities the inundation volumes increased with increasing ffpr when the rainstorm peak arrived indicating that ffpr and inundation volumes are well synchronized this relationship is not as clear in the other two rainstorm patterns 3 4 ffpr of different rainstorm patterns in this section the effects of rainstorm patterns on inundation volume were analyzed in more detail fig 14 shows the variation in ffpr during the ten minutes before the peak of the storm in each column in fig 14 the bottom represents the ffpr ten minutes before the peak while the top represents the ffpr at the peak thus the ffpr increase as the return period increased for the same rainstorm pattern meanwhile in the same return period the ffpr increased as the position coefficients of the rainstorm peak increase furthermore during the ten minutes before the peak the variation in ffpr under rainstorm patterns 1 and 2 increased as the return period increased however variations were smaller under rainstorm pattern 3 as the return period was longer these results can explain the response of inundation to rainstorm patterns when the rainstorm peak arrives early the underground sewer system has sufficient capacity to drain a large proportion of the runoff to the outfalls leading to less inundation in pattern 1 small areas of the pipes are filled and the drainage capacity for most of the remaining pipes is more than sufficient before the rainstorm peak arrives when the rainfall peaks arrive in the middle of the storm as in pattern 2 although the antecedent rainstorm fills the small areas of sewer pipes the pipes rapidly become filled during the ten minutes before the peak leading to severe inundation the reason for the rapidly increasing ffpr is that large areas of the pipes almost reach their capacities in pattern 2 when the rainstorm peak is at the end of the rainstorm as in pattern 3 the antecedent rainstorm fills large areas of sewer pipes and the ffpr are already high ten minutes before the peak thus the number of fully filled pipes increases slowly during this period although the ffpr increase slowly during the ten minutes before the peak the high ffpr still causes severe inundation in summary the later the rainstorm peak arrives the higher the ffpr will be at that point 3 5 suitability of the rainstorm peak position coefficient the design rainstorm is often regarded as the rainstorm condition that the urban sewer system was designed to accommodate generally the return period is the most important coefficient in the design rainstorm to determine the sewer system design and investment required however the position coefficient also has a large impact on urban inundation and thus on the sewer system design for example if we simply consider inundation volumes and areas we find that pattern 1 with a return period of 100a is equivalent to pattern 3 with a return period of 10a the rainstorm peak position coefficient plays a vital role in this scenario according to the model results of this study the inundation severity increases as the position coefficient increases in china the position coefficient of the design rainstorm peak which is typically located between 0 35 and 0 45 for a single peak rainstorm is close to the middle which is reasonable if the position coefficient of the design rainstorm peak is set to be too large such as 0 8 this will lead to excessive safety measures and a waste of resources however if the position coefficient is set to be too small such as 0 2 this will decrease safety thus based on the research presented in this paper the range of the position coefficient of design rainstorm peaks in china is suitable 3 6 inundation management increasing demands for urban rainwater management driven by rapid population growth and climate change is pushing urban drainage systems to be more resilient urban inundation management is one of the vital components of rainwater management to improve resilience the sensitivity factors of urban inundation should be deeply explored the results show that urban inundation is susceptible to rainstorm patterns to suitably manage urban inundation the results of this study can be applied to two aspects of urban construction first they can be applied in designing drainage systems in newly developing districts local rainstorm analysis including rainstorm intensity interval and duration data as well as the peak coefficient should be implemented to guide urban drainage planning following local rainstorm analysis numerical modeling should be conducted to aid suitable sewer pipe design second for already established districts inundation can be effectively managed by controlling the ffpr which is significantly related to surface inundation both small rainfall events and large rainfall events should be considered in the case of small rainfall events low impact development lid can provide effective measures such as depressed lawns green roofs and permeable paving to control the ffpr for example a green roof which can easily be achieved by rebuilding a traditional roof does not occupy any new space and reduces the volume of rainfall flowing directly into the sewer system however lid has a small effect on controlling surface runoff entering the sewer system during the large rainfall events in that case because of the hydraulic restrictions of the drainage system urban inundation still occurs thus the drainage system also needs upgrading which suggests a combination of green and grey infrastructures into a hybrid control system the china housing and urban rural development 2014 initiative introduced the sponge city construction project in 2014 to improve urban resilience against climate changes and rainfall induced disasters although the main technology is lid the integration of green infrastructure integrating with grey infrastructure in urban construction has been recognized by domestic experts and scholars many studies casal campos et al 2015 dong et al 2017 report that the combination of green and grey strategies benefits inundation management and offers a potential for robustness in enhancing the system resilience thus for established districts the combination of green and grey infrastructure may be the best strategy to control ffpr and achieve inundation management moreover prepositioning of temporary drainage facilities at critical positions vulnerable to flooding could significantly reduce or even avoid potential losses 4 conclusions in this study a new urban inundation model which couples swmm and swm is introduced to simulate inundation on haidian island and to investigate the response of urban inundation to rainstorm patterns the coupled model was successfully applied to haidian island using rainstorms 1 and 2 as calibration and validation data respectively three rainstorm patterns were set as the rainstorm scenarios of the coupled model the main conclusions are listed below 1 a flexible approach to couple swmm and 2d swm through dll file is introduced this approach avoids compiling complicated codes of swmm and may provide some ideas for the flexible use of swmm and the coupled model overflows between urban channel and ground surface are modeled through the lateral linkage of swmm and swm which provide a new understanding of swmm coupling 2 the comparison of simulated inundation results of the three rainstorm patterns shows that with a later rainstorm peak arrival time inundation will become more severe reflected in inundation volumes depths and extents the time lags between the rainstorm peak and inundation volume peak will be shorter with later rainstorm peak arrival times 3 based on the significant differences among the inundation results of the three rainstorm patterns the effects of position coefficients on urban inundation cannot be ignored in urban inundation management rainstorms with smaller intensity and larger position coefficients may cause inundation levels similar to rainstorms with larger intensity and smaller position coefficients such as the inundation of rainstorm pattern 3 with a return period of 10a which is equivalent to that of pattern 1 with a return period of 100a 4 correlation analysis applied to ffpr and inundation severity shows that underground sewer system ffpr is related to the inundation severity at a significance level of 99 higher ffpr before the rainstorm peak will lead to more severe inundation and vice versa 5 the position coefficient of the design rainstorm peak is typically located between 0 35 and 0 45 for a single peak rainstorm in china this study indicates and reconfirms the appropriateness of the range of position coefficients of design rainstorm peaks in china to avoid excessive safety measures and waste of resource as well as insufficient safety measures 6 in the wake of climate change a sustainable urban drainage system should be functional in the present and adaptive in the uncertain future enhancement of urban drainage system resilience becomes the task that requires no delay the results of this study can help decision makers in drainage design of newly developing districts and in the renewal of established districts this detailed inundation analysis allows for a better understanding of the potential impacts of rainstorm patterns on urban inundation and may aid policymakers and other stakeholders in developing suitable measures for urban flood risk management and increasing the urban drainage resilience acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51739011 51741903 and the national key research and development program of china 2017yfc1502704 the authors would also like to extend their thanks to three anonymous

7113,with rapid urbanization rainstorm induced inundation losses are becoming increasingly severe research on urban inundation response to rainstorm patterns can help engineers and governments make appropriate decisions and mitigate property losses this paper introduces a new hydrodynamic model that couples the storm water management model swmm and the shallow water model swm and applies the validated model to the haidian island case to determine the inundation response to rainstorm patterns the results show that the coupled model can predict rainstorm induced inundation well and that different rainstorm patterns would result in different inundation patterns with increasing rainstorm peak position coefficients urban inundation events become more severe and inundation peaks appear sooner however the times at which inundation occurs do not change to determine the reasons for the differences in inundation among different rainstorm patterns correlations between the inundation volume and the fully filled pipes ratio were analyzed correlation analysis showed that inundation events are significantly related to the working state of the sewer system indicating that a higher fully filled pipes ratio prior to the rainstorm peak will result in more severe inundation this conclusion suggests that the range of rainstorm peak position coefficients in china is quite reasonable this result can provide insights to engineers and the government for urban design planning and maintenance keywords urban inundation rainstorm pattern coupled hydrodynamic model stormwater management 1 introduction urban inundation is among the most common and destructive natural hazards resulting in considerable direct losses hammond et al 2015 price and vojinovic 2008 this problem is not exclusive to china and is a challenge faced around the world coles et al 2017 marques et al 2017 in recent years escalating inundation hazards have gained public attention and led to increased fiscal expenditures on urban drainage management infrastructure due to the significant economic losses they cause in urban areas inundation management in urban areas is a growing priority due to the factors such as continuing migration of people from rural areas to cities unplanned development climate change and growing operational and maintenance costs urban resilience has also become a popular subject both for researchers and policymakers meerow et al 2016 enhancement of urban resilience has emerged as a challenging task for researchers worldwide with the development of numerical methods and computational technologies numerical modeling provides an opportunity to address these factors and has become the most popular method for providing engineers with detailed information on flood risk management and urban planning teng et al 2017 furthermore it is not only the rainstorm intensity that influences urban inundation but also the type of rainstorm using numerical modeling we can investigate the urban inundation response to rainstorm patterns avoid inundation risks in the urban design and planning phase and mitigate risks in the maintenance phase among the numerical models one dimensional 1d sewer hydraulic models are the most common ones because the required data are inexpensive and the process is highly efficient producing satisfactory results there are currently many 1d sewer software packages available for urban drainage simulations such as storm water management model swmm rossman 2010 and simulation of interaction between pipe flow and surface overland flow in networks sipson djordjević et al 2005 swmm is an open source software package developed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa globally it is the most popular model for hydraulic sewer characteristic analysis hsu et al 2000 krebs et al 2014 wijesiri et al 2016 because of its comprehensive functions and public availability swmm is widely adopted as a computational engine in commercial software programs such as infoworks icm innovyze 2014 pcswmm james et al 2003 and xp swmm elliott and trowsdale 2007 however most of these sewer hydraulic models cannot suitably model surface flooding because they use water stage volume curves method to determine the flood depths on the ground this method can be divided into two categories the first method predetermines the ponding area for each manhole before simulation and divides the flood volumes by ponding areas to obtain the inundation depth ji 1998 rossman 2010 the second method calculates the total flood volumes of the sewer system and uses the water stage volume curve for the whole area to determine inundation depths gouldby et al 2008 krupka et al 2007 in the water stage volume curve method flood waters can be reintroduced into the sewer system as allowed by the system s capacity although they are efficient and simple these methods contain too many subjective components and cannot accurately describe the movement of flood waters because they cannot predict flow velocity and surface water direction which are important factors in inundation risk analysis merz et al 2007 to address this issue hydrodynamic surface flow models were proposed for dual drainage systems there are two approaches frequently used to model overland flow in a dual drainage system the first approach assumes that overland flood waters are restricted to streets and that inundation events only occur in areas with a lower elevation the surface ground drainage system is simplified into a series of open channels and storage areas then the dual drainage system can be modeled using a 1d model djordjević et al 2005 the second method assumes that there is no restriction on overland flow and the flow can enter any area if the physical characteristics allow it with this method the streets depressions and buildings can be described in detail in a two dimensional 2d model noh et al 2016 zhang and pan 2014 the first method takes less time than the second but it is less accurate the second method is becoming increasingly popular due to its accuracy and advanced computational characteristic many studies have been conducted to simulate urban stormwater inundation following these approaches chen et al 2005 kang 2009 hsu et al 2000 first developed a coupled 1d and 2d model for urban inundation simulation the water exchange between the 1d and 2d models at that time was unidirectional i e water can overflow from the 1d sewer model to the 2d surface model but it cannot flow from the 2d model to the 1d model a bidirectional linkage method was first applied by chen et al 2005 in urban inundation modeling in recent years bidirectional linkage methods have becomes popular for coupling the 1d and 2d models leandro et al 2009 seyoum et al 2011 yu and huang 2014 developed a combined 1d and 2d model for shallow water flows in which an implicit dual time stepping method was applied to the 2d model to improve run time efficiency borsche and klar 2014 proposed a numerical model for a sewer network coupled to the surface flow wu et al 2017 outlined a coupled 1d 2d hydrodynamic model based on swmm and lisflood fp to simulate urban inundation commercial software developers provided various urban inundation models including mike flood flood 2011 and infoworks icm innovyze 2014 that can also properly simulate urban inundation apart from the studies on model theory and construction many researchers focused on urban inundation analysis or risk assessment the effect of key urban features the effect of model treatments and future scenario analyses huang et al 2017 martins et al 2016 savage et al 2016 vojinovic et al 2013 chen et al 2016 proposed a new research approach to study a dynamic process the overflow from sewer systems mainly starts at the inlet until the pressure head in the manhole is high enough to lift its cover up in the coupled surface and sewer flow modeling leandro et al 2016 presented a coupled model and investigated how the rainfall runoff dynamics of key urban features such as consist of buildings and permeable land surfaces taken from open street map haklay and weber 2008 can be conceptualized and included in urban flood models not all researchers study urban inundation using their own models some utilize commercial models abdullah et al 2012 provided an improved methodology for processing raw light detection and ranging lidar data and used mike11 mike21 to verify their methodology because of climate change and growing urban populations many researchers focus on the effects of rainfall intensity on urban inundation not on the effects of rainfall patterns on urban inundation furthermore urban drainage planning is particularly important and should contain above and below ground drainage systems most models require costly commercial modules that limit their use and open source academic research models have been relatively scarce until recently this paper first introduces a newly established model which is based on swmm and 2d shallow water model swm yu et al 2015 couples underground drainage systems river networks and surface flows this 2d model is efficient for shallow water flows and uses the lowe upper symmetric gauss seidel lu sgs implicit dual time stepping method based on unstructured grids then we explore the urban inundation response to rainstorm patterns in a case study of the haidian island finally we illustrate the relevance of the rainstorm peak coefficient of 0 35 0 45 in urban planning and design for single peak rainstorms in china cen et al 1998 through our results and provide recommendations for urban drainage planning and inundation modeling 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study site we selected haidian island in the northern hainan province of china as our research region fig 1 haidian island which constitutes the northern part of haikou is a typical delta island with an area of 13 8 km2 and is situated within the nandu river estuary the annual average temperature and rainfall are 24 3 c and 2067 mm respectively typical of the tropical oceanic monsoon climate haidian island is a highly urbanized area containing numerous businesses campuses and residential areas the coverage of impervious areas reaches 70 this island does not have industrial pollution problems its environmental quality creates the best living conditions in haikou city although haidian island is a newly developed area its sewer system is insufficient for its current drainage needs most of the sewer system is designed for one or two year return periods thus inundation is a normal occurrence during rainstorms in haidian island in 2011 a rainstorm hit the entire haikou city causing direct economic losses of 96 93 million haidian island experienced significant damage from that rainstorm and many streets were severely flooded therefore it is a suitable site to study the characteristics of rainfall induced inundations 2 2 data availability and processing 2 2 1 topographic data digital elevation models dem are derived by applying interpolations to previously measured scattered elevation points before interpolation incorrect elevation values were revised by deleting any incidental measurements of rooftops the incorrect points constituted a small proportion of the total dataset therefore therefore the deletions did not impact the accuracy of the dem the building profiles were distinguished through high resolution google remote sensing images further buildings were regarded as non flooding zones thus they were excluded from meshing to ensure that they were not modeled as flooding zones 2 2 2 drainage system data the drainage system data provided by the haikou drainage management bureau contained geographic and geometric information on the pipes manholes rivers and storage areas e g holding ponds rainwater and wastewater in the study area are drained separately the diameters of the pipes ranged from 0 15 to 2 00 m and the depths of the manholes ranged from 0 23 to 5 00 m there are three rivers in the research region the wuxi open channel and the yawei and baisha rivers these rivers have been improved artificially a few years ago and most of their cross sections are now rectangular thus the rivers were set as rectangular open channels in the model there are eight artificial lakes on the island which were set as storage nodes in the model consequently 2690 pipes and open channels 2677 manholes 60 outfalls and eight storages were included in the model fig 1 2 2 3 rainstorm data two recorded historical rainstorms storm 1 and storm 2 were used to calibrate and validate the coupled model these two rainstorms occurred on october 5 2011 and october 5 2010 respectively the rainstorm data were obtained from the china meteorological data service center http cdc nmic cn home do storm 1 started at 10 00 on october 5 2011 and ended at 1 00 the next day it is a unimodal rainstorm with the maximum intensity of 88 1 mm h occurred at 13 00 storm 2 started at 19 00 on october 5 2010 and lasted about 15 h different from storm 1 storm 2 is a bimodal rainstorm the first rainfall peak occurred at 8 00 with an intensity of 34 5 mm h and the second rainfall peak occurred at 1 00 with an intensity of 31 9 mm h fig 2 shows the hydrographs of the storms although these two rainstorms are both equivalent to less than 1a return period rainstorm based only on the rainstorm peak intensity the durations and rainfall totals of historical rainstorms exceed those of design rainstorms thus it is very likely that both rainstorms would cause severe inundation in fact according to a news report liang 2011 storm 1 caused severe inundation in many streets including wuxi road renmin road peace avenue and haida road with an average inundation depth of 0 5 m resulting in traffic disruption and severe economic losses in addition three patterns of rainstorms with return periods of 1a 5a 10a 20a 50a and 100a fig 3 were used as model inputs to study the inundation response according to the bureau of municipal and rural construction the rainfall intensity on haidian island can be summarized using eq 1 the chicago approach keifer and chu 1957 was used to redistribute the rainfall amounts before and after the peaks the main difference among the three rainstorm patterns is the position of the peak rainfall which is controlled by the rainfall peak position coefficient r the rainfall peak position coefficients were set to 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 we named these three rainstorms as pattern 1 pattern 2 and pattern 3 1 q 3245 114 1 0 2561 lg p t 17 172 0 654 where q is the rainfall intensity l s h a p is the return period of rainstorms yr and t is the rainstorm duration in minutes 2 2 4 observed historical inundation events observed historical inundation data are key to model calibration the haikou drainage management bureau provided the inundation data for rainstorms that occurred on october 5 2011 and october 5 2010 i e storm 1 and storm 2 several cameras were set up on the roadside near seven recorded inundation positions and the maximum inundation depths and inundation extents were obtained from video images fig 4 shows the observed historical inundation extents sea levels were also recorded during storm 1 and storm 2 which would be set as outfall conditions in the model thus in this analysis storm 1 was set for calibration while storm 2 was set for validation 2 3 swmm model in this study sewer flow in the underground drainage system and the rainfall runoff process were simulated using swmm developed by the usepa swmm is a dynamic hydrology hydraulic water quality simulation model that is used worldwide for planning analysis and design in relation to stormwater runoff rossman 2010 it conceptualizes a drainage system as a series of water and material flows between several environmental compartments these compartments include the atmosphere land surface groundwater and transport in general channel and pipe flow routings are governed by the saint venant equations de st venant 1871 saint venant equations consist of mass conservation eq 2 and momentum conservation eq 2 equations for gradually varying unsteady flow in the transport compartment swmm solves the saint venant equation using the implicit finite difference method and successive approximation 2 a t q x 0 3 q t q 2 a x g a h x g a s f 0 where q is the flow rate a is the flow cross sectional area h is the hydraulic head of water in the conduit z y z is the conduit invert elevation y is the conduit water depth x is the longitudinal distance v is the velocity t denotes time g is the acceleration of gravity and sf is the friction slope head loss per unit length 2 4 shallow water model the swm is an efficient and robust model for predicting shallow water flow following the lu sgs implicit dual time step method based on an unstructured mesh yu et al 2015 the governing equations are shown in a matrix form as follows 4 u t e x g y s where u e and g are vectors of conserved flow variables and fluxes in the x and y directions and s is a source vector containing the bed slope s b and friction s f sources the vectors are expressed as 5 u h h u h v e hu h u 2 g h 2 b 2 2 h u v g hv h u v h v 2 g h 2 b 2 2 s s b s f 0 g h b s ox g h s fx g h b s oy g h s fy where h u v and b represent water depth depth averaged velocity in the x and y directions and bottom elevation respectively g is the acceleration of gravity at 9 81 m s2 sox and soy are the bed slopes in the x and y directions respectively and s fx and s fy represent the friction slopes in the x and y directions respectively the fluxes and gravity terms are written in this form to mathematically balance them without the need for flux correction more details of this shallow water model can be found in yu et al 2015 2 5 coupled swmm swm we simultaneously simulated the flow dynamics in sewer networks rivers and on overland surfaces by coupling the swmm and swm models the two models were executed individually at every single time step and then connected through appropriate linkages chen et al 2007 to exchange information obtained at suitable locations at the end of every time step in general flow exchange occurs at the connection between the surface flows and pipe or river flows thus three types of linkages including vertical lateral and longitudinal linkages were implemented and studied here the relationships between these two models and the three linkages are presented in fig 5 note that swmm is not the best tool for river network modeling there are key differences between river network models and swmm in generally models divide the entire river into subsections the river network models which are more suitable for river network modeling than swmm set river cross sections as gradually varying in each subsection however swmm assumes that each subsection has a fixed cross profile rossman 2017 this assumption in swmm is not generally suitable for a natural river but it is suitable for urban rivers with similar cross profiles therefore the shortcomings of swmm for river network modeling have a negligible effect on this study if a third river network model were chosen to handle river network modeling in the coupled model the coupled model would be more complicated and a great deal of additional work would be needed moreover swmm can handle various hydraulic structures such as pumps orifices and water gates rossman 2010 which is commonly encountered in urban sewer pipes and rivers thus swmm was chosen for the river network modeling in the coupled model 2 5 1 vertical linkage in this study vertical linkages connected pipe flows and overland surface flows fig 6 furthermore we assumed that the grid elements containing manholes were the locations where these vertical interactions occurred linkage 1 in fig 6 is vertical linkage 2 5 1 1 drainage condition when the water level on the surface is higher than the water head at the manhole surface runoff flowing into the sewer system through the manhole is determined using the weir equation eq 6 if the pressure head in the manhole is below surface elevation or the orifice equation eq 7 if the pressure head in the manhole is above surface elevation 6 q ex c w w h 2 d 2 g h 2 d if h 1 d z 2 d h 2 d 7 q ex c o a mh 2 g h 2 d h 1 d if z 2 d h 1 d h 2 d where q ex represents the exchange flow rate c w denotes the weir discharge coefficient c o denotes the orifice discharge coefficient w is the perimeter of the manhole a mh is the area of the manhole h 2 d is the water level at the surface h 1 d is the pressure head in the manholes and z 2 d is surface ground elevation 2 5 1 2 flooding condition when the pressure head at the manhole is higher than the water level on the surface water in the sewer system floods onto the surface through manholes and the discharge is determined using the orifice equation eq 3 8 q ex c o a mh 2 g h 1 d h 2 d 2 5 2 lateral linkage linkage 2 in fig 6 is the lateral linkage where river and surface flows are linked via spills between them for this scenario it is assumed that the flow in the river has a primary direction the river flow assumption is still applicable despite overtopping of the river bank or the levee the momentum of the exchange flow is not considered in the surface flow thus the exchange flow is set to be the source term in the surface model for this linkage a simple weir equation is adopted to calculate the absolute value of the exchange flow rate the flow direction is determined from the higher value between the water level in the river and on the surface 9 q ex 0 35 b e h max 2 g h max if h min h max 2 3 0 91 b e h min 2 g h max h min if 2 3 h min h max 1 10 h max max h r h c z e h min min h r h c z e where h r represents the water level in the river h c is the water level on the surface z e denotes the elevation of the weir crest and b e is the width of the weir furthermore the spatial step in swmm is a river section and there may be several grids in connection with a river segment to obtain the position of h r in the corresponding grids linear interpolation was used in this study 2 5 3 longitudinal linkage linkage 3 in fig 6 is the longitudinal linkage where the surface is connected to one end of the river in this situation the swmm model acquired the water levels from the swm as the downstream boundary condition while the swmm model provides the flow rate as the inflow boundary condition there may be several grids relating to the river flow downstream boundary defined as follows 11 z 1 d k 1 m z k l k l where z 1 d is the water level boundary condition for swmm z k is the water level in the linking cell k l k is the linkage width of the linking cell k and l represents the total linkage width 2 5 4 linking steps there are some time step linking methods for coupling swmm and swm models these methods can be classified into three categories the first category considers linking at every time step in this scenario the time step is the minimum value between swmm and swm thus the minimum time step is the coupled model time step the synchronization time which is the time to calculate the water exchange for 1d and 2d models is set at the end of each coupled model time step the second category considers linking steps at certain intervals in this method the time step is still the minimum value between swmm and swm and the synchronization time can be defined as any value within reasonable limits the third category allows the two models to use their own time steps and uses swmm run time as the synchronization time the time steps of the pipe flow calculations are generally larger than those of the surface flow calculations fig 7 is the schematic diagram of three methods δ t coupled i δ t swmm i and δ t swm i refer to the i th time step of coupled model swmm and swm respectively t sync i is the synchronization time this study used the first method for the coupled model 2 5 5 linking strategy swmm is used worldwide for planning analysis and design related to stormwater runoff in sub catchments sewer pipes and rivers the most important reason for linking swmm with swm is that swmm is a free and open source model to flexibly establish the linkages a dynamic link library dll of the swmm source code was utilized although the original dll contains several interface functions for external calls we added some additional interface functions to establish our linkages with the improved source codes swmm was flexibly coupled with swm 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation two recorded historical rainstorms storms 1 and 2 were used to calibrate and validate the coupled model due to data limitations the calibration and validation criteria mainly focused on surface inundation depths and extent most of the parameters that need to be calibrated are in swmm the sensitivity of flow simulations to swmm model parameters has been analyzed and reported in earlier studies barco et al 2008 krebs et al 2013 plenty of researches pointed out that the key parameters for model performance are imperviousness impervious depression storage and manning s n for surface flow and pipe flow thus some parameters that include the sensitive parameters are calibrated by comparing model results with recorded data table 1 shows the calibrated parameters in the coupled model fig 4 presents the inundation extents recorded during storms 1 and 2 fig 8 shows the modeled inundation depths and extents of storm 1 from the coupled model the comparison of figs 9 and 4 shows that the modeled inundation extents were in line with the recorded ones the model results also contained unrecorded inundation extents the stations from which the data were obtained covered most of the areas vulnerable to flooding rather than the entire island thus it is acceptable that some inundation extents are not included in our records table 2 shows more detailed comparisons of maximum inundation depths in general the maximum inundation depths from the coupled model were very close to the recorded inundation values with a maximum absolute error ae of 0 13 m at renmin road and a minimum ae of 0 04 m at wuxi road and peace avenue the calibration results of the inundation extents and depths indicate that the coupled model and the actual values are consistent for storm 1 storm 2 is regarded as the validation scenario in this test case the recorded inundations were compared with the model results the results from the coupled model for storm 2 are presented in fig 9 which shows that both the inundation extents and depths are consistent with the recorded data more detailed inundation depth information is presented in table 3 as with the calibration scenario the modeled inundation depths were close to the recorded ones with a maximum ae of 0 10 m at peace avenue and a minimum ae of 0 m at sanxi road calibration and validation showed that although there are some minor differences between the modeled inundation results and the recorded data on haidian island the inundation extents were still predictable over a large area via coupled model simulations thus the coupled model in this study is relatively accurate for simulating inundations on haidian island 3 2 inundation results under different rainstorm patterns to determine the inundation response to rainstorm patterns three different rainstorm patterns were set as the input scenarios for the coupled model the spatiotemporal results are presented in sections 3 2 1 3 2 3 3 2 1 total inundation volumes total inundation volumes which can numerically reflect holistic severity were obtained during the simulation period and the related hydrograph is presented in fig 10 the red vertical lines represent the times of the rainstorm peaks and the data markers on the curves represent the inundation volume peaks the curve shapes of the inundation volume hydrographs were similar to the rainstorm curves which increase rapidly and then decrease table 4 presents the peak inundation volumes in each rainstorm which ranged from 16 857 57 m3 to 97 660 56 m3 30 664 72 m3 to 145 570 90 m3 and 39 285 32 m3 to 156 641 70 m3 for patterns 1 2 and 3 respectively the inundation volume peaks increase as the rainstorm peak position coefficients increase in the same return period as the return periods increase the inundation volume peaks increase furthermore to examine the inundation occurrence times the ascent stages of fig 10 are magnified in fig 11 in fig 11 the inundation occurrence times of all rainstorm scenarios were very similar the drainage capacities of certain areas of the sewer pipes do not meet drainage requirements thus even a low intensity rainstorm would cause urban flooding 3 2 2 peak appearance time for inundation volume the red vertical lines and marked points in fig 10show that all appearance times of peak inundation volumes were after the peak rainstorm appearance times table 5 presents the details of the time lags between the rainstorm and inundation volume peaks for all rainstorm scenarios pattern 1 had the longest time lags of at least one hour and pattern 3 had the shortest time lags which did not exceed 30 min during rainstorms with the same return period time lags decreased as the position coefficients r increased indicating that later rainstorm peaks result in shorter time lags 3 2 3 inundation positions and depths 3 2 3 1 spatial distribution of inundation fig 12 shows the spatial distributions of inundation under different design scenarios different rainstorm patterns produce different inundation volumes fig 12 highlights the differences in inundation volumes inundation extent and spatial distributions extensive flooding was observed in all design scenarios there are however some differences between them even during the same return period there were considerable differences in the inundation extent between different rainstorm patterns the inundation extents of pattern 1 were significantly lower than those of the other two rainstorm patterns which is consistent with the typical pattern of inundation volumes the inundation extents of pattern 2 were close to those of pattern 3 table 6 shows the total inundation areas for each scenario the inundation areas represent the total areas of cells with inundation depths exceeding 0 02 m as expected the inundation areas increased as the position coefficient r increased 3 2 3 2 inundation depth statistics to compare the differences in inundation depth at the same flood vulnerable positions between the three rainstorm patterns 100 inundation element cells were randomly selected as samples for each scenario the maximum inundation depths of these 100 cells in three different rainstorm patterns were obtained providing each cell with three maximum inundation depths the three inundation depths for each cell were set as its x y and z coordinates finally the 100 points for each return period are presented in fig 13 in fig 13 the x y and z axes represent the inundation depths of rainstorm patterns 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 13 not only shows the spatial distribution of these sampled points but also their projection in three planes in all scenarios on the x y and x z planes most points were located over the x y and x z lines respectively indicating that inundation depths of patterns 2 and 3 were higher than those of pattern 1 at the same position for the y z plane most sample points were located near the y z line indicating that the inundation depths of pattern 2 were very close to those of pattern 3 furthermore there was no significant change in this result as the return period increased 3 3 correlation analysis between inundation volume and fully filled pipes ratio ffpr to illustrate the effects of rainstorm patterns on inundation volume fully filled pipes ratios ffprs were obtained and correlations between inundation volume and ffpr were analyzed ffpr accounts for the total number of pipes in the area table 7 shows that all coefficients were significant at 0 01 indicating that there was a significant relationship between inundation volume and ffpr excluding rainstorm pattern 1 all correlation coefficients were greater than 0 5 for all three rainstorm patterns the correlation coefficients decreased as the return period increased the correlation between inundation volume and ffpr decreased as the rainstorm intensity increased because as the rainstorm intensity increases the number of fully filled pipes increases and the drainage system reaches its full capacity causing inundation however when the rainstorm intensity becomes large enough the contribution of the underground drainage system to the entire drainage system will decrease weakening the correlation the correlation between inundation volume and ffpr was largest for pattern 2 and smallest for pattern 1 because the antecedent rainstorm before the peak during pattern 2 caused most pipes to almost reach their capacities the inundation volumes increased with increasing ffpr when the rainstorm peak arrived indicating that ffpr and inundation volumes are well synchronized this relationship is not as clear in the other two rainstorm patterns 3 4 ffpr of different rainstorm patterns in this section the effects of rainstorm patterns on inundation volume were analyzed in more detail fig 14 shows the variation in ffpr during the ten minutes before the peak of the storm in each column in fig 14 the bottom represents the ffpr ten minutes before the peak while the top represents the ffpr at the peak thus the ffpr increase as the return period increased for the same rainstorm pattern meanwhile in the same return period the ffpr increased as the position coefficients of the rainstorm peak increase furthermore during the ten minutes before the peak the variation in ffpr under rainstorm patterns 1 and 2 increased as the return period increased however variations were smaller under rainstorm pattern 3 as the return period was longer these results can explain the response of inundation to rainstorm patterns when the rainstorm peak arrives early the underground sewer system has sufficient capacity to drain a large proportion of the runoff to the outfalls leading to less inundation in pattern 1 small areas of the pipes are filled and the drainage capacity for most of the remaining pipes is more than sufficient before the rainstorm peak arrives when the rainfall peaks arrive in the middle of the storm as in pattern 2 although the antecedent rainstorm fills the small areas of sewer pipes the pipes rapidly become filled during the ten minutes before the peak leading to severe inundation the reason for the rapidly increasing ffpr is that large areas of the pipes almost reach their capacities in pattern 2 when the rainstorm peak is at the end of the rainstorm as in pattern 3 the antecedent rainstorm fills large areas of sewer pipes and the ffpr are already high ten minutes before the peak thus the number of fully filled pipes increases slowly during this period although the ffpr increase slowly during the ten minutes before the peak the high ffpr still causes severe inundation in summary the later the rainstorm peak arrives the higher the ffpr will be at that point 3 5 suitability of the rainstorm peak position coefficient the design rainstorm is often regarded as the rainstorm condition that the urban sewer system was designed to accommodate generally the return period is the most important coefficient in the design rainstorm to determine the sewer system design and investment required however the position coefficient also has a large impact on urban inundation and thus on the sewer system design for example if we simply consider inundation volumes and areas we find that pattern 1 with a return period of 100a is equivalent to pattern 3 with a return period of 10a the rainstorm peak position coefficient plays a vital role in this scenario according to the model results of this study the inundation severity increases as the position coefficient increases in china the position coefficient of the design rainstorm peak which is typically located between 0 35 and 0 45 for a single peak rainstorm is close to the middle which is reasonable if the position coefficient of the design rainstorm peak is set to be too large such as 0 8 this will lead to excessive safety measures and a waste of resources however if the position coefficient is set to be too small such as 0 2 this will decrease safety thus based on the research presented in this paper the range of the position coefficient of design rainstorm peaks in china is suitable 3 6 inundation management increasing demands for urban rainwater management driven by rapid population growth and climate change is pushing urban drainage systems to be more resilient urban inundation management is one of the vital components of rainwater management to improve resilience the sensitivity factors of urban inundation should be deeply explored the results show that urban inundation is susceptible to rainstorm patterns to suitably manage urban inundation the results of this study can be applied to two aspects of urban construction first they can be applied in designing drainage systems in newly developing districts local rainstorm analysis including rainstorm intensity interval and duration data as well as the peak coefficient should be implemented to guide urban drainage planning following local rainstorm analysis numerical modeling should be conducted to aid suitable sewer pipe design second for already established districts inundation can be effectively managed by controlling the ffpr which is significantly related to surface inundation both small rainfall events and large rainfall events should be considered in the case of small rainfall events low impact development lid can provide effective measures such as depressed lawns green roofs and permeable paving to control the ffpr for example a green roof which can easily be achieved by rebuilding a traditional roof does not occupy any new space and reduces the volume of rainfall flowing directly into the sewer system however lid has a small effect on controlling surface runoff entering the sewer system during the large rainfall events in that case because of the hydraulic restrictions of the drainage system urban inundation still occurs thus the drainage system also needs upgrading which suggests a combination of green and grey infrastructures into a hybrid control system the china housing and urban rural development 2014 initiative introduced the sponge city construction project in 2014 to improve urban resilience against climate changes and rainfall induced disasters although the main technology is lid the integration of green infrastructure integrating with grey infrastructure in urban construction has been recognized by domestic experts and scholars many studies casal campos et al 2015 dong et al 2017 report that the combination of green and grey strategies benefits inundation management and offers a potential for robustness in enhancing the system resilience thus for established districts the combination of green and grey infrastructure may be the best strategy to control ffpr and achieve inundation management moreover prepositioning of temporary drainage facilities at critical positions vulnerable to flooding could significantly reduce or even avoid potential losses 4 conclusions in this study a new urban inundation model which couples swmm and swm is introduced to simulate inundation on haidian island and to investigate the response of urban inundation to rainstorm patterns the coupled model was successfully applied to haidian island using rainstorms 1 and 2 as calibration and validation data respectively three rainstorm patterns were set as the rainstorm scenarios of the coupled model the main conclusions are listed below 1 a flexible approach to couple swmm and 2d swm through dll file is introduced this approach avoids compiling complicated codes of swmm and may provide some ideas for the flexible use of swmm and the coupled model overflows between urban channel and ground surface are modeled through the lateral linkage of swmm and swm which provide a new understanding of swmm coupling 2 the comparison of simulated inundation results of the three rainstorm patterns shows that with a later rainstorm peak arrival time inundation will become more severe reflected in inundation volumes depths and extents the time lags between the rainstorm peak and inundation volume peak will be shorter with later rainstorm peak arrival times 3 based on the significant differences among the inundation results of the three rainstorm patterns the effects of position coefficients on urban inundation cannot be ignored in urban inundation management rainstorms with smaller intensity and larger position coefficients may cause inundation levels similar to rainstorms with larger intensity and smaller position coefficients such as the inundation of rainstorm pattern 3 with a return period of 10a which is equivalent to that of pattern 1 with a return period of 100a 4 correlation analysis applied to ffpr and inundation severity shows that underground sewer system ffpr is related to the inundation severity at a significance level of 99 higher ffpr before the rainstorm peak will lead to more severe inundation and vice versa 5 the position coefficient of the design rainstorm peak is typically located between 0 35 and 0 45 for a single peak rainstorm in china this study indicates and reconfirms the appropriateness of the range of position coefficients of design rainstorm peaks in china to avoid excessive safety measures and waste of resource as well as insufficient safety measures 6 in the wake of climate change a sustainable urban drainage system should be functional in the present and adaptive in the uncertain future enhancement of urban drainage system resilience becomes the task that requires no delay the results of this study can help decision makers in drainage design of newly developing districts and in the renewal of established districts this detailed inundation analysis allows for a better understanding of the potential impacts of rainstorm patterns on urban inundation and may aid policymakers and other stakeholders in developing suitable measures for urban flood risk management and increasing the urban drainage resilience acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural

7114,the carbon and water cycles play an important role in ecosystem functioning and are linked to each other through different physical and biological processes the hydroclimatic disturbances such as droughts affect both hydrological as well as the ecological processes increasing hydroclimatic disturbances under climate change will adversely affect the ecohydrological processes and hence the assessment of the ecohydrological resilience and its controlling factors is important for the sustainability of the ecosystems in this study an assessment of the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems in india to hydroclimatic disturbances was carried out at the district i e administrative division scale ecosystem water use efficiency wuee defined as the ratio of net primary productivity npp to evapotranspiration was used as an indicator of ecosystem functioning or its response to hydroclimatic disturbances we found a large spatial variation in wuee in india at district scale which was significantly higher in lower himalayan regions compared to rest of the country increasing trend in wuee was found for central parts of the country the resilience was measured in terms of the ratio of the wuee under the dry conditions and the mean wuee which indicates the ability to absorb hydroclimatic disturbance out of 634 districts considered for this study only 241 38 districts were found resilient to dry conditions whereas a significant reduction in wuee was observed for some of the districts the resilience at district scale indicates the cross biomes response of ecosystems in general the forest dominated districts had higher resilience compared to districts dominated by other biome types also districts having temperate climate were found having higher resilience out of 30 states and union territories uts only 10 states had more than 50 resilient area the results of this study highlight the need for better ecosystem management policies in the country keywords droughts ecohydrological resilience ecosystem water use efficiency evapotranspiration hydroclimatic disturbances net primary productivity 1 introduction the concept of resilience introduced by holling 1973 has emerged immensely over last few decades folke 2016 resilience is defined as the ability of a system to maintain its structure and patterns of behavior in the face of disturbance holling 1986 resilience is having the capacity to persist in the face of change to continue to develop with ever changing environments folke 2016 simply it relates to the capacity of a system to recover after being hit by some disturbance walker and salt 2013 it quantifies the capacity of a system to adapt or even transform into new development pathways under the dynamic change the resilience approach is perceived as a subset of sustainability science by many anderies et al 2013 walker and salt 2006 resilience cannot be defined in terms of a single measurement or number rather it is defined based on a set of attributes walker and salt 2013 to assess the resilience of the system the identity a measure of system s response functioning of a system needs to be identified first the resilience analysis focuses on how that identity might be changing over time and what threatens that identity walker and salt 2013 the change in the earth s climate due to increase in the greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere is leading to the higher occurrence of the extreme hydroclimatic disturbances such as droughts and heat waves dale et al 2000 karl and trenberth 2014 meehl and tebaldi

formation mechanisms precipitation and runoff patterns in india gosain et al 2006 mishra et al 2016 mishra and lilhare 2016 the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems is adversely affected by such hydroclimatic disturbances terrestrial ecosystems play an important role in global carbon cycle as a major sink for atmospheric co2 cao and woodward 1998 ciais et al 1995 yu et al 2014 terrestrial plants consume co2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis and lose some water at the same time which regulates the mass energy exchange between the vegetation and the atmosphere keenan et al 2013 in order to assess the resilience of the ecosystem researchers use indices that represent the system behavior or the identity fiering 1982a b here we used ecosystem water use efficiency wuee to assess the terrestrial ecosystem s response to hydro climatic disturbances wuee represents the coupling of carbon and water cycles and is defined as the ratio of the rate of carbon uptake and the water loss ponce campos et al 2013 song et al 2017 tang et al 2014 it links the biological and physical processes over the land surface which makes it suitable to understand the response of ecosystem productivity to climatic changes huang et al 2017 the hydroclimatic conditions play a crucial role in the spatiotemporal variation of wuee by affecting the ecosystem evaporation transpiration and carbon uptake niu et al 2011 yang et al 2016 the hydroclimatic disturbances such as droughts and heat waves lead to lesser precipitation along with the change increase or decrease in the evapotranspiration this alters the hydrologic balance and the water availability which affects the ecosystem productivity wuee has been widely used to determine the ecosystem s response to hydroclimatic disturbances ponce campos et al 2013 sharma and goyal 2018 zhang et al 2014 however recent studies have investigated the response of wuee to drought at global or regional scales huang et al 2017 yang et al 2016 there is a contrast in the response of wuee to droughts for different biomes around the world in general different biomes have differences in correlation between wuee and drought indices huang et al 2017 generally the water use efficiency wue is defined in different ways in the literature based on the different indicators of carbon uptake and at different scales such as leaf canopy and ecosystem niu et al 2011 for example niu et al 2011 studied the wue at leaf canopy and ecosystem levels with different indicators of carbon uptake and water loss from the ecosystem the wue in this study is the ecosystem water use efficiency wuee different indicators used for carbon uptake include gross primary productivity gpp net primary productivity npp gross ecosystem productivity gep and net ecosystem co2 exchange nee huang et al 2017 niu et al 2011 ponce campos et al 2013 sharma and goyal 2018 tang et al 2014 xue et al 2015 yang et al 2016 however npp is the most widely used indicator of ecosystem carbon uptake huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 and hence was used in the present study npp is defined as the difference between the plant photosynthesis and the autotrophic respiration roxburgh et al 2005 npp is an effective indicator of ecosystem functioning and carbon fluxes from ecological and physiological processes cao and woodward 1998 as an indicator of water loss from the ecosystem evapotranspiration et is widely used ponce campos et al 2013 for this study we defined wuee as the ratio of npp to et ponce campos et al 2013 assessed the resilience of ecosystems in north america and australia to the early twenty first century drought through enhanced wuee in the water limited period the resilient ecosystem sustains its productivity to by increasing or maintaining cross biome wuee during the hydroclimatic disturbance a similar analysis was carried out by sharma and goyal 2018 at river basin scale in india which indicated that a large part of the country was not resilient to such disturbances however the study was conducted at very coarse resolution i e river basins considering the large size of country and spatial variation in the controlling factors i e land cover and climate a detailed i e higher resolution examination of ecohydrological resilience is required for better understanding of the process therefore in this study we compared the functional response of ecosystems in terms of the change in cross biome wuee in different parts of india to hydroclimatic disturbances at the district scale the districts are the administrative or political divisions within the states in india the district level response of terrestrial ecosystems to drought represents the combined responses of different biomes and climates present in the districts the objectives of this study were 1 to assess the spatiotemporal pattern of wuee at the district level in india 2 to evaluate the district level ecohydrological resilience to hydroclimatic disturbances i e drought and 3 to evaluate the role of controlling factors i e climate and biome types in ecohydrological resilience at district scale due to lack of ground measurements and eddy covariance sites in india the remote sensing based npp mod17a3 and et mod16a3 products from the nasa earth observation system eos program were used these products have been validated and used in different global and regional studies anav et al 2015 turner et al 2006 xue et al 2015 zhao and running 2010 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the present study was conducted at district and state levels in india districts represent the administrative divisions within the states in india there are a total of 29 states and 7 union territories uts in india out of these we considered a total of 30 states and uts for this study which include all state and one ut namely delhi as per 2011 census of india there are a total of 640 districts we considered 634 districts leaving those having no valid pixels of modis npp and et raster and those on islands there is a large variation in the area of districts ranging from 9 km2 mahe in the state of puducherry and 45652 km2 kachchh in the state of gujarat mahe was not included in this study 2 2 modis npp and et we used the global annual mod17a3 npp and mod16a3 et products from the nasa earth observation system eos program the global datasets were developed by numerical terradynamic simulation group ntsg at university of montana umt available from http www ntsg umt edu the mod17a3 and mod16a3 products were generated using the mod17 algorithm running et al 2004 zhao et al 2005 and improved mod16 algorithm mu et al 2007 2011 2013 respectively these datasets were available from 2000 to 2014 at a spatial resolution of 1 km the mod17 algorithm is based on the radiation use efficiency procedure of monteith 1972 the algorithm considers that the productivity of vegetation under well watered and fertilized conditions is linearly related to the amount of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar a conversion efficiency parameter ε is used to convert apar to actual productivity estimated the parameter ε varies for vegetation types and climate conditions to calculate npp mod17 also estimates daily leaf and fine root maintenance respiration annual growth respiration and annual maintenance respiration of live cells in woody tissue mod17 user guide provides further details of the algorithm and is available at http www ntsg umt edu files modis mod17usersguide2015 v3 pdf the modis npp dataset has been validated and used in many studies turner et al 2006 zhao et al 2005 2006 the mod 16 algorithm is based on the improved et algorithm of mu et al 2011 which uses penman monteith equation the et includes evaporation from wet and moist soil from rain water intercepted by the canopy before it reaches the ground and the transpiration through stomata on plant leaves and stems the remote sensing data from modis provides input for surface biophysical variables affecting et including albedo biome type and leaf area index lai the detailed algorithm of mod16 is available at http www ntsg umt edu project modis mod16 php this global et product was validated by mu et al 2011 using 46 eddy flux towers dataset and it was found that the dataset can be used to estimate actual et with satisfactory accuracy in asia previous studies in india used mod16 et as an estimate of actual et e g shah and mishra 2016 due to the lack of ground measurements it was not possible for the authors to validate these products 2 3 precipitation and drought index daily gridded rainfall dataset imd4 from indian meteorological department imd at a high spatial resolution 0 25 0 25 was used in this study pai et al 2014 the dataset is prepared from daily rainfall records from 6955 rain gauge stations in india and is available from 1901 to 2015 the total annual precipitation sum of daily precipitation mm year and mean annual precipitation map mean of annual precipitation mm year at same resolution was computed from daily values the district level map for the duration 2000 to 2014 is shown in fig 1 a to identify the drought condition we used palmer drought severity index pdsi the monthly pdsi dataset was obtained from dai and ncar 2017 at monthly timescale pdsi is a measure of dryness which is computed based on the precipitation and temperature it is a standardized index and its value ranges from 10 to 10 the negative values of pdsi indicate the dry conditions whereas the positive values indicate the wet conditions further details of pdsi and drought classifications based on pdsi can be found at http droughtmonitor unl edu aboutusdm droughtclassification aspx 2 4 land cover data the land cover classification used in this study is based on 10 years 2001 2010 of collection 5 1 mcd12q1 land cover type data and was obtained from the usgs land cover institute lci https landcover usgs gov global climatology php broxton et al 2014 croplands cr is the most dominant land cover type in india covering about 50 of the total geographical area this dataset has 17 different classes of land cover types the previous study for the region i e india reported that different forest classes or cropland classes had nearly same values of wuee sharma and goyal 2018 for example sharma and goyal 2018 showed that the wuee value for all forest classes was nearly same 0 95 gc m 2 mm 1 among five forest classes only deciduous broadleaf forest dbf had lesser values but it covers only 0 56 of the area in india similarly the value of resilience index rd defined in the next section was also nearly the same for different forest types except for dbf likewise crop classes also had similar behavior therefore we reclassified the land cover map to reduce the number of classes by merging similar classes for example evergreen needleleaf forest evergreen broadleaf forest deciduous needle leaf forest deciduous broadleaf forest and mixed forests were considered as a single forest class croplands and cropland natural vegetation mosaic were merged to a single cropland class closed shrublands and open shrublands were merged to form shrublands class similarly savannas and water snow classes were formed by merging similar classes of mcd12q1 land cover type fig 1 b shows the distribution of different land cover types i e the classes used in this study in india to estimate the potential role of vegetation type on wuee average wuee was calculated for districts dominated by different land covers a threshold of 40 was taken to determine the dominance of a land cover in a district 2 5 calculation of ecosystem water use efficiency wuee annual wuee rasters were prepared using modis npp and et rasters only valid and non fill values of npp and et rasters were considered for the calculation average npp and et were computed for every district by taking the average of all pixel values in the district the district scale wuee was calculated as the ratio of npp and et mean annual wuee was computed as the average of 15 years 2000 2014 annual wuee for every district 2 6 resilience analysis the resilience analysis was carried out using wuee as the indicator of ecosystem s response to hydroclimatic disturbance ponce campos et al 2013 sharma and goyal 2018 water limited condition i e drought was identified based on pdsi initially the driest year was chosen for every district based on the annual precipitation for the district the water limited condition i e drought condition in that year was validated based on the values of pdsi for the year we calculated the resilience index rd for every district sharma and goyal 2018 rd was defined as the ratio of the wuee in the driest year termed as wued to the mean annual value of wuee termed as wuem the response of wuee at district scale is used to assess its resilience as a district may contain different climate types or biomes hence our objective was to assess the response of cross biome wuee at district scale rather than for individual biome or climate type considering the contrast in the response for different biomes or climates we further related to district level resilience to dominating biome or climate types rd is dimensionless and it can be used to compare the resilience characteristics of different regions any district having the value rd greater than or equal to unity was considered as resilient similar to sharma and goyal 2018 the non resilient ecosystems were further classified into three categories for 0 9 rd 1 the ecosystem was termed as slightly non resilient for 0 8 rd 0 9 the ecosystem was termed as moderately non resilient for rd 0 8 the ecosystem was termed as severely non resilient 2 7 trend analysis of wuee to examine the temporal variation in the wuee a linear trend analysis was carried out at the district scale the statistical significance of trend was evaluated based on non parametric mann kendall mk trend test kendall 1975 mann 1945 at 5 significance level mk trend test is widely used in the field of hydrology 3 results and discussions the spatial variations of district level modis npp and et are shown in fig 2 which is the average over the period 2000 2014 both npp and et had large spatial variation over the country the northeast and the western ghats had higher npp and et compared to the remaining country which can mainly be attributed to the higher precipitation and the presence of forests in these regions see fig 1 the agricultural lands of indo gangetic plains i e the north part of the country had moderate npp ranging between 500 and 1000 gc m 2 the lower himalayan regions in the north had moderate npp ranging between 400 and 900 gc m 2 whereas the region had lesser et ranging between 300 and 600 mm the arid and semi arid regions in the west had least npp these regions receive very less annual precipitation and have very sparse vegetation some regions in the north e g upper parts of jammu and kashmir jk see fig 9 also had very less npp the spatial pattern of modis npp is partly consistent with the carnegie ames stanford approach casa model simulated npp over the period 1981 to 2005 nayak et al 2013 fig 3 shows the spatial pattern of mean annual wuee wuem at district scale in india for the period 2000 2014 due to the large variation in the controlling factors such as precipitation temperature and solar radiation wuee showed a large spatial variation across the country the district level wuem ranged between 0 and 2 19 gc m 2 mm 1 higher wuem was found in the northeast and lower himalayan regions in northeast india the higher wuem can mainly be attributed to the higher npp due to the presence of the forest sharma and goyal 2018 western ghats had higher npp fig 2a but showed lesser wuem which is due to high rate of et fig 2b fig 4 shows the distribution of linear trend for districts across the country decreasing trend was found for districts along the lower himalayan regions in the north and northeast india these regions had higher wuee see fig 3 significant increasing trend as per mk test of magnitude 0 01 gc m 2 mm 1 yr 1 was observed for central india this region had moderate wuee in general regions with higher wuee showed decreasing trend whereas the regions with lesser wuee showed increasing trend however there were very few districts with the significant decreasing trend only 10 districts about 68 of the districts had increasing trend only 22 were significant whereas the remaining districts had decreasing trend only 1 6 were significant npp and wuee are dependent on the vegetation types as different vegetation types have variations in carbon uptake and water consumption fig 5 shows the average wuem for districts dominated by different land covers i e vegetation types forest dominated districts had the highest wuee which is consistent with other studies sharma and goyal 2018 tang et al 2014 this explains the higher wuee in northeast india it should be noted that the average wuee is the average of annual wuee of the districts dominated by a particular land cover not the average for that land cover as the district dominated by one land cover also has other land covers the previous study has also reported higher wuee for these land cover types in india sharma and goyal 2018 the average wuee for evergreen needleleaf forest enf evergreen broadleaf forest ebf deciduous broadleaf forest dbf and mixed forests mf in india were 0 959 0 948 0 416 and 1 087 gc m 2 mm 1 respectively sharma and goyal 2018 we found average wuee for forest dominated districts as 1 00 gc m 2 mm 1 which is close to the values for individual forest classes the average wuee for grasslands gr was 0 488 gc m 2 mm 1 sharma and goyal 2018 whereas the average wuee for the gr dominated districts found was 0 77 gc m 2 mm 1 the average wuee for cropland cr and cropland natural vegetation mosaic cnv were 0 619 and 0 689 gc m 2 mm 1 whereas the average wuee for the cropland dominated districts was 0 72 gc m 2 mm 1 similarly average wuee for the shrubland savanas and baren land dominated districts were 0 17 0 54 and 0 19 gc m 2 mm 1 this indicates that the wuee of districts dominated by a particular vegetation type was related to wuee of the corresponding vegetation types though there were differences in the values of wuee which was due to the presence of different vegetation types with in the district annual pdsi was computed for every district in india for the study duration fig 6 shows the values of pdsi for every district in their respective driest years it is clear from the figure that most parts 600 634 districts of the country experienced drought conditions pdsi 1 during their respective driest year which accounts for about 94 64 of the districts only 34 districts had value of pdsi greater than 1 but less than 0 which also represent below average precipitation conditions out of 634 districts 501 districts had moderate to exceptional drought conditions i e pdsi 2 fig 7 shows the results of the district level resilience analysis rd was calculated based on the mean and driest year values of wuee as discussed in the methodology out of 634 districts considered for this study we found that 241 38 districts were resilient remaining 62 districts were found non resilient under different classes of non resilience the number of districts with slightly moderately and severely non resilient was 180 28 4 80 12 6 and 133 21 respectively in terms of area under different classes we found that the resilient slightly moderately and severely non resilient classes covered 31 65 27 51 11 52 and 29 32 respectively of area of the country this indicates the around 68 of area was not resilient most of the districts in the northeast and north india were either resilient or slightly non resilient the arid or semi arid regions in the west were non resilient some parts of eastern states were also found non resilient fig 8 a shows the distribution of number of districts for ranges of rd most of the districts are falling either in resilient or slightly non resilient classes the range 0 9 1 0 holds most number of districts 180 also around 63 of the districts fall in the range of 0 8 1 1 this shows that only 37 of the stations had shown clear characteristics of either resilient or non resilient recent studies have shown that different biomes had a tendency to increase its wuee under water stress conditions huang et al 2017 liu et al 2015 therefore we performed a correlation analysis between the ratio of driest year precipitation to mean precipitation and the rd fig 8b the pearson s correlation was found 0 125 indicating no dependencies between these two variables this shows that the behavior of wuee was not controlled only by the precipitation but it also represents other ecohydrological processes there are different factors that affect the ecosystem functioning including climatic factors such as precipitation temperature and solar radiation and biome types in order to find out the factor controlling the ecohydrological resilience we analyzed the contribution of different biome types and climate types there was a significant difference p value 0 05 in the average rd value for different biomes and climate types the average rd for forest shrubland savannas grassland cropland and barren land dominated districts were 0 99 0 28 0 83 0 98 0 92 and 0 77 respectively which shows that biome type doesn t completely relate to resilience however the forest class showed higher resilience compared to other biomes we found that there were about 75 districts with forest cover greater than 40 of district area out of these districts more than 50 were resilient whereas about 65 of the districts with less than 20 forest cover were not resilient this also indicates the higher resilience of forest dominated districts it can also be seen that the forest dominated area in northeast and north india are mostly resilient which is consistent with the findings of sharma and goyal 2018 the rd values for evergreen needleleaf forest enf evergreen broadleaf forest ebf deciduous broadleaf forest dbf and mixed forests mf were 1 03 1 00 0 70 and 0 95 respectively sharma and goyal 2018 the rd value for different forest classes was close to that for forest dominated districts on the other hand the only 35 of cropland dominated districts were found resilient the rd values for cropland cr and cropland natural vegetation mosaic cnv were 0 98 and 0 97 whereas the cropland dominated districts had slightly lesser rd value 0 92 it should be noted that croplands cover more than 50 area in india the rd value for grasslands gr was 0 98 which is equal to the average rd value for the grassland dominated districts to take into account the effect of different climate types we used koppen geiger climate classification maps from kottek et al 2006 koppen geiger climate classes a tropical b dry and c temperate cover about 30 20 and 48 of the country s districts respectively the average rd for district dominated these classes was 0 89 0 89 and 0 9 respectively the percent of districts under these climates that were found resilient are 32 38 and 42 respectively this shows that districts in the temperate climate had higher tendency to be resilient which is also consistent with the findings of sharma and goyal 2018 the average rd values for a b and c climate types were 0 818 0 787 and 1 02 respectively which also indicates that climate type c was more resilient however similar to the biome types the resilience at district level does not completely relate to climate type there are resilient districts with land cover and climates that were found less resilient some global studies showed that different biomes had contrasting responses to droughts huang et al 2017 yang et al 2016 our district level results are not completely consistent with these studies for the reason that there are multiple vegetation types within the geographical area of a district for example within a district we can have forest as well croplands the district level response of wuee is the combined response of multiple biomes climates rather than that of a single biome climate we identified some relation between these controlling factors and the resilience but there is still need of more observation and research to identify the other eco hydrological factors controlling the resilience in addition to district level resilience assessment we also examined the resilience at state scale fig 9 shows the percentage of resilient area in every state the percentage of resilient area was computed using sum of areas of resilient districts and total area of state sikkim sk was the only state with 100 resilient area all four districts in the state were found resilient two states namely rajasthan rj and chhattisgarh ch had 0 resilient area rj is located in the western arid regions and has very less vegetation it should be noted that all three classes of non resilience were considered non resilient these states had districts with different classes of non resilience but did not have a single resilient district out of 30 states and uts considered only 10 had more than 50 resilient area in general it was found that the states in the lower himalayan regions had higher resilient areas in terms of percent of total state area for example sikkim sk 100 punjab pb 88 11 haryana hr 76 02 uttarakhand uk 75 26 himachal pradesh hp 73 19 and arunachal pradesh ar 64 04 in the south tamil nadu tn 56 74 was the most resilient followed by andhra pradesh ap 53 43 and telangana tl 48 61 whereas karnataka kr 17 38 and kerala kl 19 13 had the minimum percentage of resilient area in south among northeastern states assam as 20 72 had the minimum percentage of resilient area our study highlights the resilience of the terrestrial ecosystems in different parts of india at state and district scale india is a developing nation which has been expanding its infrastructure exponentially economic growth in india requires rapid industrialization and infrastructure development the infrastructural and economic developments come at the cost of damage to natural ecosystems anthropogenic activities such as land use and land cover alterations deforestation and urbanization affect the ecological process and primary production every state in india has shown a consistent increase in gross state domestic product gsdp which indicates that continuous development occurring in different sectors on the other hand increase in the extreme hydroclimatic events in india has increasingly been reported mallya et al 2015 roxy et al 2017 sharma and mujumdar 2017 the ongoing climatic changes may lead to more extreme hydroclimatic events which will put tremendous pressure on terrestrial ecosystems to maintain its functioning and productivity the reduction in primary productivity under dry condition as found in this study may also lead to a risk of food shortage as both population and demand for food has been increasing 4 conclusions this study presents an assessment of ecohydrological resilience of the terrestrial ecosystems in india to the hydroclimatic disturbances at the district level the ecosystem water use efficiency wuee which is defined as the ratio of net primary productivity npp to evapotranspiration et was used as an indicator of ecosystem functioning or its response to hydroclimatic disturbances due to the presence of different climate and biome types in india we found a significant variation in npp et and wuee across india the forest dominated northeast and the western ghats had higher npp whereas the arid regions in the west had the least npp et had a similar spatial variation over india in contrast to npp and et the wuee was significantly higher for lower himalayan regions of indus ganga and brahmaputra basins i e in the northern and northeast regions western ghats had lower wuee despite having higher npp due to the higher et increasing trend in wuee was found in central india whereas a non significant decreasing trend was found for the lower himalayan regions i e the regions with higher wuee among different biome types districts dominated by forest cover had highest wuee followed by cropland grassland and savanna respectively based on the resilience analysis which was carried out using driest year wuee and mean wuee it was found that out of 634 districts considered for this study only 241 38 districts were resilient to dry conditions the terrestrial ecosystems in these districts had shown remarkable resilience in terms of maintaining their primary productivity under dry conditions by enhancing their wuee from the comparison the resilience at state level it was found that only 10 out of 30 states and union territories uts had more than 50 resilient area in general it was found that forest dominated districts had higher resilience compared to other biome types in terms of climate types districts having temperature climate were found more resilient this study

7114,the carbon and water cycles play an important role in ecosystem functioning and are linked to each other through different physical and biological processes the hydroclimatic disturbances such as droughts affect both hydrological as well as the ecological processes increasing hydroclimatic disturbances under climate change will adversely affect the ecohydrological processes and hence the assessment of the ecohydrological resilience and its controlling factors is important for the sustainability of the ecosystems in this study an assessment of the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems in india to hydroclimatic disturbances was carried out at the district i e administrative division scale ecosystem water use efficiency wuee defined as the ratio of net primary productivity npp to evapotranspiration was used as an indicator of ecosystem functioning or its response to hydroclimatic disturbances we found a large spatial variation in wuee in india at district scale which was significantly higher in lower himalayan regions compared to rest of the country increasing trend in wuee was found for central parts of the country the resilience was measured in terms of the ratio of the wuee under the dry conditions and the mean wuee which indicates the ability to absorb hydroclimatic disturbance out of 634 districts considered for this study only 241 38 districts were found resilient to dry conditions whereas a significant reduction in wuee was observed for some of the districts the resilience at district scale indicates the cross biomes response of ecosystems in general the forest dominated districts had higher resilience compared to districts dominated by other biome types also districts having temperate climate were found having higher resilience out of 30 states and union territories uts only 10 states had more than 50 resilient area the results of this study highlight the need for better ecosystem management policies in the country keywords droughts ecohydrological resilience ecosystem water use efficiency evapotranspiration hydroclimatic disturbances net primary productivity 1 introduction the concept of resilience introduced by holling 1973 has emerged immensely over last few decades folke 2016 resilience is defined as the ability of a system to maintain its structure and patterns of behavior in the face of disturbance holling 1986 resilience is having the capacity to persist in the face of change to continue to develop with ever changing environments folke 2016 simply it relates to the capacity of a system to recover after being hit by some disturbance walker and salt 2013 it quantifies the capacity of a system to adapt or even transform into new development pathways under the dynamic change the resilience approach is perceived as a subset of sustainability science by many anderies et al 2013 walker and salt 2006 resilience cannot be defined in terms of a single measurement or number rather it is defined based on a set of attributes walker and salt 2013 to assess the resilience of the system the identity a measure of system s response functioning of a system needs to be identified first the resilience analysis focuses on how that identity might be changing over time and what threatens that identity walker and salt 2013 the change in the earth s climate due to increase in the greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere is leading to the higher occurrence of the extreme hydroclimatic disturbances such as droughts and heat waves dale et al 2000 karl and trenberth 2014 meehl and tebaldi 2004 wheeler and braun 2013 which affects the ecosystem functioning breshears et al 2005 dale et al 2000 thomey et al 2011 xu et al 2017 zhao and running 2010 climate change is influencing the cloud formation mechanisms precipitation and runoff patterns in india gosain et al 2006 mishra et al 2016 mishra and lilhare 2016 the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems is adversely affected by such hydroclimatic disturbances terrestrial ecosystems play an important role in global carbon cycle as a major sink for atmospheric co2 cao and woodward 1998 ciais et al 1995 yu et al 2014 terrestrial plants consume co2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis and lose some water at the same time which regulates the mass energy exchange between the vegetation and the atmosphere keenan et al 2013 in order to assess the resilience of the ecosystem researchers use indices that represent the system behavior or the identity fiering 1982a b here we used ecosystem water use efficiency wuee to assess the terrestrial ecosystem s response to hydro climatic disturbances wuee represents the coupling of carbon and water cycles and is defined as the ratio of the rate of carbon uptake and the water loss ponce campos et al 2013 song et al 2017 tang et al 2014 it links the biological and physical processes over the land surface which makes it suitable to understand the response of ecosystem productivity to climatic changes huang et al 2017 the hydroclimatic conditions play a crucial role in the spatiotemporal variation of wuee by affecting the ecosystem evaporation transpiration and carbon uptake niu et al 2011 yang et al 2016 the hydroclimatic disturbances such as droughts and heat waves lead to lesser precipitation along with the change increase or decrease in the evapotranspiration this alters the hydrologic balance and the water availability which affects the ecosystem productivity wuee has been widely used to determine the ecosystem s response to hydroclimatic disturbances ponce campos et al 2013 sharma and goyal 2018 zhang et al 2014 however recent studies have investigated the response of wuee to drought at global or regional scales huang et al 2017 yang et al 2016 there is a contrast in the response of wuee to droughts for different biomes around the world in general different biomes have differences in correlation between wuee and drought indices huang et al 2017 generally the water use efficiency wue is defined in different ways in the literature based on the different indicators of carbon uptake and at different scales such as leaf canopy and ecosystem niu et al 2011 for example niu et al 2011 studied the wue at leaf canopy and ecosystem levels with different indicators of carbon uptake and water loss from the ecosystem the wue in this study is the ecosystem water use efficiency wuee different indicators used for carbon uptake include gross primary productivity gpp net primary productivity npp gross ecosystem productivity gep and net ecosystem co2 exchange nee huang et al 2017 niu et al 2011 ponce campos et al 2013 sharma and goyal 2018 tang et al 2014 xue et al 2015 yang et al 2016 however npp is the most widely used indicator of ecosystem carbon uptake huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 and hence was used in the present study npp is defined as the difference between the plant photosynthesis and the autotrophic respiration roxburgh et al 2005 npp is an effective indicator of ecosystem functioning and carbon fluxes from ecological and physiological processes cao and woodward 1998 as an indicator of water loss from the ecosystem evapotranspiration et is widely used ponce campos et al 2013 for this study we defined wuee as the ratio of npp to et ponce campos et al 2013 assessed the resilience of ecosystems in north america and australia to the early twenty first century drought through enhanced wuee in the water limited period the resilient ecosystem sustains its productivity to by increasing or maintaining cross biome wuee during the hydroclimatic disturbance a similar analysis was carried out by sharma and goyal 2018 at river basin scale in india which indicated that a large part of the country was not resilient to such disturbances however the study was conducted at very coarse resolution i e river basins considering the large size of country and spatial variation in the controlling factors i e land cover and climate a detailed i e higher resolution examination of ecohydrological resilience is required for better understanding of the process therefore in this study we compared the functional response of ecosystems in terms of the change in cross biome wuee in different parts of india to hydroclimatic disturbances at the district scale the districts are the administrative or political divisions within the states in india the district level response of terrestrial ecosystems to drought represents the combined responses of different biomes and climates present in the districts the objectives of this study were 1 to assess the spatiotemporal pattern of wuee at the district level in india 2 to evaluate the district level ecohydrological resilience to hydroclimatic disturbances i e drought and 3 to evaluate the role of controlling factors i e climate and biome types in ecohydrological resilience at district scale due to lack of ground measurements and eddy covariance sites in india the remote sensing based npp mod17a3 and et mod16a3 products from the nasa earth observation system eos program were used these products have been validated and used in different global and regional studies anav et al 2015 turner et al 2006 xue et al 2015 zhao and running 2010 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the present study was conducted at district and state levels in india districts represent the administrative divisions within the states in india there are a total of 29 states and 7 union territories uts in india out of these we considered a total of 30 states and uts for this study which include all state and one ut namely delhi as per 2011 census of india there are a total of 640 districts we considered 634 districts leaving those having no valid pixels of modis npp and et raster and those on islands there is a large variation in the area of districts ranging from 9 km2 mahe in the state of puducherry and 45652 km2 kachchh in the state of gujarat mahe was not included in this study 2 2 modis npp and et we used the global annual mod17a3 npp and mod16a3 et products from the nasa earth observation system eos program the global datasets were developed by numerical terradynamic simulation group ntsg at university of montana umt available from http www ntsg umt edu the mod17a3 and mod16a3 products were generated using the mod17 algorithm running et al 2004 zhao et al 2005 and improved mod16 algorithm mu et al 2007 2011 2013 respectively these datasets were available from 2000 to 2014 at a spatial resolution of 1 km the mod17 algorithm is based on the radiation use efficiency procedure of monteith 1972 the algorithm considers that the productivity of vegetation under well watered and fertilized conditions is linearly related to the amount of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar a conversion efficiency parameter ε is used to convert apar to actual productivity estimated the parameter ε varies for vegetation types and climate conditions to calculate npp mod17 also estimates daily leaf and fine root maintenance respiration annual growth respiration and annual maintenance respiration of live cells in woody tissue mod17 user guide provides further details of the algorithm and is available at http www ntsg umt edu files modis mod17usersguide2015 v3 pdf the modis npp dataset has been validated and used in many studies turner et al 2006 zhao et al 2005 2006 the mod 16 algorithm is based on the improved et algorithm of mu et al 2011 which uses penman monteith equation the et includes evaporation from wet and moist soil from rain water intercepted by the canopy before it reaches the ground and the transpiration through stomata on plant leaves and stems the remote sensing data from modis provides input for surface biophysical variables affecting et including albedo biome type and leaf area index lai the detailed algorithm of mod16 is available at http www ntsg umt edu project modis mod16 php this global et product was validated by mu et al 2011 using 46 eddy flux towers dataset and it was found that the dataset can be used to estimate actual et with satisfactory accuracy in asia previous studies in india used mod16 et as an estimate of actual et e g shah and mishra 2016 due to the lack of ground measurements it was not possible for the authors to validate these products 2 3 precipitation and drought index daily gridded rainfall dataset imd4 from indian meteorological department imd at a high spatial resolution 0 25 0 25 was used in this study pai et al 2014 the dataset is prepared from daily rainfall records from 6955 rain gauge stations in india and is available from 1901 to 2015 the total annual precipitation sum of daily precipitation mm year and mean annual precipitation map mean of annual precipitation mm year at same resolution was computed from daily values the district level map for the duration 2000 to 2014 is shown in fig 1 a to identify the drought condition we used palmer drought severity index pdsi the monthly pdsi dataset was obtained from dai and ncar 2017 at monthly timescale pdsi is a measure of dryness which is computed based on the precipitation and temperature it is a standardized index and its value ranges from 10 to 10 the negative values of pdsi indicate the dry conditions whereas the positive values indicate the wet conditions further details of pdsi and drought classifications based on pdsi can be found at http droughtmonitor unl edu aboutusdm droughtclassification aspx 2 4 land cover data the land cover classification used in this study is based on 10 years 2001 2010 of collection 5 1 mcd12q1 land cover type data and was obtained from the usgs land cover institute lci https landcover usgs gov global climatology php broxton et al 2014 croplands cr is the most dominant land cover type in india covering about 50 of the total geographical area this dataset has 17 different classes of land cover types the previous study for the region i e india reported that different forest classes or cropland classes had nearly same values of wuee sharma and goyal 2018 for example sharma and goyal 2018 showed that the wuee value for all forest classes was nearly same 0 95 gc m 2 mm 1 among five forest classes only deciduous broadleaf forest dbf had lesser values but it covers only 0 56 of the area in india similarly the value of resilience index rd defined in the next section was also nearly the same for different forest types except for dbf likewise crop classes also had similar behavior therefore we reclassified the land cover map to reduce the number of classes by merging similar classes for example evergreen needleleaf forest evergreen broadleaf forest deciduous needle leaf forest deciduous broadleaf forest and mixed forests were considered as a single forest class croplands and cropland natural vegetation mosaic were merged to a single cropland class closed shrublands and open shrublands were merged to form shrublands class similarly savannas and water snow classes were formed by merging similar classes of mcd12q1 land cover type fig 1 b shows the distribution of different land cover types i e the classes used in this study in india to estimate the potential role of vegetation type on wuee average wuee was calculated for districts dominated by different land covers a threshold of 40 was taken to determine the dominance of a land cover in a district 2 5 calculation of ecosystem water use efficiency wuee annual wuee rasters were prepared using modis npp and et rasters only valid and non fill values of npp and et rasters were considered for the calculation average npp and et were computed for every district by taking the average of all pixel values in the district the district scale wuee was calculated as the ratio of npp and et mean annual wuee was computed as the average of 15 years 2000 2014 annual wuee for every district 2 6 resilience analysis the resilience analysis was carried out using wuee as the indicator of ecosystem s response to hydroclimatic disturbance ponce campos et al 2013 sharma and goyal 2018 water limited condition i e drought was identified based on pdsi initially the driest year was chosen for every district based on the annual precipitation for the district the water limited condition i e drought condition in that year was validated based on the values of pdsi for the year we calculated the resilience index rd for every district sharma and goyal 2018 rd was defined as the ratio of the wuee in the driest year termed as wued to the mean annual value of wuee termed as wuem the response of wuee at district scale is used to assess its resilience as a district may contain different climate types or biomes hence our objective was to assess the response of cross biome wuee at district scale rather than for individual biome or climate type considering the contrast in the response for different biomes or climates we further related to district level resilience to dominating biome or climate types rd is dimensionless and it can be used to compare the resilience characteristics of different regions any district having the value rd greater than or equal to unity was considered as resilient similar to sharma and goyal 2018 the non resilient ecosystems were further classified into three categories for 0 9 rd 1 the ecosystem was termed as slightly non resilient for 0 8 rd 0 9 the ecosystem was termed as moderately non resilient for rd 0 8 the ecosystem was termed as severely non resilient 2 7 trend analysis of wuee to examine the temporal variation in the wuee a linear trend analysis was carried out at the district scale the statistical significance of trend was evaluated based on non parametric mann kendall mk trend test kendall 1975 mann 1945 at 5 significance level mk trend test is widely used in the field of hydrology 3 results and discussions the spatial variations of district level modis npp and et are shown in fig 2 which is the average over the period 2000 2014 both npp and et had large spatial variation over the country the northeast and the western ghats had higher npp and et compared to the remaining country which can mainly be attributed to the higher precipitation and the presence of forests in these regions see fig 1 the agricultural lands of indo gangetic plains i e the north part of the country had moderate npp ranging between 500 and 1000 gc m 2 the lower himalayan regions in the north had moderate npp ranging between 400 and 900 gc m 2 whereas the region had lesser et ranging between 300 and 600 mm the arid and semi arid regions in the west had least npp these regions receive very less annual precipitation and have very sparse vegetation some regions in the north e g upper parts of jammu and kashmir jk see fig 9 also had very less npp the spatial pattern of modis npp is partly consistent with the carnegie ames stanford approach casa model simulated npp over the period 1981 to 2005 nayak et al 2013 fig 3 shows the spatial pattern of mean annual wuee wuem at district scale in india for the period 2000 2014 due to the large variation in the controlling factors such as precipitation temperature and solar radiation wuee showed a large spatial variation across the country the district level wuem ranged between 0 and 2 19 gc m 2 mm 1 higher wuem was found in the northeast and lower himalayan regions in northeast india the higher wuem can mainly be attributed to the higher npp due to the presence of the forest sharma and goyal 2018 western ghats had higher npp fig 2a but showed lesser wuem which is due to high rate of et fig 2b fig 4 shows the distribution of linear trend for districts across the country decreasing trend was found for districts along the lower himalayan regions in the north and northeast india these regions had higher wuee see fig 3 significant increasing trend as per mk test of magnitude 0 01 gc m 2 mm 1 yr 1 was observed for central india this region had moderate wuee in general regions with higher wuee showed decreasing trend whereas the regions with lesser wuee showed increasing trend however there were very few districts with the significant decreasing trend only 10 districts about 68 of the districts had increasing trend only 22 were significant whereas the remaining districts had decreasing trend only 1 6 were significant npp and wuee are dependent on the vegetation types as different vegetation types have variations in carbon uptake and water consumption fig 5 shows the average wuem for districts dominated by different land covers i e vegetation types forest dominated districts had the highest wuee which is consistent with other studies sharma and goyal 2018 tang et al 2014 this explains the higher wuee in northeast india it should be noted that the average wuee is the average of annual wuee of the districts dominated by a particular land cover not the average for that land cover as the district dominated by one land cover also has other land covers the previous study has also reported higher wuee for these land cover types in india sharma and goyal 2018 the average wuee for evergreen needleleaf forest enf evergreen broadleaf forest ebf deciduous broadleaf forest dbf and mixed forests mf in india were 0 959 0 948 0 416 and 1 087 gc m 2 mm 1 respectively sharma and goyal 2018 we found average wuee for forest dominated districts as 1 00 gc m 2 mm 1 which is close to the values for individual forest classes the average wuee for grasslands gr was 0 488 gc m 2 mm 1 sharma and goyal 2018 whereas the average wuee for the gr dominated districts found was 0 77 gc m 2 mm 1 the average wuee for cropland cr and cropland natural vegetation mosaic cnv were 0 619 and 0 689 gc m 2 mm 1 whereas the average wuee for the cropland dominated districts was 0 72 gc m 2 mm 1 similarly average wuee for the shrubland savanas and baren land dominated districts were 0 17 0 54 and 0 19 gc m 2 mm 1 this indicates that the wuee of districts dominated by a particular vegetation type was related to wuee of the corresponding vegetation types though there were differences in the values of wuee which was due to the presence of different vegetation types with in the district annual pdsi was computed for every district in india for the study duration fig 6 shows the values of pdsi for every district in their respective driest years it is clear from the figure that most parts 600 634 districts of the country experienced drought conditions pdsi 1 during their respective driest year which accounts for about 94 64 of the districts only 34 districts had value of pdsi greater than 1 but less than 0 which also represent below average precipitation conditions out of 634 districts 501 districts had moderate to exceptional drought conditions i e pdsi 2 fig 7 shows the results of the district level resilience analysis rd was calculated based on the mean and driest year values of wuee as discussed in the methodology out of 634 districts considered for this study we found that 241 38 districts were resilient remaining 62 districts were found non resilient under different classes of non resilience the number of districts with slightly moderately and severely non resilient was 180 28 4 80 12 6 and 133 21 respectively in terms of area under different classes we found that the resilient slightly moderately and severely non resilient classes covered 31 65 27 51 11 52 and 29 32 respectively of area of the country this indicates the around 68 of area was not resilient most of the districts in the northeast and north india were either resilient or slightly non resilient the arid or semi arid regions in the west were non resilient some parts of eastern states were also found non resilient fig 8 a shows the distribution of number of districts for ranges of rd most of the districts are falling either in resilient or slightly non resilient classes the range 0 9 1 0 holds most number of districts 180 also around 63 of the districts fall in the range of 0 8 1 1 this shows that only 37 of the stations had shown clear characteristics of either resilient or non resilient recent studies have shown that different biomes had a tendency to increase its wuee under water stress conditions huang et al 2017 liu et al 2015 therefore we performed a correlation analysis between the ratio of driest year precipitation to mean precipitation and the rd fig 8b the pearson s correlation was found 0 125 indicating no dependencies between these two variables this shows that the behavior of wuee was not controlled only by the precipitation but it also represents other ecohydrological processes there are different factors that affect the ecosystem functioning including climatic factors such as precipitation temperature and solar radiation and biome types in order to find out the factor controlling the ecohydrological resilience we analyzed the contribution of different biome types and climate types there was a significant difference p value 0 05 in the average rd value for different biomes and climate types the average rd for forest shrubland savannas grassland cropland and barren land dominated districts were 0 99 0 28 0 83 0 98 0 92 and 0 77 respectively which shows that biome type doesn t completely relate to resilience however the forest class showed higher resilience compared to other biomes we found that there were about 75 districts with forest cover greater than 40 of district area out of these districts more than 50 were resilient whereas about 65 of the districts with less than 20 forest cover were not resilient this also indicates the higher resilience of forest dominated districts it can also be seen that the forest dominated area in northeast and north india are mostly resilient which is consistent with the findings of sharma and goyal 2018 the rd values for evergreen needleleaf forest enf evergreen broadleaf forest ebf deciduous broadleaf forest dbf and mixed forests mf were 1 03 1 00 0 70 and 0 95 respectively sharma and goyal 2018 the rd value for different forest classes was close to that for forest dominated districts on the other hand the only 35 of cropland dominated districts were found resilient the rd values for cropland cr and cropland natural vegetation mosaic cnv were 0 98 and 0 97 whereas the cropland dominated districts had slightly lesser rd value 0 92 it should be noted that croplands cover more than 50 area in india the rd value for grasslands gr was 0 98 which is equal to the average rd value for the grassland dominated districts to take into account the effect of different climate types we used koppen geiger climate classification maps from kottek et al 2006 koppen geiger climate classes a tropical b dry and c temperate cover about 30 20 and 48 of the country s districts respectively the average rd for district dominated these classes was 0 89 0 89 and 0 9 respectively the percent of districts under these climates that were found resilient are 32 38 and 42 respectively this shows that districts in the temperate climate had higher tendency to be resilient which is also consistent with the findings of sharma and goyal 2018 the average rd values for a b and c climate types were 0 818 0 787 and 1 02 respectively which also indicates that climate type c was more resilient however similar to the biome types the resilience at district level does not completely relate to climate type there are resilient districts with land cover and climates that were found less resilient some global studies showed that different biomes had contrasting responses to droughts huang et al 2017 yang et al 2016 our district level results are not completely consistent with these studies for the reason that there are multiple vegetation types within the geographical area of a district for example within a district we can have forest as well croplands the district level response of wuee is the combined response of multiple biomes climates rather than that of a single biome climate we identified some relation between these controlling factors and the resilience but there is still need of more observation and research to identify the other eco hydrological factors controlling the resilience in addition to district level resilience assessment we also examined the resilience at state scale fig 9 shows the percentage of resilient area in every state the percentage of resilient area was computed using sum of areas of resilient districts and total area of state sikkim sk was the only state with 100 resilient area all four districts in the state were found resilient two states namely rajasthan rj and chhattisgarh ch had 0 resilient area rj is located in the western arid regions and has very less vegetation it should be noted that all three classes of non resilience were considered non resilient these states had districts with different classes of non resilience but did not have a single resilient district out of 30 states and uts considered only 10 had more than 50 resilient area in general it was found that the states in the lower himalayan regions had higher resilient areas in terms of percent of total state area for example sikkim sk 100 punjab pb 88 11 haryana hr 76 02 uttarakhand uk 75 26 himachal pradesh hp 73 19 and arunachal pradesh ar 64 04 in the south tamil nadu tn 56 74 was the most resilient followed by andhra pradesh ap 53 43 and telangana tl 48 61 whereas karnataka kr 17 38 and kerala kl 19 13 had the minimum percentage of resilient area in south among northeastern states assam as 20 72 had the minimum percentage of resilient area our study highlights the resilience of the terrestrial ecosystems in different parts of india at state and district scale india is a developing nation which has been expanding its infrastructure exponentially economic growth in india requires rapid industrialization and infrastructure development the infrastructural and economic developments come at the cost of damage to natural ecosystems anthropogenic activities such as land use and land cover alterations deforestation and urbanization affect the ecological process and primary production every state in india has shown a consistent increase in gross state domestic product gsdp which indicates that continuous development occurring in different sectors on the other hand increase in the extreme hydroclimatic events in india has increasingly been reported mallya et al 2015 roxy et al 2017 sharma and mujumdar 2017 the ongoing climatic changes may lead to more extreme hydroclimatic events which will put tremendous pressure on terrestrial ecosystems to maintain its functioning and productivity the reduction in primary productivity under dry condition as found in this study may also lead to a risk of food shortage as both population and demand for food has been increasing 4 conclusions this study presents an assessment of ecohydrological resilience of the terrestrial ecosystems in india to the hydroclimatic disturbances at the district level the ecosystem water use efficiency wuee which is defined as the ratio of net primary productivity npp to evapotranspiration et was used as an indicator of ecosystem functioning or its response to hydroclimatic disturbances due to the presence of different climate and biome types in india we found a significant variation in npp et and wuee across india the forest dominated northeast and the western ghats had higher npp whereas the arid regions in the west had the least npp et had a similar spatial variation over india in contrast to npp and et the wuee was significantly higher for lower himalayan regions of indus ganga and brahmaputra basins i e in the northern and northeast regions western ghats had lower wuee despite having higher npp due to the higher et increasing trend in wuee was found in central india whereas a non significant decreasing trend was found for the lower himalayan regions i e the regions with higher wuee among different biome types districts dominated by forest cover had highest wuee followed by cropland grassland and savanna respectively based on the resilience analysis which was carried out using driest year wuee and mean wuee it was found that out of 634 districts considered for this study only 241 38 districts were resilient to dry conditions the terrestrial ecosystems in these districts had shown remarkable resilience in terms of maintaining their primary productivity under dry conditions by enhancing their wuee from the comparison the resilience at state level it was found that only 10 out of 30 states and union territories uts had more than 50 resilient area in general it was found that forest dominated districts had higher resilience compared to other biome types in terms of climate types districts having temperature climate were found more resilient this study
