1335,base mine lake bml was the first commercial scale demonstration oil sands pit lake established in northern alberta canada recent studies indicate that ebullition enhances internal mass loading of dissolved constituents during settlement and dewatering of methanogenic fluid fine tailings fft below the overlying water cap here we describe results of integrated field measurements and numerical modelling to i determine potential for ebullition and enhanced mixing within bml and ii assess impacts on chemical mass transport across the tailings water interface we observed sharp increases in ch4 aq with depth from 0 1 mg l 1 immediately above the interface to 60 mg l 1 over the upper 1 5 to 3 0 m of ftt thermodynamic modelling revealed that maximum ch4 aq values represent 60 to 80 of theoretical saturation and corresponding total dissolved gas pressures approach or exceed fluid pressures these findings supported integration of enhanced mixing into one dimensional 1 d advective dispersive transport models which substantially improved upon previous simulations of conservative tracer i e cl profiles and chemical mass fluxes the models revealed a positive relationship between ch4 aq saturation and enhanced mixing showing that ebullition enhances internal mass loading this information has potential to inform ongoing assessments of pit lake performance and support improved closure and reclamation planning at oil sands mines keywords oil sands fluid tailings pit lakes process affected water mine closure reclamation 1 introduction surface mining operations in the athabasca oil sands area of northern alberta canada generate large volumes of fluid fine tailings fft that require storage in engineered tailings ponds this mixture of water 65 75 wt solids 25 35 wt and residual hydrocarbons 5 wt is generated during post depositional segregation of tailings chalaturnyk et al 2002 kasperski and mikula 2011 slow settlement and dewatering of these fine grained deposits which include a substantial clay mineral component delays permanent reclamation dompierre et al 2016 kasperski and mikula 2011 consequently production has outpaced reclamation and the cumulative fft inventory roughly doubled to 1 27 109 m3 from 2009 to 2019 aer 2020 evolving regulations for fft management have accelerated research and development into treatment technologies that expedite permanent reclamation and curb ongoing inventory growth aer 2015 2018 2020 ercb 2009 these technologies which may include chemical e g coagulation flocculation and physical e g centrifugation treatments accelerate dewatering and divert fft from tailings ponds to mine closure landforms for permanent terrestrial or aquatic reclamation aer 2020 pit lakes are the principal closure landform being developed for reclamation of oil sands process affected water ospw and fft or treated fft cema 2012 cosia 2021 kabwe et al 2019 approximately 23 pit lakes will be established within exhausted mine pits that can extend over 75 m below the undisturbed ground surface and cover 5 to 25 km2 areas cosia 2021 golder associates 2017 planned water depths for oil sands pit lakes range from 2 5 to 45 m with cap water depths expected to average 16 m above subaqueous fft deposits cosia 2021 golder associates 2017 these pit lakes are designed to receive freshwater inputs from the surrounding watershed and pending regulatory approval release cap water to local watersheds dompierre et al 2016 kabwe et al 2019 the initial chemistry of cap water and fft pore water are dominated by ospw which contains elevated concentrations of various dissolved inorganic and organic constituents allen 2008 asiedu 2021 bowman et al 2020 dompierre et al 2016 dissolved na cl and hco3 are principal contributors to total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity which can range from 1 to 3 ms cm 1 allen 2008 dompierre et al 2016 these major ions along with naphthenic acids and other organics

suspended solids can have important implications for biogeochemical processes and therefore water chemistry within oil sands pit lakes arriaga et al 2019 risacher et al 2018 tedford et al 2019 freshwater inputs and in situ biogeochemical processes will support improvements in cap water quality following pit lake establishment cema 2012 syncrude 2021 westcott and watson 2007 these improvements result from dilution of dissolved salts degradation of organics oxidation of oxygen consuming constituents and settlement of suspended solids syncrude 2021 westcott and watson 2007 however chemical mass fluxes across the tailings water interface influences cap water chemistry and may hinder water quality improvements dompierre and barbour 2016 dompierre et al 2017 vertical advective dispersive transport associated with fft pore water release to the cap water layer dominates mass fluxes immediately following pit lake establishment dompierre et al 2017 the relative importance of diffusive transport will increase over time concomitant with declining fft settlement rates and the associated pore water release carrier et al 2007 dompierre et al 2017 jeeravipoolvarn et al 2014 kasperski and mikula et al 2011 mixing associated with wind driven internal seiches lake turnover and ebullition can resuspend fft solids within oil sands pit lakes lawrence et al 2016 tedford et al 2019 of the various potential mechanisms only ebullition is likely to trigger mixing to depths greater than a few centimeters below the tailings water interface lawrence et al 2016 biogenic gas production associated with anaerobic microbial metabolisms is widespread in fft deposits across the athabasca oil sands area foght et al 2017 holowenko et al 2000 siddique et al 2012 stasik and wendt potthoff 2016 methanogenic degradation of residual diluent hydrocarbons within fft deposits generates ch4 and co2 which can lead to gas exsolution and ebullition kong et al 2019 siddique and kuznetsova 2020 siddique et al 2014a 2014b exsolution occurs when total dissolved gas pressure p tdg exceeds fluid pressure p fluid whereas ebullition requires bubble growth until buoyancy exceeds sediment cohesion kavcar and wright 2009 although p tdg is the sum of partial pressures for all dissolved gases ch4 exhibits relatively low solubility in water compared to co2 and other gases meaning it often dominates p tdg within methanogenic environments amos et al 2005 ebullition produces transient bubble channels that can enhance pore water release during fft settlement and dewatering siddique et al 2014b consequently chemical mass transport via bubble channels may explain observations of physical mixing well below the tailings water interface in this study we examine the influence of ebullition on chemical mass fluxes during settlement and dewatering of methanogenic fft within a commercial scale oil sands pit lake in northern alberta canada specifically we integrate field measurements and numerical modelling to test the hypothesis that ebullition enhances mixing and therefore mass transport between the fft and the overlying water cap we use these findings to refine conceptual models of coupled physical chemical and biological processes within oil sands pit lakes and contribute to the ongoing evaluation of these closure landforms for permanent aquatic fft reclamation 2 site description our research focused on base mine lake bml 57 00 39 n 111 37 25 w which is located 35 km north of fort mcmurray alberta at the mildred lake mine operated by syncrude canada limited fig 1 this oil sands pit lake was created in the 7 8 km2 west in pit which was filled with approximately 186 mm3 of fft between 1998 and 2012 this fft was pumped from mildred lake settling basin and southwest in pit into the northeast and southwest areas of west in pit respectively during filling the water cap depth was maintained between 3 and 5 m to facilitate ospw recycling for bitumen extraction dompierre 2017 in december 2012 bml was formally commissioned as the first commercial scale demonstration pit lake in the athabasca oil sands area the final water cap surface elevation of 308 5 m above sea level m asl was attained in october 2013 by pumping approximately 11 0 mm3 of freshwater and 3 5 mm3 of ospw into the bml water cap dompierre et al 2017 syncrude 2021 this freshwater was sourced from beaver creek reservoir and mildred lake reservoir the annual water balance for the 2014 to 2019 water years i e november to october show the water balance was dominated on average by evaporation 3 8 mm3 cap water pump out 3 2 mm3 freshwater pump in 4 6 mm3 and precipitation 2 9 mm3 although runoff from the initial 6 6 km2 bml catchment area has been a minor contributor 1 1 mm3 to the annual water balance over this time this freshwater input is expected to increase over time as surrounding mine closure landforms are constructed and surface drainages are connected to the pit groundwater seepage is assumed negligible relative to other annual inputs and outputs dompierre 2017 dompierre et al 2016 kabwe et al 2019 the water cap volume was approximately 50 mm3 in october 2013 when the final water cap elevation was attained pore water release during fft settlement and dewatering increased the total water cap volume by an estimated 20 mm3 over the combined 2014 to 2019 water years this cap water volume increase corresponds to a 4 to 7 m decline in the tailings water interface elevation fig 1 the dewatering e g consolidation of the fft occurs initially at the base of the deposit with the expelled water travelling vertically upwards through the fft column and discharging into the water cap at commissioning the fft thickness averaged 45 m ranging from approximately 15 to 50 m thick syncrude 2021 the rate of pore water release associated with fft settlement and dewatering is greatest immediately following bml commissioning and declines over time carrier et al 2007 dompierre et al 2017 consequently dissolved constituents contributed during fft pore water release dominated the chemical mass balance during early bml development dompierre et al 2017 three permanent sampling platforms i e p1 p2 p3 positioned along a southwest to northeast transect of bml used here have also been used for several other bml studies e g arriaga et al 2019 dompierre and barbour 2016 dompierre et al 2014 2016 2017 risacher et al 2018 rudderham 2019 tedford et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 3 materials and methods 3 1 pressure and temperature measurements in situ temperature and pressure measurements were obtained at p1 p2 and p3 over two ice off periods i august 8 2018 to october 10 2018 and ii may 29 2019 to october 10 2019 additional temperature measurements were obtained at p3 over one ice on period february 4 2019 to march 11 2019 logging pressure temperature 3001 lt levelogger edge m30 solinst canada ltd and temperature hobo water temperature pro v2 onset computer corp sensors were configured to record measurements hourly during the deployment periods the pressure temperature sensors recorded absolute pressure kpa with a reported resolution of 10 4 0 147 kpa and temperature c with a reported resolution of 0 003 0 05 c these sensors were deployed in custom polyvinyl chloride pvc housings to facilitate fluid pressure p fluid or total gas pressure p tdg measurements sensors for p fluid measurements were placed in pvc pipe that was capped at one end before being filled with water and sealed with flexible nitrile membrane gas bubbles were excluded and a perforated pvc cap was added to protect the membrane while allowing water pressures to equilibrate with fft pore water sensors for p tdg measurements were placed in perforated pvc pipe that was capped at one end before being filled with 20 40 mesh ottawa sand and wrapped with semi permeable silicone membrane masterflex antylia scientific co to facilitate p tdg equilibration the sand was used to decrease the total gas volume and prevent compression of the sensor housing absolute pressures recorded by p fluid and p tdg sensors were compensated using barometric pressure sensors 3001 lt barologger edge m1 5 solinst canada ltd permanently located on platform p1 the independent temperature sensors had a reported resolution of 0 02 0 2 c and were deployed as received the sensors were deployed from an aluminum work boat using a modified version of the setup described by dompierre et al 2016 briefly the sensors were attached to a 5 m length of steel chain connected to a 22 7 kg steel weight at the bottom and to a partially inflated buoy and concrete cinder block at the top fig s1 the steel weight pulled the chain and sensors into the fft while the buoy and block supported the installation string at the tailings water interface due to the fluid density transition across this interface the tailings water interface depth was confirmed by active sonar with a 200 khz transducer hds 7 lowrance electronics the chain was then attached to a braided nylon rope and fully inflated buoy to facilitate recovery immediately prior to deployment the p fluid and p tdg sensors were positioned to record measurements at 1 0 2 0 3 0 and 5 0 m below the tailings water interface an additional p fluid sensor was positioned to record measurements at the interface individual temperature sensors were positioned to obtain measurements at additional depths below the interface final deployment depths were confirmed by p fluid data which was compared to the surveyed cap water surface elevation the measured tailings water interface depth and an estimated hydrostatic pressure profile calculated from the fft density profile as calculated from porosity n and specific gravity œÅs data the final installation depths were generally within 0 5 m of the intended deployment depth however data from the 2019 deployment at p2 suggest the chain became tangled below the tailings water interface 3 2 sample collection and analysis samples for aqueous geochemical analysis were collected during august 2015 august 2016 and july 2017 following methods described by dompierre et al 2016 2017 briefly high resolution sampling used a custom built system comprised of 20 discrete 250 ml pneumatic piston samplers spaced 10 cm on center this aluminum fixed interval sampler fis was slowly lowered through the moon pool of the work boat using an overhead winch until 16 pistons were situated below the tailings water interface after 10 min the pistons were slowly retracted from the closed position to collect samples the fis was then retrieved and samples were immediately extruded into 250 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles the sampling boat was repositioned 2 m from the first sample location and the procedure was repeated to obtain separate samples for gravimetric determination of water and solid contents as well as bitumen contents using the dean and stark 1920 extraction method volumetric water content Œ∏ was then calculated using volume density relationships and specific gravities reported by dompierre et al 2016 during the 2015 2016 and 2017 sampling campaigns water samples were separated from fft solids by centrifugation at 8500 g for 30 min the fft supernatant and cap water samples were passed through 0 45 Œºm polyethersulfone pes syringe filters and stored in clean hdpe bottles at 4 c until determination of dissolved chloride concentrations cl aq by ion chromatography ics 2100 dionex corp during the 2016 and 2017 sampling campaigns sub samples for dissolved gas analysis were immediately transferred into gas impermeable containers the fis samples were transferred into 125 ml amber glass serum bottles dwk life sciences using 60 ml catheter syringes and were then crimp sealed with 20 mm aluminum caps and butyl rubber stoppers cls 4209 14 chemglass life sciences the pfs samples were extruded directly into 600 ml plastic jars isojars isotech laboratories which were tightly capped and sealed with vinyl tape the sample containers were stored at 20 c to prevent ongoing gas production before analysis passive diffusion samplers were deployed with the sensor arrays in 2018 and 2019 to obtain dissolved gas samples these samplers were attached at depths corresponding to the independent temperature sensors the sampler design deployed during 2018 proved ineffective and was revisited prior to the 2019 sampling campaign the 2019 samplers were constructed from 30 ml polyethylene polypropylene pe pp syringes henke ject air tite products co and a 10 cm length of platinum cured silicone tubing masterflex l s 24 cole parmer instrument co the silicone tubing was attached with marine silicone before both were filled with deionized water and tubing was capped with a barbed pe tubing cap the samplers were allowed to equilibrate in situ for 134 d before retrieval upon retrieval the silicone tubes were removed a sterile 18 gauge needle precisionglide becton dickinson and co was attached and the water was injected into pre evacuated 60 ml serum bottles these bottles were prepared in an anaerobic chamber where they were crimp sealed using aluminum caps and butyl rubber stoppers before being placed under vacuum for 5 min using tubing connected to an 18 gauge needle and vacuum pump the samples were stored at 20 c to prevent ongoing gas production headspace ch4 g and co2 g concentrations were quantified by gas chromatography gc 490 microgc agilent technologies usa using a poraplot column and thermal conductivity detector prior to analysis the samples were thawed and equilibrated for at least 24 h at ambient laboratory temperature i e 22 c following data verification the serum bottles and plastic jars were then opened and both headspace volume and water content were determined gravimetrically concentrations of dissolved methane ch4 aq and carbon dioxide co2 aq were calculated using the method described by amos et al 2005 3 3 thermodynamic modelling thermodynamic models developed by duan and mao 2006 and mao et al 2013 were used to calculate theoretical ch4 aq and co2 aq solubility respectively simulations were parameterized using measured and calculated depth profiles of pressure temperature and salinity pressure profiles combined discrete p fluid measurements with calculated values water cap elevation tailings water interface depth and calculated Œ∏ values dompierre and barbour 2016 dompierre et al 2016 syncrude 2021 temperature and salinity profiles integrated discrete measurements and previously published values dompierre and barbour 2016 dompierre et al 2014 sensitivity analyses were performed by independently varying pressure temperature and salinity over a relevant range of values to assess dominant controls on methane solubility within bml measured ch4 aq and co2 aq were compared to theoretical solubility to determine degrees of saturation although this method does not account for the combined influence of all constituent gases on individual gas solubilities the corresponding p fluid and p tdg measurements support assessment of the potential for exsolution and ebullition 3 4 transport modelling numerical modelling of upward vertical one dimensional 1 d mass transport across the tailings water interface utilized the ctran w and seep w components of the geostudio finite element modelling software suite geo slope international ltd 2018a 2018b current models build upon those developed by dompierre and barbour 2016 and dompierre et al 2017 which were parameterized using 2013 2015 data for p1 and assumed discrete events e g lake turnover wind driven seiches to trigger physical mixing in the upper fft however ongoing research indicated that water cap processes are unlikely drivers of physical mixing below the tailings water interface lawrence et al 2016 and that there were substantial differences in physical chemical and biological processes in the fft at the various platforms rudderham 2019 this was also evident in differences in fft settlement both spatially and temporally syncrude 2021 fig 1 the current models incorporate these findings by using 2013 2019 data to parametrize distinct models for p1 p2 and p3 and considering continuous mixing by ebullition within the upper fft the current models simulate conservative mass transport in water saturated fft via two mechanisms i advective dispersive transport in fft porewater and ii physical mixing of fft porewater with overlying cap water the equation utilized for advective dispersive transport was as follows 1 c n t z d h n c z c q z z where c is the concentration of a conservative solute at time t and depth z d h is hydrodynamic dispersion n is porosity and q z is the water flux physical mixing was simulated by applying enhanced diffusion coefficients d fft to the upper 2 m of fft this diffusion coefficient is related to d h by longitudinal dispersity Œ± l and vertical pore water velocity v z the latter being calculated as q z divided by Œ∏ 2 d h Œ± l v z d fft the model domain included a 10 m water column overlying 5 m of fft the model domain used 201 nodes equally vertically spaced at 0 05 m intervals values for physical fft properties table 1 from previous studies were applied to five 1 m intervals according to Œ∏ measurements dompierre and barbour 2016 dompierre et al 2016 2017 the hydraulic properties were assumed constant within the model domain over the study period because settlement due to self weight consolidation is a bottom up process that drives upward pore water advection dompierre and barbour 2016 upper and lower boundary conditions were based on measurements at p1 p2 and p3 the lower boundary conditions included a specified water flux as determined from monitored fft settlement rates syncrude 2021 and a constant concentration cl aq based on average values measured at depths up to 45 m below the twi in this study as well as previous studies dompierre et al 2016 2017 the upper boundary conditions included a constant head and a constant concentration the constant head of 10 m was based on the average water cap over the study period and the constant concentration was based on measured cl aq values in the water cap dompierre et al 2017 enhanced mixing was simulated by increasing d fft values relative to those estimated based on relationships between molecular diffusion coefficients and n in saturated porous media without physical mixing boudreau 1996 this approach differs from simulations performed by dompierre et al 2017 which invoked discrete annual mixing events within the upper 1 m of fft all simulations were run for 2000 d using may 1 2013 as the initial time the initial concentration profile was constant and equal to the concentration utilized at the lower boundary of the simulation representing pore fluid concentrations immediately following fft deposition 4 results 4 1 temperature seasonal temperature variations are greatest at the tailings water interface and decrease with depth remaining relatively constant approximately 5 0 m below this point fig s2 during the 2018 and 2019 sensor deployment periods temperatures measured 0 5 m below the interface at individual platforms varied by approximately 6 c whereas smaller variations of 2 5 c were observed 2 5 m below the interface despite limited variability 2018 temperatures measured 5 5 m below the tailings water interface were 2 to 3 c higher at p2 compared to p1 and p3 similar values were measured at p1 and p3 during the 2019 sensor deployment however the longer deployment period also captured larger seasonal temperature variations the combined 2018 and 2019 data revealed a temperature envelope with values at the tailings water interface ranging from 5 7 0 2 c in march 2018 to 13 8 0 2 c in august 2019 fig 2 the magnitude of the annual variation decreased with increasing depth and was 1 c at depths 5 5 m below the interface as observed in previous studies upper fft temperatures measured during the 2018 and 2019 sensor deployments were warmer than cap water from november through june and cooler from july through october arriaga et al 2019 dompierre and barbour 2016 dompierre et al 2014 risacher et al 2018 tedford et al 2019 the associated temperature gradient in the water cap drives seasonal fluctuations within the upper fft whereas their magnitude and depth have increased as convective heat transfer from depth has decreased due to decreasing settlement rates and therefore decreasing pore water fluxes dompierre and barbour 2016 2017 4 2 pressure the p fluid sensors equilibrated quickly with fft fluid pressures and the values remained relatively constant over time fig s3 these results indicate that the sensor arrays remained at the intended depth following deployment and initial settlement and equilibration recorded p fluid values at the tailings water interface generally correspond to the measured cap water depths of 11 m 108 kpa at p1 and p3 2018 2019 and 13 m 128 kpa at p2 2018 with the exception of the 2019 deployment at p2 differences in p fluid values between sensors were consistent with estimated fft fluid pressures and the intended vertical spacing the fluid pressures are calculated based on the assumption that no effective stress i e total stress minus pore pressure has developed between fft particles over these depths i e total stress is equal to fluid pressure minor p fluid variations of 1 kpa i e 0 1 m h2o are attributed to fluctuations in elevations of the tailings water interface and water cap the p tdg values increased gradually following deployment until equilibration with dissolved gases was attained fig s4 in 2018 equilibration times varied from 20 to 60 d for all p tdg sensors deployed 1 0 and 3 0 m below the tailings water interface the deeper 5 0 m sensors equilibrated within 50 and 10 d at p1 and p2 respectively whereas equilibration was not reached at p3 this longer equilibration time observed at p3 is attributed to lower dissolved gas concentrations and therefore lower p tdg during the 2018 deployment despite a longer deployment period several p tdg sensors deployed during 2019 had not equilibrated prior to retrieval these longer equilibration times are attributed to a sensor housing design change between the 2018 and 2019 deployment calculated gas diffusion rates for the sensors housings revealed a longer diffusive path length and therefore longer equilibration time for the 2019 housing design francis 2020 differential pressures Œ¥p calculated by subtracting p fluid from p tdg for corresponding sensors reveal 2018 conditions at p1 p2 and p3 were favorable for gas exsolution fig 3 following equilibration these Œ¥p values became positive for sensors deployed 1 and 3 m below the tailings water interface at p1 and 3 and 5 m below the interface at p2 these Œ¥p values were within the reported accuracy i e 0 15 kpa of 0 kpa developed for sensors deployed 1 m and 5 m below the interface at p2 and p3 respectively the Œ¥p value reached 0 5 kpa upon retrieval of sensors deployed 2 m below the interface at p3 but the ongoing increases suggest values may have reached equilibrium at approximately 0 kpa 4 3 chloride sharp increases in dissolved cl concentrations cl aq were observed with depth across the tailings water interface fig s5 the decrease in average water cap cl aq from 450 to 420 mg l 1 between 2015 and 2017 is attributed to combined cap water outputs and freshwater inputs syncrude 2021 the cl aq increased to relatively constant values of between 500 and 700 mg l 1 at depths below the twi of more than 3 m although these values vary with profile location for example the average cl aq at depths greater than 3 m at p1 p2 and p3 were approximately 550 600 and 630 mg l 1 respectively variations in cl aq depth profiles were observed among locations with a zone of elevated concentrations observed from 0 5 to 1 0 m below the interface at p1 and p3 in contrast a decrease in cl aq over the upper 1 0 m of fft at p2 was observed after 2015 these differences in cl aq depth profiles among locations are attributed to variations in initial fft pore water chemistry and variations in physical mixing between the water cap and upper fft 4 4 methane sharp increases in dissolved methane concentrations ch4 aq from 0 1 to 45 mg l 1 were observed with depth from 0 2 m above to 1 5 m below the tailings water interface fig s6 greater spatial and temporal variability in ch4 aq was observed for samples collected from 1 5 m below the interface where mean values among all sampling campaigns i e 2016 2017 2019 were 37 13 mg l 1 p3 47 10 mg l 1 p1 and 59 10 mg l 1 p2 temporal trends in mean ch4 aq values also differed among locations for samples collected from 1 5 m below the tailings water interface from 2016 to 2019 mean ch4 aq decreased from 45 11 mg l 1 to 25 10 mg l 1 at p1 and increased from 45 12 mg l 1 to 56 3 8 mg l 1 at p3 greater variability was observed at p2 where ch4 aq ranged from 35 to 79 mg l 1 in 2017 this greater variability during 2017 sampling may have resulted from the presence of gas bubbles in fft samples nevertheless ch4 aq values observed during 2019 in samples collected with the passive diffusion sampler were generally consistent with the 2016 and 2017 results despite this spatial and temporal variability deeper below the tailings water interface ch4 aq depth profiles across the tailings water interface were relatively consistent among years at individual platforms the calculated degree of ch4 aq saturation increased with depth below the tailings water interface from 0 01 at the interface to between 0 9 and 1 1 over the upper 1 to 3 m of fft fig 4 subsequent decreases in ch4 aq saturation to 0 5 were observed with increasing depth below this upper zone temporal changes in temperature and pressure during fft settlement likely contribute to observed variation in the degree of ch4 aq saturation between sampling campaigns 4 5 carbon dioxide consistent with methane co2 aq increased sharply with depth from 10 mg l 1 at the tailings water interface to approximately 65 mg l 1 over the upper 2 m of fft fig s6 depth profiles exhibited considerable spatial and temporal variability below 2 m with the highest co2 aq values observed for 2016 samples the lowest and highest average concentrations were observed at p1 30 18 mg l 1 and p2 average 81 47 mg l 1 respectively whereas p3 fell between these values 66 44 mg l 1 the degree of co2 aq saturation was consistently 4 relative to theoretical ch4 aq solubility with values increasing from 0 1 to between 0 5 and 2 0 over the upper 2 m of fft fig 4 differences between years and locations reflect variability in measured co2 aq values coupled with changing pressure and temperature conditions during fft settlement 4 6 water content calculated volumetric water contents values for 2015 2016 and 2017 samples fig s7 were generally consistent with previously reported results averaging 0 8 over the upper 5 0 m of fft for all locations dompierre and barbour 2016 sharp decreases from 1 0 to 0 9 were observed over the upper 0 25 m of fft with subsequent decreases to 0 8 observed within the upper 1 0 to 2 0 m of fft depending on location subsequent volumetric water content increases to 0 5 have been reported near the base of the deepest fft profiles consistent with the bottom up self weight consolidation mechanism dompierre and barbour 2016 kabwe et al 2019 4 7 settlement rates settlement data was obtained from annual fft surface elevation surveys syncrude 2021 these surveys were performed using single 2012 2015 and multi beam 2016 2019 sonar to track spatial and temporal changes in fft surface elevations and therefore settlement and dewatering settlement rates exhibit spatial and temporal variations with the highest and lowest rates observed at p2 and p3 respectively figs 1 and s8 settlement rates at p1 decreased from 1 3 to 0 7 m a 1 from 2013 to 2017 over the same time fft settlement rates decreased from 1 9 to 0 7 m a 1 at p2 and from 1 0 to 0 6 m a 1 at p3 4 8 transport modelling various simulations were performed and compared to measured the goodness of fit for each simulation was determined from the root mean square error rmse of the modeled versus measured cl aq profiles fig 5 simulations considered a range of d fft values and distributions with best fits achieved using enhanced d fft values over the upper 2 m of fft relative to the base case estimated from n relationships table 1 simulations that best fit 2016 and 2017 cl aq profiles used enhanced d fft values representing 2 5 p3 10 p1 and 25 p2 the base case for the upper 1 0 m of fft and 1 5 p3 6 p3 and 15 p2 the base case over the 1 to 2 m depth interval best fit simulations for 2015 cl aq profiles at p1 and p2 used enhanced d fft values representing 10 the base case for the upper 1 0 m of fft and 6 the base case over the 1 to 2 m depth interval enhanced d fft values were not needed to simulate cl aq profiles at depths over 2 m below the interface or to simulate the upper 2 m of 2015 cl aq profiles at p3 lower d fft values used for the upper fft in 2015 compared to 2016 and 2107 are attributed to a 0 4 m decrease in surface water elevation and therefore hydrostatic pressure between july 2015 and may 2016 enhanced d fft values were applied from june to november of each model year whereas base case d fft values were applied from december to may of each model year the long term trends in mass flux across the twi are controlled by the specified fluid flux and concentrations at the base of the model domain differences in these values at each modeled location produce differences in these overall trends as shown in fig 6 however superimposed on these longer term trends are the seasonal variations created by the assumed d fft values fig 6 consequently the highest average mass flux occurred at p2 0 87 0 43 g cl d 1 m 2 while lower fluxes occurred at p1 0 22 0 05 g cl d 1 m 2 and p3 0 21 0 06 g cl d 1 m 2 since the overall decrease in mass flux is dominated by declining ftt settlement rates the largest decrease from 1 9 to 0 31 g cl d 1 m 2 occurred at p2 while decreases from 0 42 to 0 15 g cl d 1 m 2 and 0 50 to 0 13 g cl d 1 m 2 occurred at p1 and p3 respectively for individual locations higher d fft values generally produced higher mass fluxes and seasonal d fft variations produced 60 to 90 changes in corresponding seasonal mass fluxes 5 discussion 5 1 methane production and consumption the observed increase in ch4 aq and co2 aq values with depth across the tailings water interface is attributed to several inter connected processes including i methanogenesis within the upper fft rudderham 2019 stasik and wendt potthoff 2016 stasik et al 2014 and ii methanotrophy within the water cap and potentially upper fft albakistani et al 2022 arriaga et al 2019 goad 2017 mori et al 2019 risacher et al 2018 rudderham 2019 microbial communities within fft deposits include genera associated with both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis which generate ch4 while also producing or consuming co2 respectively foght et al 2017 rudderham 2019 stasik and wendt potthoff 2016 stasik et al 2014 methanogenesis is largely supported by residual diluent hydrocarbons which are initially contributed by froth treatment tailings and gradually depleted over time via microbial degradation or potentially co transport via ebullition simpson et al 2010 large increases in ch4 production rates were observed across the tailings water interface for fft samples collected in 2011 before formal bml commissioning stasik et al 2014 the highest rates were observed within 1 to 2 m of the interface which generally corresponds to maximum ch4 aq values from this study additional research has shown that o2 and no2 dependent oxidation limits ch4 aq fluxes across the bml tailings water interface and concentrations in the water cap albakistani et al 2022 arriaga et al 2019 mori et al 2019 risacher et al 2018 rudderham 2019 although these oxidation reactions affect measured ch4 aq values physical mixing between fft pore water and overlying cap water also influence reactive and conservative constituents including ch4 aq and cl aq respectively dompierre and barbour 2016 dompierre et al 2017 5 2 methane exsolution and ebullition the solubility of ch4 and co2 in water are strongly influenced by pressure temperature and salinity duan and sun 2003 mao et al 2013 however co2 solubility mol kg 1 h2o is 25 times higher meaning that ch4 is commonly the larger contributor to p tdg and gas exsolution within methanogenic sediments amos and mayer 2006 this situation is consistent with current results where ch4 aq partial pressures consistently account for 80 of p tdg over the upper 2 to 3 m of fft at p1 p2 and p3 these partial pressure trends are generally consistent with ch4 aq saturation profiles which are similarly high over the same depth intervals corresponding co2 aq partial pressures generally represented 10 of p tdg and associated degrees of saturation were similarly low although these results indicate that methanogenesis promoted conditions favorable to gas exsolution they are not direct evidence of ebullition within the upper fft ebullition occurs when buoyancy forces overcome cohesive strength allowing upward migration of bubbles through water saturated sediments kavcar and wright 2009 consequently ebullition generally requires bubble growth following exsolution which may result from ongoing gas production amos and mayer 2006 amos et al 2005 or pressure perturbations harrison et al 2017 mattson and likens 1990 scandella et al 2011 2017 mattson and likens 1990 found substantial increases in ebullition rates corresponding to low pressure weather events harrison et al 2017 found that water level decreases within reservoirs can stimulate large ebullition events whereas water level increases have the opposite effect recent studies offer additional evidence for ebullition within methanogenic fft stored in bml clark et al 2021 analyzed ch4 fluxes measured at the bml water atmosphere interface from 2014 to 2018 noting particularly large fluxes associated with low pressure cyclones tedford et al 2019 observed similar relationships between storm events and cap water turbidity which could result from fft resuspension during ebullition as previously proposed by lawrence et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 provided more conclusive evidence of this pressure ebullition turbidity relationship including large turbidity increases following large barometric pressure decreases echograms showing bubble rise through the bml water cap and photographs showing pockmarks where bubble channels exited the fft surface zhao et al 2021 found that ebullition events triggering turbidity increases principally correspond to barometric pressure drops during ice on periods however pressure variations associated with water surface elevation changes can have much larger impacts on hydrostatic pressure at the tailings water interface dompierre et al 2017 finally persistent bubbling observed at the bml water surface during all sampling years provides additional evidence for ongoing ebullition fig s9 5 3 temporal trends in methane dynamics sensitivity analyses revealed that ch4 aq solubility varies widely over the measured ranges in pressure and temperature but negligibly over the measured salinity range fig s10 solubility increases with increasing p fluid and decreasing temperature suggesting that ch4 exsolution and ebullition are influenced by seasonality and longer term factors in the upper fft maximum ch4 aq solubility occurs during the march april temperature minimum whereas minimum ch aq solubility occurs during the october november temperature maximum dompierre and barbour 2016 duan and mao 2006 lawrence et al 2016 seasonal temperature dependent ch4 aq solubility variations are most pronounced within the upper 1 m and largely absent 4 m below the tailings water interface fig s11 however ch4 aq solubility will also increase during long term fft cooling toward the regional shallow ground temperatures of 3 to 4 c dompierre and barbour 2017 pressure variations during weather events water level fluctuations and fft settlement influence ch4 aq solubility weather events and water level fluctuations occur over hours to weeks and are therefore more likely to promote short lived increases or decreases in ch4 aq solubility pore water release during fft settlement increases cap water depth and therefore p fluid and ch4 aq solubility at a given depth relative to the tailings water interface clark et al 2021 reported barometric pressure variations from approximately 98 to 104 kpa with rapid decreases of 0 8 kpa stimulating large ch4 emission events from 2012 to 2019 increases in cap water depth related to fft settlement increased p fluid by 39 to 69 kpa at a given depth relative to the tailings water interface this pressure increase has increased ch4 aq solubility by up to 80 within fft pore water although rates will continue declining over time fig s8 ongoing fft settlement will support continued increases in ch4 aq solubility declining temperatures and diluent hydrocarbon availability will likely limit ch4 production rates over time methanogenesis is a temperature dependent microbial respiration process with acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic ch4 production rates increasing with temperature from 5 to 15 c lavergne et al 2021 nozhevnikova et al 1997 additionally a combination of methanogenic biodegradation and associated vapor stripping during ebullition may deplete more labile diluent hydrocarbon fractions over time mohamad shahimin et al 2016 mohamad shahimin and siddique 2017 penner and foght 2010 simpson et al 2010 stasik et al 2015 siddique et al 2020 expected increases in ch4 aq solubility below the tailings water interface fig s10 coupled with anticipated declines in ch4 production may lead to decreased exsolution and ebullition over time although pore water release and declining porosity would decrease potential methane storage self weight consolidation is a bottom up process and porosity changes within the upper fft will be limited even as the degree of settlement approaches 100 after more than 100 years carrier et al 2007 however contributions of other gases to p tdg will increase with declining ch4 production and increased ch4 solubility and ebullition has been documented in sediments where simulated gas saturations were insufficient for this process to occur amos et al 2005 5 4 influence of ebullition on mass transport field measurements thermodynamic modelling and transport modelling support the hypothesis that ebullition enhances mixing between fft pore water and the overlying water cap these combined results also suggest that ebullition exhibits temporal and spatial variations which influence mixing on seasonal and longer time scales transport models required larger increases in d fft values for locations exhibiting higher degrees of ch4 aq saturation and higher fft settlement rates which is likely related to the elapsed time since fft deposition at a given location higher modeled fluxes at p2 are consistent with fft deposition into the northeast region occurring shortly before bml commissioning in 2012 one impact of this timing is that fft settlement rates are greatest immediately following deposition with 80 of the total settlement for a 50 m thick deposit predicted to occur within 15 years carrier et al 2007 diluent hydrocarbons that support ebullition and associated mixing become depleted over time likely decreasing the influence of these processes on fft settlement rates cema 2012 fedorak et al 2003 kavcar and wright 2009 siddique et al 2014a 2014b further considering the temperature and pressure effects on ch4 aq production and solubility the models suggest that the influence of ebullition on mass fluxes will continue declining over years to decades ebullition within cohesive sediments creates channels that provide conduits for bubbles to migrate upward these channels may remain open thereby facilitating ongoing bubble migration from a zone of dissolved gas saturation scandella et al 2011 2017 the channel diameter decreases with depth below the sediment surface corresponding to changes in hydrostatic pressure and corresponding bubble diameter scandella et al 2011 2017 sirhan et al 2019 the scaling of d fft over the model domain at individual locations reflects this change in bubble size and channel diameter with depth below the fft water interface scandella et al 2011 2017 moreover the higher d fft values applied at p2 are consistent with higher ebullitive fluxes which would produce more bubble channels to facilitate mixing between the upper fft and overlying water cap zhao et al 2021 observed numerous bubble channel openings at the fft surface these authors observed a decrease in channel diameter below the tailings water interface with presumably inactive channels backfilled with sediment bubble migration through existing channels temporarily displaces water causing back flushing of cap water following bubble release zhao et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 clearly demonstrated this process in laboratory experiments using dyed gel water systems to simulate ebullition 5 5 revised conceptual model initial conceptual models for conservative mass transport across the tailings water interface centred on pore water release during fft settlement this process drives upward vertical advective transport proportional to settlement rates which decline rapidly over time fig s8 although fft pore water release contributes solutes to the overlying water cap freshwater inputs and biogeochemical processes also influence cap water chemistry arriaga et al 2019 risacher et al 2018 these factors can produce sharp chemical gradients across the tailings water interface dompierre et al 2017 rudderham 2019 that will enhance diffusive transport declining fft settlement rates coupled with diverging water chemistry mean that diffusion will eventually become the more important chemical mass transport process dompierre et al 2017 since settlement rates and advection flux rates are the same at a given location these processes could be modeled to forecast chemical mass loading to the water cap over time however numerical models devolved by dompierre and barbour 2016 and dompierre et al 2017 clearly demonstrated that physical mixing complicates chemical mass transport and associated mass loading estimates transport models developed for this study indicate that continuous mixing due to ebullition enhances chemical mass transport but the influence of this process is likely to decline over time based on findings from the current study revised conceptual models for conservative mass transport across the bml tailings water interface should include time dependent continuous physical mixing due to ebullition fig 7 although more research is needed to constrain long term methane production rates research indicates that exsolution and ebullition will diminish over time due to declining diluent hydrocarbon availability decreasing temperatures and increasing pressures below the tailings water interface coupled with declining fft settlement and associated advective transport diffusion will eventually become the dominant driver of chemical mass transport between the fft and overlying water cap within bml 6 summary and conclusions combined field measurements and numerical modelling support the hypothesis that ebullition enhances chemical mass transport across the tailings water interface at bml concomitant decreases in chemical mass fluxes and fft settlement rates were observed from 2013 to 2019 dompierre et al 2017 the influence of ebullition on these fluxes also declined over the study period and this trend is expected to continue over time field measurements and thermodynamic modelling indicated that methanogenesis is the principal driver of ebullition at bml with ch4 concentrations approaching theoretical solubility limits over a depth interval from 1 to 3 m below the tailings water interface corresponding pressure measurements revealed conditions favorable to gas exsolution and ebullition over the same interval thermodynamic modelling also indicates that ch4 aq solubility will increase over time due to temperature decreases and pressure increases related to fft settlement and cooling coupled with declining ch4 production related to expected depletion of labile diluent hydrocarbons these combined results suggest ebullition will decline over time incorporation of enhanced physical mixing into vertical 1 d transport models substantially improved fits between simulated and measured depth profiles of cl across the tailings water interface this mixing was simulated by enhancing theoretical diffusion coefficients determined for the fft based on measured volumetric water content data different diffusion coefficients were used for the three study locations with the greatest values corresponding to higher ebullition potential inferred from ch4 aq saturation and pressure data although ebullition enhanced physical mixing between tailings pore water and overlying cap water and increased seasonal flux rates fft settlement continues to be the principal driver of annual chemical mass fluxes the relative importance of physical mixing to these fluxes increased with declining fft settlement rates anticipated declines in ch4 production over time suggest diffusion will become the dominant chemical mass transport process over time this study provides additional insight into the complex interrelated processes that influence chemical mass fluxes across the bml tailings water interface the results can inform mass

1335,base mine lake bml was the first commercial scale demonstration oil sands pit lake established in northern alberta canada recent studies indicate that ebullition enhances internal mass loading of dissolved constituents during settlement and dewatering of methanogenic fluid fine tailings fft below the overlying water cap here we describe results of integrated field measurements and numerical modelling to i determine potential for ebullition and enhanced mixing within bml and ii assess impacts on chemical mass transport across the tailings water interface we observed sharp increases in ch4 aq with depth from 0 1 mg l 1 immediately above the interface to 60 mg l 1 over the upper 1 5 to 3 0 m of ftt thermodynamic modelling revealed that maximum ch4 aq values represent 60 to 80 of theoretical saturation and corresponding total dissolved gas pressures approach or exceed fluid pressures these findings supported integration of enhanced mixing into one dimensional 1 d advective dispersive transport models which substantially improved upon previous simulations of conservative tracer i e cl profiles and chemical mass fluxes the models revealed a positive relationship between ch4 aq saturation and enhanced mixing showing that ebullition enhances internal mass loading this information has potential to inform ongoing assessments of pit lake performance and support improved

expedite permanent reclamation and curb ongoing inventory growth aer 2015 2018 2020 ercb 2009 these technologies which may include chemical e g coagulation flocculation and physical e g centrifugation treatments accelerate dewatering and divert fft from tailings ponds to mine closure landforms for permanent terrestrial or aquatic reclamation aer 2020 pit lakes are the principal closure landform being developed for reclamation of oil sands process affected water ospw and fft or treated fft cema 2012 cosia 2021 kabwe et al 2019 approximately 23 pit lakes will be established within exhausted mine pits that can extend over 75 m below the undisturbed ground surface and cover 5 to 25 km2 areas cosia 2021 golder associates 2017 planned water depths for oil sands pit lakes range from 2 5 to 45

suspended solids can have important implications for biogeochemical processes and therefore water chemistry within oil sands pit lakes arriaga et al 2019 risacher et al 2018 tedford et al 2019 freshwater inputs and in situ biogeochemical processes will support improvements in cap water quality following pit lake establishment cema 2012 syncrude 2021 westcott and watson 2007 these improvements result from dilution of dissolved salts degradation of organics oxidation of oxygen consuming constituents and settlement of suspended solids syncrude 2021 westcott and watson 2007 however chemical mass fluxes across the tailings water interface influences cap water chemistry and may hinder water quality improvements dompierre and barbour 2016 dompierre et al 2017 vertical advective dispersive transport associated with fft pore water release to the cap water layer dominates mass fluxes immediately following pit lake establishment dompierre et al 2017 the relative importance of diffusive transport will increase over time concomitant with declining fft settlement rates and the associated pore water release carrier et al 2007 dompierre et al 2017 jeeravipoolvarn et al 2014 kasperski and mikula et al 2011 mixing associated with wind driven internal seiches lake turnover and ebullition can resuspend fft solids within oil sands pit lakes lawrence et al 2016 tedford et al 2019 of the various potential mechanisms only ebullition is likely to trigger mixing to depths greater than a few centimeters below the tailings water interface lawrence et al 2016 biogenic gas production associated with anaerobic microbial metabolisms is widespread in fft deposits across the athabasca oil sands area foght et al 2017 holowenko et al 2000 siddique et al 2012 stasik and wendt potthoff 2016 methanogenic degradation of residual diluent hydrocarbons within fft deposits generates ch4 and co2 which can lead to gas exsolution and ebullition kong et al 2019 siddique and kuznetsova 2020 siddique et al 2014a 2014b exsolution occurs when total dissolved gas pressure p tdg exceeds fluid pressure p fluid whereas ebullition requires bubble growth until buoyancy exceeds sediment cohesion kavcar and wright 2009 although p tdg is the sum of partial pressures for all dissolved gases ch4 exhibits relatively low solubility in water compared to co2 and other gases meaning it often dominates p tdg within methanogenic environments amos et al 2005 ebullition produces transient bubble channels that can enhance pore water release during fft settlement and dewatering siddique et al 2014b consequently chemical mass transport via bubble channels may explain observations of physical mixing well below the tailings water interface in this study we examine the influence of ebullition on chemical mass fluxes during settlement and dewatering of methanogenic fft within a commercial scale oil sands pit lake in northern alberta canada specifically we integrate field measurements and numerical modelling to test the hypothesis that ebullition enhances mixing and therefore mass transport between the fft and the overlying water cap we use these findings to refine conceptual models of coupled physical chemical and biological processes within oil sands pit lakes and contribute to the ongoing evaluation of these closure landforms for permanent aquatic fft reclamation 2 site description our research focused on base mine lake bml 57 00 39 n 111 37 25 w which is located 35 km north of fort mcmurray alberta at the mildred lake mine operated by syncrude canada limited fig 1 this oil sands pit lake was created in the 7 8 km2 west in pit which was filled with approximately 186 mm3 of fft between 1998 and 2012 this fft was pumped from mildred lake settling basin and southwest in pit into the northeast and southwest areas of west in pit respectively during filling the water cap depth was maintained between 3 and 5 m to facilitate ospw recycling for bitumen extraction dompierre 2017 in december 2012 bml was formally commissioned as the first commercial scale demonstration pit lake in the athabasca oil sands area the final water cap surface elevation of 308 5 m above sea level m asl was attained in october 2013 by pumping approximately 11 0 mm3 of freshwater and 3 5 mm3 of ospw into the bml water cap dompierre et al 2017 syncrude 2021 this freshwater was sourced from beaver creek reservoir and mildred lake reservoir the annual water balance for the 2014 to 2019 water years i e november to october show the water balance was dominated on average by evaporation 3 8 mm3 cap water pump out 3 2 mm3 freshwater pump in 4 6 mm3 and precipitation 2 9 mm3 although runoff from the initial 6 6 km2 bml catchment area has been a minor contributor 1 1 mm3 to the annual water balance over this time this freshwater input is expected to increase over time as surrounding mine closure landforms are constructed and surface drainages are connected to the pit groundwater seepage is assumed negligible relative to other annual inputs and outputs dompierre 2017 dompierre et al 2016 kabwe et al 2019 the water cap volume was approximately 50 mm3 in october 2013 when the final water cap elevation was attained pore water release during fft settlement and dewatering increased the total water cap volume by an estimated 20 mm3 over the combined 2014 to 2019 water years this cap water volume increase corresponds to a 4 to 7 m decline in the tailings water interface elevation fig 1 the dewatering e g consolidation of the fft occurs initially at the base of the deposit with the expelled water travelling vertically upwards through the fft column and discharging into the water cap at commissioning the fft thickness averaged 45 m ranging from approximately 15 to 50 m thick syncrude 2021 the rate of pore water release associated with fft settlement and dewatering is greatest immediately following bml commissioning and declines over time carrier et al 2007 dompierre et al 2017 consequently dissolved constituents contributed during fft pore water release dominated the chemical mass balance during early bml development

measurements in situ temperature and pressure measurements were obtained at p1 p2 and p3 over two ice off periods i august 8 2018 to october 10 2018 and ii may 29 2019 to october 10 2019 additional

fluid or total gas pressure p tdg measurements sensors for p fluid measurements were placed in pvc pipe that was capped at one end before being filled with water and sealed with flexible nitrile membrane gas bubbles were excluded and a perforated pvc cap was added to protect the membrane while allowing water pressures to equilibrate with fft pore water sensors for p tdg measurements were placed in perforated pvc pipe that was capped at one end before being filled with 20 40 mesh ottawa sand and wrapped with semi permeable silicone membrane masterflex antylia scientific co to facilitate p tdg equilibration the sand was used to decrease the total gas volume and prevent compression of the sensor housing absolute pressures recorded by p fluid and p tdg sensors were compensated using barometric pressure sensors 3001 lt barologger edge m1 5 solinst canada ltd permanently located on platform p1 the independent temperature sensors had a reported resolution of 0 02 0 2 c and were deployed as received the sensors were deployed from an aluminum work boat using a modified version of the setup described by dompierre et al 2016 briefly the sensors were attached to a 5 m length of steel chain connected to a 22 7 kg steel weight at the bottom and to a partially inflated buoy and concrete cinder block at the top fig s1 the steel weight pulled the chain and sensors into the fft while the buoy and block supported the installation string at the tailings water interface due to the fluid density transition across this interface the tailings water interface depth was confirmed by active sonar with a 200 khz transducer hds 7 lowrance electronics the chain was then attached to a braided nylon rope and fully inflated buoy to facilitate recovery immediately prior to deployment the p fluid and p tdg sensors were positioned to record measurements at 1 0 2 0 3 0 and 5 0 m below the tailings water interface an additional p fluid sensor was positioned to record measurements at the interface individual temperature sensors were positioned to obtain measurements at additional depths below the interface final deployment depths were confirmed by p fluid data which was compared to the surveyed cap water surface elevation the measured tailings water interface depth and an estimated hydrostatic pressure profile calculated from the fft density profile as calculated from porosity n and specific gravity œÅs data the final installation depths were generally within 0 5 m of the intended deployment depth however data from the 2019 deployment at p2 suggest the chain became tangled below the tailings water interface 3 2 sample collection and analysis samples for aqueous geochemical analysis were collected during august 2015 august 2016 and july 2017 following methods described by dompierre et al 2016 2017 briefly high resolution sampling used a custom built system comprised of 20 discrete 250 ml pneumatic piston samplers spaced 10 cm on center this aluminum fixed interval sampler fis was slowly lowered through the moon pool of the work boat using an overhead winch until 16 pistons were situated below the tailings water interface after 10 min the pistons were slowly retracted from the closed position to collect samples the fis was then retrieved and samples were immediately extruded into 250 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles the sampling boat was repositioned 2 m from the first sample location and the procedure was repeated to obtain separate samples for gravimetric determination of water and solid contents as well as bitumen contents using the dean and stark 1920 extraction method volumetric water content Œ∏ was then calculated using volume density relationships and specific gravities reported by dompierre et al 2016 during the 2015 2016 and 2017 sampling campaigns water samples were separated from fft solids by centrifugation at 8500 g for 30 min the fft supernatant and cap water samples were passed through 0 45 Œºm polyethersulfone pes syringe filters and stored in clean hdpe bottles at 4 c until determination of dissolved chloride concentrations cl aq by ion chromatography ics 2100 dionex corp during the 2016 and 2017 sampling campaigns sub samples for dissolved gas analysis were immediately transferred into gas impermeable containers the fis samples were transferred into 125 ml amber glass serum bottles dwk life sciences using 60 ml catheter syringes and were then crimp sealed with 20 mm aluminum caps and butyl rubber stoppers cls 4209 14 chemglass life sciences the pfs samples were extruded directly into 600 ml plastic jars isojars isotech laboratories which were tightly capped and sealed with vinyl tape the sample containers were stored at 20 c to prevent ongoing gas production before analysis passive diffusion samplers were deployed with the sensor arrays in 2018 and 2019 to obtain dissolved gas samples these samplers were attached at depths corresponding to the independent temperature sensors the sampler design deployed during 2018 proved ineffective and was revisited prior to the 2019 sampling campaign the 2019 samplers were constructed from 30 ml polyethylene polypropylene pe pp syringes henke ject air tite products co and a 10 cm length of platinum cured silicone tubing masterflex l s 24 cole parmer instrument co the silicone tubing was attached with marine silicone before both were filled with deionized water and tubing was capped with a barbed pe tubing cap the samplers were allowed to equilibrate in situ for 134 d before retrieval upon retrieval the silicone tubes were removed a sterile 18 gauge needle precisionglide becton dickinson and co was attached and the water was injected into pre evacuated 60 ml serum bottles these bottles were prepared in an anaerobic chamber where they were crimp sealed using aluminum caps and butyl rubber stoppers before being placed under vacuum for 5 min using tubing connected to an 18 gauge needle and vacuum pump the samples were stored at 20 c to prevent ongoing gas production headspace ch4 g and co2 g concentrations were quantified by gas chromatography gc 490 microgc agilent technologies usa using a poraplot column and thermal conductivity detector prior to analysis the samples were thawed and equilibrated for at least 24 h at ambient laboratory temperature i e 22 c following data verification the serum bottles and plastic jars were then opened and both headspace volume and water content were determined gravimetrically concentrations of dissolved methane ch4 aq and carbon dioxide co2 aq were calculated using the method described by amos et al 2005 3 3 thermodynamic modelling thermodynamic models developed by duan and mao 2006 and mao et al 2013 were used to calculate theoretical ch4 aq and co2 aq solubility respectively simulations were parameterized using measured and calculated depth profiles of pressure temperature and salinity pressure profiles combined discrete p fluid measurements with calculated values water cap elevation tailings water interface depth and calculated Œ∏ values dompierre and barbour 2016 dompierre et al 2016 syncrude 2021 temperature and salinity profiles integrated discrete measurements and previously published values dompierre and barbour 2016 dompierre et al 2014 sensitivity analyses were performed by independently varying pressure temperature and salinity over a relevant range of values to assess dominant controls on methane solubility within bml measured ch4 aq and co2 aq were compared to theoretical solubility to determine degrees of saturation although this method does not account for the combined influence of all constituent gases on individual gas solubilities the corresponding p fluid and p tdg measurements support assessment of the potential for exsolution and ebullition 3 4 transport modelling numerical modelling of upward vertical one dimensional 1 d mass transport across the tailings water interface utilized the ctran w and seep w components of the geostudio finite element modelling software suite geo slope international ltd 2018a 2018b current models build upon those developed by dompierre and barbour 2016 and dompierre et al 2017 which were parameterized using 2013 2015 data for p1 and assumed discrete events e g lake turnover wind driven seiches to trigger physical mixing in the upper fft however ongoing research indicated that water cap processes are unlikely drivers of physical mixing below the tailings water interface lawrence et al 2016 and that there were substantial differences in physical chemical and biological processes in the fft at the various platforms rudderham 2019 this was also evident in differences in fft settlement both spatially and temporally syncrude 2021 fig 1 the current models incorporate these findings by using 2013 2019 data to parametrize distinct models for p1 p2 and p3 and considering continuous mixing by ebullition within the upper fft the current models simulate conservative mass transport in water saturated fft via two mechanisms i advective dispersive transport in fft porewater and ii physical mixing of fft porewater with overlying cap water the equation utilized for advective dispersive transport was as follows 1 c n t z d h n c z c q z z where c is the concentration of a conservative solute at time t and depth z d h is hydrodynamic dispersion n is porosity and q z is the water flux physical mixing was simulated by applying enhanced diffusion coefficients d fft to the upper 2 m of fft this diffusion coefficient is related to d h by longitudinal dispersity Œ± l and vertical pore water velocity v z the latter being calculated as q z divided by Œ∏ 2 d h Œ± l v z d fft the model domain included a 10 m water column overlying 5 m of fft the model domain used 201 nodes equally vertically spaced at 0 05 m intervals values for physical fft properties table 1 from previous studies were applied to five 1 m intervals according to Œ∏ measurements dompierre and barbour 2016 dompierre et al 2016 2017 the hydraulic properties were assumed constant within the model domain over the study period because settlement due to self weight consolidation is a bottom up process that drives upward pore water advection dompierre and barbour 2016 upper and lower boundary conditions were based on measurements at p1 p2 and p3 the lower boundary conditions included a specified water flux as determined from monitored fft settlement rates syncrude 2021 and a constant concentration cl aq based on average values measured at depths up to 45 m below the twi in this study as well as previous studies dompierre et al 2016 2017 the upper boundary conditions included a constant head and a constant concentration the constant head of 10 m was based on the average water cap over the study period and the constant concentration was based on measured cl aq values in the water cap dompierre et al 2017 enhanced mixing was simulated by increasing d fft values relative to those estimated based on relationships between molecular diffusion coefficients and n in saturated porous media without physical mixing boudreau 1996 this approach differs from simulations performed by dompierre et al 2017 which invoked discrete annual mixing events within the upper 1 m of fft all simulations were run for 2000 d using may 1 2013 as the initial time the initial concentration profile was constant and equal to the concentration utilized at the lower boundary of the simulation representing pore fluid concentrations immediately following fft deposition 4 results 4 1 temperature seasonal temperature variations are greatest at the tailings water interface and decrease with depth remaining relatively constant approximately 5 0 m below this point fig s2 during the 2018 and 2019 sensor deployment periods temperatures measured 0 5 m below the interface at individual platforms varied by approximately 6 c whereas smaller variations of 2 5 c were observed 2 5 m below the interface despite limited variability 2018 temperatures measured 5 5 m below the tailings water interface were 2 to 3 c higher at p2 compared to p1 and p3 similar values were measured at p1 and p3 during the 2019 sensor deployment however the longer deployment period also captured larger seasonal temperature variations the combined 2018 and 2019 data revealed a temperature envelope with values at the tailings water interface ranging from 5 7 0 2 c in march 2018 to 13 8 0 2 c in august 2019 fig 2 the magnitude of the annual variation decreased with increasing depth and was 1 c at depths 5 5 m below the interface as observed in previous studies upper fft temperatures measured during the 2018 and 2019 sensor deployments were warmer than cap water from november through june and cooler from july through october arriaga et al 2019 dompierre and barbour 2016 dompierre et al 2014 risacher et al 2018 tedford et al 2019 the associated temperature gradient in the water cap drives seasonal fluctuations within the upper fft whereas their magnitude and depth have increased as convective heat transfer from depth has decreased due to decreasing settlement rates and therefore decreasing pore water fluxes dompierre and barbour 2016 2017 4 2 pressure the p fluid sensors equilibrated quickly with fft fluid pressures and the values remained relatively constant over time fig s3 these results indicate that the sensor arrays remained at the intended depth following deployment and initial settlement and equilibration recorded p fluid values at the tailings water interface generally correspond to the measured cap water depths of 11 m 108 kpa at p1 and p3 2018 2019 and 13 m 128 kpa at p2 2018 with the exception of the 2019 deployment at p2 differences in p fluid values between sensors were consistent with estimated fft fluid pressures and the intended vertical spacing the fluid pressures are calculated based on the assumption that no effective stress i e total stress minus pore pressure has developed between fft particles over these depths i e total stress is equal to fluid pressure minor p fluid variations of 1 kpa i e 0 1 m h2o are attributed to fluctuations in elevations of the tailings water interface and water cap the p tdg values increased gradually following deployment until equilibration with dissolved gases was attained fig s4 in 2018 equilibration times varied from 20 to 60 d for all p tdg sensors deployed 1 0 and 3 0 m below the tailings water interface the deeper 5 0 m sensors equilibrated within 50 and 10 d at p1 and p2 respectively whereas equilibration was not reached at p3 this longer equilibration time observed at p3 is attributed to lower dissolved gas concentrations and therefore lower p tdg during the 2018 deployment despite a longer deployment period several p tdg sensors deployed during 2019 had not equilibrated prior to retrieval these longer equilibration times are attributed to a sensor housing design change between the 2018 and 2019 deployment calculated gas diffusion rates for the sensors housings revealed a longer diffusive path length and therefore longer equilibration time for the 2019 housing design francis 2020 differential pressures Œ¥p calculated by subtracting p fluid from p tdg for corresponding sensors reveal 2018 conditions at p1 p2 and p3 were favorable for gas exsolution fig 3 following equilibration these Œ¥p values became positive for sensors deployed 1 and 3 m below the tailings water interface at p1 and 3 and 5 m below the interface at p2 these Œ¥p values were within the reported accuracy i e 0 15 kpa of 0 kpa developed for sensors deployed 1 m and 5 m below the interface at p2 and p3 respectively the Œ¥p value reached 0 5 kpa upon retrieval of sensors deployed 2 m below the interface at p3 but the ongoing increases suggest values may have reached equilibrium at approximately 0 kpa 4 3 chloride sharp increases in dissolved cl concentrations cl aq were observed with depth across the tailings water interface fig s5 the decrease in average water cap cl aq from 450 to 420 mg l 1 between 2015 and 2017 is attributed to combined cap water outputs and freshwater inputs syncrude 2021 the cl aq increased to relatively constant values of between 500 and 700 mg l 1 at depths below the twi of more than 3 m although these values vary with profile location for example the average cl aq at depths greater than 3 m at p1 p2 and p3 were approximately 550 600 and 630 mg l 1 respectively variations in cl aq depth profiles were observed among locations with a zone of elevated concentrations observed from 0 5 to 1 0 m below the interface at p1 and p3 in contrast a decrease in cl aq over the upper 1 0 m of fft at p2 was observed after 2015 these differences in cl aq depth profiles among locations are attributed to variations in initial fft pore water chemistry and variations in physical mixing between the water cap and upper fft 4 4 methane sharp increases in dissolved methane concentrations ch4 aq from 0 1 to 45 mg l 1 were observed with depth from 0 2 m above to 1 5 m below the tailings water interface fig s6 greater spatial and temporal variability in ch4 aq was observed for samples collected from 1 5 m below the interface where mean values among all sampling campaigns i e 2016 2017 2019 were 37 13 mg l 1 p3 47 10 mg l 1 p1 and 59 10 mg l 1 p2 temporal trends in mean ch4 aq values also differed among locations for samples collected from 1 5 m below the tailings water interface from 2016 to 2019 mean ch4 aq decreased from 45 11 mg l 1 to 25 10 mg l 1 at p1 and increased from 45 12 mg l 1 to 56 3 8 mg l 1 at p3 greater variability was observed at p2 where ch4 aq ranged from 35 to 79 mg l 1 in 2017 this greater variability during 2017 sampling may have resulted from the presence of gas bubbles in fft samples nevertheless ch4 aq values observed during 2019 in samples collected with the passive diffusion sampler were generally consistent with the 2016 and 2017 results despite this spatial and temporal variability deeper below the tailings water interface ch4 aq depth profiles across the tailings water interface were relatively consistent among years at individual platforms the calculated degree of ch4 aq saturation increased with depth below the tailings water interface from 0 01 at the interface to between 0 9 and 1 1 over the upper 1 to 3 m of fft fig 4 subsequent decreases in ch4 aq saturation to 0 5 were observed with increasing depth below this upper zone temporal changes in temperature and pressure during fft settlement likely contribute to observed variation in the degree of ch4 aq saturation between sampling campaigns 4 5 carbon dioxide consistent with methane co2 aq increased sharply with depth from 10 mg l 1 at the tailings water interface to approximately 65 mg l 1 over the upper 2 m of fft fig s6 depth profiles exhibited considerable spatial and temporal variability below 2 m with the highest co2 aq values observed for 2016 samples the lowest and highest average concentrations were observed at p1 30 18 mg l 1 and p2 average 81 47 mg l 1 respectively whereas p3 fell between these values 66 44 mg l 1 the degree of co2 aq saturation was consistently 4 relative to theoretical ch4 aq solubility with values increasing from 0 1 to between 0 5 and 2 0 over the upper 2 m of fft fig 4 differences between years and locations reflect variability in measured co2 aq values coupled with changing pressure and temperature conditions during fft settlement 4 6 water content calculated volumetric water contents values for 2015 2016 and 2017 samples fig s7 were generally consistent with previously reported results averaging 0 8 over the upper 5 0 m of fft for all locations dompierre and barbour 2016 sharp decreases from 1 0 to 0 9 were observed over the upper 0 25 m of fft with subsequent decreases to 0 8 observed within the upper 1 0 to 2 0 m of fft depending on location subsequent volumetric water content increases to 0 5 have been reported near the base of the deepest fft profiles consistent with the bottom up self weight consolidation mechanism dompierre and barbour 2016 kabwe et al 2019 4 7 settlement rates settlement data was obtained from annual fft surface elevation surveys syncrude 2021 these surveys were performed using single 2012 2015 and multi beam 2016 2019 sonar to track spatial and temporal changes in fft surface elevations and therefore settlement and dewatering settlement rates exhibit spatial and temporal variations with the highest and lowest rates observed at p2 and p3 respectively figs 1 and s8 settlement rates at p1 decreased from 1 3 to 0 7 m a 1 from 2013 to 2017 over the same time fft settlement rates decreased from 1 9 to 0 7 m a 1 at p2 and from 1 0 to 0 6 m a 1 at p3 4 8 transport modelling various simulations were performed and compared to measured the goodness of fit for each simulation was determined from the root mean square error rmse of the modeled versus measured cl aq profiles fig 5 simulations considered a range of d fft values and distributions with best fits achieved using enhanced d fft values over the upper 2 m of fft relative to the base case estimated from n relationships table 1 simulations that best fit 2016 and 2017 cl aq profiles used enhanced d fft values representing 2 5 p3 10 p1 and 25 p2 the base case for the upper 1 0 m of fft and 1 5 p3 6 p3 and 15 p2 the base case over the 1 to 2 m depth interval best fit simulations for 2015 cl aq profiles at p1 and p2 used enhanced d fft values representing 10 the base case for the upper 1 0 m of fft and 6 the base case over the 1 to 2 m depth interval enhanced d fft values were not needed to simulate cl aq profiles at depths over 2 m below the interface or to simulate the upper 2 m of 2015 cl aq profiles at p3 lower d fft values used for the upper fft in 2015 compared to 2016 and 2107 are attributed to a 0 4 m decrease in surface water elevation and therefore hydrostatic pressure between july 2015 and may 2016 enhanced d fft values were applied from june to november of each model year whereas base case d fft values were applied from december to may of each model year the long term trends in mass flux across the twi are controlled by the specified fluid flux and concentrations at the base of the model domain differences in these values at each modeled location produce differences in these overall trends as shown in fig 6 however superimposed on these longer term trends are the seasonal variations created by the assumed d fft values fig 6 consequently the highest average mass flux occurred at p2 0 87 0 43 g cl d 1 m 2 while lower fluxes occurred at p1 0 22 0 05 g cl d 1 m 2 and p3 0 21 0 06 g cl d 1 m 2 since the overall decrease in mass flux is dominated by declining ftt settlement rates the largest decrease from 1 9 to 0 31 g cl d 1 m 2 occurred at p2 while decreases from 0 42 to 0 15 g cl d 1 m 2 and 0 50 to 0 13 g cl d 1 m 2 occurred at p1 and p3 respectively for individual locations higher d fft values generally produced higher mass fluxes and seasonal d fft variations produced 60 to 90 changes in corresponding seasonal mass fluxes 5 discussion 5 1 methane production and consumption the observed increase in ch4 aq and co2 aq values with depth across the tailings water interface is attributed to several inter connected processes including i methanogenesis within the upper fft rudderham 2019 stasik and wendt potthoff 2016 stasik et al 2014 and ii methanotrophy within the water cap and potentially upper fft albakistani et al 2022 arriaga et al 2019 goad 2017 mori et al 2019 risacher et al 2018 rudderham 2019 microbial communities within fft deposits include genera associated with both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis which generate ch4 while also producing or consuming co2 respectively foght et al 2017 rudderham 2019 stasik and wendt potthoff 2016 stasik et al 2014 methanogenesis is largely supported by residual diluent hydrocarbons which are initially contributed by froth treatment tailings and gradually depleted over time via microbial degradation or potentially co transport via ebullition simpson et al 2010 large increases in ch4 production rates were observed across the tailings water interface for fft samples collected in 2011 before formal bml commissioning stasik et al 2014 the highest rates were observed within 1 to 2 m of the interface which generally corresponds to maximum ch4 aq values from this study additional research has shown that o2 and no2 dependent oxidation limits ch4 aq fluxes across the bml tailings water interface and concentrations in the water cap albakistani et al 2022 arriaga et al 2019 mori et al 2019 risacher et al 2018 rudderham 2019 although these oxidation reactions affect measured ch4 aq values physical mixing between fft pore water and overlying cap water also influence reactive and conservative constituents including ch4 aq and cl aq respectively dompierre and barbour 2016 dompierre et al 2017 5 2 methane exsolution and ebullition the solubility of ch4 and co2 in water are strongly influenced by pressure temperature and salinity duan and sun 2003 mao et al 2013 however co2 solubility mol kg 1 h2o is 25 times higher meaning that ch4 is commonly the larger contributor to p tdg and gas exsolution within methanogenic sediments amos and mayer 2006 this situation is consistent with current results where ch4 aq partial pressures consistently account for 80 of p tdg over the upper 2 to 3 m of fft at p1 p2 and p3 these partial pressure trends are generally consistent with ch4 aq saturation profiles which are similarly high over the same depth intervals corresponding co2 aq partial pressures generally represented 10 of p tdg and associated degrees of saturation were similarly low although these results indicate that methanogenesis promoted conditions favorable to gas exsolution they are not direct evidence of ebullition within the upper fft ebullition occurs when buoyancy forces overcome cohesive strength allowing upward migration of bubbles through water saturated sediments kavcar and wright 2009 consequently ebullition generally requires bubble growth following exsolution which may result from ongoing gas production amos and mayer 2006 amos et al 2005 or pressure perturbations harrison et al 2017 mattson and likens 1990 scandella et al 2011 2017 mattson and likens 1990 found substantial increases in ebullition rates corresponding to low pressure weather events harrison et al 2017 found that water level decreases within reservoirs can stimulate large ebullition events whereas water level increases have the opposite effect recent studies offer additional evidence for ebullition within methanogenic fft stored in bml clark et al 2021 analyzed ch4 fluxes measured at the bml water atmosphere interface from 2014 to 2018 noting particularly large fluxes associated with low pressure cyclones tedford et al 2019 observed similar relationships between storm events and cap water turbidity which could result from fft resuspension during ebullition as previously proposed by lawrence et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 provided more conclusive evidence of this pressure ebullition turbidity relationship including large turbidity increases following large barometric pressure decreases echograms showing bubble rise through the bml water cap and photographs showing pockmarks where bubble channels exited the fft surface zhao et al 2021 found that ebullition events triggering turbidity increases principally correspond to barometric pressure drops during ice on periods however pressure variations associated with water surface elevation changes can have much larger impacts on hydrostatic pressure at the tailings water interface dompierre et al 2017 finally persistent bubbling observed at the bml water surface during all sampling years provides additional evidence for ongoing ebullition fig s9 5 3 temporal trends in methane dynamics sensitivity analyses revealed that ch4 aq solubility varies widely over the measured ranges in pressure and temperature but negligibly over the measured salinity range fig s10 solubility increases with increasing p fluid and decreasing temperature suggesting that ch4 exsolution and ebullition are influenced by seasonality and longer term factors in the upper fft maximum ch4 aq solubility occurs during the march april temperature minimum whereas minimum ch aq solubility occurs during the october november temperature maximum dompierre and barbour 2016 duan and mao 2006 lawrence et al 2016 seasonal temperature dependent ch4 aq solubility variations are most pronounced within the upper 1 m and largely absent 4 m below the tailings water interface fig s11 however ch4 aq solubility will also increase during long term fft cooling toward the regional shallow ground temperatures of 3 to 4 c dompierre and barbour 2017 pressure variations during weather events water level fluctuations and fft settlement influence ch4 aq solubility weather events and water level fluctuations occur over hours to weeks and are therefore more likely to promote short lived increases or decreases in ch4 aq solubility pore water release during fft settlement increases cap water depth and therefore p fluid and ch4 aq solubility at a given depth relative to the tailings water interface clark et al 2021 reported barometric pressure variations from approximately 98 to 104 kpa with rapid decreases of 0 8 kpa stimulating large ch4 emission events from 2012 to 2019 increases in cap water depth related to fft settlement increased p fluid by 39 to 69 kpa at a given depth relative to the tailings water interface this pressure increase has increased ch4 aq solubility by up to 80 within fft pore water although rates will continue declining over time fig s8 ongoing fft settlement will support continued increases in ch4 aq solubility declining temperatures and diluent hydrocarbon availability will likely limit ch4 production rates over time methanogenesis is a temperature dependent microbial respiration process with acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic ch4 production rates increasing with temperature from 5 to 15 c lavergne et al 2021 nozhevnikova et al 1997 additionally a combination of methanogenic biodegradation and associated vapor stripping during ebullition may deplete more labile diluent hydrocarbon fractions over time mohamad shahimin et al 2016 mohamad shahimin and siddique 2017 penner and foght 2010 simpson et al 2010 stasik et al 2015 siddique et al 2020 expected increases in ch4 aq solubility below the tailings water interface fig s10 coupled with anticipated declines in ch4 production may lead to decreased exsolution and ebullition over time although pore water release and declining porosity would decrease potential methane storage self weight consolidation is a bottom up process and porosity changes within the upper fft will be limited even as the degree of settlement approaches 100 after more than 100 years carrier et al 2007 however contributions of other gases to p tdg will increase with declining ch4 production and increased ch4 solubility and ebullition has been documented in sediments where simulated gas saturations were insufficient for this process to occur amos et al 2005 5 4 influence of ebullition on mass transport field measurements thermodynamic modelling and transport modelling support the hypothesis that ebullition enhances mixing between fft pore water and the overlying water cap these combined results also suggest that ebullition exhibits temporal and spatial variations which influence mixing on seasonal and longer time scales transport models required larger increases in d fft values for locations exhibiting higher degrees of ch4 aq saturation and higher fft settlement rates which is likely related to the elapsed time since fft deposition at a given location higher modeled fluxes at p2 are consistent with fft deposition into the northeast region occurring shortly before bml commissioning in 2012 one impact of this timing is that fft settlement rates are greatest immediately following deposition with 80 of the total settlement for a 50 m thick deposit predicted to occur within 15 years carrier et al 2007 diluent hydrocarbons that support ebullition and associated mixing become depleted over time likely decreasing the influence of these processes on fft settlement rates cema 2012 fedorak et al 2003 kavcar and wright 2009 siddique et al 2014a 2014b further considering the temperature and pressure effects on ch4 aq production and solubility the models suggest that the influence of ebullition on mass fluxes will continue declining over years to decades ebullition within cohesive sediments creates channels that provide conduits for bubbles to migrate upward these channels may remain open thereby facilitating ongoing bubble migration from a zone of dissolved gas saturation scandella et al 2011 2017 the channel diameter decreases with depth below the sediment surface corresponding to changes in hydrostatic pressure and corresponding bubble diameter scandella et al 2011 2017 sirhan et al 2019 the scaling of d fft over the model domain at individual locations reflects this change in bubble size and channel diameter with depth below the fft water interface scandella et al 2011 2017 moreover the higher d fft values applied at p2 are consistent with higher ebullitive fluxes which would produce more bubble channels to facilitate mixing between the upper fft and overlying water cap zhao et al 2021 observed numerous bubble channel openings at the fft surface these authors observed a decrease in channel diameter below the tailings water interface with presumably inactive channels backfilled with sediment bubble migration through existing channels temporarily displaces water causing back flushing of cap water following bubble release zhao et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 clearly demonstrated this process in laboratory experiments using dyed gel water systems to simulate ebullition 5 5 revised conceptual model initial conceptual models for conservative mass transport across the tailings water interface centred on pore water release during fft settlement this process drives upward vertical advective transport proportional to settlement rates which decline rapidly over time fig s8 although fft pore water release contributes solutes to the overlying water cap freshwater inputs and biogeochemical processes also influence cap water chemistry arriaga et al 2019 risacher et al 2018 these factors can produce sharp chemical gradients across the tailings water interface dompierre et al 2017 rudderham 2019 that will enhance diffusive transport declining fft settlement rates coupled with diverging water chemistry mean that diffusion will eventually become the more important chemical mass transport process dompierre et al 2017 since settlement rates and advection flux rates are the same at a given location these processes could be modeled to forecast chemical mass loading to the water cap over time however numerical models devolved by dompierre and barbour 2016 and dompierre et al 2017 clearly demonstrated that physical mixing complicates chemical mass transport and associated mass loading estimates transport models developed for this study indicate that continuous mixing due to ebullition enhances chemical mass transport but the influence of this process is likely to decline over time based on findings from the current study revised conceptual models for conservative mass transport across the bml tailings water interface should include time dependent continuous physical mixing due to ebullition fig 7 although more research is needed to constrain long term methane production rates research indicates that exsolution and ebullition will diminish over time due to declining diluent hydrocarbon availability decreasing temperatures and increasing pressures below the tailings water interface coupled with declining fft settlement and associated advective transport diffusion will eventually become the dominant driver of chemical mass transport between the fft and overlying water cap within bml 6 summary and conclusions combined field measurements and numerical modelling support the hypothesis that ebullition enhances chemical mass transport across the tailings water interface at bml concomitant decreases in chemical mass fluxes and fft settlement rates were observed from 2013 to 2019 dompierre et al 2017 the influence of ebullition on these fluxes also declined over the study period and this trend is expected to continue over time field measurements and thermodynamic modelling indicated that methanogenesis is the principal driver of ebullition at bml with ch4 concentrations approaching theoretical solubility limits over a depth interval from 1 to 3 m below the tailings water interface corresponding pressure measurements revealed conditions favorable to gas exsolution and ebullition over the same interval thermodynamic modelling also indicates that ch4 aq solubility will increase over time due to temperature decreases and pressure increases related to fft settlement and cooling coupled with declining ch4 production related to expected depletion of labile diluent hydrocarbons these combined results suggest ebullition will decline over time incorporation of enhanced physical mixing into vertical 1 d transport models substantially improved fits between simulated and measured depth profiles of cl across the tailings water interface this mixing was simulated by enhancing theoretical diffusion coefficients determined for the fft based on measured volumetric water content data different diffusion coefficients were used for the three study locations with the greatest values corresponding to higher ebullition potential inferred from ch4 aq saturation and pressure data although ebullition enhanced physical mixing between tailings pore water and overlying cap water and increased seasonal flux rates fft settlement continues to be the principal driver of annual chemical mass fluxes the relative importance of physical mixing to these fluxes increased with declining fft settlement rates anticipated declines in ch4 production over time suggest diffusion will become the dominant chemical mass transport process over time this study provides additional insight into the complex interrelated processes that influence chemical mass fluxes across the bml tailings water interface the results can inform mass

1336,analytical and numerical models describing the evolution of contaminant concentrations in the plume associated with the dissolution of napl source and degradation processes were presented in the literature at real sites and particularly in complex aquifers like chalk it is difficult to understand how the sources of contaminants evolve with time 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca is one of the few compounds with a well known hydrolysis constant that can help to improve knowledge of the contaminant sources and transport rates of dissolved contaminants in groundwater by dating the spill in this work different scenarios that could explain the evolution of the concentrations of 1 1 1 tca and its degradation product 1 1 dichloroethene 1 1 dce at a real contaminated site were investigated by analytical and numerical modelling the results show that 1 the peaks of concentration time series do not correspond to a single contamination event even in the case of a complex medium 2 the multiphasic behavior of the concentration time series is dictated by the dissolution in a heterogeneous medium and 3 the persistence of the concentrations can arise from a small residual organic phase or transport in dual domain medium keywords napl dissolution hydrolysis 1 1 1 trichloroethane analytical model numerical model 1 introduction halogenated volatile organic compounds hvocs such as 1 1 1 tca tca are dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls and are among the most frequently encountered pollutants in groundwater at industrial sites bost and perry 2006 plumb jr 1992 this situation is explained by their uses in various industrial activities in particular dry cleaning and degreasing of metal parts kota et al 2003 scheutz et al 2011 tca in particular has been used extensively for more than 35 years between 1960 and 2000 as a replacement for tce and pce because of their danger to the environment and human health lawrence 2006 morrison and murphy 2002 snyder 1990 these compounds and their degradation products are still found in the environment especially near older industrial sites where chlorinated solvents were used these sites are often subject to monitoring of concentrations in the vadose zone and in groundwater and in certain cases of pollution treatment l√∂ffler and edwards 2006 major et al 2002 mccarty 1997 scheutz et al 2008 as part of monitoring and remediation programs adopting an adequate strategy requires a good understanding of 1 the functioning of the contamination source itself and 2 the parameters that determine the persistence of these contaminations several decades after the use of these products has ceased in groundwater the degradation of tca can occur biotically or abiotically broholm et al 2014 grostern and edwards 2006 palau et al 2014 2016 scheutz et al 2011 biological degradation occurs either by aerobic bacteria by catabolism hashimoto et al 2002 either by anaerobic bacteria methanogens for example and sulphate

gander et al 2002 grostern and edwards 2006 sun et al 2002 under these conditions the degradation kinetics can be limited by the presence of co contaminants such as pce and tce duhamel et al 2002 grostern and edwards 2009 2006 abiotically tca can be degraded by hydrolysis with production of acetate hcl and 1 1 dce scheutz et al 2011 the kinetic rates of hydrolysis are higher than reductive

et al 2009 elsner et al 2008 hunkeler et al 2008 palau et al 2016 2014 vanstone et al 2008 in groundwater the concentrations of tca and 1 1 dce dissolved in the plume depend on the hydrolysis kinetics which are generally pseudo first order if the ph of the medium is lower than 11 cline and delfino 1989 vogel and mccarty 1987 wing 1997 the yield is generally independent of the temperature and the ph of the groundwater under natural environmental conditions ellenrieder and reinhard 1988 gerkens and franklin 1989 haag and mill 1988 this offers the interesting possibility to use the ratio of 1 1 dce to tca as a clock to estimate the date of the original first pollution by pure tca gauthier and murphy 2003 wing 1997 in the presence of a source zone of dnapls the dissolution kinetics of the organic phase which determines the concentrations of solutes depend on several parameters such as the organic phase mass and solubility groundwater flow rates and dispersivities clement et al 2004 nambi and powers 2000 powers et al 1992 in a heterogeneous environment other mechanisms such as the variability of local relative permeability or the dnapl water interface area of the source zone also affect the concentrations of solutes in the plume christ et al 2006 difilippo et al 2010 fure et al 2006 lemke and abriola 2006 rivett and allen king 2003 in contrast the depletion of the sources of light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls in the vadose zone is also subject to other processes such as volatilization capillary effects and water table fluctuation davis et al 2005 yang et al 2013 lari et al 2019 the present article focuses on a site contaminated by dnapls in the north of france which is regularly monitored for pollutant concentrations in groundwater at the site as well as hydraulic downstream this monitoring enabled the acquisition of almost 20 years long time series 2002 2020 of tca and 1 1 dce concentrations measured immediately downstream of the site on these concentration time series several peaks of different shapes and resolutions are observed as well as low concentrations that persist until the present day in order to determine the napl dissolution kinetics and characterize the hydrodynamic of the contaminated aquifer at the site different analytical and numerical models considering the different processes were applied and the results compared to concentration time series these models were developed to understand the origin of solutes and the persistence of these contaminants in groundwater two decades after their use ceases this may allow predicting future changes in concentrations the major objective of the paper is to use the degradation properties of tca to determine whether the different peaks observed are the result of distinct contamination events or different migration pathways if tca was present as a napl or dissolved source at the entry point of the water table and if it is possible to precisely date the origin of the contamination 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and hydrogeology the study site is a factory producing motor vehicles since 1970 it houses buildings dedicated to stamping painting storage and logistics activities the site is located on quaternary silts lying on the senonian chalks aquifer with a thickness of about 65 m in the well cores the presence of fractures was identified the impermeable substratum includes marls of the middle and lower turonian fig 1 at the site the groundwater globally flows from the southwest to the northeast with an average hydraulic gradient of 1 5 fig 2 a total porosity between 0 25 and 0 38 was measured with a mercury porosimeter on cores from boreholes drilled in 2020 soil surveys carried out between 0 and 5 m deep between 2002 and 2018 enabled the source zones delineation the two most important sources of tca are located next to the paint dilution building and the south end of sheet metal building these two source zones were well known for the risk of contamination indeed the source zone of the ca building is a paint dilution area and the source zone of the sheet metal building is the location of a former metal parts degreasing station where 1 1 1 tca was used trade name atochem the investigations confirmed an impact of 1 1 1 tca in the soil under fig s1 of the supporting information analysis of the physicochemical parameters shows for all the piezometers except for pz9 a dissolved oxygen level between 1 and 10 mg l and a redox potential that varies between 100 and 220 mv the detailed physicochemical parameters and the concentrations of the major ions are provided in table s1 of the supporting information 2 2 contamination and concentration time series a contamination of groundwater by chlorinated solvents has been detected at the site in 2002 and concentration monitoring has been set up since the plant has stopped using tca and similar products since 2000 however 20 years after this product replacement tca and its degradation product 1 1 dce are still quantified in the underlying aquifer groundwater was sampled during the years by several companies and in accordance with french standard fd x 31 615 of december 2000 relating to sampling of groundwater in a borehole the piezometers were always purged and the physicochemical parameters monitored until stabilization before sampling the samples were then placed in clean bottles provided by the laboratory stored and transported at 3 4 c protected from light until they arrived in the cold room of the laboratory the analyses were carried out by several laboratories with french cofrac accreditation the quantification limits for tca and 1 1 dce have remained constant since 2002 and are 0 5 Œºg l i e 3 5 10 9 and 5 16 10 9 mol l for tca and 1 1 dce respectively the concentration time series at pz28 and pz29 close to sources of contamination are presented in fig 3 on these figures 2 peaks of different shapes can be observed between 0 and 1000 days a first thin peak of high amplitude maximum measured concentrations of 3 10 7 and 4 10 6 mol l on pz28 and pz29 respectively was observed following this first peak a second smaller peak maximum measured concentrations of 6 10 8 and 5 10 7 mol l on pz28 and pz29 respectively occurred in the interval between 1000 and 2500 days then the measured concentrations evolved between 1 10 8 and 8 10 8 mol l in pz29 and between 7 10 9 and 2 10 8 mol l in pz28 these low concentrations a few Œºg l persist until now 2 3 estimated errors on concentrations and ratio 1 1 dce to tca the quantification limits induce errors on the calculated 1 1 dce tca ratios these errors are higher as the measured concentrations are close to these limits the uncertainties r on the 1 1 dce tca ratios were therefore calculated using errors propagation method 1 r c w dce c w tca dce c w dce 2 tca c w tca 2 where dce and tca are the absolute uncertainties considered equal to the limits of quantification of 1 1 dce and tca respectively c w dce and c w tca are the measured concentrations of dce and tca respectively as shown by wing 1997 and since transformation of tca on the studied site is mainly dehydrohalogenation and hydrolysis the rate of transformation can be expressed as 2 ln 1 4 c w dce t c w tca t k deg t the constant 4 comes from the 25 yield of 1 1 dce produced by tca transformation ellenrieder and reinhard 1988 gerkens and franklin 1989 haag and mill 1988 vogel and mccarty 1987 wing 1997 2 4 modelling assumptions six 2d models were built to reproduce the site configuration as closely as possible while honoring literature and experimental data these models were tested in order to find the one that best fits the existing data but also by comparison to help understanding the role of each process on the tca and 1 1 dce concentrations the models present one or two sources which are dissolved or in organic phase and placed in a field of hydraulic conductivity which can be homogeneous falta et al 2005a 2005b or heterogeneous nambi and powers 2000 rivett et al 2001 the medium can have a unique porosity or a dual domain zheng and wang 1999 the characteristics of the different models are summarized in fig 4 2 4 1 napl dissolution dissolution of napls occurs at the interface of water and napl it is assumed here as in literature lemke and abriola 2006 powers et al 1994 zhu and sykes 2004 that the linear driving force expression is appropriate to represent the inter phase mass transfer flux j 0 3 j 0 Œª c wsat c w where Œª is the mass transfer coefficient c wsat is the aqueous equilibrium concentration solubility and c w is the concentration of tca in the aqueous phase dissolution from a heterogeneous source was also considered the heterogeneous source consists in an area with a part located in a low permeability lowk zone and the rest having the same permeability as the whole domain globk model 3 5 include a napl source in model 5 1 1 dce is considered to partition back in the napl once it has been produced by tca degradation like shown for instance by ramsburg et al 2010 for other substances as the proportion of dce is difficult to know it was assumed to be at equilibrium with the dissolved phase considering aqueous dissolution following raoult s law 2 4 2 transport and degradation of solutes 2 4 2 1 analytical models model 1 and 6 in the simplest approach the transport is considered to occur in a homogeneous medium which leads to a 2d analytical equation for the injection of a mass at time 0 with a pore velocity v in the x direction given by eq 4 bear 2012 4 c x y t m 0 Œ∏ 4 œÄvt Œ± l Œ± t exp x vt 2 4 Œ± l vt y 2 4 Œ± t vt exp k deg t with m 0 the injected mass Œ∏ the effective porosity of the medium Œ±l and Œ±t the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities kdeg is the degradation constant of tca the concentration of tca and 1 1 dce can be calculated iteratively in a spreadsheet using first order kinetics battersby 1990 wing 1997 5 d c w tca dt k deg c w tca which implies 6 c w tca t c w tca 0 exp k deg t 7 c w dce t c w tca 0 1 exp k deg t r h where rh is the yield of 1 1 dce coming from the tca aerobic degradation c w tca t c w dce t are the dissolved tca and 1 1 dce concentration at time t 2 4 2 2 numerical models model 2 3 4 and 5 the equations were solved with the mt3dms code zheng and wang 1999 using tvd for the advective scheme the grid the boundary conditions and the flow field are presented in the supporting information degradation of tca is considered by specifying a first order rate dual domain mass transfer has been used in numerous publications to represent the mass exchange between matrices and fissures briggs et al 2014 falta 2003 greskowiak et al 2010 neumann et al 2008 zheng and wang 1999 the model consists of two domains the immobile or matrix domain porosity Œ∏ im and the mobile or fracture domain porosity Œ∏ m the exchanges between the two compartments occur through an exchange coefficient Œ∂ leading to the following formulation zheng and wang 1999 8 Œ∏ m c m t Œ∏ im c im t x i Œ∏ m d ij c m x j c m t Œ∏ m v i c m q s c s q s c m k deg Œ∏ m c m k deg Œ∏ im c im the mass conservation implies 9 Œ∏ im c im t Œ∂ c m c im k deg Œ∏ im c im where c m and c im are respectively the concentration in the mobile and immobile domain Œ∏ m and Œ∏ im are respectively the mobile and immobile porosities k deg is the degradation rate present in both domains Œ∂ is the rate of transfer between the domains although largely used this method may have some limitations karadimitriou et al 2016 the fig 5 is a conceptual representation of the set of models 2 4 3 model parameters for all models the yield of 1 1 dce rh is 0 25 as discussed previously in section 2 3 the distance between the source and the piezometer was set at 150 m as indicated by the results of the delimitation of the source zones on the site for the transport models the hydraulic gradient of the domain was set at 1 5 in accordance with the piezometric maps at the site the dispersivity values used in all models were obtained by optimization on the basis of the assumptions of model 1 the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities obtained are 30 m and 3 m respectively these quite large values of dispersivities may come from the fact that the tca peak lasts quite long from a supposed unique spill event it is possible that several events occurred during a short period and mixing of these events will result in one broader peak the other reason comes from the presence of wells screened over 15 60 m which lead to vertical mixing and thus a higher apparent dispersivity table 1 summarizes the rest of the parameters of each model 3 results 3 1 tca transformation constant and origin of the contamination dating in this paper following wing 1997 we consider that 1 1 dce is not degraded in oxidative conditions as often considered some authors ferrey et al 2004 scheutz et al 2011 wu et al 2014 showed that 1 1 dce can be degraded abiotically in presence of iron minerals such as magnetite iron sulfides green rusts and pyrite these iron minerals occur naturally in sediments and are usually quantified by x ray diffraction studies berner 2015 ferrey et al 2004 g√©nin et al 1998 however and even though we did not perform a mineralogical study on the chalk matrix data of total trace element concentrations including iron in the groundwater of the studied area table s2 supporting information suggest that concentrations of iron minerals in the chalk matrix are very low fig 6 shows the observed temporal evolution of the ratio represented for the two piezometers pz28 and pz29 both located downstream of the site the ratios in the graphs were increasing approximately linearly from 0 5 to 2 and 2 5 for pz28 and pz29 respectively beyond that between 4000 and 6000 days the increase in the ratio became smaller for pz29 and stabilized for pz28 the fitted slope is slightly higher at pz29 than pz28 however the uncertainties in the fitting suggest that these values are not statistically different it can also be seen that at pz28 the slope is higher in the period 0 1500 days then almost flat from 4000 to 6000 days for pz29 there are quite important variations of the slope with no evident reasons for these variations as 1 1 dce is formed from the hydrolysis of tca the 1 1 dce tca ratio can be used to determine the age of tca release gauthier and murphy 2003 wing 1997 wing 1997 has shown that the intersection point of the ratio regression line with the time axis gives a good estimate of the origin of the contamination the fig 6 shows that these intersection points are roughly the same on pz28 and pz29 which consolidates the contamination dating estimate it is about 4000 days from the start of monitoring corresponding to approximately 11 years before the start of monitoring which dates to 1991 it is important in making this estimate to take into account the uncertainties of the concentrations on the calculated ratios gauthier and murphy 2003 the uncertainty of the estimate is equal to 8 months and 1 8 years based on data from pz28 and pz29 respectively this origin which predates the start of the concentration measurements on the piezometers time 0 fig 5 explains the fact that the 1 1 dce tca ratios were already high at the beginning of the measurements approximately 0 7 3 2 model results 3 2 1 model 1 source is pure dissolved tca the transport parameters of the eq 3 were optimized through the excel solver which leads to a good fit of the main peak of tca and 1 1 dce at both wells as a result the root mean square error rmse of the ratios is less than 0 5 the ratio is also quite well fitted the major issue arises from long term concentrations that are null in the model while the measured ones are around 10 8 mol l i e around the regulatory values 3 2 2 model 2 dual domain model source is pure dissolved tca in a double porosity medium in the case of a dual domain medium the tca of the mobile zones is quickly mobilized leading to a concentration peak which starts to decrease after the exhaustion of tca in the mobile zone however the tca of the immobile zone is exchanged by diffusion with the mobile zone wefer roehl et al 2001 and has the effect of an extension of the tail of the concentration peak fig 8 unlike the case of homogeneous media in which the concentrations decrease rapidly after the peak 3 2 3 model 3 napl source homogeneous domain in a homogeneous medium a napl source gives concentrations in the plume which reach equilibrium fig 9 consequently the 1 1 dce tca ratio is constant after the equilibrium point with a simple organic source both the concentrations and ratio are not correctly fitted the model 3 is therefore disqualified and not further discussed 3 2 4 models 4 tca napl only and 5 tca napl and 1 1 dce napl in a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity medium with single porosity in a heterogeneous medium with tca napl source model 4 it is observed that the concentrations of the dissolved species in the plume resulting from the dissolution of a source of napl vary with time and consequently the 1 1 dce tca ratio experiences periods of growth decrease and stabilization continuous curves in fig 10 the calibrated dissolution constant leads to a very fast dissolution of the part of the source located in the globk part and thus a peak equivalent to a dissolved source then the dissolution is much slower as the flow passing through the lowk zone is very low leading to low concentrations that last until napl remains with the presence of a source of 1 1 dce model 5 the 1 1 dce tca ratio remains higher for a long time 3 2 5 model 6 source of dissolved tca in two events previous models show that with a single contamination event the second peak in concentrations is not reproducible in the hypothesis of a double contamination separated in time with the first peak at 210 days and the second peak at 1760 days and 1320 days for pz28 and pz29 respectively one obtains a reproduction of the two peaks fig 11 under these conditions the ratio increases with time and there is a sharp drop followed by a resumption of linear growth the rmse of the different models in relation to the observed data is presented in the table 2 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of models model 1 tca dissolved in homogeneous medium in a single event fig 7 and model 6 tca dissolved in homogeneous medium in two events fig 11 results show good optimizations on the 1 1 dce tca ratio rmse 0 50 the two event model 6 also simulates the second peak of concentrations and therefore shows a sharp drop in the ratio at the start of the second event due to the arrival of a fraction of dissolved tca not yet degraded however for these pure transport models the low remaining concentrations at the tail after 2000 days are not reproduced in contrast with model 1 the dual domain model 2 gives a peak which decreases more slowly low concentrations therefore last a little longer than in a homogeneous medium the main weakness of models 4 and 5 with dissolved tca is their inability to account for the low concentrations that persist after peaks in this the models in a heterogeneous medium in addition to the first peak being well fitted give a better fitting of the tail of low concentrations of tca and dce models 4 and 5 give very similar changes in concentrations between 0 and 1000 days however the post first peak evolution is more sensitive to the presence or absence of an organic phase of 1 1 dce in the source in the case of the presence of an organic phase of 1 1 dce in the source model 5 the simulated ratios are closer to the observed values this suggests the presence in the source zone of an organic phase of 1 1 dce this situation could be explained by the return of dissolved 1 1 dce in the organic phase which is generated by the affinity of the 1 1 dce for the organic phase ramsburg et al 2010 or possibly by a degradation of the tca in the unsaturated zone before the arrival of the contamination in the water table due to the fact that transfer time through the zns is slow between 0 3 and 0 7 m year chen et al 2019 4 2 evolution of the organic phase and possible explanation of the tail of low concentrations experiments were carried out on the efficiency of the elimination of a source of napl in heterogeneous porosity zone and the impact of the non uniform distribution of the napl source zones on the reduction of mass fluxes akyol 2018 akyol et al 2013 akyol and turkkan 2018 the results showed an evolution of mass fluxes in multiple steps the cause of this multi step behavior has been attributed to the heterogeneity of the napl source zone in the initial stage the organic phase within the matrix is hydraulically accessible and gives rise to high concentrations of solutes as observed at the start of the concentrations time series of pz28 and pz29 conversely the later stage is controlled by the more poorly accessible organic phase leading to low but lasting solute concentration that could explain the persistent tail in the concentrations time series of pz28 and pz29 5 conclusions concentrations time series of 1 1 1 tca and 1 1 dce in groundwater downstream of an industrial site were analyzed in this article using dissolution and transport degradation models concentrations of metallic trace elements measured in groundwater are low and conditions are aerobic given these geochemical conditions of the water table the 1 1 dce is assumed to be non reactive in numerical models the distribution of permeabilities and the transfer coefficient of the dual domain model are relatively simple and are certainly less accurate than the real fracture chalk geology of the six tested models the model 3 did neither fit concentration data nor the ratio of 1 1 dce to 1 1 1 tca the five others fitted relatively well concentration data and model 5 was the best model to fit well both concentration data and the ratio of 1 1 dce to 1 1 1 tca this suggests thus that at this site the source is a napl composed by both 1 1 dce and 1 1 1 tca and transport must be modelled in a heterogeneous domain the results of the models agree with work in the literature in that the multiphasic behavior even in the case of pollution in a single event is dictated by the type of dissolution in a heterogeneous medium for real sites this type of dissolution could complicate the estimation and forecasting of remediation efforts and should therefore be taken into consideration for better characterization of pollution and the development of effective site management strategies in particular for remedial techniques the reduction in mass flow for a given level of mass removal from the source is important information for evaluating the effectiveness of the treatment author

1336,analytical and numerical models describing the evolution of contaminant concentrations in the plume associated with the dissolution of napl source and degradation processes were presented in the literature at real sites and particularly in complex aquifers like chalk it is difficult to understand how the sources of contaminants evolve with time 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca is one of the few compounds with a well known hydrolysis constant that can help to improve knowledge of the contaminant sources and transport rates of dissolved contaminants in groundwater by dating the spill in this work different scenarios that could explain the evolution of the concentrations of 1 1 1 tca and its degradation product 1 1 dichloroethene 1 1 dce at a real contaminated site were investigated by analytical and numerical modelling the results show that 1 the peaks of concentration time series do not correspond to a single contamination event even in the case of a complex medium 2 the multiphasic behavior of the concentration time series is dictated by the dissolution in a heterogeneous medium and 3 the persistence of the concentrations can arise from a small residual organic phase or transport in dual domain medium keywords napl dissolution hydrolysis 1 1 1 trichloroethane analytical model numerical model 1 introduction halogenated volatile organic compounds hvocs such as 1 1 1 tca tca are dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls and are among the most frequently encountered pollutants in groundwater at industrial sites bost and perry 2006 plumb jr 1992 this situation is explained by their uses in various industrial activities in particular dry cleaning and degreasing of metal parts kota et al 2003 scheutz et al 2011 tca in particular has been used extensively for more than 35 years between 1960 and 2000 as a replacement for tce and pce because of their danger to the environment and human health lawrence 2006 morrison and murphy 2002 snyder 1990 these compounds and their degradation products are still found in the environment especially near older industrial sites where chlorinated solvents were used these sites are often subject to monitoring of concentrations in the vadose zone and in groundwater and in certain cases of pollution treatment l√∂ffler and edwards 2006 major et al 2002 mccarty 1997 scheutz et al 2008 as part of monitoring and remediation programs adopting an adequate strategy requires a good understanding of 1 the functioning of the contamination source itself and 2 the parameters that determine the persistence of these contaminations several decades after the use of these products has ceased in groundwater the degradation of tca can occur biotically or abiotically broholm et al 2014 grostern and edwards 2006 palau et al 2014 2016 scheutz et al 2011 biological degradation occurs either by aerobic bacteria by catabolism hashimoto et al 2002 either by anaerobic bacteria methanogens for example and sulphate reducing bacteria leading to tca transformation into 1 1 dca and then often into chloroethane adamson and parkin 1999 bae and lee 2010 cho and choi 2010 de best et al 1999 fennelly and roberts 1998 gander et al 2002 grostern and edwards 2006 sun et al 2002 under these conditions the degradation kinetics can be limited by the presence of co contaminants such as pce and tce duhamel et al 2002 grostern and edwards 2009 2006 abiotically tca can be degraded by hydrolysis with production of acetate hcl and 1 1 dce scheutz et al 2011 the kinetic rates of hydrolysis are higher than reductive dechlorination processes by about a factor of 5 with a yield varying between 73 and 80 for the production of acetate and 20 to 27 for 1 1 dce cline and delfino 1989 ellenrieder and reinhard 1988

of the groundwater under natural environmental conditions ellenrieder and reinhard 1988 gerkens and franklin 1989 haag and mill 1988 this offers the interesting possibility to use the ratio of 1 1 dce to tca as a clock to estimate the date of the original first pollution by pure tca gauthier and murphy 2003 wing 1997 in the presence of a source zone of dnapls the dissolution kinetics of the organic

measured concentrations evolved between 1 10 8 and 8 10 8 mol l in pz29 and between 7 10 9 and 2 10 8 mol l in pz28 these low concentrations a few Œºg l persist until now 2 3 estimated errors on concentrations and ratio 1 1 dce to tca the quantification limits induce errors on the calculated 1 1 dce tca ratios these errors are higher as the measured concentrations are close to these limits the uncertainties r on the 1 1 dce tca ratios were therefore calculated using errors propagation method 1 r c w dce c w tca dce c w dce 2 tca c w tca 2 where dce and tca are the absolute uncertainties considered equal to the limits of quantification of 1 1 dce and tca respectively c w dce and c w tca are the measured concentrations of dce and tca respectively as shown by wing 1997 and since transformation of tca on the studied site is mainly dehydrohalogenation and hydrolysis the rate of transformation can be expressed as 2 ln 1 4 c w dce t c w tca t k deg t the constant 4 comes from the 25 yield of 1 1 dce produced by tca transformation ellenrieder and reinhard 1988 gerkens and franklin 1989 haag and mill 1988 vogel and mccarty 1987 wing 1997 2 4 modelling assumptions six 2d models were built to reproduce the site configuration as closely as possible while honoring literature and experimental data these models were tested in order to find the one that best fits the existing data but also by comparison to help understanding the role of each process on the tca and 1 1 dce concentrations the models present one or two sources which are dissolved or in organic phase and placed in a field of hydraulic conductivity which can be homogeneous falta et al 2005a 2005b or heterogeneous nambi and powers 2000 rivett et al 2001 the medium can have a unique porosity or a dual domain zheng and wang 1999 the characteristics of the different models are summarized in fig 4 2 4 1 napl dissolution dissolution of napls occurs at the interface of water and napl it is assumed here as in literature lemke and abriola 2006 powers et al 1994 zhu and sykes 2004 that the linear driving force expression is appropriate to represent the inter phase mass transfer flux j 0 3 j 0 Œª c wsat c w where Œª is the mass transfer coefficient c wsat is the aqueous equilibrium concentration solubility and c w is the concentration of tca in the aqueous phase dissolution from a heterogeneous source was also considered the heterogeneous source consists in an area with a part located in a low permeability lowk zone and the rest having the same permeability as the whole domain globk model 3 5 include a napl source in model 5 1 1 dce is considered to partition back in the napl once it has been produced by tca degradation like shown for instance by ramsburg et al 2010 for other substances as the proportion of dce is difficult to know it was assumed to be at equilibrium with the dissolved phase considering aqueous dissolution following raoult s law 2 4 2 transport and degradation of solutes 2 4 2 1 analytical models model 1 and 6 in the simplest approach the transport is considered to occur in a homogeneous medium which leads to a 2d analytical equation for the injection of a

solved with the mt3dms code zheng and wang 1999 using tvd for the advective scheme the grid the boundary conditions and the flow field are presented in the supporting information degradation of tca is considered by specifying a first order rate dual domain mass transfer has been used in numerous publications to represent the mass exchange between matrices and fissures briggs et al 2014 falta 2003 greskowiak et al 2010 neumann et al 2008 zheng and wang 1999 the model consists of two domains the immobile or matrix domain porosity Œ∏ im and the mobile or fracture domain porosity Œ∏ m the exchanges between the two compartments occur through an exchange coefficient Œ∂ leading to the following formulation zheng and wang 1999 8 Œ∏ m c m t Œ∏ im c im t x i Œ∏ m d ij c m x j c m t Œ∏ m v i

immobile domain Œ∏ m and Œ∏ im are respectively the mobile and immobile porosities k deg is the degradation rate present in both domains Œ∂ is the rate of transfer between the domains although largely used this method may have some limitations karadimitriou et al 2016 the fig 5 is a conceptual representation of the set of models 2 4 3 model parameters for all models the yield of 1 1 dce rh is 0 25 as discussed previously in section 2 3 the distance between the source and the piezometer was set at 150 m as indicated by the results of the delimitation of the source zones on the site for the transport models the hydraulic gradient of the domain was set at 1 5 in accordance with the piezometric maps at the site the dispersivity values used in all models were obtained by optimization on the basis of the assumptions of model 1 the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities obtained are 30 m and 3 m respectively these quite large values of dispersivities may come from the fact that the tca peak lasts quite long from a supposed unique spill event it is possible that several events occurred during a short period and mixing of these events will result in one broader peak the other reason comes from the presence of wells screened over 15 60 m which lead to vertical mixing and thus a higher apparent dispersivity table 1 summarizes the rest of the parameters of each model 3 results 3 1 tca transformation constant and origin of the contamination dating in this paper following wing 1997 we consider that 1 1 dce is not degraded in oxidative conditions as often considered some authors ferrey et al 2004 scheutz et al 2011 wu et al 2014 showed that 1 1 dce can be degraded abiotically in presence of iron minerals such as magnetite iron sulfides green rusts and pyrite these iron minerals occur naturally in sediments and are usually quantified by x ray diffraction studies berner 2015 ferrey et al 2004 g√©nin et al 1998 however and even though we did not perform a mineralogical study on the chalk matrix data of total trace element concentrations including iron in the groundwater of the studied area table s2 supporting information suggest that concentrations of iron minerals in the chalk matrix are very low fig 6 shows the observed temporal evolution of the ratio represented for the two piezometers pz28 and pz29 both located downstream of the site the ratios in the graphs were increasing approximately linearly from 0 5 to 2 and 2 5 for pz28 and pz29 respectively beyond that between 4000 and 6000 days the increase in the ratio became smaller for pz29 and stabilized for pz28 the fitted slope is slightly higher at pz29 than pz28 however the uncertainties in the fitting suggest that these values are not statistically different it can also be seen that at pz28 the slope is higher in the period 0 1500 days then almost flat from 4000 to 6000 days for pz29 there are quite important variations of the slope with no evident reasons for these variations as 1 1 dce is formed from the hydrolysis of tca the 1 1 dce tca ratio can be used to determine the age of tca release gauthier and murphy 2003 wing 1997 wing 1997 has shown that the intersection point of the ratio regression line with the time axis gives a good estimate of the origin of the contamination the fig 6 shows that these intersection points are roughly the same on pz28 and pz29 which consolidates the contamination dating estimate it is about 4000 days from the start of monitoring corresponding to approximately 11 years before the start of monitoring which dates to 1991 it is important in making this estimate to take into account the uncertainties of the concentrations on the calculated ratios gauthier and murphy 2003 the uncertainty of the estimate is equal to 8 months and 1 8 years based on data from pz28 and pz29 respectively this origin which predates the start of the concentration measurements on the piezometers time 0 fig 5 explains the fact that the 1 1 dce tca ratios were already high at the beginning of the measurements approximately 0 7 3 2 model results 3 2 1 model 1 source is pure dissolved tca the transport parameters of the eq 3 were optimized through the excel solver which leads to a good fit of the main peak of tca and 1 1 dce at both wells as a result the root mean square error rmse of the ratios is less than 0 5 the ratio is also quite well fitted the major issue arises from long term concentrations that are null in the model while the measured ones are around 10 8 mol l i e around the regulatory values 3 2 2 model 2 dual domain model source is pure dissolved tca in a double porosity medium in the case of a dual domain medium the tca of the mobile zones is quickly mobilized leading to a concentration peak which starts to decrease after the exhaustion of tca in the mobile zone however the tca of the immobile zone is exchanged by diffusion with the mobile zone wefer roehl et al 2001 and has the effect of an extension of the tail of the concentration peak fig 8 unlike the case of homogeneous media in which the concentrations decrease rapidly after the peak 3 2 3 model 3 napl source homogeneous domain in a homogeneous medium a napl source gives concentrations in the plume which reach equilibrium fig 9 consequently the 1 1 dce tca ratio is constant after the equilibrium point with a simple organic source both the concentrations and ratio are not correctly fitted the model 3 is therefore disqualified and not further discussed 3 2 4 models 4 tca napl only and 5 tca napl and 1 1 dce napl in a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity medium with single porosity in a heterogeneous medium with tca napl source model 4 it is observed that the concentrations of the dissolved species in the plume resulting from the dissolution of a source of napl vary with time and consequently the 1 1 dce tca ratio experiences periods of growth decrease and stabilization continuous curves in fig 10 the calibrated dissolution constant leads to a very fast dissolution of the part of the source located in the globk part and thus a peak equivalent to a dissolved source then the dissolution is much slower as the flow passing through the lowk zone is very low leading to low concentrations that last until napl remains with the presence of a source of 1 1 dce model 5 the 1 1 dce tca ratio remains higher for a long time 3 2 5 model 6 source of dissolved tca in two events previous models show that with a single contamination event the second peak in concentrations is not reproducible in the hypothesis of a double contamination separated in time with the first peak at 210 days and the second peak at 1760 days and 1320 days for pz28 and pz29 respectively one obtains a reproduction of the two peaks fig 11 under these conditions the ratio increases with time and there is a sharp drop followed by a resumption of linear growth the rmse of the different models in relation to the observed data is presented in the table 2 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of models model 1 tca dissolved in homogeneous medium in a single event fig 7 and model 6 tca dissolved in homogeneous medium in two events fig 11 results show good optimizations on the 1 1 dce tca ratio rmse 0 50 the two event model 6 also simulates the second peak of concentrations and therefore shows a sharp drop in the ratio at the start of the second event due to the arrival of a fraction of dissolved tca not yet degraded however for these pure transport models the low remaining concentrations at the tail after 2000 days are not reproduced in contrast with model 1 the dual domain model 2 gives a peak which decreases more slowly low concentrations therefore last a little longer than in a homogeneous medium the main weakness of models 4 and 5 with dissolved tca is their inability to account for the low concentrations that persist after peaks in this the models in a heterogeneous medium in addition to the first peak being well fitted give a better fitting of the tail of low concentrations of tca and dce models 4 and 5 give very similar changes in concentrations between 0 and 1000 days however the post first peak evolution is more sensitive to the presence or absence of an organic phase of 1 1 dce in the source in the case of the presence of an organic phase of 1 1 dce in the source model 5 the simulated ratios are closer to the observed values this suggests the presence in the source zone of an organic phase of 1 1 dce this situation could be explained by the return of dissolved 1 1 dce in the organic phase which is generated by the affinity of the 1 1 dce for the organic phase ramsburg et al 2010 or possibly by a degradation of the tca in the unsaturated zone before the arrival of the contamination in the water table due to the fact that transfer time through the zns is slow between 0 3 and 0 7 m year chen et al 2019 4 2 evolution of the organic phase and possible explanation of the tail of low concentrations experiments were carried out on the efficiency of the elimination of a source of napl in heterogeneous porosity zone and the impact of the non uniform distribution of the napl source zones on the reduction of mass fluxes akyol 2018 akyol et al 2013 akyol and turkkan 2018 the results showed an evolution of mass fluxes in multiple steps the cause of this multi step behavior has been attributed to the heterogeneity of the napl source zone in the initial stage the organic phase within the matrix is hydraulically accessible and gives rise to high concentrations of solutes as observed at the start of the concentrations time series of pz28 and pz29 conversely the later stage is controlled by the more poorly accessible organic phase leading to low but lasting solute concentration that could explain the persistent tail in the concentrations time series of pz28 and pz29 5 conclusions concentrations time series of 1 1 1 tca and 1 1 dce in groundwater downstream of an industrial site were analyzed in this article using dissolution and transport degradation models concentrations of metallic trace elements measured in groundwater are low and conditions are aerobic given these geochemical conditions of the water table the 1 1 dce is assumed to be non reactive in numerical models the distribution of permeabilities and the transfer coefficient of the dual domain model are relatively simple and are certainly less accurate than the real fracture chalk geology of the six tested models the model 3 did neither fit concentration data nor the ratio of 1 1 dce to 1 1 1 tca the five others fitted relatively well concentration data and model 5 was the best model to fit well both concentration data and the ratio of 1 1 dce to 1 1 1 tca this suggests thus that at this site the source is a napl composed by both 1 1 dce and 1 1 1 tca and transport must be modelled in a heterogeneous domain the results of the models agree with work in the literature in that the multiphasic behavior even in the case of pollution in a single event is dictated by the type of dissolution in a heterogeneous medium for real sites this type of dissolution could complicate the estimation and forecasting of remediation efforts and should therefore be taken into consideration for better characterization of pollution and the development of effective site management strategies in particular for remedial techniques the reduction in mass flow for a given level of mass removal from the source is important information for evaluating the effectiveness of the treatment author

1337,immobile water is defined as a firmly bound thin film of water surrounding clay particles that somehow resembles solid features the characteristics and amount of immobile water depend on pore water chemistry the type of clay and the contact area of water with particles seepage can occur only when the hydraulic gradient increases sufficiently to date no accurate method is available to determine the immobile water content therefore an approach is proposed for direct measurement of the immobile water content which applies vegetable oil to displace water in saturated compacted clay rich materials under a high hydraulic gradient the vegetable oil completely displaces the free porewater in the clay rich materials and the remaining residual water is assumed to be immobile water by using carbon tetrachloride ccl4 as an extracting agent the oil in the permeated sample was subjected to extraction and distillation and the total liquid content was determined by the oven drying method as a final step the immobile water content in the sample was calculated a high speed centrifugation method was used to determine the immobile water content from the corresponding soil water potential which accounted for approximately 634 3 kpa it was found that the immobile water of the clay rich materials was essentially equal to the bound water the effective porosity of clay was obtained based on the immobile water content by comparing the relationship between porosity effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity the effective porosity revealed an improved linear relationship with log k the test results show the oil seepage method to be useful and reliable for the quantification of the immobile water content of saturated compacted clay rich materials keywords compacted clay rich materials immobile water oil displacing water soil water binding potential effectivity porosity 1 introduction understanding water flow through low permeability media such as clay rich materials is important for a number of practical engineering applications for example clay rich materials are considered buffer materials for the geological disposal of high level radioactive waste because of their low permeability low diffusion coefficient and high retention capacity for radionuclides tsang et al 2012 the low permeability of compacted clay rich materials is characterized by a relatively low hydraulic conductivity k and a threshold gradient i 0 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2020a due to the interactions between electrostatic forces and van der waals forces the cations in the liquid surrounding the clay particles form water films that resemble solid features around the particles and are firmly bonded to the surface of the particles wang et al 2020b zhang and lu 2018 min et al 2021 the water film around clay particles is affected by the chemicals of the pore water the type of clay and the contact area of water with particles which makes it difficult for the water to shear and flow seepage can occur only when the hydraulic gradient increases sufficiently therefore the curve of seepage velocity v versus hydraulic gradient i does not pass through the origin of the coordinates for the compacted clay rich materials and the intersection of the v i line and i axis is defined as threshold gradient i 0 therefore these water films resist flow the presence of a water film affects the pore throat radius which has a significant impact on compacted clay rich material permeation miller and low 1963 insisted that a quasicrystal structure exists at the clay water interface and that a shear stress must deform the water membrane structure to allow seepage many scholars have used nanotubes for clay pore size and molecular dynamics simulations to study the flow of water within nanotubes these scholars consider that the flow of water in the large pores may be different from that in the small pores the nearer the soil particle surfaces are to each other the greater the water density chen et al 2008 farrow et al 2011 singh and wallender 2008 used a modified kozeny carman equation to improve the prediction of hydraulic conductivity they believed that the water film on clay particle surfaces could not flow under a hydraulic gradient thus the volume of this component of water should be deducted from the void volume to obtain an effective porosity liu et al 2005 proposed a method for calculating bound water content by considering that the bound water film is continuously sheared as the displacement pressure increases when the displacement pressure increases to a certain level the water film nearly stops shearing zeng et al 2010 used oil to displace water from sandstones from oil reservoirs as the seepage pressure increased the oil saturation exhibited three stages a rapid growth phase slow growth phase and stable phase eventually oil water filtration stopped the outflow of water but the maximum oil saturation reached 60 the results showed that there was some water that resisted flow even under the high oil displacement pressure that was applied in the present paper a water film that resists flow is called an immobile water film immobile water is mainly influenced by the chemistry of the pore water the type of clay and the contact area of water with particles wang et al 2016 used a soil water binding potential of 3 8 approximately 634 3 kpa to differentiate between immobile water and flowable fluid and established an equation between the threshold gradient of clay seepage and effective porosity wang et al 2001 proposed that the amount of flowable fluid measured by nmr is equivalent to the drained water from water saturated conditions to a suction head of 689 5 kpa cui et al 2010 proposed a bound water calculation method for red clay and found that the bound water thickness of red clay was approximately 0 12 mm zhang et al 2018 obtained the equivalent calculation method of clay hydraulic conductivity based on assuming 0 12 mm thick bound water as immobile water for red clay the immobile water content has a significant effect on compacted clay permeability so we must quantify the immobile water contents and influencing factors to design impermeable clay seepage control structures such as compacted clay liners in landfills clay core walls in dam seepage control structures and radioactive waste seepage control structures additionally immobile water films play an important role in the infiltration process through clay pores and in evaluating the nonpermeation of low permeability clay at present centrifugal force is not yet a uniform estimate of the boundary pressure between mobile and immobile water and there is no direct method to determine the immobile water content dang et al 2015 to solve these problems we focus on developing a method to determine the immobile water film content permeation experiments of oil water displacement are carried out at different seepage pressures ensuring the existence of immobile water by observing the seepage process the residual water and oil contents are measured for the compacted clay rich materials additionally a centrifugal experiment is carried out for water saturated compacted clay rich materials confirming the presence of an immobile water film that corresponds to the soil water centrifugal pressure 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials as the presence of immobile water films has an impact on the hydraulic conductivity and threshold gradient two kinds of clay rich materials with different permeability characteristics were selected for experimentation the two kinds of clay rich materials were called clay a and clay b two clay rich materials were obtained from clay manufacturers clay a was produced in hebei china and the main mineral was kaolinite clay b was from nanjing china and was mainly composed of illite and montmorillonite for each clay rich material the liquid limit plastic limit and specific gravity g s were measured according to the gb t 50123 2019 method china moc 2019 and the particle size distribution of clay rich materials was measured by using a mastersizer 2000 laser particle size analyzer according to the astm d2487 11 soil classification system these clay rich materials were low liquid limit clays cls the mineral components of clay a and clay b were determined by x ray diffraction xrd pattern analysis the properties of the two clay rich materials are given in table 1 and fig 1 the two types of permeants used in this work were deionized water and vegetable oil which are both newtonian fluids the oil viscosity was 54 10 3 pa s and its density was œÅ 0 9 g cm3 as determined by the nxs 11b rotary viscometer produced by chengdu instrument factory china the viscosity has little effect on the results at lower oil viscosities while higher oil viscosities have a greater effect on the results therefore the vegetable oil was chosen after the vegetable oil and water were mixed for a long period the oil water interface was still clearly visible suggesting that no diffusion occurred 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 flexible wall permeability instrument modification an rst 1 flexible wall permeameter from the literature wang et al 2019 was used it is a constant water head permeameter the flexible wall permeameter applies gas water exchange to transfer pressure through an air compressor and the water pressure is measured by a pore pressure gauge a digital controller is used for real time monitoring of the water pressure and regulation the rst 1 flexible wall permeability apparatus was modified to include an oil permeable device and an oil water conversion system was added behind the piezometer the added system is permeable by water driven oil and ensures normal operation of the entire pressurization system the improved instrument diagram is shown in fig 2 to verify the applicability of the experimental method six sets of infiltration oil displacement experiments were conducted two clay samples and three porosities of each clay the porosity was changed by consolidation pressure œÉ 3 clay a was consolidated under consolidation pressures of 300 kpa 500 kpa and 600 kpa clay b was consolidated under consolidation pressures of 100 kpa 125 kpa and 200 kpa we measured the specific gravity g s density œÅ and water content w of the soil sample after the permeability test by deionized water and the porosity n can be derived as 1 n 1 œÅ g s œÅ w 1 w where n is the porosity œÅ is the soil density g cm3 g s is the specific gravity œÅ w is the water density g cm3 and w is the water content the porosities of the two clays are shown in table 2 2 2 2 oil seepage displacement test a good displacement liquid candidate for water must possess the following properties low toxicity low volatility and immiscibility in water since water is an inorganic liquid and poorly soluble in organic liquids an organic solution was selected as a displacement fluid general organic solutions are volatile and toxic have some effect on the measurement results and are harmful to operators to avoid these problems we chose oil as the infiltration liquid to carry out the experiment vegetable oil is easily soluble in carbon tetrachloride and both carbon tetrachloride and oil are poorly soluble in water therefore the use of carbon tetrachloride to separate oil and water from clay particles is feasible at 1 atm pressure vegetable oil has a boiling point of approximately 250 c while the boiling point of water is 100 c therefore the liquid extracted with carbon tetrachloride was evaporated at 100 c to determine the oil content the oil was boiled at 250 c to determine the total liquid content of the sample after permeation thus the oil and water contents of the sample could be measured after oil displacement the experimental process is depicted in fig 3 the details of the experimental process are as follows 2 2 2 1 sample preparation the air dried powdery particles were separated into two samples with the same moisture contents w 22 the samples were divided into three equal layers and pressed into a cutting ring with d 7 cm and h 4 cm the first two layers were filled with 93 g while the last layer was filled with 94 g the interfaces between two layers were scarified to make seepage proofing contact the initial dry density of all samples was approximately 1 5 g cm3 the prepared samples were saturated by vacuum in a saturated cylinder and then placed in a flexible wall apparatus the samples needed to be consolidated under a certain consolidation pressure if the water level in the drainpipe did not change under a certain consolidation pressure the sample had reached stable consolidation all moisture contents were calculated over the dry season 2 2 2 2 water seepage the loaded sample was consolidated until the liquid level in the exudation volume tube remained unchanged once consolidation was completed seepage pressure was applied to induce water seepage to prevent the porosity of a sample from changing under high seepage pressure the seepage pressure was changed from high to low pressures for clay a the seepage pressures were 70 kpa 140 kpa 210 kpa and 280 kpa under consolidation pressure of 300 kpa the seepage pressures were 120 kpa 240 kpa 360 kpa and 480 kpa under consolidation pressure of 500 kpa and the seepage pressures were 140 kpa 280 kpa 420 kpa and 560 kpa under consolidation pressure of 600 kpa for clay b the seepage pressures were 20 kpa 40 kpa 60 kpa and 80 kpa under a consolidation pressure of 100 kpa the seepage pressures were 25 kpa 50 kpa 75 kpa and 100 kpa under a consolidation pressure of 125 kpa and the seepage pressures were 40 kpa 80 kpa 120 kpa and 160 kpa under a consolidation pressure of 200 kpa under the seepage pressure in each stage the liquid level of the exudation was recorded every 2 h when the calculated seepage flow rate stabilized the next level of seepage pressure was applied finally the measured infiltration curve of the sample was obtained 2 2 2 3 oil seepage after the infiltration was complete according to the infiltration curve a high seepage pressure was chosen to test the sample under rapid oil seepage deionized water infiltration was applied to another sample under the same seepage pressure only when seepage oil exudation was the only liquid coming from the oil seepage outlet was a higher seepage pressure for oil seepage applied 2 2 2 4 oil and water separation the sample then underwent an oil water separation test a total of 5 g of sample was placed into a 250 ml conical flask with 100 ml of ccl4 added the flask was sealed and then placed on a horizontal oscillator for 24 h after the oscillation the sample was filtered by using a 0 45 Œºm filter membrane under a vacuum pumping device the solid and liquid were considered to be separated when the filtrate was not produced within 5 min extraction and filtration were performed for at least an hour at normal atmospheric pressure the boiling point of oil is 250 c the boiling point of water is 100 c and the boiling point of ccl4 is 78 c the vacuum created by the vacuum pump with a rotary evaporator reached 0 09 mpa in this case the boiling point of the oil is approximately 150 c the boiling point of the water is approximately 48 c and the boiling point of ccl‚ÇÑ is approximately 30 c therefore the supernatant was placed in a rotary evaporator the rotary evaporator temperature was set to 60 c the vacuum was set to 0 09 mpa and the speed was set to 100 rpm finally water and ccl4 were removed and the oil content was obtained additionally 5 g of the infiltrated sample was weighed before and after it was dried in a muffle furnace at 250 c to determine the total liquid content of the sample 2 2 2 5 immobile water calculation after the sample was tested the water content w b and displaced oil content w o were obtained according to parallel sample 2 we could determine the moisture content w by drying tests after the water penetration test since the oil volume w o is equal to the original free water volume v f by calculation we determined the free water content w f and the immobile water content w b after water was displaced from the sample 2 w b w w o œÅ w œÅ o where w is the water content w b is the immobile water content w o is the oil content œÅ o is the oil density g cm3 and œÅ w is the water density g cm3 2 2 2 6 immobile water content and corresponding soil water potential to determine the soil water potential of immobile water a centrifugation test was carried out on another sample after the water seepage experiment by using a himac cr21 mini centrifuge produced by hitachi japan the rotation speeds were set to 500 rpm 1000 rpm 3000 rpm 5000 rpm 7000 rpm and 9000 rpm the corresponding soil water potential pf values were calculated according to gardner 1937 this process could provide the water retention curve of the sample due to the low hydraulic conductivity of saturated clay to ensure that the water could be discharged in each stage the test at each rotation speed used in the test was held for 24 h the water content measured in the infiltration test corresponded to the soil water retention curve so the corresponding pf value of the immobile water could be determined the consolidation pressures porosity rotation speed and pf of the two clay rich materials are shown in table 2 3 results 3 1 water penetration test results to ensure the seepage stability of the sample under the hydraulic gradient at each level the volume in the tube at the outlet was read at 2 h intervals the flow rate was calculated and plotted against time fig 4 when the continuous measurement of flow q loss was less than or equal to 25 the infiltration was considered stable when the calculated permeated flow was stable the next level of seepage pressure was applied the measured infiltration curve of the sample was thus obtained the hydraulic conductivity and threshold gradient that each porosity corresponded to could be obtained through the infiltration curve as shown in table 3 3 2 oil penetration test results for the oil to quickly displace the flowable water in the clay sample a greater seepage pressure should be applied the seepage pressure was selected to be lower than the consolidation pressure of 50 kpa under the first oil permeability pressure three stages of oil water displacement were observed as shown in fig 5 a b and c initially the water percolated to the collection port in the first stage as shown in fig 5 a the water and oil percolated to the collection port in the second stage as shown in fig 5 b ultimately the oil percolated to the collection port in the third stage as shown in fig 5 c to ensure that all flowable water could percolate the seepage pressure was continuously increased by 15 kpa while collection port exudation was observed if the collection port still showed water percolation the seepage pressure was increased until essentially no water seepage was observed the pressure of each stage was increased by 15 kpa to displace all flowable water 3 3 oil separation experiment results the resultant liquid was filtered through a 0 45 Œºm filtered membrane into a rotary evaporator flask for oil water separation and the weight of the flask was recorded every minute the evaporation mass is the mass reduced by the evaporation flask during evaporation finally the evaporation curve could be obtained fig 6 shows the oil water separation and evaporation curve of clay a with a porosity of 37 28 the water evaporated quickly in the beginning and the mass of the liquid in the evaporation flask rapidly decreased approximately 2 min later the evaporation rate gradually decreased after approximately 5 min the mass of the liquid reached a constant value the content flask was only the permeated oil the oil seepage test could determine the residual moisture immobile water content the free water content and immobile water content in the sample before oil permeation could be obtained by further calculation the specific data are shown in table 4 4 discussion 4 1 relationship of mineral composition porosity and immobile water table 4 shows that clay b has a slightly more immobile water content when the porosities of clay a and clay b are approximately equal the existence of an immobile water film is mainly due to the interaction of particles and water the stronger the interaction between the particles and the water is the thicker the water film the main mineral component of clay a is kaolinite 71 and the main mineral components of clay b are illite 58 and montmorillonite 12 since montmorillonite and illite have a slightly larger specific surface area than kaolinite montmorillonite and illite particles interact strongly with the surrounding water consequently the immobile water content that forms around its particles is slightly higher for clay b since the smaller immobile water film is produced by kaolinite the immobile water content is slightly lower for clay a additionally for the same kind of clay table 4 the smaller the porosity is the smaller the immobile water content this is mainly because the lower the porosity is the less contact area between soil and water and the thinner the immobile water film because the immobile water film has solid state characteristics it is difficult to shear and flow therefore the content of immobile water film directly affects the effective porosity the more immobile water is present the smaller the effective porosity and the slower the penetration rate in contrast the less immobile water is present the greater the porosity of infiltration and the faster the relative penetration rate 4 2 immobile water corresponding to soil water potential the immobile water content is deduced from the oil seepage test the water retention curves obtained from the centrifuge tests for all of clay a and clay b are shown in fig 7 the immobile water content was examined against the water retention curve the soil water potential corresponding to the measured water content was approximately 3 8 and the centrifugal pressure was approximately 634 3 kpa in the field of soil science lebedev suggested that pf 3 8 be used as the demarcation point between bound water and free water and high speed centrifugation has been used as a method to determine the bound water and free water contents gardner 1937 some scholars have also studied permeability using pf 3 8 as the demarcation point between bound and free water xu et al 2019 zhu et al 2007 therefore the measured immobile water content is comparable to the bound water content as shown in fig 8 the relationship between the immobile water content and the bound water content of the two clays is linear with a slope of 1 suggesting that the two types of water obtained by two independent methods are equivalent therefore it is worth researching in the future whether a centrifugal test can be used to obtain the bound water content of an infiltrated sample by displacing the immobile water content for more clay rich materials and to compare experiments with these available theoretical values lu 2016 4 3 relationship between the effective porosity and the hydraulic conductivity since it is difficult to displace immobile water in the seepage process immobile water can be taken as the particle framework in this system the pores that strongly affect the seepage process are the effective porosity e g the porosity corresponding to pf 3 8 the effective porosity n e is given by 3 n e Œ∏ s Œ∏ 3 8 where n e is the effective porosity Œ∏ s is the initial saturated volumetric water content and Œ∏ 3 8 is the volumetric water content for pf 3 8 by using eq 3 we calculate the effective porosity of all permeated clay samples and the relationship between the hydraulic conductivity log k porosity and effective porosity is established figs 9 and 10 some scholars have proposed that porosity has a fine linear relationship with log k but the linear relationship is poor for some compacted clays song et al 2018 dixon et al 2011 nagaraj et al 1993 for clay a porosity has a fine linear relationship with log k r2 0 97 for clay b porosity has a poor linear relationship with log k r2 0 72 the effective porosity has a better linear relationship than porosity with log k for two clay rich materials for clay a changing the porosity to effective porosity increases the corresponding r2 from 0 97 to 0 99 as shown in fig 9 for clay b changing the porosity to effective porosity increases the corresponding r2 from 0 72 to 0 97 as shown in fig 10 the main mineral component of clay a is kaolinite 71 and the main mineral components of clay b are illite 58 and montmorillonite 12 therefore clay b is more affected by immobile water and effective porosity and the increase in r2 is more obvious between the effective porosity and log k for clay b furthermore the determination method of immobile water is proven to be correct 5 conclusions 1 this paper proposes a method to determine the immobile water content between clay particles mainly by oil water displacement the specific steps are as follows 1 sample loading 2 water seepage 3 oil seepage

determination of total liquid content by the oven drying method and 3 calculation 3 through these measurements it was found that the two different types of clay studied had different immobile water contents for the two clay samples with the same porosity the immobile water content of clay b which is mainly composed of illite and montmorillonite is slightly higher than that of kaolinitic clay a additionally for the same kind of clay table 4 with an increase in porosity the immobile water content increases the pf corresponding to the immobile water content is approximately 3 8 and the centrifugal pressure is approximately 634 3 kpa 4 the effective porosity of clay is obtained by immobile water by comparing the relationship between porosity effective porosity and hydraulic

1337,immobile water is defined as a firmly bound thin film of water surrounding clay particles that somehow resembles solid features the characteristics and amount of immobile water depend on pore water chemistry the type of clay and the contact area of water with particles seepage can occur only when the hydraulic gradient increases sufficiently to date no accurate method is available to determine the immobile water content therefore an approach is proposed for direct measurement of the immobile water content which applies vegetable oil to displace water in saturated compacted clay rich materials under a high hydraulic gradient the vegetable oil completely displaces the free porewater in the clay rich materials and the remaining residual water is assumed to be immobile water by using carbon tetrachloride ccl4 as an extracting agent the oil in the permeated sample was subjected to extraction and distillation and the total liquid content was determined by the oven drying method as a final step the immobile water content in the sample was calculated a high speed centrifugation method was used to determine the immobile water content from the corresponding soil water potential which accounted for approximately 634 3 kpa it was found that the immobile water of the clay rich materials was essentially equal to the bound water the effective porosity of clay was obtained based on the immobile water content by comparing the relationship between porosity effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity the effective porosity revealed an improved linear relationship with log k the test results show the oil seepage method to be useful and reliable for the quantification of the immobile water content of saturated compacted clay rich materials keywords compacted clay rich materials immobile water oil displacing water soil water binding potential effectivity porosity 1 introduction understanding water flow through low permeability media such as clay rich materials is important for a number of practical engineering applications for example clay rich materials are considered buffer materials for the geological disposal of high level radioactive waste because of their low permeability low diffusion coefficient and high retention capacity for radionuclides tsang et al 2012 the low permeability of compacted clay rich materials is characterized by a relatively low hydraulic conductivity k and a threshold gradient i 0 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2020a due to the interactions between electrostatic forces and van der waals forces the cations in the liquid surrounding the clay particles form water films that resemble solid features around the particles and are firmly bonded to the surface of the particles wang et al 2020b zhang and lu 2018 min et al 2021 the water film around clay particles is affected by the chemicals of the pore water the type of clay and the contact area of water with particles which makes it difficult for the water to shear and flow seepage can occur only when the hydraulic gradient increases sufficiently therefore the curve of seepage velocity v versus hydraulic gradient i does not pass through the origin of the coordinates for the compacted clay rich materials and the intersection of the v i line and i axis is defined as threshold gradient i 0 therefore these water films resist flow the presence of a water film affects the pore throat radius which has a significant impact on compacted clay rich material permeation miller and low 1963 insisted that a quasicrystal structure exists at the clay water interface and that a shear stress must deform the water membrane structure to allow seepage many scholars have used nanotubes for clay pore size and molecular dynamics simulations to study the flow of water within nanotubes these scholars consider that the flow of water in the large pores may be different from that in the small pores the nearer the soil particle surfaces are to each other the greater the water density chen et al 2008 farrow et al 2011 singh and wallender 2008 used a modified kozeny carman equation to improve the prediction of hydraulic conductivity they believed that the water film on clay particle surfaces could not flow under a hydraulic gradient thus the volume of this component of water should be deducted from the void volume to obtain an effective porosity liu et al 2005 proposed a method for calculating bound water content by considering that the bound water film is continuously sheared as the displacement pressure increases when the displacement pressure increases to a certain level the water film nearly stops shearing zeng et al 2010 used oil to displace water from sandstones from oil reservoirs as the seepage pressure increased the oil saturation exhibited three stages a rapid growth phase slow growth phase and stable phase eventually oil water filtration stopped the outflow of water but the maximum oil saturation reached 60 the results showed that there was some water that resisted flow even under the high oil displacement pressure that was applied in the present paper a water film that resists flow is called an immobile water film immobile water is mainly influenced by the chemistry of the pore water the type of clay and the contact area of water with particles wang et al 2016 used a soil water binding potential of 3 8 approximately 634 3 kpa to differentiate between immobile water and flowable fluid and established an equation between the threshold gradient of clay seepage and effective porosity wang et al 2001 proposed that the amount of flowable fluid measured by nmr is equivalent to the drained water from water saturated conditions to a suction head of 689 5 kpa cui et al 2010 proposed a bound water calculation method for red clay and found that the bound water thickness of red clay was approximately 0 12 mm zhang et al 2018 obtained the equivalent calculation method of clay hydraulic conductivity based on assuming 0 12 mm thick bound water as immobile water for red clay the immobile water content has a significant effect on compacted clay permeability so we must quantify the immobile water contents and influencing factors to design impermeable clay seepage control structures such as compacted clay liners in landfills clay core walls in dam seepage control structures and radioactive waste seepage control structures additionally immobile water films play an important role in the infiltration process through clay pores and in evaluating the nonpermeation of low permeability clay at present centrifugal force is not yet a uniform estimate of the boundary pressure between mobile and immobile water and there is no direct method to determine the immobile water content dang et al 2015 to solve these problems we focus on developing a method to determine the immobile water film content permeation experiments of oil water displacement are carried out at different seepage pressures ensuring the existence of immobile water by observing the seepage process the residual water and oil contents are measured for the compacted clay rich materials additionally a centrifugal experiment is carried out for water saturated compacted clay rich materials confirming the presence of an immobile water film that corresponds to the soil water centrifugal pressure 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials as the presence of immobile water films has an impact on the hydraulic conductivity and threshold gradient two kinds of clay rich materials with different permeability characteristics were selected for experimentation the two kinds of clay rich materials were called clay a and clay b two clay rich materials were obtained from clay manufacturers clay a was produced in hebei china and the main mineral was kaolinite clay b was from nanjing china and was mainly composed of illite and montmorillonite for each clay rich material the liquid limit plastic limit and specific gravity g s were measured according to the gb t 50123 2019 method china moc 2019 and the particle size distribution of clay rich materials was measured by using a mastersizer 2000 laser particle size analyzer according to the astm d2487 11 soil classification system these clay rich materials were low liquid limit clays cls the mineral components of clay a and clay b were determined by x ray diffraction xrd pattern analysis the properties of the two clay rich materials are given in table 1 and fig 1 the two types of permeants used in this work were deionized water and vegetable oil which are both newtonian fluids the oil viscosity was 54 10 3 pa s and its density was œÅ 0 9 g cm3 as determined by the nxs 11b rotary viscometer produced by chengdu instrument factory china the viscosity has little effect on the results at lower oil viscosities while higher oil viscosities have a greater effect on the results therefore the vegetable oil was chosen after the vegetable oil and water were mixed for a long period the oil water interface was still clearly visible suggesting that no diffusion occurred 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 flexible wall permeability instrument modification an rst 1 flexible wall permeameter from the literature wang et al 2019 was used it is a constant water head permeameter the flexible wall permeameter applies gas water exchange to transfer pressure through an air compressor and the water pressure is measured by a pore pressure gauge a digital controller is used for real time monitoring of the water pressure and regulation the rst 1 flexible wall permeability apparatus was modified to include an oil permeable device and an oil water conversion system was added behind the piezometer the added system is permeable by water driven oil and ensures normal operation of the entire pressurization system the improved instrument diagram is shown in fig 2 to verify the applicability of the experimental method six sets of infiltration oil displacement experiments were conducted two clay samples and three porosities of each clay the porosity was changed by consolidation pressure œÉ 3 clay a was consolidated under consolidation pressures of 300 kpa 500 kpa and 600 kpa clay b was consolidated under consolidation pressures of 100 kpa 125 kpa and 200 kpa we measured the specific gravity g s density œÅ and water content w of the soil sample after the permeability test by deionized water and the porosity n can be derived as 1 n 1 œÅ g s œÅ w 1 w where n is the porosity œÅ is the soil density g cm3 g s is the specific gravity œÅ w is the water density g cm3 and w is the water content the porosities of the two clays are shown in table 2 2 2 2 oil seepage displacement test a good displacement liquid candidate for water must possess the following properties low toxicity low volatility and immiscibility in water since water is an inorganic liquid and poorly soluble in organic liquids an organic solution was selected as a displacement fluid general organic solutions are volatile and toxic have some effect on the measurement results and are harmful to operators to avoid these problems we chose oil as the infiltration liquid to carry out the experiment vegetable oil is easily soluble in carbon tetrachloride and both carbon tetrachloride and oil are poorly soluble in water therefore the use of carbon tetrachloride to separate oil and water from clay particles is feasible at 1 atm pressure vegetable oil has a boiling point of approximately 250 c while the boiling point of water is 100 c therefore the liquid extracted with carbon tetrachloride was evaporated at 100 c to determine the oil content the oil was boiled at 250 c to determine the total liquid content of the sample after permeation thus the oil and water contents of the sample could be measured after oil displacement the experimental process is depicted in fig 3 the details of the experimental process are as follows 2 2 2 1 sample preparation the air dried powdery particles were separated into two samples with the same moisture contents w 22 the samples were divided into three equal layers and pressed into a cutting ring with d 7 cm and h 4 cm the first two layers were filled with 93 g while the last layer was filled with 94 g the interfaces between two layers were scarified to make seepage proofing contact the initial dry density of all samples was approximately 1 5 g cm3 the prepared samples were saturated by vacuum in a saturated cylinder and then placed in a flexible wall apparatus the samples needed to be consolidated under a certain consolidation pressure if the water level in the drainpipe did not change under a certain consolidation pressure the sample had reached stable consolidation all moisture contents were calculated over the dry season 2 2 2 2 water seepage the loaded sample was consolidated until the liquid level in the exudation volume tube remained unchanged once consolidation was completed seepage pressure was applied to induce water seepage to prevent the porosity of a sample from changing under high seepage pressure the seepage pressure was changed from high to low pressures for clay a the seepage pressures were 70 kpa 140 kpa 210 kpa and 280 kpa under consolidation pressure of 300 kpa the seepage pressures were 120 kpa 240 kpa 360 kpa and 480 kpa under consolidation pressure of 500 kpa and the seepage pressures were 140 kpa 280 kpa 420 kpa and 560 kpa under consolidation pressure of 600 kpa for clay b the seepage pressures were 20 kpa 40 kpa 60 kpa and 80 kpa under a consolidation pressure of 100 kpa the seepage pressures were 25 kpa 50 kpa 75 kpa and 100 kpa under a consolidation pressure of 125 kpa and the seepage pressures were 40 kpa 80 kpa 120 kpa and 160 kpa under a consolidation pressure of 200 kpa under the seepage pressure in each stage the liquid level of the exudation was recorded every 2 h when the calculated seepage flow rate stabilized the next level of seepage pressure was applied finally the measured infiltration curve of the sample was obtained 2 2 2 3 oil seepage after the infiltration was complete according to the infiltration curve a high seepage pressure was chosen to test the sample under rapid oil seepage deionized water infiltration was applied to another sample under the same seepage pressure only when seepage oil exudation was the only liquid coming from the oil seepage outlet was a higher seepage pressure for oil seepage applied 2 2 2 4 oil and water separation the sample then underwent an oil water separation test a total of 5 g of sample was placed into a 250 ml conical flask with 100 ml of ccl4 added the flask was sealed and then placed on a horizontal oscillator for 24 h after the oscillation the sample was filtered by using a 0 45 Œºm filter membrane under a vacuum pumping device the solid and liquid were considered to be separated when the filtrate was not produced within 5 min extraction and filtration were performed for at least an hour at normal atmospheric pressure the boiling point of oil is 250 c the boiling point of water is 100 c and the boiling point of ccl4 is 78 c the vacuum created by the vacuum pump with a rotary evaporator reached 0 09 mpa in this case the boiling point of the oil is approximately 150 c the boiling point of the water is approximately 48 c and the boiling point of ccl‚ÇÑ is approximately 30 c therefore the supernatant was placed in a rotary evaporator the rotary evaporator temperature was set to 60 c the vacuum was set to 0 09 mpa and the speed was set to 100 rpm finally water and ccl4 were removed and the oil content was obtained additionally 5 g of the infiltrated sample was weighed before and after it was dried in a muffle furnace at 250 c to determine the total liquid content of the sample 2 2 2 5 immobile water calculation after the sample was tested the water content w b and displaced oil content w o were obtained according to parallel sample 2 we could determine the moisture content w by drying tests after the water penetration test since the oil volume w o is equal to the original free water volume v f by calculation we determined the free water content w f and the immobile water content w b after water was displaced from the sample 2 w b w w o œÅ w œÅ o where w is the water content w b is the immobile water content w o is the oil content œÅ o is the oil density g cm3 and œÅ w is the water density g cm3 2 2 2 6 immobile water content and corresponding soil water potential to determine the soil water potential of immobile water a centrifugation test was carried out on another sample after the water seepage experiment by using a himac cr21 mini centrifuge produced by hitachi japan the rotation speeds were set to 500 rpm 1000 rpm 3000 rpm 5000 rpm 7000 rpm and 9000 rpm the corresponding soil water potential pf values were calculated according to gardner 1937 this process could provide the water retention curve of the sample due to the low hydraulic conductivity of saturated clay to ensure that the water could be discharged in each stage the test at each rotation speed used in the test was held for 24 h the water content measured in the infiltration test corresponded to the soil water retention curve so the corresponding pf value of the immobile water could be determined the consolidation pressures porosity rotation speed and pf of the two clay rich materials are shown in table 2 3 results 3 1 water penetration test results to ensure the seepage stability of the sample under the hydraulic gradient at each level the volume in the tube at the outlet was read at 2 h intervals the flow rate was calculated and plotted against time fig 4 when the continuous measurement of flow q loss was less than or equal to 25 the infiltration was considered stable when the calculated permeated flow was stable the next level of seepage pressure was applied the measured infiltration curve of the sample was thus obtained the hydraulic conductivity and threshold gradient that each porosity corresponded to could be obtained through the infiltration curve as shown in table 3 3 2 oil penetration test results for the oil to quickly displace the flowable water in the clay sample a greater seepage pressure should be applied the seepage pressure was selected to be lower than the consolidation pressure of 50 kpa under the first oil permeability pressure three stages of oil water displacement were observed as shown in fig 5 a b and c initially the water percolated to the collection port in the first stage as shown in fig 5 a the water and oil percolated to the collection port in the second stage as shown in fig 5 b ultimately the oil percolated to the collection port in the third stage as shown in fig 5 c to ensure that all flowable water could percolate the seepage pressure was continuously increased by 15 kpa while collection port exudation was observed if the collection port still showed water percolation the seepage pressure was increased until essentially no water seepage was observed the pressure of each stage was increased by 15 kpa to displace all flowable water 3 3 oil separation experiment results the resultant liquid was filtered through a 0 45 Œºm filtered membrane into a rotary evaporator flask for oil water separation and the weight of the flask was recorded every minute the evaporation mass is the mass reduced by the evaporation flask during evaporation finally the evaporation curve could be obtained fig 6 shows the oil water separation and evaporation curve of clay a with a porosity of 37 28 the water evaporated quickly in the beginning and the mass of the liquid in the evaporation flask rapidly decreased approximately 2 min later the evaporation rate gradually decreased after approximately 5 min the mass of the liquid reached a constant value the content flask was only the permeated oil the oil seepage test could determine the residual moisture immobile water content the free water content and immobile water content in the sample before oil permeation could be obtained by further calculation the specific data are shown in table 4 4 discussion 4 1 relationship of mineral composition porosity and immobile water table 4 shows that clay b has a slightly more immobile water content when the

national wetland park in the hainan island china was chosen as a case study the results showed that agricultural n emission to water in 2018 increased fivefold compared to 1990 leaching was the main

the natural ecosystem water soil and atmosphere have been polluted to varying extent ma et al 2010 at the same time livestock farming was also gradually developing in the transition from traditional free range to the current intensive agriculture however the current utilization efficiency of n and p in agriculture was backward and the removal rate of n and p in animal manure was low which caused a large amount of nutrients enter the water body and then causing considerable damage to the environment bai et al 2016 67 of the world s megacities referring to cities with a population of more than 10 million are located in coastal areas pittman et al 2019 the bay is an important link between land and sea fang et al 2020 li et al 2017 excessive emissions of n and p have caused eutrophication of

shrimp species pinto et al 2012 farmland and pasture were considered to be the main reasons for the eutrophication of global coasts and oceans in the past century vigouroux et al 2021 and the nutrient level of agricultural exports was much higher than that of forests grasslands and other land use types rodr√≠guez gallego et al 2017 it was estimated that 59 of n output in china came from agriculture yu et al 2019 in the united states tp in agriculture accounted for 47 50 of marine eutrophication ortiz reyes and anex 2018 it was predicted that the intensity duration and frequency of eutrophication in this century would increase due to the effects of climate change on rainfall patterns combined with human activities suteja et al 2021 cultural eutrophication started in the context of population explosion and socio economic development in 1950 with a worldwide sixfold increase in fertilizers use consequently a two to fourfold increase in n fluxes and threefold increase in p fluxes to the coastal zone desmit et al 2018 china has become the largest consuming country of n and p fertilizers in the world ma et al 2013 sims et al 2013 strokal et al 2016 yu et al 2019 and agricultural land source pollution flowed into the ocean coast becoming one of the countries with the most severe eutrophication pollution in the world wang et al 2018a xu and zhang 2012 the mangrove nature reserve in bamen bay bmb has the most abundant mangrove species in china and is a typical agricultural pollution bay wang et al 2021 affected by human activities excessive n and p in agriculture have caused severe eutrophication pollution in the lagoon herbeck et al 2013 since the 1960s mangrove resources have been rapidly degraded due to environmental factors from 3611 ha in 1956 to 750 ha at present huang et al 2013 however the research on eutrophication was mainly conducted in temperate regions such as the us and europe etc and such studies have rarely been conducted in tropical regions in china zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 quantitatively revealing the spatiotemporal flow characteristics and sources of agricultural n and p nutrients is the key to alleviate water pollution some prevalent hydrological models have been used to study this problem such as swat the soil and water assessment tool and annagnps annualized agricultural non point source pollution model cheng et al 2021 li et al 2015 however these models required complicated data and the sources of spatial pollution were difficult to identify which limits their application zhao et al 2019 the output coefficient method provides a way to determine the control elements without monitoring the water quality of the basin dupas et al 2015 the watershed nutrient output model is a watershed scale model that can simulate nutrient input and output with less data mayorga et al 2010 it could be used to estimate global n and p output from river or ocean but the spatial resolution of the result was low and the parameters were relatively lacking recently the development of a nutrient flow model in the food chain can quantify the loss of n and p from the food chain to water body with less data bai et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 this is extremely beneficial to the effective study of non point source pollution especially for bmb a tropical area of china where data is relatively deficient however traditional methods ignored the impact of land use changes and generally used administrative units for research ignoring the flow of pollutants from land to gulf in the natural basin unit the land sea water environment management considering the basin unit is an important means of gulf governance at present wang et al 2019 besides the spatiotemporal management of agricultural nutrients emissions based on high resolution land use data has not been studied yet these limited the nutrition management in agricultural pollution bay where data was lacking hence the objectives of this study were 1 to quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics of n and p emissions to water in the crop and animal system from 1990 to 2018 in bmb area with high resolution based nufer model 2 to identify the main sources of agricultural n and p emissions of bmb from 1990 to 2018 and the changes in the contribution of different crop and animal categories and propose mitigation option for agricultural pollution type bays based on the concept of land sea coordination 2 materials and methods bamen bay bmb is located in the northeast of hainan island china fig 1 the mangroves in hainan island accounted for 40 of the 81 mangrove resources in the world and it was the largest mangroves in hainan island wang et al 2021 affected by the tropical monsoon climate bmb s dry season is from november to april the rainy season is from may to october the annual average temperature is 22 26 c and the annual precipitation is 1500 2000 mm herbeck et al 2013 bmb is composed of wenjiao river and wenchang river basin with an area of 768 3km2 and 516 6km2 respectively the lengths of the two rivers are 56 0 km and 37 1 km respectively li et al 2013 liu et al 2011 the wenjiao river and wenchang river flow into the lagoon and are connected to the ocean through a long and narrow natural channel both basins located in wenchang city which is composed of 12 towns in 2018 the arable land and economic forest in the study area accounted for 34 9 and 30 0 of the land use which was a typical agricultural area fig 2 according to the monitoring data in 2018 the tn and tp point source pollution of industrial and domestic sewage accounted for about 3 5 and 2 0 in wenjiao river respectively and the tn and tp point source pollution accounted for 7 1 and 4 6 in wenchang river respectively ecological environmental protection bureau wenchang hainan provincial water affairs department 2018 which indicated that the n and p pollution in both basins was mainly non point source pollution most of the n and p emissions came from agriculture su et al 2011 the basins mainly were represented for tropical agriculture including rice tropical fruits cash crops etc the main source of water resources in the bay is the input of fresh water from the two rivers since the 1960s a large number of mangroves have disappeared replaced by intensive and semi intensive marine fish and shrimp breeding ponds herbeck et al 2011 coupled with agricultural non point source pollution the water quality in bmb has become one of the worst in hainan province 2 1 estimation of non point source pollution of agricultural n and p generally agricultural non point source pollution refers to the emissions of nutrients from cultivated land to water this includes two parts of land source agricultural pollution 1 emissions of agricultural n and p to water body via runoff leaching and erosion from crop system 2 n and p leaching and direct discharge of manure from animal system to quantify the agricultural n and p emissions to water we constructed a high resolution nufer model based on ma et al 2010 bai et al 2016 and zhao et al 2019 nufer model was originally used to evaluate nutrient flow in the food chain and losses in each step of the food chain ma et al 2010 it uses a mass balance approach and starts with an estimation of nutrients input for the different crop and animal categories the input items of the nufer model include chemical fertilizers organic fertilizers atmospheric deposition biological fixation n seeds irrigation water in the crop system and fodder in the animal system the output items mainly include agricultural products and environmental losses the model takes soil crop animal as the boundary condition the values and parameters used are presented in detail in the supplemental information si the main improvements of high resolution based nufer model in this study were following 1 considering natural factors topography meteorology soil conditions and anthropogenic factors fertilization methods straw and manure treat ways manure storage status based on field investigation 2 the results could guide agricultural specific management via source identification based on land sea coordination 2 1 1

temperature and soil organic matter content were used to calculate the distribution of n p leaching erosion and runoff reduction coefficients via arcgis respectively fig 3 finally we evenly distributed n ptopsoil n papplication n psurplus to the arable land and economic forest of each town with a resolution of 30 m 30 m table s1 for specific values 2 1 2 n p emission from animal system for the animal system n and p were discharged to the water via direct discharge and leaching from animal management chain including housing storage and treatment stages bai et al 2016 we first calculated by multiplying n p excretion rate table s2 with the livestock number in different livestock systems to obtain the total emission then calculated by multiplying the respective proportion of direct discharge or leaching with total emission in the management chain of animal obtained from the investigation finally n and p emissions in animal system were evenly allocated to the rural settlement areas in each town assuming that all the available animal manure in each town was applied to the arable lands within this town n and p emissions from animal housing manure storage and treatment stages were evenly allocated to the rural settlement areas in each town zhao et al 2017 all the parameters could be found in table s1 s4 in the si 2 2 sources of n and p emissions from crop and animal system the sources of n and p emissions and contributions of the different crop and animal categories were studied from the perspective of soil crop animal manure generally the inputs of n and p in crop and animal systems include chemical fertilizers organic fertilizers fodder atmospheric deposition irrigation water and seeds in addition n includes nitrogen fixation for the contributions of different crops and animal categories we divided them into rice vegetables oils fruits tropical crops including pepper betel nut coconut rubber coffee etc other crops mainly sugarcane potatoes tea etc as well as swine cattle sheep and poultry some other crops and animals such as wheat corn mules horses and other animals were not considered because they were negligible all crop and livestock amounts came from statistical data 2 3 data collection data sources include statistics survey data literature parameters and spatial data the statistical data was derived from the statistical yearbook of counties and towns including the crop planting area sowing amount livestock number chemical fertilizer application and population from 1990 to 2018 besides we estimated 4 period the organic fertilizer application the straw return rate return rate of manure to field and fertilizer management methods of investigation data via comprehensive farm interview covering 58 individual farms in 10 typical towns in bmb these investigation content including crop fertilization crop product straw destination planting and management methods information of livestock houses manure storage and treatment with farmers n p content of crops and animals was obtained from literature bai et al 2016 ma et al 2010 the spatial data was derived from institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn we used temperature precipitation and land use data that have changed significantly in 4 periods and elevation slope soil texture with fewer changes in 2018 the precipitation distribution was based on the monthly data of 88 stations in hainan province and the inverse distance weighting method was used to interpolate the values in arcgis 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal changes of agricultural n and p emissions 3 1 1 spatiotemporal changes of n and p emissions in crop system in 28 years the n emission to water in crop system increased from 535 4 t n yr 1 to 3934 6 t n yr 1 n leaching was the largest source and its proportion has risen from 9 7 to 18 1 from 1990 to 2018 the n loss to water via leaching increased from 514 1 t n yr 1 to 3783 9 t n yr 1 the total n emission to water via erosion and runoff is minimal accounting for less than 1 from 1990 to 2018 fig 4 for p the p emission to water in crop system increased from 19 6 t p yr 1 to 103 8 t p yr 1 p erosion to water increased from 13 1 t p yr 1 to 65 7 t p yr 1 erosion is the largest source of soil p loss accounting for 1 of p input the spatiotemporal distribution of n and p emissions to water via leaching shows that the changes in n loss via leaching in farmland and economic forests are similar fig 5 while p loss via leaching are more concentrated in economic forests in the west and north tropical crops such as betel nut rubber and pepperwere planted in this area fig 6 besides the erosion and runoff distribution of n and p were relatively scattered and concentrated in some areas on the north side of the bay fig 7 and 8 3 1 2 spatiotemporal changes of n and p emissions in animal system direct discharge from livestock management chain was the most important way for n and p emissions to water in animal systems and it has shown a gradual increase in 28 years in 1990 the direct emissions of n and p were 532 5 t n yr 1 and 94 2 t p yr 1 respectively in 2018 the direct emissions of n and p reached 1893 6 t n yr 1 and 852 6 t p yr 1 respectively leaching in livestock management chain was another way to enter water bodies in 1990 n and p leaching were 147 6 t n yr 1and 36 1 t p yr 1 respectively in 2018 n and p leaching reached 286 8 t n yr 1and 89 8 t p yr 1 respectively from a spatial point of view the direct discharge in the livestock management chain of n and p were at a relatively low level in 1990 in 2018 the areas with high n discharge intensity were mainly distributed in the north area for p since 2010 there has been higher emission intensity in the north and the wenjiao river estuary fig 9 and 10 for n leaching in livestock management chain there was a higher emission intensity in the western region and wenjiao river estuary in 1990 and the intensity in the north increased in 2018 for p leaching in livestock management chain the discharge intensity did not change significantly from 1990 to 2010 and the intensity increased in the north until 2018 fig 11 and 12 3 1 3 spatiotemporal changes of n and p emissions in agriculture for n a total of 1215 t n was discharged into the water from crop and animal system in 1990 of which the crop system accounted for 44 1 and the animal system accounted for 55 9 in 2018 a total of 6114 t n was discharged into the water of which the crop system accounted for 64 4 and the animal system accounted for 35 6 for p a total of 150 t p was discharged into the water from crop and animal system in 1990 of which the crop system accounted for 13 2 and the animal system accounted for 86 8 in 2018 a total of 1046 t p was discharged into the water of which the crop system accounted for 9 9 and the animal system accounted for 90 1 there were large spatial heterogeneities in agricultural n and p emissions fig 13 and 14 n emission has been mainly distributed in the western and northern parts of the country since 2010 most of these areas are economic forest among which tropical crops such as betel nut rubber and pepper were planted in bmb because the distribution of animal breeding sites is relatively concentrated the emission intensity of animal manure has always been at a high level in 28 years in terms of spatial distribution the highest average emission intensity reached 0 9 t km2 yr 1 in 1990 and 6 8 t km2 yr 1 in 2018 for p the emission of p in the economic forest areas in the west and the arable land in the north and east during the 28 years showed the similar level but the concentration of the animal breeding sites mainly concentrated in the estuary was still relatively high the highest average emission intensity reached 0 14 t km2 yr 1 in 1990 and 0 72 t km2 yr 1 in 2018 3 2 sources of nitrogen and phosphorus from agriculture from the perspective of the input sources of agricultural n and p the composition of the input structure of n and p in 1990 and 2018 was similar fig 15 for n in 1990 chemical fertilizers accounted for 56 0 of total n input followed by 23 7 of fodder and organic fertilizer was the third in 2018 the proportion of chemical fertilizer and organic fertilizer input dropped to 52 7 and 13 1 respectively while the fodder in the animal system increased to 33 6 which is the opposite of the change in the n emission way regarding the contribution of each category in the crop and animal system to n poultry has the largest increase which increased from 19 1 in 1990 to 41 9 in 2018 followed by fruit which increased from 9 8 to 29 8 the contribution of cattle and rice to n output decreased the most from 5 7 to 2 2 and 15 4 to 5 6 respectively the largest increase in the contribution of each category to p output was vegetables which increased from 8 5 in 1990 to 34 2 in 2018 poultry also increased from 32 3 to 49 1 the largest decline was in cattle which fell from 24 5 in 1990 to 1 4 in 2018 followed by rice which fell from 18 7 to 4 8 fig 16 4 discussion since the establishment of a province in hainan in 1988 rapid environmental changes have led to rapid degradation of mangrove resources xu 2018 thus we quantified agricultural n and p emissions from 1990 to 2018 in bmb area with high resolution identified the spatiotemporal characteristics of agricultural n and p emissions from 1990 to 2018 and explored its main pollution sources from 1990 to 2018 n leaching in crop system and n direct discharge from the animal management chain were the largest ways of agricultural n pollution in 1990 n leaching in crop system and direct discharge from animal management chain accounted for 43 6 and 42 9 of agricultural n emission respectively in 2018 the proportions of the two were 61 9 and 31 0 respectively the reason is that on the one hand the use of chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizers was increasing rapidly on the other hand the return of animal manure to the field was increasing gradually and the relative direct emission will be reduced this is a conclusion based on our field investigation for p between 1990 and 2018 the proportion of direct discharge from the animal management chain increased from 63 0 to 81 5 which is the largest way for agricultural p emission although the proportion of animal manure returned to the field has been increasing gradually however the p proportion of animal management direct discharge was still highly proportion the massive growth of the poultry industry still caused a large amount of direct emission pollution 4 1 sources of nitrogen and phosphorus although the animal breeding industry in bmb has grown rapidly since the 1990s the proportion of fodder n input has only increased by about 10 this was because the input of chemical fertilizers has increased gradually and has remained above 50 throughout the year for p chemical fertilizers and fodder were the largest sources to agricultural p emission and their proportions have reached more than 90 compared with 1990 the source of p emission from fodder increased in 2018 while chemical fertilizers declined in contrast to n the growth rate of p emission sources was positively correlated with its emission pathways this may be due to the large proportion of animal systems in the entire agriculture in 2018 the proportion of animal and crop discharged to water was approximately 9 1 and it may be higher in the future therefore it is necessary for agricultural development to reduce the use of n fertilizer and control the p direct discharge from the animal system in the future large spatial heterogeneities in n and p emissions were existed in bmb on the one hand the main loss ways of n and p in the crop system were different n emissions were mainly from leaching no 3 accounting for more than 95 of the arable land p emission were dominated by soil erosion which accounted for more than 65 of the loss in crop system on the other hand n fertilizer application rate was higher than p all year round and n content in fertilizer and manure was also higher than p for n contribution of each category in crop and animal systems rice contributed 25 7 of n output to agriculture in 1990 while in 2018 the largest output of n was replaced by poultry reaching 41 9 with 29 8 of fruit in the second place this change was related to the rapid development of wenchang chicken and tropical fruits in bmb area in addition the hainan provincial government has gradually banned straw burning since 2000 which has promoted the control of n and p output in the crop system while the number of poultry farming chickens ducks geese has increased more than 10 times in 28 years the contribution rate to total agricultural n has increased rapidly this was because our field investigation found that although the rate of returning manure from swine and cattle to the field has increased significantly in 28 years the direct discharge of poultry manure has been maintained at a relatively high level the manure collection rate of swine and cattle is relatively high in several areas of bmb we visited farmers collected manure and used it as fertilizer on local farms or sold it for p among crops and animal cattle poultry and rice contributed the most to p in the 1990s since 2000 the rapid development of vegetables has made it second only to the contribution of poultry to agriculture the sum of poultry and vegetables accounted for more than 80 of the entire agriculture therefore in the future agricultural development the management of vegetable p fertilizer and the improvement of the efficiency of animal manure treatment should be paid attention to 4 2 water resources risk from agricultural n p emission n leaching is the most important way to water body which accounts more than 96 of crop system n loss to water and it have serious affection groundwater especially in the bay area where seawater intrusion occurs lu et al 2019 tang et al 2020 our estimation results showed that the n leaching of bmb agriculture in 2018 was 5 12 t km2 yr 1 which is higher than that 3 76 t km2 yr 1 estimated by yu et al 2019 in china yu et al 2019 similar to the result 4 63 t km2 yr 1 in the humid areas of hainan province zhou 2011 and is 3 2 times that 1 60 t km2 yr 1 of the eu 27 velthof et al 2009 this might be explained by the effect of different soil textures the soil texture in bmb area is mainly composed of sand which accounts for 85 of the entire area and the n leaching rate is the fastest in the sandy soil koops et al 1996 salm dolfing et al 2007 besides the removal rate of poultry manure is still low at present which puts a lot of pressure on the groundwater in this area for p p emission is mainly soil erosion in the crop system while bmb area is in a tropical monsoon climate with abundant rainfall which promotes the erosion rate of its arable land yan and gao 2021 our estimation results showed that the p loss rate of bmb agriculture in 2018 was 0 26 t km2 yr 1 which is lower than that 0 36 t km2 yr 1 estimated by zhou in hainan province zhou 2011 while slightly higher than the averages 0 21 t km2 yr 1 reported in china by han han et al 2021 the contribution of the animal system to p reached 90 in 2018 while the utilization efficiency of p in animal system was only 1 8 which is lower than the world average biswas chowdhury and zhang 2021 it is essential to manage p discharge from livestock breeding sites near the bay all these emissions are conducive to the formation of eutrophication in bmb 4 3 significance of future agricultural nutrients management our estimation may be lower than the actual situation almost all bmb areas are made up of rural population therefore some policies issued by the government have not been fully implemented in rural areas wang et al 2018b in our field investigation part of the manure treatment methods composting returning to the field direct discharge biogas fermentation etc were done via direct observation or consultation with farmers which caused some errors however we have obtained the spatiotemporal emission characteristics and source information of n and p under different factors since the 1990s which has a clear understanding of the sources of agricultural n and p pollution in the gulf region in addition land use has been found to affect the sources of n and p contributions mockler et al 2017 thus the model considered the effect of land use factors on n and p emissions reducing the uncertainty of the results since 1990 in bmb the area of economic forest has increased and large areas of tropical fruits and cash crops have been planted besides the planting industry had gradually changed from rice to tropical fruits and cash crops for animal husbandry wenchang had been focusing on developing local characteristics of wenchang chicken in recent years since 2000 policies such as the prohibition of straw burning and the direct discharge of waste water have been implemented therefore the pollution characteristics of n and p have changed considerably even in a short period of time which was closely related to the development policy and direction of local agriculture bmb has a high demand for poultry but it will cause a large amount of p water discharge if it is reduced accordingly poultry production replaced by pork and eggs it will greatly reduce the p load yuan et al 2019 therefore the transformation of agriculture in the future is necessary which is essential to the ecological health of the agricultural pollution gulf areas 5 conclusion we constructed a nufer model of a typical bay area on a tropical island and 4 periods of land use data from 1990 to 2018 were used to explore the characteristics and sources of the temporal and spatial emissions of n and p to water bodies further the estimated agricultural n and p emissions to the bmb water in 2018 were 6114 t and 1046 t respectively n emission was mainly via leaching and was distributed in farms in the west and north while p emission distributed in livestock breeding sites near the bay base on face to face interviews we explored the sources of n and p emissions and the results showed that fertilizers and fodder are the largest sources of n and p in agriculture and poultry is the first source of n and p output fruits and vegetables are the second output categories of n and p respectively the results of our study suggest that the application of n fertilizer should be reduced in the future and the removal rate of p fertilizer in the livestock should be increased to achieve the balance of n and p our results of agricultural n and p emissions to the water of bmb synthesized sources identification and explored mitigation option which provided reference for other typical agricultural pollution bays in exploring

1338,the spatiotemporal characteristics and sources identification of agricultural nitrogen n and phosphorus p emissions to the gulf are rarely reported in tropical regions of china mainly due to the lack of local reliable data and quantitative tools for spatiotemporal changes in this study we constructed a high resolution nufer nutrient flow in food chains environment and resources use model based on geology meteorology land use data statistical data and field investigation to quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics and sources of n and p emissions bamen bay bmb a bay with a mangrove national wetland park in the hainan island china was chosen as a case study the results showed that agricultural n emission to water in 2018 increased fivefold compared to 1990 leaching was the main method of agricultural n emission and was mainly distributed in farms in the west and north the contribution of n emission from crop system to water increased 20 3 in 28 years poultry and fruits have contributed the most to n output and the trend is continuing p emission to water increased sevenfold compared 1990 the contribution of p emission from animal system to water increased from 86 8 in 1990 to 90 1 in 2018 due to low removal rate of livestock manure p emission was mainly via direct discharge of manure mainly distributed in livestock breeding sites near the bay poultry has consistently contributed the most to p output in 28 years accounting for 49 1 in 2018 fertilizers and fodder were the largest sources of n and p the average n and p loss rates of bmb were 5 32 t km2 yr 1 and 0 26 t km2 yr 1 the future agricultural transformation is essential and it is necessary to reduce the application of n fertilizer and increase the removal rate of livestock manure these results can provide reference for other typical agricultural pollution bays in exploring the spatiotemporal characteristics of n and p emissions to water and the identification of agricultural sources

bamen bay bmb has the most abundant mangrove species in china and is a typical agricultural pollution bay wang et al 2021 affected by human activities excessive n and p in agriculture have caused severe eutrophication pollution in the lagoon herbeck et al 2013 since the 1960s mangrove resources have been rapidly degraded due to environmental factors from 3611 ha in 1956 to 750 ha at present huang et al 2013 however the research on eutrophication was mainly conducted in temperate regions such as the us and europe etc and such studies have rarely been conducted in tropical regions in china zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 quantitatively revealing the spatiotemporal flow characteristics and sources of agricultural n and p nutrients is the key to alleviate water pollution some prevalent hydrological models have been used to study this problem such as swat the soil and water assessment tool and annagnps annualized agricultural non point source pollution model cheng et al 2021 li et al 2015 however these models required complicated data and the sources of spatial pollution were difficult to identify which limits their application zhao et al 2019 the output coefficient method provides a way to determine the control elements without monitoring the water quality of the basin dupas et al 2015 the watershed nutrient output model is a watershed scale model that can simulate nutrient input and output with less data mayorga et al 2010 it could be used to estimate global n and p output from river or ocean but the spatial resolution of the result was low and the parameters were relatively lacking recently the development of a nutrient flow model in the food chain can quantify the loss of n and p from the food chain to water body with less data bai et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 this is extremely beneficial to the effective study of non point source pollution especially for bmb a tropical area of china where data is relatively deficient however traditional methods ignored the impact of land use changes and generally used administrative units for research ignoring the flow of pollutants from land to gulf in the natural basin unit the land sea water environment management considering the basin unit is an important means of gulf governance at present wang et al 2019 besides the spatiotemporal management of agricultural nutrients emissions based on high resolution land use data has not been studied yet these limited the nutrition management in agricultural pollution bay where data was lacking hence the objectives of this study were 1 to quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics of n and p emissions to water in the crop and animal system from 1990 to 2018 in bmb area with high resolution based nufer model 2 to identify the main sources of agricultural n and p emissions of bmb from 1990 to 2018 and the changes in the contribution of different crop and animal categories and propose mitigation option for agricultural pollution type bays based on the concept of land sea coordination 2 materials and methods bamen bay bmb is located in the northeast of hainan island china fig 1 the mangroves in hainan island accounted for 40 of the 81 mangrove resources in the world and it was the largest mangroves in hainan island wang et al 2021 affected by the tropical monsoon climate bmb s dry season is from november to april the rainy season is from may to october the annual average temperature is 22 26 c and the annual precipitation is 1500 2000 mm herbeck et al 2013 bmb is composed of wenjiao river and wenchang river basin with an area of 768 3km2 and 516 6km2 respectively the lengths of the two rivers are 56 0 km and 37 1 km respectively li et al 2013 liu et al 2011 the wenjiao river and wenchang river flow into the lagoon and are connected to the ocean through a long and narrow natural channel both basins located in wenchang city which is composed of 12 towns in 2018 the arable land and economic forest in the study area accounted for 34 9 and 30 0 of the land use which was a typical agricultural area fig 2 according to the monitoring data in 2018 the tn and tp point source pollution of industrial and domestic sewage accounted for about 3 5 and 2 0 in wenjiao river respectively and the tn and tp point source pollution accounted for 7 1 and 4 6 in wenchang river respectively ecological environmental protection bureau wenchang hainan provincial water affairs department 2018 which indicated that the n and p pollution in both basins was mainly non point source pollution most of the n and p emissions came from agriculture su et al 2011 the basins mainly were represented for tropical agriculture including rice tropical fruits cash crops etc the main source of water resources in the bay is the input of fresh water from the two rivers since the 1960s a large number of mangroves have disappeared replaced by intensive and semi intensive marine fish and shrimp breeding ponds herbeck et al 2011 coupled with agricultural non point source pollution the water quality in bmb has become one of the worst in hainan province 2 1 estimation of non point source pollution of agricultural n and p generally agricultural non point source pollution refers to the emissions of nutrients from cultivated land to water this includes two parts of land source agricultural pollution 1 emissions of agricultural n and p to water body via runoff leaching and erosion from crop system 2 n and p leaching and direct discharge of manure from animal system to quantify the agricultural n and p emissions to water we constructed a high resolution nufer model based on ma et al 2010 bai et al 2016 and zhao et al 2019 nufer model was originally used to evaluate nutrient flow in the food chain and losses in each step of the food chain ma et al 2010 it uses a mass balance approach and starts with an estimation of nutrients input for the different crop and animal categories the input items of the nufer model include chemical fertilizers organic fertilizers atmospheric deposition biological fixation n seeds irrigation water in the crop system and fodder in the animal system the output items mainly include agricultural products and environmental losses the model takes soil crop animal as the boundary condition the values and parameters used are presented in detail in the supplemental information si the main improvements of high resolution based nufer model in this study were following 1 considering natural factors topography meteorology soil conditions and anthropogenic factors fertilization methods straw and manure treat ways manure storage status based on field investigation 2 the results could guide agricultural specific management via source identification based on land sea coordination 2 1 1

temperature and soil organic matter content were used to calculate the distribution of n p leaching erosion and runoff reduction coefficients via arcgis respectively fig 3 finally we evenly distributed n ptopsoil n papplication n psurplus to the arable land and economic forest of each town with a resolution of 30 m 30 m table s1 for specific values 2 1 2 n p emission from animal system for the animal system n and p were discharged to the water via direct discharge and leaching from animal management chain including housing storage and treatment stages bai et al 2016 we first calculated by multiplying n p excretion rate table s2 with the livestock number in different livestock systems to obtain the total emission then calculated by multiplying the respective proportion of direct discharge or leaching with total emission in the management chain of animal obtained from the investigation finally n and p emissions in animal system were evenly allocated to the rural settlement areas in each town assuming that all the available animal manure in each town was applied to the arable lands within this town n and p emissions from animal housing manure storage and treatment stages were evenly allocated to the rural settlement areas in each town zhao et al 2017 all the parameters could be found in table s1 s4 in the si 2 2 sources of n and p emissions from crop and animal system the sources of n and p emissions and contributions of the different crop and animal categories were studied from the perspective of soil crop animal manure generally the inputs of n and p in crop and animal systems include chemical fertilizers organic fertilizers fodder atmospheric deposition irrigation water and seeds in addition n includes nitrogen fixation for the contributions of different crops and animal categories we divided them into rice vegetables oils fruits tropical crops including pepper betel nut coconut rubber coffee etc other crops mainly sugarcane potatoes tea etc as well as swine cattle sheep and poultry some other crops and animals such as wheat corn mules horses and other animals were not considered because they were negligible all crop and livestock amounts came from statistical data 2 3 data collection data sources include statistics survey data literature parameters and spatial data the statistical data was derived from the statistical yearbook of counties and towns including the crop planting area sowing amount livestock number chemical fertilizer application and population from 1990 to 2018 besides we estimated 4 period the organic fertilizer application the straw return rate return rate of manure to field and fertilizer management methods of investigation data via comprehensive farm interview covering 58 individual farms in 10 typical towns in bmb these investigation content including crop fertilization crop product straw destination planting and management methods information of livestock houses manure storage and treatment with farmers n p content of crops and animals was obtained from literature bai et al 2016 ma et al 2010 the spatial data was derived from institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn we used temperature precipitation and land use data that have changed significantly in 4 periods and elevation slope soil texture with fewer changes in 2018 the precipitation distribution was based on the monthly data of 88 stations in hainan province and the inverse distance weighting method was used to interpolate the values in arcgis 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal changes of agricultural n and p emissions 3 1 1 spatiotemporal changes of n and p emissions in crop system in 28 years the n emission to water in crop system increased from 535 4 t n yr 1 to 3934 6 t n yr 1 n leaching was the largest source and its proportion has risen from 9 7 to 18 1 from 1990 to 2018 the n loss to water via leaching increased from 514 1 t n yr 1 to 3783 9 t n yr 1 the total n emission to water via erosion and runoff is minimal accounting for less than 1 from 1990 to 2018 fig 4 for p the p emission to water in crop system increased from 19 6 t p yr 1 to 103 8 t p yr 1 p erosion to water increased from 13 1 t p yr 1 to 65 7 t p yr 1 erosion is the largest source of soil p loss accounting for 1 of p input the spatiotemporal distribution of n and p emissions to water via leaching shows that the changes in n loss via leaching in farmland and economic forests are similar fig 5 while p loss via leaching are more concentrated in economic forests in the west and north tropical crops such as betel nut rubber and pepperwere planted in this area fig 6 besides the erosion and runoff distribution of n and p were relatively scattered and concentrated in some areas on the north side of the bay fig 7 and 8 3 1 2 spatiotemporal changes of n and p emissions in animal system direct discharge from livestock management chain was the most important way for n and p emissions to water in animal systems and it has shown a gradual increase in 28 years in 1990 the direct emissions of n and p were 532 5 t n yr 1 and 94 2 t p yr 1 respectively in 2018 the direct emissions of n and p reached 1893 6 t n yr 1 and 852 6 t p yr 1 respectively leaching in livestock management chain was another way to enter water bodies in 1990 n and p leaching were 147 6 t n yr 1and 36 1 t p yr 1 respectively in 2018 n and p leaching reached 286 8 t n yr 1and 89 8 t p yr 1 respectively from a spatial point of view the direct discharge in the livestock management chain of n and p were at a relatively low level in 1990 in 2018 the areas with high n discharge intensity were mainly distributed in the north area for p since 2010 there has been higher emission intensity in the north and the wenjiao river estuary fig 9 and 10 for n leaching in livestock management chain there was a higher emission intensity in the western region and wenjiao river estuary in 1990 and the intensity in the north increased in 2018 for p leaching in livestock management chain the discharge intensity did not change significantly from 1990 to 2010 and the intensity increased in the north until 2018 fig 11 and 12 3 1 3 spatiotemporal changes of n and p emissions in agriculture for n a total of 1215 t n was discharged into the water from crop and animal system in 1990 of which the crop system accounted for 44 1 and the animal system accounted for 55 9 in 2018 a total of 6114 t n was discharged into the water of which the crop system accounted for 64 4 and the animal system accounted for 35 6 for p a total of 150 t p was discharged into the water from crop and animal system in 1990 of which the crop system accounted for 13 2 and the animal system accounted for 86 8 in 2018 a total of 1046 t p was discharged into the water of which the crop system accounted for 9 9 and the animal system accounted for 90 1 there were large spatial heterogeneities in agricultural n and p emissions fig 13 and 14 n emission has been mainly distributed in the western and northern parts of the country since 2010 most of these areas are economic forest among which tropical crops such as betel nut rubber and pepper were planted in bmb because the distribution of animal breeding sites is relatively concentrated the emission intensity of animal manure has always been at a high level in 28 years in terms of spatial distribution the highest average emission intensity reached 0 9 t km2 yr 1 in 1990 and 6 8 t km2 yr 1 in 2018 for p the emission of p in the economic forest areas in the west and the arable land in the north and east during the 28 years showed the similar level but the concentration of the animal breeding sites mainly concentrated in the estuary was still relatively high the highest average emission intensity reached 0 14 t km2 yr 1 in 1990 and 0 72 t km2 yr 1 in 2018 3 2 sources of nitrogen and phosphorus from agriculture from the perspective of the input sources of agricultural n and p the composition of the input structure of n and p in 1990 and 2018 was similar fig 15 for n in 1990 chemical fertilizers accounted for 56 0 of total n input followed by 23 7 of fodder and organic fertilizer was the third in 2018 the proportion of chemical fertilizer and organic fertilizer input dropped to 52 7 and 13 1 respectively while the fodder in the animal system increased to 33 6 which is the opposite of the change in the n emission way regarding the contribution of each category in the crop and animal system to n poultry has the largest increase which increased from 19 1 in 1990 to 41 9 in 2018 followed by fruit which increased from 9 8 to 29 8 the contribution of cattle and rice to n output decreased the most from 5 7 to 2 2 and 15 4 to 5 6 respectively the largest increase in the contribution of each category to p output was vegetables which increased from 8 5 in 1990 to 34 2 in 2018 poultry also increased from 32 3 to 49 1 the largest decline was in cattle which fell from 24 5 in 1990 to 1 4 in 2018 followed by rice which fell from 18 7 to 4 8 fig 16 4 discussion since the establishment of a province in hainan in 1988 rapid environmental changes have led to rapid degradation of mangrove resources xu 2018 thus we quantified agricultural n and p emissions from 1990 to 2018 in bmb area with high resolution identified the spatiotemporal characteristics of agricultural n and p emissions from 1990 to 2018 and explored its main pollution sources from 1990 to 2018 n leaching in crop system and n direct discharge from the animal management chain were the largest ways of agricultural n pollution in 1990 n leaching in crop system and direct discharge from animal management chain accounted for 43 6 and 42 9 of agricultural n emission respectively in 2018 the proportions of the two were 61 9 and 31 0 respectively the reason is that on the one hand the use of chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizers was increasing rapidly on the other hand the return of animal manure to the field was increasing gradually and the relative direct emission will be reduced this is a conclusion based on our field investigation for p between 1990 and 2018 the proportion of direct discharge from the animal management chain increased from 63 0 to 81 5 which is the largest way for agricultural p emission although the proportion of animal manure returned to the field has been increasing gradually however the p proportion of animal management direct discharge was still highly proportion the massive growth of the poultry industry still caused a large amount of direct emission pollution 4 1 sources of nitrogen and phosphorus although the animal breeding industry in bmb has grown rapidly since the 1990s the proportion of fodder n input has only increased by about 10 this was because the input of chemical fertilizers has increased gradually and has remained above 50 throughout the year for p chemical fertilizers and fodder were the largest sources to agricultural p emission and their proportions have reached more than 90 compared with 1990 the source of p emission from fodder increased in 2018 while chemical fertilizers declined in contrast to n the growth rate of p emission sources was positively correlated with its emission pathways this may be due to the large proportion of animal systems in the entire agriculture in 2018 the proportion of animal and crop discharged to water was approximately 9 1 and it may be higher in the future therefore it is necessary for agricultural development to reduce the use of n fertilizer and control the p direct discharge from the animal system in the future large spatial heterogeneities in n and p emissions were existed in bmb on the one hand the main loss ways of n and p in the crop system were different n emissions were mainly from leaching no 3 accounting for more than 95 of the arable land p emission were dominated by soil erosion which accounted for more than 65 of the loss in crop system on the other hand n fertilizer application rate was higher than p all year round and n content in fertilizer and manure was also higher than p for n contribution of each category in crop and animal systems rice contributed 25 7 of n output to agriculture in 1990 while in 2018 the largest output of n was replaced by poultry reaching 41 9 with 29 8 of fruit in the second place this change was related to the rapid development of wenchang chicken and tropical fruits in bmb area in addition the hainan provincial government has gradually banned straw burning since 2000 which has promoted the control of n and p output in the crop system while the number of poultry farming chickens ducks geese has increased more than 10 times in 28 years the contribution rate to total agricultural n has increased rapidly this was because our field investigation found that although the rate of returning manure from swine and cattle to the field has increased significantly in 28 years the direct discharge of poultry manure has been maintained at a relatively high level the manure collection rate of swine and cattle is relatively high in several areas of bmb we visited farmers collected manure and used it as fertilizer on local farms or sold it for p among crops and animal cattle poultry and rice contributed the most to p in the 1990s since 2000 the rapid development of vegetables has made it second only to the contribution of poultry to agriculture the sum of poultry and vegetables accounted for more than 80 of the entire agriculture therefore in the future agricultural development the management of vegetable p fertilizer and the improvement of the efficiency of animal manure treatment should be paid attention to 4 2 water resources risk from agricultural n p emission n leaching is the most important way to water body which accounts more than 96 of crop system n loss to water and it have serious affection groundwater especially in the bay area where seawater intrusion occurs lu et al 2019 tang et al 2020 our estimation results showed that the n leaching of bmb agriculture in 2018 was 5 12 t km2 yr 1 which is higher than that 3 76 t km2 yr 1 estimated by yu et al 2019 in china yu et al 2019 similar to the result 4 63 t km2 yr 1 in the humid areas of hainan province zhou 2011 and is 3 2 times that 1 60 t km2 yr 1 of the eu 27 velthof et al 2009 this might be explained by the effect of different soil textures the soil texture in bmb area is mainly composed of sand which accounts for 85 of the entire area and the n leaching rate is the fastest in the sandy soil koops et al 1996 salm dolfing et al 2007 besides the removal rate of poultry manure is still low at present which puts a lot of pressure on the groundwater in this area for p p emission is mainly soil erosion in the crop system while bmb area is in a tropical monsoon climate with abundant rainfall which promotes the erosion rate of its arable land yan and gao 2021 our estimation results showed that the p loss rate of bmb agriculture in 2018 was 0 26 t km2 yr 1 which is lower than that 0 36 t km2 yr 1 estimated by zhou in hainan province zhou 2011 while slightly higher than the averages 0 21 t km2 yr 1 reported in china by han han et al 2021 the contribution of the animal system to p reached 90 in 2018 while the utilization efficiency of p in animal system was only 1 8 which is lower than the world average biswas chowdhury and zhang 2021 it is essential to manage p discharge from livestock breeding sites near the bay all these emissions are conducive to the formation of eutrophication in bmb 4 3 significance of future agricultural nutrients management our estimation may be lower than the actual situation almost all bmb areas are made up of rural population therefore some policies issued by the government have not been fully implemented in rural areas wang et al 2018b in our field investigation part of the manure treatment methods composting returning to the field direct discharge biogas fermentation etc were done via direct observation or consultation with farmers which caused some errors however we have obtained the spatiotemporal emission characteristics and source information of n and p under different factors since the 1990s which has a clear understanding of the sources of agricultural n and p pollution in the gulf region in addition land use has been found to affect the sources of n and p contributions mockler et al 2017 thus the model considered the effect of land use factors on n and p emissions reducing the uncertainty of the results since 1990 in bmb the area of economic forest has increased and large areas of tropical fruits and cash crops have been planted besides the planting industry had gradually changed from rice to tropical fruits and cash crops for animal husbandry wenchang had been focusing on developing local characteristics of wenchang chicken in recent years since 2000 policies such as the prohibition of straw burning and the direct discharge of waste water have been implemented therefore the pollution characteristics of n and p have changed considerably even in a short period of time which was closely related to the development policy and direction of local agriculture bmb has a high demand for poultry but it will cause a large amount of p water discharge if it is reduced accordingly poultry production replaced by pork and eggs it will greatly reduce the p load yuan et al 2019 therefore the transformation of agriculture in the future is necessary which is essential to the ecological health of the agricultural pollution gulf areas 5 conclusion we constructed a nufer model of a typical bay area on a tropical island and 4 periods of land use data from 1990 to 2018 were used to explore the characteristics and sources of the temporal and spatial emissions of n and p to water bodies further the estimated agricultural n and p emissions to the bmb water in 2018 were 6114 t and 1046 t respectively n emission was mainly via leaching and was distributed in farms in the west and north while p emission distributed in livestock breeding sites near the bay base on face to face interviews we explored the sources of n and p emissions and the results showed that fertilizers and fodder are the largest sources of n and p in agriculture and poultry is the first source of n and p output fruits and vegetables are the second output categories of n and p respectively the results of our study suggest that the application of n fertilizer should be reduced in the future and the removal rate of p fertilizer in the livestock should be increased to achieve the balance of n and p our results of agricultural n and p emissions to the water of bmb synthesized sources identification and explored mitigation option which provided reference for other typical agricultural pollution bays in exploring the spatiotemporal characteristics of n and p emissions and the identification of agricultural sources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1339,a number of studies have been conducted to determine the relationships between runoff and sediment under different conditions however the water sediment synergistic relationship which refers to the degree of intervention between the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season must be further analyzed this study proposed the concept of the synergy degree between water and sediment based on the discipline of synergetics created by haken haken 1983 the flood and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season and the measured water sediment coordination levels were adopted in this study to obtain their synergy degree by taking as an example the largest and most continuous region from the huangfu river to the jialu river in the coarse sand source regions of the loess plateau the results of this investigation are as follows the degree of synergy between runoff and suspended sediment transport was below 0 722 from 1958 to 2016 approximately 70 of the flood events in the five river basins had poor degrees of synergy between the flow and sediment processes in the flood season moreover the synergy degrees of the water sediment relationship were relatively low in the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season due to the low order degrees of these two process subsystems the low synergistic relationship between these two subsystems shows that the coordination and buffering abilities between the flood and suspended sediment transport processes were weak these findings demonstrate the successful adoption of synergetics to ascertain the water sediment synergistic relationship and also provided critical information for designing water conveyance systems with high sediment concentrations for irrigation in the coarse sand source regions of the loess plateau china keywords water sediment relation synergy degree peak flood discharge suspended sediment transport flood season 1 introduction in the past century major rivers have experienced dramatic changes at a global scale due to climate change and intensive human activities such as water abstractions water flow regulations dams weirs sluices and locks land use change damming and sand mining for instance thodsen et al 2010 found that climate change affects suspended sediment transport in rivers both directly through erosion processes and increased river discharges and indirectly through changes in land use and land cover and modeled increases of 17 in the mean annual suspended sediment transport of alluvial rivers and 27 in that of nonalluvial rivers under steady state scenarios bormann 2010 systematically analyzed the gauge data of large rivers in germany to identify variations in the runoff regime which were caused mainly by climate change since the middle of the 20th century and showed that the detailed characteristics of the runoff regimes were considerably affected by environmental change chien et al 2013 pointed out that climate variability affects runoff mainly by influencing precipitation and potential evapotranspiration ahn and merwade 2014 quantified the relative impacts of climate and human activities on runoff in four u s states by using historical streamflow records in conjunction with four methods linear regression hydrologic simulation annual balancing and budyko analysis zhai and tao 2017 showed that human activities such as an increase in water withdrawal and the operation of dams and the operation of dams and reservoirs may be responsible for the decreased runoff in six catchments nianzishan xiahui yangjiaping sanjiangkou xixian and changle after 2000 the relationships between runoff and suspended sediment are very complex lana renault et al 2007 thus many researchers have focused on studying the variability in the relationships between the runoff and suspended sediment concentration ssc at different time scales for example bronsdon and naden 2000 investigated the ssc discharge relationship per year and per month on the river tweed and found variation in the seasonal sediment stock due to the production mobilization or exhaustion of particles suspended sediment data collected over 10 years 1991 2001 in nahal eshtemoa israel were used to demonstrate a relationship between ssc and water discharge q with a high degree of scatter alexandrov et al 2007 in basin and river investigations establishing a relationship between q and the sediment load has always been one of the most important research objectives and has received considerable attention from several researchers asselman 1999 sadeghi et al 2008 tahmoures et al 2015 jansson 1997 pointed out that a sediment rating curve is a relationship established between suspended sediment concentration ssc in kg m3 and the corresponding water discharge q in m3 s this relationship is in most case defined as a power equation ssc aq b where a and b are constants this can be transformed into an additive relationship via a logarithmic transform given the expression lnssc blnq lna lnssc and lnq are the natural logarithm of suspended sediment concentration and discharge a and b are the regression coefficients linear relation model is better than non linear relation model in describing the relationship between suspended sediment concentrations and discharge since then a number of studies have been conducted on the ssc q relationship and generally expressed as a power function fenn et al 1985 asselman 1999 syvitski et al 2000 to discuss relationships between ssc and q hydrologists often use sediment rating curves which is the statistical relationship between ssc and discharge and the most commonly approach is to fit a power curve to the data lefrancois et al 2007 the investigation of variations in the ssc q relationship can be useful for inferring the dominant origins and processes contributing to the suspended sediment load in a river bronsdon and naden 2000 this has given rise to numerous studies on suspended sediment concentration discharge ssc q relationships the linkage between suspended sediment and discharge often cannot be described by simple linear or univariate relationships studies that have focused on the hysteretic behavior in the suspended sediment concentration ssc discharge q relationship observed at the flood scale duvert et al 2010 gao and josefson 2012 seeger et al 2004 lefrancois et al 2007 sherriff et al 2016 have highlighted the major role of in channel bed deposition and resuspension processes in the downstream suspended sediment flux variability other studies have focused on the ssc q relationship by using different methods including regression models francke et al 2008 tachi et al 2020 empirical models irvine and drake 2010 mukanov et al 2019 geno kalman filtering model altunkaynak 2010 multivariate frequency analyses bezak et al 2014 swat model himanshu et al 2017 alberto and carmelo 2020 and artificial intelligence techniques tachi et al 2016 joshi et al 2016 mohd et al 2019 to better enumerate the ssc q relationship a new concept called connectivity has been used by the scientific community as a means to describe and quantify the influences on the fluxes of water and sediment parsons et al 2015 marco et al 2019 demonstrated that connectivity has become a key issue in the study of active processes within hydrogeomorphic systems and has strong implications for understanding their behaviors keesstra et al 2020 pointed out that the concept of connectivity widens the focus of an investigation by forcing the researcher to consider more parts of a system than has been done in most hydrological and sediment dynamics studies since the beginning of the 21st century the concept of connectivity has become increasingly important and prevalent in the field of catchment hydrology bracken and croke 2007 as a tool to understand the relationship between water flow and sediment to date the connectivity between water flow and sediment has been evaluated in various regions worldwide long and pavelsky 2013 cerda et al 2017 for example lesschen et al 2009 simulated the runoff and sediment dynamics at the catchment scale with the lapsus model and included plot and hillslope scale features that influence hydrological connectivity croke et al 2013 assessed both hydrological and sediment connectivity by using high resolution aerial photographs and multitemporal light detection and ranging lidar digital elevation models dems coupled with hydrological modeling poeppl et al 2017 indicated that the variations in the transport times between water and the channel outlet can be explained by variations in hydrological and sediment connectivity after eight years of field observations at the slope scale rodrigo et al 2018 reported that the flows along the whole slope exhibited connectivity very rarely twice while connectivity was observed eight times along individual slope parts and 19 times at the interrow scale keesstra et al 2019 adapted the knowledge of connectivity to better understand and quantify the water and sediment transfer characteristics in catchment systems the yellow river is a globally famous silt carrying river its basic characteristics is less water with more sediment distinguishing it from other rivers zhang 2018 with the development of agricultural production in the yellow river basin considering the use of only clear water cannot meet the requirements of irrigation therefore there are many concerns about the relationship between water and sediment within the sediment laden basin in the middle reach of the yellow river i e the loess plateau lp the source of nearly 90 of the sediment load of the river this water sediment relationship provides a research basis for designing a water conveyance system with high sediment concentration for irrigation in yellow river for example zheng et al 2008 examined the ssc q relationship and the runoff sediment yield relationship for 12 small watersheds in hilly loess areas and zheng et al 2012 examined the flow sediment relationship at three spatial scales and three timescales in the same types of areas in addition to the sediment rating curve which describes the ssc q relationship for a specific drainage system fan et al 2012 the hysteresis analysis between ssc and q is an effective tool for revealing the dynamics of suspended sediment fang et al 2011 many studies have been performed to quantify the relationships between water and sediment in different catchments however more attention should be paid to the synergistic relationship between the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes during the flood season in catchments with high sediment yields which present additional challenges for example when taking field measurements and collecting suspended sediment data as a result these efforts are rarely achieved over long timescales in some catchments schmidt and morche 2006 moreover it is difficult to quantify the degree of synergy in the water sediment relationship this study proposes the concept of the synergy degree sd between water and sediment and constructs a model of the water sediment synergistic relationship based on the discipline of synergetics created by haken haken 1983 the synergistic relationships between runoff and suspended sediment refer to the degree of intervention between the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes during the flood season specifically the synergy between water and sediment refers to the coherence between the flood process and suspended sediment transport process which is reflected by the coordination or buffering of the two subsystems this study adopts values between 0 and 1 for the calculated degree of synergy of the water sediment relationship the more collaborative the water sediment relationship the greater this value is the synergistic relationship between runoff and suspended sediment transport can provide valuable information that can be used to understand the behaviors of runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in flood seasons and can further offer critical information for designing a water conveyance system with high sediment concentrations for irrigation in the coarse sand source regions of the lp china therefore in this paper runoff and suspended sediment transport during the flood season are used as the research targets and the objective of this study is to analyze the water sediment relationship in the flood season to quantify the water sediment synergy in the coarse sand source regions of the lp 2 study area and data description 2 1 study area the lp in north china is famous for its deep loess the region of the lp characterized by a high coarse sediment yield is the primary source of sediment from the lp approximately 53 98 of the lp sediment yield with a particle size 0 1 mm is produced therein the middle reach of the yellow river features eight first order tributaries namely the huangfu gushan kuye tuwei jialu wuding qingjian and yanhe rivers which cover a total area of approximately 1 88 104 km2 fig 1 the largest and most continuous region stretches from the huangfu river to the jialu river between 37 58 39 26 n and 109 32 111 16 e this study area has a continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 6 14 c rainfall in the study area is highly variable both spatially and temporally its average annual precipitation varies from 310 to 580 mm and nearly 60 70 of all precipitation is dominated by rainstorms that occur during the rainy season most flood events occur between april and september the triangles in fig 1 represent the hydrological gauging stations in different basins for example the main gauging station named gaojiachuan station as shown in fig 1 controls a drainage area of nearly 3253 km2 which accounts for nearly 98 76 of the tuwei river basin the average runoff and sediment load values at the gaojiachuan station were 3 41 108 m3 and 0 4 108 t respectively between 1956 and 2005 sun et al 2010 2 2 data sources to collect data with which to investigate the runoff and sediment yield in five river basins the huangfu gaoshiya wenjiachuan gaojiachuan and shenjiawan hydrological stations were established by the yellow river water conservancy commission yrcc of the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china in 1953 1953 1953 1955 and 1956 respectively historical data are fundamental to understanding the present and anticipating the future therefore this study used historical data in the flood season for five river basins some measurement variables including the peak flood discharge pfd and peak value of the suspended sediment concentration in the flood season pvssc followed the national standards issued by the ministry of water conservancy and were obtained from the hydrological yearbook of the yellow river hybyr according to the available data from the hybyr and yrcc the data used in this study were collected from 1958 2016 this long term period presented a complete hydrological record and a continuous flood record with only a few gaps table 1 revealing a large amount of suspended sediment during the flood season the tuwei river basin was taken as an example for which data in 2011 were not available the time series from 1990 to 2005 were provided by the yrcc while the remaining data were obtained from the hybyr therefore the flood events in the tuwei river basin were obtained for the periods of 1958 2010 and 2012 2016 3 methodologies 3 1 determination of selected flood events it is possible to use the maximum annual flood maf events in each year the annual flood series the maf series of peak floods have been commonly used in the literature to analyze flood events to estimate design floods e g to calculate the flood frequency and conduct flood risk analyses the main limitation of the maf method is that annual flood events with very short durations may be included furthermore some years may contribute several floods and other years may contribute none the degrees of water sediment synergy in the flood season were studied by performing a synergistic analysis on the flood event series to overcome the problems described above the flood event selection procedure was revised this study proposed the duration over threshold dot method to consider all flood events above some selected threshold the advantage of dot series is that insignificant floods are excluded the use of the dot method requires setting some rules to determine whether flood events with small flood peaks or low flood volumes should be considered the first and most critical step in the construction of dot series is to select the most appropriate threshold here the average flood duration was used as the condition for choosing the appropriate threshold the second step is usually to select flood events in which the pfd is more than the average annual runoff 3 2 calculations of v i and s i the flood duration is defined as the time span from the beginning to the end of a flood event and is related to the specific circumstances in the area and the variations in rainfall intensity here the average flood duration was calculated using the following formula 1 t j 1 m t j m where t is the average flood duration j 1 m m is the number of flood events and t j is the flood duration of the jth flood event for the hypothetical flow process depicted in fig 2 v i j the ith hour flood volume for the jth flood event was determined by 2 v i j 3600 q i j q i 1 j 2 where i 1 t t is the average flood duration q i j is the observed discharge of the ith hour for the jth flood event and q i 1 j is the observed discharge of the i 1 th hour for the jth flood event the sand transport rate in the ith hour str i j kg s for the jth flood event was calculated by multiplying the ssc ssc i j kg m3 in the ith hour for the jth flood event by the observed discharge of the ith hour for the jth flood event q i j m3 s 3 str i j ssc i j q i j where ssc i j is the observed suspend sediment concentration of the ith hour for the jth flood event the sediment load in the ith hour s i j kg for the jth flood event was similarly calculated by multiplying the time duration t i sec by the average sand transport rate in the ith hour str i j kg s for the jth flood event 4 s i j t i str i j where i 1 t j 1 m m 1 str i str i j str i 1 j 2 and t i 3600 s 3 3 calculation of the degree of synergy 3 3 1 establishing the order parameters the selection of input variables is one of the most important steps in the development of the method for calculating the sd the order parameters can characterize the degree of order of the system the flood process and suspended sediment transport process compose an open system suppose a complex open system consists of k subsystems st ss 1 ss 2 ss k ss k k 1 k and k 2 in this paper k is 2 and represents the flood process and suspended sediment transport process the order parameter of ss k over a certain time period t is defined as 5 p ss 1 v i 1 v i 2 v i j v i m k 1 p ss 2 s i 1 s i 2 s i j s i m k 2 where i 1 t j 1 m v i j is the tth hour flood volume for the jth flood event s i j is the tth hour sediment load for the jth flood event for convenience in the subsequent analysis we assume that p i j k t is the tth hour flood volume sediment load for the jth flood event namely p i j 1 t v i j and p i j 2 t s i j the eq 5 of the ss k order parameters is written as 6 p ss k p i 1 k t p i 2 k t p i j k t p i m k t assume l i t ss k and u i t ss k are the lower and upper limits over a certain time period respectively of the order parameter component p i j t which belongs to subsystem k l i t ss k p i j k t u i t ss k and u i t ss k max i p i 1 k t p i 2 k t p i j k t p i m k t l i t ss k min i p i 1 k t p i 2 k t p i j k t p i m k t 3 3 2 order degree of the order parameter the order parameter of ss k fluctuates around a constant value suppose p i 1 k t p i 2 k t p i g k t are slow relaxation parameters the higher these values are the higher the order degree of the subsystem while the smaller these values are the lower the order degree of the subsystem then the order degree of each order parameter denoted u k p i j k t can be defined as 7 u k p i j k t p i j k t l i t ss k u i t ss k l i t ss k p i j k t p i j k t u k p i j k t u i t ss k p i j k t u i t ss k l i t ss k p i j k t p i j k t where p i j k t is the order parameter of the subsystem over a certain time period p i j k t p i 1 k t p i 2 k t p i j k t p i m k t m it is clear from the calculation above that u k p i j k t varies between 0 and 1 and a larger u k p i j k t value is better according to the theory of synergetics when u k p i j k t approaches 0 the order parameter p i j k t contributes little to the subsystem in contrast when u k p i j k t approaches 1 the order parameter p i j k t greatly contributes to the subsystem and plays a leading role in the collaborative process 3 3 3 subsystem total order degree this paper utilized the linear weighted summation method to define the order degree of each subsystem and obtain the expressions of the order degrees of the flood process and suspended sediment transport process subsystems over a certain period time as shown below 8 z j s k i 1 t Œæ i u k p i j k t in eq 7 z j s k is defined as the order degree of subsystem k for the jth flood event z j s k 0 1 the larger z j s k is the larger the contribution of the subsystem order parameter to this system order and vice versa Œæ i represents the relative weights of the order parameters for the subsystem this study used the entropy method to reduce the subjectivity of the weights of the order parameters the concrete steps of the entropy method are described in delgado and romero 2016 3 3 4 degree of synergy degree of synergy means the degree of coordination and collaboration between the subsystems within a system the synergy degree of ssc q refers to the coherence between the flood process and suspended sediment transport process which is reflected by the coordination or buffering of the flood process subsystem and the suspended sediment transport process subsystem as a valuable index used to reflect the relationship between the flood process and suspended sediment transport process the degree of synergy plays an important role in identifying the degree of intervention between runoff and suspended sediment transport processes therefore a model of the coordination degree between the flood process and suspended sediment transport process was established to analyze the interactive coordination degree the algorithm can be expressed as follows 9 sd j t k 1 k Œª j œÑ j 1 2 10 Œª j 2 k 1 k z j s k k 1 k z j s k 1 2 11 œÑ j k 1 k Œ± z j s k Œ± 1 k where sd j t is the degree of coupling coordination between two subsystems namely the flood process and suspended sediment transport process in this study Œª j stands for the degree of coupling between the two subsystems œÑ j denotes the overall impact of the performance levels of the two systems on the coupling coordination degree and Œ± describes the contributions of the flood process and suspended sediment transport process to the coordination level in this study Œ± is 1 k because each subsystem has the same level of importance 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of the analyzed flood events in this paper the dot series replaced the flood series for each year by its largest flood maf dot data are composed of all flood events over a chosen threshold for the entire stream gauge record some years may contribute several floods while other years may contribute no floods during the observation period there were 221 223 239 213 and 205 flood events in the huangfu gushan kuye tuwei and jialu river basins respectively the total numbers of significant flood events were identified using complete flood season data with average durations over 107 33 90 44 112 68 101 67 and 104 73 h in the huangfu gushan kuye tuwei and jialu river basins respectively in the present study the statistical characteristics were analyzed based on a dataset of the total number of flood events and the number of dot series as illustrated in table 2 for example in the huangfu river basin the flood duration ranged from 12 1 h in august 1963 to 512 h in july 2012 the pfd varied from 8 02 m3 s in june 1977 to 11 600 m3 s in july 1989 during 1958 2016 with a mean value of 888 62 m3 s and the pvssc values ranged from 18 3 kg m3 in july 2016 to 1570 kg m3 in july 1974 in 1958 2016 with an average value of 783 77 kg m3 therefore all of the recorded events in which the pfd was greater than the average annual runoff and the flood duration was longer than the average flood duration were adopted to analyze the degree of synergy with an increased sample size taking the huangfu river basin as an example among the 89 selected flood events the minimum peak discharge was greater than the average annual flow 4 16 m3 s the minimum and maximum values of peak discharge were 14 9 m3 s 1982 and 11 600 m3 s 1989 respectively the minimum pvssc of 175 kg m3 was measured in 2008 and the maximum pvssc of 1540 kg m3 was measured in 1974 the flood duration for the drainage area of the huangfu river gauging station ranged from 108 h 1969 to 512 h 2012 with a mean value of 173 41 h the flood events satisfying these conditions are listed in table 3 4 2 characterization of the synergy degrees and order degrees the sds of the five river basins at the corresponding hydrological stations from 1958 to 2016 were analyzed to demonstrate the proposed methodology the period of observation for the five stations was longer than 50 years the sd variations in the flow and sediment loading in the flood season at the five hydrological stations between 1958 and 2016 are shown in fig 3 the sd of the water sediment relationship fluctuated greatly with some peaks among the five hydrological stations during the study period from 1958 to 2016 the sds in the huangfu and gushan river basins showed a peak at approximately 0 7 in 1988 while the sd of the water sediment relationship fluctuated with two peaks 1959 and 1988 in the kuye river basin however in the tuwei and jialu river basins the peak values occurred in 2016 and 2012 respectively taking the huangfu river basin as an example the sd of the water sediment relationship continuously exhibited considerable variation an analysis of the sd shows that the minimum sd was 0 102 in june 1995 the 69th flood event while the highest value reached 0 7224 in august 1988 the 60th flood event the average sd value was 0 3129 during the study period according to the magnitude of the coordination degree the sd was divided into five categories the basic statistical attributes of the sd such as the number of flood events under different sd ranges were analyzed over the 59 year period for the five river basins table 4 an sd value of 0 2 is considered very low values between 0 4 and 0 6 are considered moderate and values within the range 0 6 sd 0 8 are considered high in the study area table 4 reveals that the sds of the five river basins are low in the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season for example in the huangfu river basin 70 79 of flood events had a poor sd while the sds of many of the remaining flood events 25 84 ranged from 0 4 to 0 6 approximately 3 37 of the flood events of the huangfu river had a high sd while no flood events were in the very high range in the study region the sd of the water sediment relationship fluctuated greatly but was still low to some extent according to the theory of synergetics the main reason for the weak synergistic relationship between water and sediment may be the sd which was determined by the order degrees of the subsystems table 5 shows some statistical characteristics of the order degrees of the two subsystems i e the flood process and the suspended sediment transport process whose order degrees were low the order degrees of the flood process subsystem and the suspended sediment transport process subsystem at the huangfu hydrological station changed from 0 011 to 0 63 and from 0 01 to 0 432 respectively for the gushan river basin the order degrees of the flood process subsystem strongly fluctuated between 0 012 and 0 487 with an average of 0 147 z s 1 while those of the suspended sediment transport subsystem varied from 0 010 to 0 411 with an average of 0 109 z s 2 the maximum values of z s 1 and z s 2 which appeared at the wenjiachuan hydrological station for the kuye river basin were 0 527 and 0 376 respectively the order degrees of the flood process subsystems were below 0 590 and 0 615 from 1958 to 2016 in the tuwei and jialu river basins respectively according to table 5 most of the means of the order degrees of the two subsystems no more than 0 15 corresponded to the basins with a low sd of the water sediment relationship 4 3 relationships between the synergy degree and peak flood discharge peak suspended sediment concentration the results of further analysis of the relationship between the sd and pfd pvssc are shown in a contour plot fig 4 which demonstrates that the upper and lower limits of the pfd and pvssc vary linearly in the study area as shown in fig 4 the sd graph presents the scenes of two conditions with the pfd and pvssc occurring at the same time in the contour map each contour line corresponds to a value of the sd indicating that the responses of the flood and sediment transport processes in the five basins to the sd are complex 1 with increases in pfd and pvssc the water sediment sd did not increase analysis of the results showed a significant difference in the water sediment synergistic relationship between huangfu and the other four catchments the highest sd of huangfu appeared at the larger pvssc and the highest sd corresponded to the smaller pvssc for the other four catchments the larger the pvssc with a lower pfd 2000 m3 s 5000 m3 s 1000 m3 s the smaller the water sediment sd was for the gushan tuwei and jialu river basins respectively in contrast the smaller the pvssc with a larger pfd 200 1800 m3 s 6000 9000 m3 s 800 2100 m3 s 2000 5750 m3 s the higher the water sediment sd was for the gushan kuye tuwei and jialu river basins respectively 2 the sd results varied under different water sediment conditions the sd values increased gradually with increasing pvssc and the pfd values ranged from 8000 m3 s to 10 000 m3 s in gushan in comparison the sd values in tuwei showed different changes specifically the sd values decreased gradually with increasing pvssc and the pfd values ranged from 1000 m3 s to 2200 m3 s in contrast the sd values in huangfu first increased and then decreased with increasing pvssc and the pfd values ranged from 4000 m3 s to 5200 m3 s 3 the water sediment relationships displayed stronger synergy when the pfd and pvssc were within certain ranges in the sd variation domain of the pfd and pvssc there was one clear high value aggregation center of sd change characteristics in each river basin the aggregation center coordinates of the pfd and pvssc in the five river basins could be estimated respectively as 6900 m3 s and 1300 kg m3 fig 4a 950 m3 s and 180 kg m3 fig 4b 7500 m3 s and 100 kg m3 fig 4c 1250 m3 s and 60 kg m3 fig 4d and 3250 m3 s and 100 kg m3 fig 4e the influence scope of the intensity was relatively large and the highest sd values were almost completely concentrated in the high value centers for example in the high value center of the huangfu river basin in the pfd variation domain the strong concentration influence range was approximately 6500 7200 m3 s and in the pvssc variation domain the strong concentration influence range was approximately 950 1540 kg m3 4 4 relationships between the synergy degree and the order degrees of the two subsystems scatterplot matrices are commonly used and easily applicable graphical tools for exploring the relationships between two quantitative variables fig 5 presents a graphical scatterplot of the results sd s 1 s 2 1 the data given in fig 5 a2 and fig 5 c2 show a moderate correlation r2 0 666 0 681 with a positive slope 0 5188 0 5438 fig 5 d2 and fig 5 e2 illustrate a slightly positive correlation between z s 1 and s 2 r2 0 478 0 462 2 the analysis results in fig 5 also show a positive linear relationship between the water sediment sd and the order degree of the suspended sediment transport process z s 2 for the tuwei and jialu river basins and this relationship was better than that between the sd and z s 1 therefore in the tuwei and jialu river basins the suspended sediment transport subsystem had a great influence on the water sediment synergy 3 the linear regression relationships between the sd and s 1 s 2 were acquired good positive correlations were found between the sd and s 1 s 2 e g panel 1 1 and panel 2 1 in fig 5a for example panel 1 1 in fig 5a displays a strong correlation of r 0 934 with a coefficient of determination of r2 0 872 as shown in figure 5b1 a high correlation of r 0 957 reflects the strong relationship between the sd and the order degree of the suspended sediment transport process subsystem z s 2 with r2 0 915 indicating that the variation in z s2 accounted for 91 5 of the variation in the sd figure 5d1 clearly shows that the sd exhibited a strong positive association with z s2 r 0 938 and the coefficient of determination r2 0 879 revealed that the variation in z s2 accounted for 87 9 of the variation in the sd in figure 5e3 the coefficient of determination r2 0 714 suggests that the sd was responsible for 71 4 of the variation in the order degree of the flood process subsystem z s1 and the regression coefficient b 0 7957 indicated that a unit increase in z s1 resulted in a corresponding increase of 0 7957 in sd this study revealed positive and highly significant associations between the sd and the order degrees of the two subsystems z s1 and z s2 5 conclusions this paper adopted the largest and most continuous region from the huangfu river to the jialu river in the coarse sand source regions of the lp as an example and proposed the concept of the sd between the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes during the flood season based on the discipline of synergetics and thus the order parameters characterizing the degree of order of a system created by haken then this study constructed a sd model and measured the coordination levels between runoff and suspended sediment transport processes to obtain the water sediment sds in five river basins from this study the following conclusions were drawn 1 for the five river basins the sds of the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes were below 0 722 from 1958 to 2016 additionally 70 79 69 32 65 18 70 12 and 70 93 of flood events had poor flow sediment sds in the flood season for the huangfu gushan kuye tuwei and jialu river basins respectively approximately 25 84 29 55 31 25 25 29 and 29 07 of the sds in huangfu gushan kuye tuwei and jialu respectively were in the range of 0 4 to 0 6 four flood events in the kuye and tuwei river basins had high sds while no flood events were in the very high sd range overall the sds of the five river basins were relatively low in terms of the flow and sediment in the flood season 2 with increases in pfd and pvssc the water sediment sd did not increase the water sediment relationship displayed stronger synergy when the pfd and pvssc were within certain ranges among the five river basins in the sd variation domains of the pfd and pvssc there was one clear high value aggregation center of sd change characteristics in each catchment the aggregation center coordinates of the pfd and pvssc were estimated respectively as 6900 m3 s and 1300 kg m3 huangfu 950 m3 s and 180 kg m3 gushan 13 800 m3 s and 250 kg m3 kuye 1250 m3 s and 60 kg m3 tuwei and 3250 m3 s and 100 kg m3 jialu 3 according to the theory of synergetics the sds were determined by the order degrees of the subsystems the study quantified the linear relationship between sd and s 1 s 2 for each of the five catchments the regression analysis between sd and s1 for the five catchments indicated that the regression r2 values were in the range of 0 714 0 913 while those between sd and s 2 were in the range of 0 872 0 915 most of the average order degrees of the two subsystems which were no more than 0 15 corresponded to the basins with a low water sediment sd therefore overall for the five catchments with a high sediment yield the sds of the water sediment relationship were relatively low in the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season this study of the synergistic relationship between the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season provides further insight into the water sediment relationships in catchments with high sediment yields it is expected that this study will help reveal the behaviors of the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season and provide a basis for establishing better water sediment relationships then critical information can be provided for effectively governing the water and sediment resources in the coarse sand source regions of the lp china author statement i

1339,a number of studies have been conducted to determine the relationships between runoff and sediment under different conditions however the water sediment synergistic relationship which refers to the degree of intervention between the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season must be further analyzed this study proposed the concept of the synergy degree between water and sediment based on the discipline of synergetics created by haken haken 1983 the flood and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season and the measured water sediment coordination levels were adopted in this study to obtain their synergy degree by taking as an example the largest and most continuous region from the huangfu river to the jialu river in the coarse sand source regions of the loess plateau the results of this investigation are as follows the degree of synergy between runoff and suspended sediment transport was below 0 722 from 1958 to 2016 approximately 70 of the flood events in the five river basins had poor degrees of synergy between the flow and sediment processes in the flood season moreover the synergy degrees of the water sediment relationship were relatively low in the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season due to the low order degrees of these two process subsystems the low synergistic relationship between these two subsystems shows that the coordination and buffering abilities between the flood and suspended sediment transport processes were weak these findings demonstrate the successful adoption of synergetics to ascertain the water sediment synergistic relationship and also provided critical information for designing water conveyance systems with high sediment concentrations for irrigation in the coarse sand source regions of the loess plateau china keywords water sediment relation synergy degree peak flood discharge suspended sediment transport flood season 1 introduction in the past century major rivers have experienced dramatic changes at a global scale due to climate change and intensive human activities such as water abstractions water flow regulations dams weirs sluices and locks land use change damming and sand mining for instance thodsen et al 2010 found that climate change affects suspended sediment transport in rivers both directly through erosion processes and increased river discharges and indirectly through changes in land use and land cover and modeled increases of 17 in the mean annual suspended sediment transport of alluvial rivers and 27 in that of nonalluvial rivers under steady state scenarios bormann 2010 systematically analyzed the gauge data of large rivers in germany to identify variations in the runoff regime which were caused mainly by climate change since the middle of the 20th century and showed that the detailed characteristics of the runoff regimes were considerably affected by environmental change chien et al 2013 pointed out that climate variability affects runoff mainly by influencing precipitation and potential evapotranspiration ahn and merwade 2014 quantified the relative impacts of climate and human activities on runoff in four u s states by using historical streamflow records in conjunction with four methods linear regression hydrologic simulation annual balancing and budyko analysis zhai and tao 2017 showed that human activities such as an increase in water withdrawal and the operation of dams and the operation of dams and reservoirs may be responsible for the decreased runoff in six catchments nianzishan xiahui yangjiaping sanjiangkou xixian and changle after 2000 the relationships between runoff and suspended sediment are very complex lana renault et al 2007 thus many researchers have focused on studying the variability in the relationships between the runoff and suspended sediment concentration ssc at different time scales for example bronsdon and naden 2000 investigated the ssc discharge relationship per year and per month on the river tweed and found variation in the seasonal sediment stock due to the production mobilization or exhaustion of particles suspended sediment data collected over 10 years 1991 2001 in nahal eshtemoa israel were used to demonstrate a relationship between ssc and water discharge q with a high degree of scatter alexandrov et al 2007 in basin and river investigations establishing a relationship between q and the sediment load has always been one of the most important research objectives and has received considerable attention from several researchers asselman 1999 sadeghi et al 2008 tahmoures et al 2015 jansson 1997 pointed out that a sediment rating curve is a relationship established between suspended sediment concentration ssc in kg m3 and the corresponding water discharge q in m3 s this relationship is in most case defined as a power equation ssc aq b where a and b are constants this can be transformed into an additive relationship via a logarithmic transform given the expression lnssc blnq lna lnssc and lnq are the natural logarithm of suspended sediment concentration and discharge a and b are the regression coefficients linear relation model is better than non linear relation model in describing the relationship between suspended sediment concentrations and discharge since then a number of studies have been conducted on the ssc q relationship and generally expressed as a power function fenn et al 1985 asselman 1999 syvitski et al 2000 to discuss relationships between ssc and q hydrologists often use sediment rating curves which is the statistical relationship between ssc and discharge and the most commonly approach is to fit a power curve to the data lefrancois et al 2007 the investigation of variations in the ssc q relationship can be useful for inferring the dominant origins and processes contributing to the suspended sediment load in a river bronsdon and naden 2000 this has given rise to numerous studies on suspended sediment concentration discharge ssc q relationships the linkage between suspended sediment and discharge often cannot be described by simple linear or univariate relationships studies that have focused on the hysteretic behavior in the suspended sediment concentration ssc discharge q relationship observed at the flood scale duvert et al 2010 gao and josefson 2012 seeger et al 2004 lefrancois et al 2007 sherriff et al 2016 have highlighted the major role of in channel bed deposition and resuspension processes in the downstream suspended sediment flux variability other studies have focused on the ssc q relationship by using different methods including regression models francke et al 2008 tachi et al 2020 empirical models irvine and drake 2010 mukanov et al 2019 geno kalman filtering model altunkaynak 2010 multivariate frequency analyses bezak et al 2014 swat model himanshu et al 2017 alberto and carmelo 2020 and artificial intelligence techniques tachi et al 2016 joshi et al 2016 mohd et al 2019 to better enumerate the ssc q relationship a new concept called connectivity has been used by the scientific community as a means to describe and quantify the influences on the fluxes of water and sediment parsons et al 2015 marco et al 2019 demonstrated that connectivity has become a key issue in the study of active processes within hydrogeomorphic systems and has strong implications for understanding their behaviors keesstra et al 2020 pointed out that the concept of connectivity widens the focus of an investigation by forcing the researcher to consider more parts of a system than has been done in most hydrological and sediment dynamics studies since the beginning of the 21st century the concept of connectivity has become increasingly important and prevalent in the field of catchment hydrology bracken and croke 2007 as a tool to understand the relationship between water flow and sediment to date the connectivity between water flow and sediment has been evaluated in various regions worldwide long and pavelsky 2013 cerda et al 2017 for example lesschen et al 2009 simulated the runoff and sediment dynamics at the catchment scale with the lapsus model and included plot and hillslope scale features that influence hydrological connectivity croke et al 2013 assessed both hydrological and sediment connectivity by using high resolution aerial photographs and multitemporal light detection and ranging lidar digital elevation models dems coupled with hydrological modeling poeppl et al 2017 indicated that the variations in the transport times between water and the channel outlet can be explained by variations in hydrological and sediment connectivity after eight years of field observations at the slope scale rodrigo et al 2018 reported that the flows along the whole slope exhibited connectivity very rarely twice while connectivity was observed eight times along individual slope parts and 19 times at the interrow scale keesstra et al 2019 adapted the knowledge of connectivity to better understand and quantify the water and sediment transfer characteristics in catchment systems the yellow river is a globally famous silt carrying river its basic characteristics is less water with more sediment distinguishing it from other rivers zhang 2018 with the development of agricultural production in the yellow river basin considering the use of only clear water cannot meet the requirements of irrigation therefore there are many concerns about the relationship between water and sediment within the sediment laden basin in the middle reach of the yellow river i e the loess plateau lp the source of nearly 90 of the sediment load of the river this water sediment relationship provides a research basis for designing a water conveyance system with high sediment concentration for irrigation in yellow river for example zheng et al 2008 examined the ssc q relationship and the runoff sediment yield relationship for 12 small watersheds in hilly loess areas and zheng et al 2012 examined the flow sediment relationship at three spatial scales and three timescales in the same types of areas in addition to the sediment rating curve which describes the ssc q relationship for a specific drainage system fan et al 2012 the hysteresis analysis between ssc and q is an effective tool for revealing the dynamics of suspended sediment fang et al 2011 many studies have been performed to quantify the relationships between water and sediment in different catchments however more attention should be paid to the synergistic relationship between the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes during the flood season in catchments with high sediment yields which present additional challenges for example when taking field measurements and collecting suspended sediment data as a result these efforts are rarely achieved over long timescales in some catchments schmidt and morche 2006 moreover it is difficult to quantify the degree of synergy in the water sediment relationship this study proposes the concept of the synergy degree sd between water and sediment and constructs a model of the water sediment synergistic relationship based on the discipline of synergetics created by haken haken 1983 the synergistic relationships between runoff and suspended sediment refer to the degree of intervention between the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes during the flood season specifically the synergy between water and sediment refers to the coherence between the flood process and suspended sediment transport process which is reflected by the coordination or buffering of the two subsystems this study adopts values between 0 and 1 for the calculated degree of synergy of the water sediment relationship the more collaborative the water sediment relationship the greater this value is the synergistic relationship between runoff and suspended sediment transport can provide valuable information that can be used to understand the behaviors of runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in flood seasons and can further offer critical information for designing a water conveyance system with high sediment concentrations for irrigation in the coarse sand source regions of the lp china therefore in this paper runoff and suspended sediment transport during the flood season are used as the research targets and the objective of this study is to analyze the water sediment relationship in the flood season to quantify the water sediment synergy in the coarse sand source regions of the lp 2 study area and data description 2 1 study area the lp in north china is famous for its deep loess the region of the lp characterized by a high coarse sediment yield is the primary source of sediment from the lp approximately 53 98 of the lp sediment yield with a particle size 0 1 mm is produced therein the middle reach of the yellow river features eight first order tributaries namely the huangfu gushan kuye tuwei jialu wuding qingjian and yanhe rivers which cover a total area of approximately 1 88 104 km2 fig 1 the largest and most continuous region stretches from the huangfu river to the jialu river between 37 58 39 26 n and 109 32 111 16 e this study area has a continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 6 14 c rainfall in the study area is highly variable both spatially and temporally its average annual precipitation varies from 310 to 580 mm and nearly 60 70 of all precipitation is dominated by rainstorms that occur during the rainy season most flood events occur between april and september the triangles in fig 1 represent the hydrological gauging stations in different basins for example the main gauging station named gaojiachuan station as shown in fig 1 controls a drainage area of nearly 3253 km2 which accounts for nearly 98 76 of the tuwei river basin the average runoff and sediment load values at the gaojiachuan station were 3 41 108 m3 and 0 4 108 t respectively between 1956 and 2005 sun et al 2010 2 2 data sources to collect data with which to investigate the runoff and sediment yield in five river basins the huangfu gaoshiya wenjiachuan gaojiachuan and shenjiawan hydrological stations were established by the yellow river water conservancy commission yrcc of the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china in 1953 1953 1953 1955 and 1956 respectively historical data are fundamental to understanding the present and anticipating the future therefore this study used historical data in the flood season for five river basins some measurement variables including the peak flood discharge pfd and peak value of the suspended sediment concentration in the flood season pvssc followed the national standards issued by the ministry of water conservancy and were obtained from the hydrological yearbook of the yellow river hybyr according to the available data from the hybyr and yrcc the data used in this study were collected from 1958 2016 this long term period presented a complete hydrological record and a continuous flood record with only a few gaps table 1 revealing a large amount of suspended sediment during the flood season the tuwei river basin was taken as an example for which data in 2011 were not available the time series from 1990 to 2005 were provided by the yrcc while the remaining data were obtained from the hybyr therefore the flood events in the tuwei river basin were obtained for the periods of 1958 2010 and 2012 2016 3 methodologies 3 1 determination of selected flood events it is possible to use the maximum annual flood maf events in each year the annual flood series the maf series of peak floods have been commonly used in the literature to analyze flood events to estimate design floods e g to calculate the flood frequency and conduct flood risk analyses the main limitation of the maf method is that annual flood events with very short durations may be included furthermore some years may contribute several floods and other years may contribute none the degrees of water sediment synergy in the flood season were studied by performing a synergistic analysis on the flood event series to overcome the problems described above the flood event selection procedure was revised this study proposed the duration over threshold dot method to consider all flood events above some selected threshold the advantage of dot series is that insignificant floods are excluded the use of the dot method requires setting some rules to determine whether flood events with small flood peaks or low flood volumes should be considered the first and most critical step in the construction of dot series is to select the most appropriate threshold here the average flood duration was used as the condition for choosing the appropriate threshold the second step is usually to select flood events in which the pfd is more than the average annual runoff 3 2 calculations of v i and s i the flood duration is defined as the time span from the beginning to the end of a flood event and is related to the specific circumstances in the area and the variations in rainfall intensity here the average flood duration was calculated using the following formula 1 t j 1 m t j m where t is the average flood duration j 1 m m is the number of flood events and t j is the flood duration of the jth flood event for the hypothetical flow process depicted in fig 2 v i j the ith hour flood volume for the jth flood event was determined by 2 v i j 3600 q i j q i 1 j 2 where i 1 t t is the average flood duration q i j is the observed discharge of the ith hour for the jth flood event and q i 1 j is the observed discharge of the i 1 th hour for the jth flood event the sand transport rate in the ith hour str i j kg s for the jth flood event was calculated by multiplying the ssc ssc i j kg m3 in the ith hour for the jth flood event by the observed discharge of the ith hour for the jth flood event q i j m3 s 3 str i j ssc i j q i j where ssc i j is the observed suspend sediment concentration of the ith hour for the jth flood event the sediment load in the ith hour s i j kg for the jth flood event was similarly calculated by multiplying the time duration t i sec by the average sand transport rate in the ith hour str i j kg s for the jth flood event 4 s i j t i str i j where i 1 t j 1 m m 1 str i str i j str i 1 j 2 and t i 3600 s 3 3 calculation of the degree of synergy 3 3 1 establishing the order parameters the selection of input variables is one of the most important steps in the development of the method for calculating the sd the order parameters can characterize the degree of order of the system the flood process and suspended sediment transport process compose an open system suppose a complex open system consists of k subsystems st ss 1 ss 2 ss k ss k k 1 k and k 2 in this paper k is 2 and represents the flood process and suspended sediment transport process the order parameter of ss k over a certain time period t is defined as 5 p ss 1 v i 1 v i 2 v i j v i m k 1 p ss 2 s i 1 s i 2 s i j s i m k 2 where i 1 t j 1 m v i j is the tth hour flood volume for the jth flood event s i j is the tth hour sediment load for the jth flood event for convenience in the subsequent analysis we assume that p i j k t is the tth hour flood volume sediment load for the jth flood event namely p i j 1 t v i j and p i j 2 t s i j the eq 5 of the ss k order parameters is written as 6 p ss k p i 1 k t p i 2 k t p i j k t p i m k t assume l i t ss k and u i t ss k are the lower and upper limits over a certain time period respectively of the order parameter component p i j t which belongs to subsystem k l i t ss k p i j k t u i t ss k and u i t ss k max i p i 1 k t p i 2 k t p i j k t p i m k t l i t ss k min i p i 1 k t p i 2 k t p i j k t p i m k t 3 3 2 order degree of the order parameter the order parameter of ss k fluctuates around a constant value suppose p i 1 k t p i 2 k t p i g k t are slow relaxation parameters the higher these values are the higher the order degree of the subsystem while the smaller these values are the lower the order degree of the subsystem then the order degree of each order parameter denoted u k p i j k t can be defined as 7 u k p i j k t p i j k t l i t ss k u i t ss k l i t ss k p i j k t p i j k t u k p i j k t u i t ss k p i j k t u i t ss k l i t ss k p i j k t p i j k t where p i j k t is the order parameter of the subsystem over a certain time period p i j k t p i 1 k t p i 2 k t p i j k t p i m k t m it is clear from the calculation above that u k p i j k t varies between 0 and 1 and a larger u k p i j k t value is better according to the theory of synergetics when u k p i j k t approaches 0 the order parameter p i j k t contributes little to the subsystem in contrast when u k p i j k t approaches 1 the order parameter p i j k t greatly contributes to the subsystem and plays a leading role in the collaborative process 3 3 3 subsystem total order degree this paper utilized the linear weighted summation method to define the order degree of each subsystem and obtain the expressions of the order degrees of the flood process and suspended sediment transport process subsystems over a certain period time as shown below 8 z j s k i 1 t Œæ i u k p i j k t in eq 7 z j s k is defined as the order degree of subsystem k for the jth flood event z j s k 0 1 the larger z j s k is the larger the contribution of the subsystem order parameter to this system order and vice versa Œæ i represents the relative weights of the order parameters for the subsystem this study used the entropy method to reduce the subjectivity of the weights of the order parameters the concrete steps of the entropy method are described in delgado and romero 2016 3 3 4 degree of synergy degree of synergy means the degree of coordination and collaboration between the subsystems within a system the synergy degree of ssc q refers to the coherence between the flood process and suspended sediment transport process which is reflected by the coordination or buffering of the flood process subsystem and the suspended sediment transport process subsystem as a valuable index used to reflect the relationship between the flood process and suspended sediment transport process the degree of synergy plays an important role in identifying the degree of intervention between runoff and suspended sediment transport processes therefore a model of the coordination degree between the flood process and suspended sediment transport process was established to analyze the interactive coordination degree the algorithm can be expressed as follows 9 sd j t k 1 k Œª j œÑ j 1 2 10 Œª j 2 k 1 k z j s k k 1 k z j s k 1 2 11 œÑ j k 1 k Œ± z j s k Œ± 1 k where sd j t is the degree of coupling coordination between two subsystems namely the flood process and suspended sediment transport process in this study Œª j stands for the degree of coupling between the two subsystems œÑ j denotes the overall impact of the performance levels of the two systems on the coupling coordination degree and Œ± describes the contributions of the flood process and suspended sediment transport process to the coordination level in this study Œ± is 1 k because each subsystem has the same level of importance 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of the analyzed flood events in this paper the dot series replaced the flood series for each year by its largest flood maf dot data are composed of all flood events over a chosen threshold for the entire stream gauge record some years may contribute several floods while other years may contribute no floods during the observation period there were 221 223 239 213 and 205 flood events in the huangfu gushan kuye tuwei and jialu river basins respectively the total numbers of significant flood events were identified using complete flood season data with average durations over 107 33 90 44 112 68 101 67 and 104 73 h in the huangfu gushan kuye tuwei and jialu river basins respectively in the present study the statistical characteristics were analyzed based on a dataset of the total number of flood events and the number of dot series as illustrated in table 2 for example in the huangfu river basin the flood duration ranged from 12 1 h in august 1963 to 512 h in july 2012 the pfd varied from 8 02 m3 s in june 1977 to 11 600 m3 s in july 1989 during 1958 2016 with a mean value of 888 62 m3 s and the pvssc values ranged from 18 3 kg m3 in july 2016 to 1570 kg m3 in july 1974 in 1958 2016 with an average value of 783 77 kg m3 therefore all of the recorded events in which the pfd was greater than the average annual runoff and the flood duration was longer than the average flood duration were adopted to analyze the degree of synergy with an increased sample size taking the huangfu river basin as an example among the 89 selected flood events the minimum peak discharge was greater than the average annual flow 4 16 m3 s the minimum and maximum values of peak discharge were 14 9 m3 s 1982 and 11 600 m3 s 1989 respectively the minimum pvssc of 175 kg m3 was measured in 2008 and the maximum pvssc of 1540 kg m3 was measured in 1974 the flood duration for the drainage area of the huangfu river gauging station ranged from 108 h 1969 to 512 h 2012 with a mean value of 173 41 h the flood events satisfying these conditions are listed in table 3 4 2 characterization of the synergy degrees and order degrees the sds of the five river basins at the corresponding hydrological stations from 1958 to 2016 were analyzed to demonstrate the proposed methodology the period of observation for the five stations was longer than 50 years the sd variations in the flow and sediment loading in the flood season at the five hydrological stations between 1958 and 2016 are shown in fig 3 the sd of the water sediment relationship fluctuated greatly with some peaks among the five hydrological stations during the study period from 1958 to 2016 the sds in the huangfu and gushan river basins showed a peak at approximately 0 7 in 1988 while the sd of the water sediment relationship fluctuated with two peaks 1959 and 1988 in the kuye river basin however in the tuwei and jialu river basins the peak values occurred in 2016 and 2012 respectively taking the huangfu river basin as an example the sd of the water sediment relationship continuously exhibited considerable variation an analysis of the sd shows that the minimum sd was 0 102 in june 1995 the 69th flood event while the highest value reached 0 7224 in august 1988 the 60th flood event the average sd value was 0 3129 during the study period according to the magnitude of the coordination degree the sd was divided into five categories the basic statistical attributes of the sd such as the number of flood events under different sd ranges were analyzed over the 59 year period for the five river basins table 4 an sd value of 0 2 is considered very low values between 0 4 and 0 6 are considered moderate and values within the range 0 6 sd 0 8 are considered high in the study area table 4 reveals that the sds of the five river basins are low in the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season for example in the huangfu river basin 70 79 of flood events had a poor sd while the sds of many of the remaining flood events 25 84 ranged from 0 4 to 0 6 approximately 3 37 of the flood events of the huangfu river had a high sd while no flood events were in the very high range in the study region the sd of the water sediment relationship fluctuated greatly but was still low to some extent according to the theory of synergetics the main reason for the weak synergistic relationship between water and sediment may be the sd which was determined by the order degrees of the subsystems table 5 shows some statistical characteristics of the order degrees of the two subsystems i e the flood process and the suspended sediment transport process whose order degrees were low the order degrees of the flood process subsystem and the suspended sediment transport process subsystem at the huangfu hydrological station changed from 0 011 to 0 63 and from 0 01 to 0 432 respectively for the gushan river basin the order degrees of the flood process subsystem strongly fluctuated between 0 012 and 0 487 with an average of 0 147 z s 1 while those of the suspended sediment transport subsystem varied from 0 010 to 0 411 with an average of 0 109 z s 2 the maximum values of z s 1 and z s 2 which appeared at the wenjiachuan hydrological station for the kuye river basin were 0 527 and 0 376 respectively the order degrees of the flood process subsystems were below 0 590 and 0 615 from 1958 to 2016 in the tuwei and jialu river basins respectively according to table 5 most of the means of the order degrees of the two subsystems no more than 0 15 corresponded to the basins with a low sd of the water sediment relationship 4 3 relationships between the synergy degree and peak flood discharge peak suspended sediment concentration the results of further analysis of the relationship between the sd and pfd pvssc are shown in a contour plot fig 4 which demonstrates that the upper and lower limits of the pfd and pvssc vary linearly in the study area as shown in fig 4 the sd graph presents the scenes of two conditions with the pfd and pvssc occurring at the same time in the contour map each contour line corresponds to a value of the sd indicating that the responses of the flood and sediment transport processes in the five basins to the sd are complex 1 with increases in pfd and pvssc the water sediment sd did not increase analysis of the results showed a significant difference in the water sediment synergistic relationship between huangfu and the other four catchments the highest sd of huangfu appeared at the larger pvssc and the highest sd corresponded to the smaller pvssc for the other four catchments the larger the pvssc with a lower pfd 2000 m3 s 5000 m3 s 1000 m3 s the smaller the water sediment sd was for the gushan tuwei and jialu river basins respectively in contrast the smaller the pvssc with a larger pfd 200 1800 m3 s 6000 9000 m3 s 800 2100 m3 s 2000 5750 m3 s the higher the water sediment sd was for the gushan kuye tuwei and jialu river basins respectively 2 the sd results varied under different water sediment conditions the sd values increased gradually with increasing pvssc and the pfd values ranged from 8000 m3 s to 10 000 m3 s in gushan in comparison the sd values in tuwei showed different changes specifically the sd values decreased gradually with increasing pvssc and the pfd values ranged from 1000 m3 s to 2200 m3 s in contrast the sd values in huangfu first increased and then decreased with increasing pvssc and the pfd values ranged from 4000 m3 s to 5200 m3 s 3 the water sediment relationships displayed stronger synergy when the pfd and pvssc were within certain ranges in the sd variation domain of the pfd and pvssc there was one clear high value aggregation center of sd change characteristics in each river basin the aggregation center coordinates of the pfd and pvssc in the five river basins could be estimated respectively as 6900 m3 s and 1300 kg m3 fig 4a 950 m3 s and 180 kg m3 fig 4b 7500 m3 s and 100 kg m3 fig 4c 1250 m3 s and 60 kg m3 fig 4d and 3250 m3 s and 100 kg m3 fig 4e the influence scope of the intensity was relatively large and the highest sd values were almost completely concentrated in the high value centers for example in the high value center of the huangfu river basin in the pfd variation domain the strong concentration influence range was approximately 6500 7200 m3 s and in the pvssc variation domain the strong concentration influence range was approximately 950 1540 kg m3 4 4 relationships between the synergy degree and the order degrees of the two subsystems scatterplot matrices are commonly used and easily applicable graphical tools for exploring the relationships between two quantitative variables fig 5 presents a graphical scatterplot of the results sd s 1 s 2 1 the data given in fig 5 a2 and fig 5 c2 show a moderate correlation r2 0 666 0 681 with a positive slope 0 5188 0 5438 fig 5 d2 and fig 5 e2 illustrate a slightly positive correlation between z s 1 and s 2 r2 0 478 0 462 2 the analysis results in fig 5 also show a positive linear relationship between the water sediment sd and the order degree of the suspended sediment transport process z s 2 for the tuwei and jialu river basins and this relationship was better than that between the sd and z s 1 therefore in the tuwei and jialu river basins the suspended sediment transport subsystem had a great influence on the water sediment synergy 3 the linear regression relationships between the sd and s 1 s 2 were acquired good positive correlations were found between the sd and s 1 s 2 e g panel 1 1 and panel 2 1 in fig 5a for example panel 1 1 in fig 5a displays a strong correlation of r 0 934 with a coefficient of determination of r2 0 872 as shown in figure 5b1 a high correlation of r 0 957 reflects the strong relationship between the sd and the order degree of the suspended sediment transport process subsystem z s 2 with r2 0 915 indicating that the variation in z s2 accounted for 91 5 of the variation in the sd figure 5d1 clearly shows that the sd exhibited a strong positive association with z s2 r 0 938 and the coefficient of determination r2 0 879 revealed that the variation in z s2 accounted for 87 9 of the variation in the sd in figure 5e3 the coefficient of determination r2 0 714 suggests that the sd was responsible for 71 4 of the variation in the order degree of the flood process subsystem z s1 and the regression coefficient b 0 7957 indicated that a unit increase in z s1 resulted in a corresponding increase of 0 7957 in sd this study revealed positive and highly significant associations between the sd and the order degrees of the two subsystems z s1 and z s2 5 conclusions this paper adopted the largest and most continuous region from the huangfu river to the jialu river in the coarse sand source regions of the lp as an example and proposed the concept of the sd between the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes during the flood season based on the discipline of synergetics and thus the order parameters characterizing the degree of order of a system created by haken then this study constructed a sd model and measured the coordination levels between runoff and suspended sediment transport processes to obtain the water sediment sds in five river basins from this study the following conclusions were drawn 1 for the five river basins the sds of the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes were below 0 722 from 1958 to 2016 additionally 70 79 69 32 65 18 70 12 and 70 93 of flood events had poor flow sediment sds in the flood season for the huangfu gushan kuye tuwei and jialu river basins respectively approximately 25 84 29 55 31 25 25 29 and 29 07 of the sds in huangfu gushan kuye tuwei and jialu respectively were in the range of 0 4 to 0 6 four flood events in the kuye and tuwei river basins had high sds while no flood events were in the very high sd range overall the sds of the five river basins were relatively low in terms of the flow and sediment in the flood season 2 with increases in pfd and pvssc the water sediment sd did not increase the water sediment relationship displayed stronger synergy when the pfd and pvssc were within certain ranges among the five river basins in the sd variation domains of the pfd and pvssc there was one clear high value aggregation center of sd change characteristics in each catchment the aggregation center coordinates of the pfd and pvssc were estimated respectively as 6900 m3 s and 1300 kg m3 huangfu 950 m3 s and 180 kg m3 gushan 13 800 m3 s and 250 kg m3 kuye 1250 m3 s and 60 kg m3 tuwei and 3250 m3 s and 100 kg m3 jialu 3 according to the theory of synergetics the sds were determined by the order degrees of the subsystems the study quantified the linear relationship between sd and s 1 s 2 for each of the five catchments the regression analysis between sd and s1 for the five catchments indicated that the regression r2 values were in the range of 0 714 0 913 while those between sd and s 2 were in the range of 0 872 0 915 most of the average order degrees of the two subsystems which were no more than 0 15 corresponded to the basins with a low water sediment sd therefore overall for the five catchments with a high sediment yield the sds of the water sediment relationship were relatively low in the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season this study of the synergistic relationship between the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season provides further insight into the water sediment relationships in catchments with high sediment yields it is expected that this study will help reveal the behaviors of the runoff and suspended sediment transport processes in the flood season and provide a basis for establishing better water sediment relationships then critical information can be provided for effectively governing the water and sediment resources in the coarse sand source regions of the lp china author statement i
