16000,reducing methane emission is of great importance to control the global greenhouse effect dissimilatory iron reduction dir coupling of organic matter decomposition may suppress methane production via reducing primary electron donors available for methanogenesis however during dir the amorphous iron oxides e g ferrihydrite are easy to transform into more stable crystalline iron minerals which slowdowns the rate of dir humic substance hs with redox activity has been extensively reported to facilitate dir via electron shuttles mechanism yet little known about the effect of hs on mediating the mineralization of iron oxides and the subsequent influences on dir and methanogenesis to clarify this ferrihydrite and fulvic acid fa as the model substance of hs were supplied to anaerobic methanogenesis systems results showed that fa could significantly decrease the formation of crystalline iron oxides enhance dir rate by 13 72 and suppress methanogenesis by 25 13 compared to ferrihydrite supplemented only by x ray absorption spectra analysis it was found that fa could complex with ferrihydrite via forming a fe c o structure on the second shell of fe atom quantum chemical calculation further confirmed that fa reduced the adsorption energy between fe ii and ferrihydrite our study suggested that rational use of hs to mediate mineralization pathway of iron oxides could efficiently improve the availability of iron oxides to drive dir and control the conversion of organics into ch4 in natural or engineered systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iron reduction ferrihydrite humic substances greenhouse gas emission x ray absorption spectra quantum chemical calculation 1 introduction methane is a major component of greenhouse gasses whose greenhouse effect is 22 times greater than that of carbon dioxide neubauer and megonigal 2019 in natural environment methane is mainly produced by methanogens through the metabolism of organic carbon e g acetic acid or carbon dioxide it accounts for ca 69 of the total annual flux of global methane into the atmosphere zhang et al 2019 up to now the interactions between methane emission and climate change have been well understood while the regulating method especially biogeochemical controls on methane fluxes are less so miller et al 2015 serreze and barry 2011 dissimilatory iron reduction dir namely the reduction of fe iii to fe ii coupled with the oxidization of organic carbon by iron reducing bacteria irb plays a crucial role in iron and carbon cycles lovley and anderson 2000 pan et al 2016 for instance natural organic carbon oc often forms stable bonds with iron oxides to preserve the c loss of soil dir can potentially weaken or break down the associations between fe iii and oc then release fe iii bound oc into environment or directly decompose it via microbial degradation knorr 2013 previous studies reported that dir also can dissolve fe iii oxides and produce fe ii leading to mineral phase transformations of fe iii to generate secondary minerals e g magnetite goethite lepidocrocite siderite and akaganeite adhikari et al 2017 more importantly fe iii reduction is thermodynamically more favorable to methanogenesis which makes dir able to suppress methane emission via competing for the primary electron donors for methanogens lovley and phillips 1987 ferrihydrite a ubiquitously iron oxide that exists in soils and sediments has a higher dir capacity than crystalline iron oxides e g hematite or magnetite due to its higher redox potential bird et al 2011 wang et al 2017 2019 however ferrihydrite with poorly crystalline structure is thermodynamically unstable which easily causes the secondary mineralization to transform into more stable crystalline iron minerals cismasu et al 2016 fu et al 2016 zhuang et al 2015 the crystalline iron oxides with low solubility cannot disperse well in aquatic systems that leads to insufficient contact with irb also the low bioavailability and redox potential of these crystalline iron oxides make the fe iii reduction difficult as a result the formation of the crystalline iron oxides may slow down and even hold up the process of dir to weaken the competition with methanogenesis aeppli et al 2019 notini et al 2019 moreover the crystalline iron minerals with semi conductivity are reported to serve as conduits for electric syntrophy between geobacter and methanogens to accelerate the generation of methane via direct interspecies electron transfer diet cruz viggi et al 2014 song et al 2019 storck et al 2016 these findings imply that the changes in mineralogical properties of iron oxides greatly affect the methane generation thus preventing the secondary mineralization of ferrihydrite is a key measure to curb methane emission in soils and aquatic environments ferrihydrite is frequently associated with natural organic matters nom the nom contains a variety of functional groups such as carboxyls phenols quinones and amines many of which strongly interact with fe ii fe iii to influence the reduction hydrolysis and solubility of fe humic substance hs as a kind of macromolecular nom with redox activity has been extensively reported to be capable of enhancing dir bond and lovley 2002 chen et al 2017 stern et al 2018 it is ascribed that hs may serve as electron shuttle to enhance the electron connection between irbs and iron oxides it especially facilitates the long distance electron transfer between cells and fe iii oxides to benefit dir stern et al 2018 also hs affected the mineral transformation of iron oxides for example colombo et al 2015 demonstrated that hs could inhibit crystal growth of fe ion leading to a decrease in crystalline iron oxides and promoting the formation of ferrihydrite shimizu et al 2013 also found that the addition of hs slowed down the formation of goethite and magnetite and increased the fe iii reduction rate however the potential mechanisms of how hs altered the mineralization pathway were not clear moreover subsequent influences of the transformation of iron oxides on dir and methanogenesis were often overlooked based on the above consideration ferrihydrite and fa a type of hs were introduced into anaerobic methanogenesis systems in this study with the aim to investigate the role of hs on methane emission via mediating dir the link between greenhouse gas emission and dir were monitored atomic force microscope x ray absorption spectra and quantum chemical calculation were used for deeply revealing the role of fa on preventing the secondary mineralization of poorly crystalline iron oxides 2 material and methods 2 1 synthesis of ferrihydrite minerals ferrihydrite fhy was synthesized via neutralization of 50 mm fecl3 6h2o solution with 0 4 m naoh to a ph around 7 then repeated washing centrifugation 8000 rpm for 10 min steps with deionized water for 3 times to remove excess ions adhikari et al 2017 chen et al 2014 fulvic acid tang et al 2014 fa purity 98 purchased from aladdin https www aladdin e com one of the hs which is soluble over the entire ph range was used as the model substance for hs the fhy fa coprecipitates were synthesized by adding 1 g l of fulvic acid to the fecl3 solution before neutralization 2 2 experimental setup the experiments on investigating competition of dir on methanogenesis were conducted in three parallel ad systems control reactor fhy reactor and fhy fa reactor using 250 ml serum bottles each bottle contained 10 ml of inoculum and 200 ml of feeding substrate the inoculum was collected from sediment of chunliu river dalian china then stored at 4 c before using the inoculum was digested for 7 days until biogas production ceased to consume its natural organic matters contained the initial composition of feeding substrate was as follows 0 3 g nh4cl 0 5 g l mgso4 0 1 g l cacl2 0 14 g l kh2po4 0 2 g l nacl 22 mm nahco3 and 10 mm nano3 5 mm glucose as carbon source was added into the reactors for microbial growth on day 0 14 and 28 to observe the mineral transformation of ferrihydrite more intuitively another two abiotic reactors with no inoculum added were set up abiotic fhy reactor and abiotic fhy fa reactor all parameters were the same as the above experiment except for 7 mm feso4 was injected into these two abiotic reactors to replace the fe ii generated from dir the concentration of ferrihydrite in all reactor was 10 mm all above experiments were triplicated 2 3 analytical methods the volume of biogas was equivalent to the headspace of serum bottles the ch4 and co2 proportion of biogas was measured by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd tianmei gc 7900p tcd zhao et al 2015 every two days a 1 ml suspension sample was taken from the bottles for the detection of fe concentration in liquid phase another 1 ml sample containing both suspension and slurry was taken from the bottle after it was blended for the detection of total fe concentration in reactor to inhibit the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 1 ml 6 m hcl was added into the sample immediately after it was collected ferrous iron was analyzed by an adaptation of the ferrozine technique cooper et al 2000 the total iron content was determined by inductively coupled plasma icp optima 2000 dv perkinelmer the difference between the total iron minus the ferrous iron is the ferric iron concentration another 1 5 ml suspension sample was taken for short chain volatile fatty acids vfas detection vfas including acetate propionate butyrate and valerate were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector fid tianmei gc 7900p fid jiang et al 2007 the reduced and oxidized state of fa was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer according to orsetti s method orsetti et al 2013 briefly the suspension was sampled from the fhy fa reactor the supernatant was collected through centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 10 min then transport into a quartz cuvette with an optical path length of 1 0 cm the cuvette was subsequently sealed in the anaerobic chamber and spectra range from 300 to 600 nm were recorded the eps of the inoculum were extracted using the cation exchange resin cer technique cer 20 50 mesh 732 001 7 according to frolund et al 1995 2 4 determination of fe mineral x ray diffraction xrd was

canfield 2005 tessier et al 1979 at the end of each feedstock stage a 5 ml mixture sample was taken from each reactor then process vacuum freeze drying 0 1 g dry sludge sample and 20 ml extracting solution were added to a 50 ml centrifuge tube then placed in a table concentrator with a vibration speed of 100 r min under 25 c after extraction the supernatant was transported into a test tube then using deionized water to wash residual sediment three times to collect supernatant in case of the loss of the sample afterward the residual was used for the next extraction step the detail extraction method of each step was described as follows i exchangeable and carbonate fe fraction was extracted by 20 ml 1 m sodium acetate ph was buffered to 5 with acetic acid for 24 h ii labile organic binding fe fraction was extracted by 20 ml 0 1 m sodium pyrophosphate na4p2o7 solution for 1 h after centrifugation and pouring out the supernatant another 20 ml pyrophosphate solution was added to repeat the extraction once again the supernatant from two extractions was combined iii easily reducible fe fraction including ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite were extracted by 20 ml 1 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride for 48 h the hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution was prepared by 25 acetic acid iv crystalline fe including goethite hematite and akaganeite fraction were extracted by 20 ml 0 29 m

support information the raw sequence files were submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive database under accession no prjna810363 3 results and discussions 3 1 methane decrease with ferrihydrite and fa supplemented methane generation was monitored to investigate the competition of dir with methanogenesis during the first 14 days first feedstock there was only carbon dioxide 1 mm with no methane generated in all reactors when another 5 mm glucose was added into reactors at day 14 methane started to produce and reached 0 41 0 04 0 20 0 03 and 0 10 0 01 mm in control fhy and fhy fa reactors respectively at day 28 the final day of the second feedstock it preliminarily showed the decrease of methane production with fhy and fhy fa added more obvious gas of methane was observed in the third feedstock at day 42 the cumulative methane production of three reactors was 1 67 0 15 1 28 0 15 and 0 48 0 12 mm respectively which meant that the methane production was suppressed by 23 19 with ferrihydrite added and adding fa further suppressed the methane production by 48 32 the analysis of residual organics in three reactors figure s1 and text s1 showed that more organic substances was consumed but less methane was produced in fhy reactors which suggested that the competition of dir with methanogenesis decreased the organic carbon flowing into methane addition of fa further strengthened this competition during dir organic carbon was converted into co2 and then the enhanced dir should lead to more co2 production reversely the actual production of co2 detected in fhy and fhy fa reactors was less than that of the control as shown in fig 1b the co2 production of the three reactors was 3 73 0 06 2 58 0 10 and 2 12 0 04 mm respectively which meant that co2 production in fhy and fhy fa reactors decreased by 30 73 and 43 23 in comparison to control respectively similar results were observed by xu et al 2019 who found the co2 emission was reduced with ferrihydrite addition in paddy soil it was ascribed that the dissolved co2 reacted with dir generated fe ii to form siderite feco3 then decreased the amount of gaseous co2 detected as shown in fig 2a biogenetic fe ii rapidly increased in the first 17 days which reached 0 09 0 01 0 38 0 04 and 0 82 0 01 mm in control fhy and fhy fa reactor respectively correspondingly the generating rate of fe ii in the liquid phase of three reactors was 5 54 23 57 and 53 04 μm day respectively data was based on day 2 17 meaning that the addition of fa increased the rate of dir by 125 it was ascribed that fa could act as electron shuttles to facilitate the electron transfer between cells and iron oxides as shown in fig s2 the peaks of uv vis absorption spectrum at 328 nm and 410 nm were referred to the oxidized and reduced state of fa respectively compared with the pure fa the supernatant from the fhy fa showed a stronger peak at 410 nm which indicated the fa accepted h and e from organics oxidation it also implied the potential of fa on serving as electron shuttles orsetti et al 2013 on day 18 the concentration of fe ii in the liquid phase started to decrease it was probably because that the dir generated fe ii precipitated on the surface of ferrihydrite then induced the transformation of ferrihydrite to decrease the dir rate as a result the speed of precipitation of fe ii was faster than that of dir generation when adding an extra carbon source on day 28 the concentration of fe ii did not increase again meaning that the dir process might have stopped and all the reactive ferrihydrite had been depleted at the end of the experiment the concentration of total fe ii in control fhy and fhy fa reactor was 1 65 0 17 7 01 0 25 and 8 25 0 30 mm respectively corresponding to the iron reduction rate of 76 26 for fhy and 89 98 for fhy fa respectively in summary the supplement of fa could increase both rate and extent of the dir process 3 2 fa inhibit secondary mineralization of ferrihydrite at the end of each feedstock a mixture sample was taken from the fhy and fhy fa reactors to analyze the composition of iron species as shown in fig 3 the main iron oxides of the two reactors were exchangeable including adsorption exchangeable and carbonate state which accounted for 49 02 1st 44 15 2nd and 38 01 3rd for fhy reactor and 50 80 1st 51 04 2nd and 56 18 3rd for fhy fa reactor during three feedstocks respectively xrd analysis fig 4 showed that siderite feco3 jcpds 83 1764 was the dominant iron species in fhy and fhy fa reactor which correspond to the carbonate state in exchangeable fe siderite was generated from the reaction of fe ii and dissolved co2 which was in agreement with the decreased gaseous co2 detected in fhy and fhy fa reactor organic bonding fe took second place of iron species which accounted for 30 88 1st 30 16 2nd and 29 93 3rd of the total content in fhy reactor and 38 64 1st 36 59 2nd and 32 79 3rd in fhy fa reactor respectively organic bonding fe in fhy reactor was formed from the combination of the fe including iron oxides and dir generated fe ii and organics such as extracellular polymeric substance eps secreted by microorganisms omoike et al 2004 when fa was added the abundant functional groups e g hydroxy and carboxyl of fa complexed with fe increased the content of organic bonding fe karlsson and persson 2012 the organic bonding structure helped alleviate the adsorption precipitation of fe ii on the surface of ferrihydrite to prevent from transformation from the first feedstock to the third feedstock the content of crystalline fe i e goethite and hematite in fhy reactor gradually increased from 4 35 to 12 06 and highly crystalline fe magnetite increased from 1 82 to 7 78 respectively it suggested that the reducible ferrihydrite had been gradually transformed into crystalline iron minerals that were more thermodynamically stable in contrast their contents maintained at 2 21 3 13 crystalline and 1 90 2 70 highly crystalline in fhy fa reactor which seemed substantially unchanged it indicated that fa could prevent the mineral transformation of ferrihydrite as mentioned above the formation of organic bonding iron with the eps 125 7 mg g vs in this study secreted by microorganism alleviated the crystalline transformation to eliminate the interference of eps another two abiotic experiments with and without fa was operated named abiotic fhy reactor and abiotic fhy fa reactor the experimental parameters were the same as the fhy and fhy fa reactors except for no microbial inoculum was added as shown in fig 4c the ferrihydrite added in the abiotic fhy reactor was gradually transformed into more crystalline iron minerals with the content of ferrihydrite decreasing from 56 80 to 21 19 correspondingly the summation of crystalline and highly crystalline fe increased from 37 35 to 77 04 and there were almost no exchangeable and organic bonding fe existed in abiotic fhy reactor 2 at the third feedstock when fa was added fig 4d most fe existed as organic bonding form accounting for 39 98 78 57 of the total iron in abiotic fhy fa reactor during the three feedstocks while the summation of crystalline and highly crystalline only accounted for 10 12 26 22 of the total iron it clearly showed that fa prevented the mineral transformation of ferrihydrite fig 5 showed the morphology transformation of ferrihydrite without microbial inoculation sample was taken from abiotic fhy and abiotic fhy fa reactors in the absence of fa ferrihydrite was dissolved then polymerized 12 h and finally formed new types of iron minerals 36 h the iron minerals continued to aggregate 120 h with the average size increasing from 20 to 50 nm over time according to the xrd analysis the globular iron oxides blue arrow belonged to magnetite figure s3 the needle like iron oxides red arrow were speculated to be goethite in contrast no obvious mineralization of iron oxides was detected and the peaks of magnetite of the samples in abiotic fhy fa reactor in xrd patterns was not as clear as that of abiotic fhy reactor the results were in agreement with fig 4 which further exhibited the role of fa on preventing ferrihydrite from the mineralization xafs was used to determine the coordination structure between ferrihydrite and fa the position of the main edge in the xanes region showed that fe iii was the predominant oxidation state in both fhy and fhy fa coprecipitates samples the weak absorption spectrum of pre edge 7114 0 ev combined with the strong absorption spectrum of main edge 7132 0 ev were resulted from the octahedral structure of ferrihydrite prietzel et al 2007 differently the main edge position of fhy fa shifted from 7132 5 ev to 7131 4 ev compared to fhy the reduction of fe iii was an electron capture process and the energy state of fe iii in fhy fa sample was nearer to fe ii than that of fhy sample the main edge of fe ii was around 7125 0 ev which suggested electron was easier to be captured karlsson and persson 2010 and 2012 also suggested that the chemical adsorption of organic matters on the surface of iron oxides might weaken the acting force of fe o by polarization it indicated a decreasing tendency of the oxidation valence of fe iii in fhy fa samples in another words the fe iii in fhy fa sample was easier to be reduced into fe ii fourier transforms fig 6b of exafs gave the information of coordination path bond distance r coordination number c n and disorder σ2 of fe in fhy and fhy fa samples according to the conventional exafs data fitting table 1 fe in fhy samples was coordinated by approximately six c n o atoms at distances of 1 96 0 01 å at the first shell it should be noted that c n and o atoms could not be distinguished explicitly by exafs but considering no c and n atoms in the pure fhy samples it could be ensured that the coordinated atom with fe was o only in contrast to fhy there was a new coordination shell formed at a longer distance of 2 12 0 04 å in fhy fa except for the six coordination numbers of fe o at the first shell it was identified as c n o atom which might originate from the functional groups such as carboxyl groups of fa that were complexed with fe similarly karlsson et al 2010 and 2012 found natural organic matter complexing with ferrihydrite might lead to a longer scattering fe c o distance in which carboxylates were the predominant functional groups for the complexation also this complexation suppressed the precipitation of fe iii in this study the carboxyl groups in fa might have a similar effect on complexing ferrihydrite to prevent ferrihydrite from adsorbing free fe ii and then alleviated the mineralization of ferrihydrite the wavelet wt analysis showed shell contributions of fhy and fhy fa samples more intuitively fhy and fhy fa samples showed similar first shell contributions which backscattering maxima was around 4 å 1 it was in accordance with the fe o scattering differently the signal of fe fe of fhy fa samples was stronger than that of fhy sample which indicated that the grain size of the sample might increase it was probably because the bridging effect of fa made adjacent ferrihydrite unit cells more interconnecting debye waller factors of first and second fe shells in fhy fa sample 43 3 7 6 and 22 1 19 7 were significantly higher than that of fhy sample 15 9 3 6 and 13 6 6 9 which meant the spatial structure of fe in fhy became more disordered it was likely that the presence of fa disordered the arrangement of ferrihydrite unit cell to weaken the nucleation of ferrihydrite and prevented it from transforming into crystalline iron oxides dft calculations were used to simulate the adsorption complex models of fe ii and fhy with or without fa to simplify the calculations fe oh 6 3 was used as geometrical model to represent the hexa coordinate fe o bond of fhy karlsson and persson 2012 c mikutta 2011 low molecular weight hydroxybenzoic acids were served as model substances for fa because they had the same dominating functional groups e g carboxyl and phenol groups c mikutta 2011 fe oh 2 was used as fe ii model due to the precipitation of fe ii in the neutral environment after optimizing the geometry structure of fa fe oh 2 and fhy their most stable states with lowest energy were obtained fig s4 as shown in fig 7a the adsorption of fe oh 2 on the surface of fhy did not break the structure of fe oh 2 and fhy but just made the bond angle and bond distance of o fe o of fe oh 2 changed after frequency calculations the adsorption energy of fe ii between fhy was 1 40 ev differently the adsorption of fa on the surface of fhy changed the structures of fa and fhy as a result it formed a five membered chelate ring via a bidentate structure then generated two molecules of h2o by identifying the label of o atom fig s4 it was confirmed that the o of h2o was originated from the oh of fhy the bidentate structure made the fa fhy complex more stable correspondingly it produced 2 87 ev adsorption energy which was higher than that of fe oh 2 fhy it meant that fa would be prior to adsorb on fhy compared to fe ii when they both existed in the environment fig 7c showed that the adsorption energy between fe ii and the fa fhy complex was 1 38 ev it indicated that the complex of fhy and fa could weaken the absorption of fe ii 3 3 potential mechanism of fa to affect mineral transformation of ferrihydrite in previous studies fe ii was considered as one of the most important factors to cause the transformation of ferrihydrite into more crystalline minerals boland et al 2014 hansel et al 2005 jones et al 2009 the main mechanism is ascribed that fe ii adsorbed on the surface of ferrihydrite releases an electron to the solid fe iii of ferrihydrite with itself oxidized to fe iii the newly formed fe iii has a lower energy than that of original ferrihydrite due to the energy lost during electron transfer resultantly it transforms into a relatively stable iron mineral such as goethite hematite and magnetite types of iron oxides depended on external circumstances as a result the electron generated on oxidation of the surface fe ii keeps hop from one fe iii atom to adjacent fe iii atom in ferrihydrite until the whole ferrihydrite are consumed boland et al 2014 namely fe ii is able to catalyze the transformation of ferrihydrite and the adsorption of fe ii on the surface of ferrihydrite is the inducement of the transformation of ferrihydrite in this study fa likely formed stable complexes with ferrihydrite via functional groups to occupy the reactive surface sites of ferrihydrite then decreased the opportunity of fe ii directly adsorbed on the ferrihydrite surface in addition fa also might combine with fe ii to keep it disperse in the liquid phase which was confirmed by the higher aqueous fe ii content and the dominant exchangeable and organic bonding iron species in fhy fa reactor fig 2a 3b it was ascribed that fa was able to capture the fe ii produced from the interface of ferrihydrite and cell during dir after it released to the liquid phase then the combination of fa and fe ii formed organic bonding iron to prevent fe ii to precipitate on the surface of ferrihydrite this might further retard the adsorption of fe ii and therefore alleviated the negative effects of fe ii on dir based on the above results we proposed a mechanism diagram of the effects of fa on the secondary mineralization of ferrihydrite as follows 3 4 microbial community analysis microbial community structure was analyzed to gain the microbial factors linked to the anaerobic performances as shown in fig 9 irbs were the dominant bacteria in all three reactors statistically about 23 types of irbs on the genus level were detected e g bacteroides clostridium desulfomicrobium geobacter etc li et al 2019 lovley and phillips 1988 park et al 2008 the total abundance of irbs accounted for 34 05 for control 41 88 for fhy and 54 99 for fhy fa respectively it meant that the total abundance of irbs was enhanced by 7 83 with ferrihydrite supplement and the addition of fa further increased by 13 11 the high abundance of irbs in fhy and fhy fa reactors accelerated the consumption of organic matters and utilized acetate prior to methanogenesis it was in agreement with the low concentration of acetate and methane production in fhy and fhy fa reactors at the archaea level the main methanogens detected in the reactors were methanosarcina methanospirillum and methanothrix maeder et al 2006 rotaru et al 2014 the addition of ferrihydrite and fa seemed not to change the abundance of methanosarcina which was ca 25 in all three reactors methanospirillum usually utilizing hydrogen and carbon dioxide as substrates to produce methane accounted for 7 51 24 44 and 40 86 of the abundance of the control fhy and fhy fa reactors respectively methanothrix was restricted to use acetate as substrates for methanogenesis whose abundance was 42 79 38 85 and 13 42 in control fhy and fhy fa reactors respectively it seemed that the abundance of acetate utilizing methanogens significantly decreased in fhy and fhy fa reactors due to the part of acetate utilized by dir instead hydrogen utilizing methanogens was enriched in the addition of ferrihydrite and fa the results indicated that the additon of fhy and fhy fa affected the methanogenesis process via changing its community structure in the real natural systems most of nom are more complicated than glucose used in this study which may lead to the different microbial community composition for example stern et al 2018 found that using nom as feed substrate enriched a more diverse microbial community related to decomposing complex organic carbon e g spirochaetes bacteroidetes firmicutes and chloroflexi on phyla level than glucose yan and zhou 2019 further demonstrated that the presence of ferrihydrite and humic substances stimulated the degradation of refractory compounds via enhancement of dir that might produce more simple substrates available for the potential methanogenesis or other microbial metabolisms it implied that the roles of dir in producing simple substrates available for methanogenesis and in competing with methanogenesis for electron donors should be taken in account when evaluating the actual effect of hs mediated dir on inhibiting methane emission especially in the real natural systems 4 environmental significance to date numerous studies have highlighted the importance of fe iii reduction in controlling methanogenesis using ferrihydrite bond and lovley 2002 zhuang et al 2015 but the secondary mineralization of poorly crystalline ferrihydrite during the microbial reduction was frequently neglected such transformation could result in the formation of crystalline iron oxides that were more inactive in dir to weaken the inhibition of fe iii reduction on methanogenesis tang et al 2016 previous studies have shown that compared with pure ferrihydrite coprecipitates of ferrihydrite and organics are more uneasy to transform into crystalline phases cismasu et al 2011 shimizu et al 2013 here our results clarified that fa can cover on the surface of ferrihydrite and complexing with fe ii to decrease its catalysis in the transformation of ferrihydrite these observations may help explain why soils and sediments often contain substantial amounts of ferrihydrite like iron oxides our studies further showed that fa could both serve as electron shuttle to enhance dir and postpone the secondary mineralization of ferrihydrite then reduced the production of methane these two aspects might further alter the composition of the microbial community and affect the metabolic activity of microorganisms kulikova and perminova 2021 in this study the addition of fa increased the abundance of irbs and changed the community structure of methanogens with the results of hydrogen utilizing methanogens increased and acetate utilizing methanogens decreased fig 9 understanding the role of hs cooperated with fe iii reduction has profound environmental implications for example sediments wetland and paddy soil systems are the primary source of global methane emission where hs and iron oxides such as iron fertilizer poured on the paddy soil extensively existed catrouillet et al 2014 miller et al 2015 xu et al 2013 rational use of iron oxides and hs may reduce the conversion of organics to methane in these systems in engineered systems the effluent from anaerobic digesters usually contains quite high concentration of organic matters that are still potential to produce methane in the subsequent oxygen free processes such as sedimentation and anoxic tank which is an important source of methane emission but the methane is not collected from the economic standpoint due to the low energy density in addition municipal wastewater pipelines also contribute the greenhouse gas emission hs and fe iii as natural matters extensively exist in these systems but they are likely in an incompatible ratio to just forming complexation that enhances dir to reduce methane generation thus adjusting hs and fe iii in the these system may be a feasible measure to control the greenhouse gas emission since the

16000,reducing methane emission is of great importance to control the global greenhouse effect dissimilatory iron reduction dir coupling of organic matter decomposition may suppress methane production via reducing primary electron donors available for methanogenesis however during dir the amorphous iron oxides e g ferrihydrite are easy to transform into more stable crystalline iron minerals which slowdowns the rate of dir humic substance hs with redox activity has been extensively reported to facilitate dir via electron shuttles mechanism yet little known about the effect of hs on mediating the mineralization of iron oxides and the subsequent influences on dir and methanogenesis to clarify this ferrihydrite and fulvic acid fa as the model substance of hs were supplied to anaerobic methanogenesis systems results showed that fa could significantly decrease the formation of crystalline iron oxides enhance dir rate by 13 72 and suppress methanogenesis by 25 13 compared to ferrihydrite supplemented only by x ray absorption spectra analysis it was found that fa could complex with ferrihydrite via forming a fe c o structure on the second shell of fe atom quantum chemical calculation further confirmed that fa reduced the adsorption energy between fe ii and ferrihydrite our study suggested that rational use of hs to mediate mineralization pathway of iron oxides could efficiently improve the availability of iron oxides to drive dir and control the conversion of organics into ch4 in natural or engineered systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords iron reduction ferrihydrite humic substances greenhouse gas emission x ray absorption spectra quantum chemical calculation 1 introduction methane is a major component of greenhouse gasses whose greenhouse effect is 22 times greater than that of carbon dioxide neubauer and megonigal 2019 in natural environment methane is mainly produced by methanogens through the metabolism of organic carbon e g acetic acid or carbon dioxide it accounts for ca 69 of the total annual flux of global methane into the atmosphere zhang et al 2019 up to now the interactions between methane emission and climate change have been well understood while the regulating method especially biogeochemical controls on methane fluxes are less so miller et al 2015 serreze and barry 2011 dissimilatory iron reduction dir namely the reduction of fe iii to fe ii coupled with the oxidization of organic carbon by iron reducing bacteria irb plays a crucial role in iron and carbon cycles lovley and anderson 2000 pan et al 2016 for instance natural organic carbon oc often forms stable bonds with iron oxides to preserve the c loss of soil dir can potentially weaken or break down the associations between fe iii and oc then release fe iii bound oc into environment or directly decompose it via microbial degradation knorr 2013 previous studies reported that dir also can dissolve fe iii oxides and produce fe ii leading to mineral phase transformations of fe iii to generate secondary minerals e g magnetite goethite lepidocrocite siderite and akaganeite adhikari et al 2017 more importantly fe iii reduction is thermodynamically more favorable to methanogenesis which makes dir able to suppress methane emission via competing for the primary electron donors for methanogens lovley and phillips 1987 ferrihydrite a ubiquitously iron oxide that exists in soils and sediments has a higher dir capacity than crystalline iron oxides e g hematite or magnetite due to its higher redox potential bird et al 2011 wang et al 2017 2019 however ferrihydrite with poorly crystalline structure is thermodynamically unstable which easily causes the secondary mineralization to transform into more stable crystalline iron minerals cismasu et al 2016 fu et al 2016 zhuang et al 2015 the crystalline iron oxides with low solubility cannot disperse well in aquatic systems that leads to insufficient contact with irb also the low bioavailability and redox potential of these crystalline iron oxides make the fe iii reduction difficult as a result the formation of the crystalline iron oxides may slow down and even hold up the process of dir to weaken the competition with methanogenesis aeppli et al 2019 notini et al 2019 moreover the crystalline iron minerals with semi conductivity are reported to serve as conduits for electric syntrophy between geobacter and methanogens to accelerate the generation of methane via direct interspecies electron transfer diet cruz viggi et al 2014 song et al 2019 storck et al 2016 these findings imply that the changes in mineralogical properties of iron oxides greatly affect the methane generation thus preventing the secondary mineralization of ferrihydrite is a key measure to curb methane emission in soils and aquatic environments ferrihydrite is frequently associated with natural organic matters nom the nom contains a variety of functional groups such as carboxyls phenols quinones and amines many of which strongly interact with fe ii fe iii to influence the reduction hydrolysis and solubility of fe humic substance hs as a kind of macromolecular nom with redox activity has been extensively reported to be capable of enhancing dir bond and lovley 2002 chen et al 2017 stern et al 2018 it is ascribed that hs may serve as electron shuttle to enhance the electron connection between irbs and iron oxides it especially facilitates the long distance electron transfer between cells and fe iii oxides to benefit dir stern et al 2018 also hs affected the mineral transformation of iron oxides for example colombo et al 2015 demonstrated that hs could inhibit crystal growth of fe ion leading to a decrease in crystalline iron oxides and promoting the formation of ferrihydrite shimizu et al 2013 also found that the addition of hs slowed down the formation of goethite and magnetite and increased the fe iii reduction rate however the potential mechanisms of how hs altered the mineralization pathway were not clear moreover subsequent influences of the transformation of iron oxides on dir and methanogenesis were often overlooked based on the above consideration ferrihydrite and fa a type of hs were introduced into anaerobic methanogenesis systems in this study with the aim to investigate the role of hs on methane emission via mediating dir the link between greenhouse gas emission and dir were monitored atomic force microscope x ray absorption spectra and quantum chemical calculation were used for deeply revealing the role of fa on preventing the secondary mineralization of poorly crystalline iron oxides 2 material and methods 2 1 synthesis of ferrihydrite minerals ferrihydrite fhy was synthesized via neutralization of 50 mm fecl3 6h2o solution with 0 4 m naoh to a ph around 7 then repeated washing centrifugation 8000 rpm for 10 min steps with deionized water for 3 times to remove excess ions adhikari et al 2017 chen et al 2014 fulvic acid tang et al 2014 fa purity 98 purchased from aladdin https www aladdin e com one of the hs which is soluble over the entire ph range was used as the model substance for hs the fhy fa coprecipitates were synthesized by adding 1 g l of fulvic acid to the fecl3 solution before neutralization 2 2 experimental setup the experiments on investigating competition of dir on methanogenesis were conducted in three parallel ad systems control reactor fhy reactor and fhy fa reactor using 250 ml serum bottles each bottle contained 10 ml of inoculum and 200 ml of feeding substrate the inoculum was collected from sediment of chunliu river dalian china then stored at 4 c before using the inoculum was digested for 7 days until biogas production ceased to consume its natural organic matters contained the initial composition of feeding substrate was as follows 0 3 g nh4cl 0 5 g l mgso4 0 1 g l cacl2 0 14 g l kh2po4 0 2 g l nacl 22 mm nahco3 and 10 mm nano3 5 mm glucose as carbon source was added into the reactors for microbial growth on day 0 14 and 28 to observe the mineral transformation of ferrihydrite more intuitively another two abiotic reactors with no inoculum added were set up abiotic fhy reactor and abiotic fhy fa reactor all parameters were the same as the above experiment except for 7 mm feso4 was injected into these two abiotic reactors to replace the fe ii generated from dir the concentration of ferrihydrite in all reactor was 10 mm all above experiments were triplicated 2 3 analytical methods the volume of biogas was equivalent to the headspace of serum bottles the ch4 and co2 proportion of biogas was measured by a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd tianmei gc 7900p tcd zhao et al 2015 every two days a 1 ml suspension sample was taken from the bottles for the detection of fe concentration in liquid phase another 1 ml sample containing both suspension and slurry was taken from the bottle after it was blended for the detection of total fe concentration in reactor to inhibit the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 1 ml 6 m hcl was added into the sample immediately after it was collected ferrous iron was analyzed by an adaptation of the ferrozine technique cooper et al 2000 the total iron content was determined by inductively coupled plasma icp optima 2000 dv perkinelmer the difference between the total iron minus the ferrous iron is the ferric iron concentration another 1 5 ml suspension sample was taken for short chain volatile fatty acids vfas detection vfas including acetate propionate butyrate and valerate were analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector fid tianmei gc 7900p fid jiang et al 2007 the reduced and oxidized state of fa was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer according to orsetti s method orsetti et al 2013 briefly the suspension was sampled from the fhy fa reactor the supernatant was collected through centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 10 min then transport into a quartz cuvette with an optical path length of 1 0 cm the cuvette was subsequently sealed in the anaerobic chamber and spectra range from 300 to 600 nm were recorded the eps of the inoculum were extracted using the cation exchange resin cer technique cer 20 50 mesh 732 001 7 according to frolund et al 1995 2 4 determination of fe mineral x ray diffraction xrd was applied to identify the crystalline iron phases presented in the all reactors the xrd diffractometer smartlab 9kw japan equipped a cu ka radiation and the test condition was at a voltage of 45 kv and

canfield 2005 tessier et al 1979 at the end of each feedstock stage a 5 ml mixture sample was taken from each reactor then process vacuum freeze drying 0 1 g dry sludge sample and 20 ml extracting solution were added to a 50 ml centrifuge tube then placed in a table concentrator with a vibration speed of 100 r min under 25 c after extraction the supernatant was transported into a test tube then using deionized water to wash residual sediment three times to collect supernatant in case of the loss of the sample afterward the residual was used for the next extraction step the detail extraction method of each step was described as follows i exchangeable and carbonate fe fraction was extracted by 20 ml 1 m sodium acetate ph was buffered to 5 with acetic acid for 24 h ii labile organic binding fe fraction was extracted by 20 ml 0 1 m sodium pyrophosphate na4p2o7 solution for 1 h after centrifugation and pouring out the supernatant another 20 ml pyrophosphate solution was added to repeat the extraction once again the supernatant from two extractions was combined iii easily reducible fe fraction including ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite were extracted by 20 ml 1 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride for 48 h the hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution was prepared by 25 acetic acid iv crystalline fe including goethite hematite and akaganeite fraction were extracted by 20 ml 0 29 m

collected at the singapore synchrotron light source ssls center c mikutta 2011 where a pair of channel cut si 111 crystals was used in the monochromator the fe k edge xanes data were recorded in a transmission mode fe foil were used as references the storage ring was working at the energy of 2 5 gev with an average electron current of below 200 ma the obtained x ray adsorption fine structure

support information the raw sequence files were submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive database under accession no prjna810363 3 results and discussions 3 1 methane decrease with ferrihydrite and fa supplemented methane generation was monitored to investigate the competition of dir with methanogenesis during the first 14 days first feedstock there was only carbon dioxide 1 mm with no methane generated in all reactors when another 5 mm glucose was added into reactors at day 14 methane started to produce and reached 0 41 0 04 0 20 0 03 and 0 10 0 01 mm in control fhy and fhy fa reactors respectively at day 28 the final day of the second feedstock it preliminarily showed the decrease of methane production with fhy and fhy fa added more obvious gas of methane was observed in the third feedstock at day 42 the cumulative methane production of three reactors was 1 67 0 15 1 28 0 15 and 0 48 0 12 mm respectively which meant that the methane production was suppressed by 23 19 with ferrihydrite added and adding fa further suppressed the methane production by 48 32 the analysis of residual organics in three reactors figure s1 and text s1 showed that more organic substances was consumed but less methane was produced in fhy reactors which suggested that the competition of dir with methanogenesis decreased the organic carbon flowing into methane addition of fa further strengthened this competition during dir organic carbon was converted into co2 and then the enhanced dir should lead to more co2 production reversely the actual production of co2 detected in fhy and fhy fa reactors was less than that of the control as shown in fig 1b the co2 production of the three reactors was 3 73 0 06 2 58 0 10 and 2 12 0 04 mm respectively which meant that co2 production in fhy and fhy fa reactors decreased by 30 73 and 43 23 in comparison to control respectively similar results were observed by xu et al 2019 who found the co2 emission was reduced with ferrihydrite addition in paddy soil it was ascribed that the dissolved co2 reacted with dir generated fe ii to form siderite feco3 then decreased the amount of gaseous co2 detected as shown in fig 2a biogenetic fe ii rapidly increased in the first 17 days which reached 0 09 0 01 0 38 0 04 and 0 82 0 01 mm in control fhy and fhy fa reactor respectively correspondingly the generating rate of fe ii in the liquid phase of three reactors was 5 54 23 57 and 53 04 μm day respectively data was based on day 2 17 meaning that the addition of fa increased the rate of dir by 125 it was ascribed that fa could act as electron shuttles to facilitate the electron transfer between cells and iron oxides as shown in fig s2 the peaks of uv vis absorption spectrum at 328 nm and 410 nm were referred to the oxidized and reduced state of fa respectively compared with the pure fa the supernatant from the fhy fa showed a stronger peak at 410 nm which indicated the fa accepted h and e from organics oxidation it also implied the potential of fa on serving as electron shuttles orsetti et al 2013 on day 18 the concentration of fe ii in the liquid phase started to decrease it was probably because that the dir generated fe ii precipitated on the surface of ferrihydrite then induced the transformation of ferrihydrite to decrease the dir rate as a result the speed of precipitation of fe ii was faster than that of dir generation when adding an extra carbon source on day 28 the concentration of fe ii did not increase again meaning that the dir process might have stopped and all the reactive ferrihydrite had been depleted at the end of the experiment the concentration of total fe ii in control fhy and fhy fa reactor was 1 65 0 17 7 01 0 25 and 8 25 0 30 mm respectively corresponding to the iron reduction rate of 76 26 for fhy and 89 98 for fhy fa respectively in summary the supplement of fa could increase both rate and extent of the dir process 3 2 fa inhibit secondary mineralization of ferrihydrite at the end of each feedstock a mixture sample was taken from the fhy and fhy fa reactors to analyze the composition of iron species as shown in fig 3 the main iron oxides of the two reactors were exchangeable including adsorption exchangeable and carbonate state which accounted for 49 02 1st 44 15 2nd and 38 01 3rd for fhy reactor and 50 80 1st 51 04 2nd and 56 18 3rd for fhy fa reactor during three feedstocks respectively xrd analysis fig 4 showed that siderite feco3 jcpds 83 1764 was the dominant iron species in fhy and fhy fa reactor which correspond to the carbonate state in exchangeable fe siderite was generated from the reaction of fe ii and dissolved co2 which was in agreement with the decreased gaseous co2 detected in fhy and fhy fa reactor organic bonding fe took second place of iron species which accounted for 30 88 1st 30 16 2nd and 29 93 3rd of the total content in fhy reactor and 38 64 1st 36 59 2nd and 32 79 3rd in fhy fa reactor respectively organic bonding fe in fhy reactor was formed from the combination of the fe including iron oxides and dir generated fe ii and organics such as extracellular polymeric substance eps secreted by microorganisms omoike et al 2004 when fa was added the abundant functional groups e g hydroxy and carboxyl of fa complexed with fe increased the content of organic bonding fe karlsson and persson 2012 the organic bonding structure helped alleviate the adsorption precipitation of fe ii on the surface of ferrihydrite to prevent from transformation from the first feedstock to the third feedstock the content of crystalline fe i e goethite and hematite in fhy reactor gradually increased from 4 35 to 12 06 and highly crystalline fe magnetite increased from 1 82 to 7 78 respectively it suggested that the reducible ferrihydrite had been gradually transformed into crystalline iron minerals that were more thermodynamically stable in contrast their contents maintained at 2 21 3 13 crystalline and 1 90 2 70 highly crystalline in fhy fa reactor which seemed substantially unchanged it indicated that fa could prevent the mineral transformation of ferrihydrite as mentioned above the formation of organic bonding iron with the eps 125 7 mg g vs in this study secreted by microorganism alleviated the crystalline transformation to eliminate the interference of eps another two abiotic experiments with and without fa was operated named abiotic fhy reactor and abiotic fhy fa reactor the experimental parameters were the same as the fhy and fhy fa reactors except for no microbial inoculum was added as shown in fig 4c the ferrihydrite added in the abiotic fhy reactor was gradually transformed into more crystalline iron minerals with the content of ferrihydrite decreasing from 56 80 to 21 19 correspondingly the summation of crystalline and highly crystalline fe increased from 37 35 to 77 04 and there were almost no exchangeable and organic bonding fe existed in abiotic fhy reactor 2 at the third feedstock when fa was added fig 4d most fe existed as organic bonding form accounting for 39 98 78 57 of the total iron in abiotic fhy fa reactor during the three feedstocks while the summation of crystalline and highly crystalline only accounted for 10 12 26 22 of the total iron it clearly showed that fa prevented the mineral transformation of ferrihydrite fig 5 showed the morphology transformation of ferrihydrite without microbial inoculation sample was taken from abiotic fhy and abiotic fhy fa reactors in the absence of fa ferrihydrite was dissolved then polymerized 12 h and finally formed new types of iron minerals 36 h the iron minerals continued to aggregate 120 h with the average size increasing from 20 to 50 nm over time according to the xrd analysis the globular iron oxides blue arrow belonged to magnetite figure s3 the needle like iron oxides red arrow were speculated to be goethite in contrast no obvious mineralization of iron oxides was detected and the peaks of magnetite of the samples in abiotic fhy fa reactor in xrd patterns was not as clear as that of abiotic fhy reactor the results were in agreement with fig 4 which further exhibited the role of fa on preventing ferrihydrite from the mineralization xafs was used to determine the coordination structure between ferrihydrite and fa the position of the main edge in the xanes region showed that fe iii was the predominant oxidation state in both fhy and fhy fa coprecipitates samples the weak absorption spectrum of pre edge 7114 0 ev combined with the strong absorption spectrum of main edge 7132 0 ev were resulted from the octahedral structure of ferrihydrite prietzel et al 2007 differently the main edge position of fhy fa shifted from 7132 5 ev to 7131 4 ev compared to fhy the reduction of fe iii was an electron capture process and the energy state of fe iii in fhy fa sample was nearer to fe ii than that of fhy sample the main edge of fe ii was around 7125 0 ev which suggested electron was easier to be captured karlsson and persson 2010 and 2012 also suggested that the chemical adsorption of organic matters on the surface of iron oxides might weaken the acting force of fe o by polarization it indicated a decreasing tendency of the oxidation valence of fe iii in fhy fa samples in another words the fe iii in fhy fa sample was easier to be reduced into fe ii fourier transforms fig 6b of exafs gave the information of coordination path bond distance r coordination number c n and disorder σ2 of fe in fhy and fhy fa samples according to the conventional exafs data fitting table 1 fe in fhy samples was coordinated by approximately six c n o atoms at distances of 1 96 0 01 å at the first shell it should be noted that c n and o atoms could not be distinguished explicitly by exafs but considering no c and n atoms in the pure fhy samples it could be ensured that the coordinated atom with fe was o only in contrast to fhy there was a new coordination shell formed at a longer distance of 2 12 0 04 å in fhy fa except for the six coordination numbers of fe o at the first shell it was identified as c n o atom which might originate from the functional groups such as carboxyl groups of fa that were complexed with fe similarly karlsson et al 2010 and 2012 found natural organic matter complexing with ferrihydrite might lead to a longer scattering fe c o distance in which carboxylates were the predominant functional groups for the complexation also this complexation suppressed the precipitation of fe iii in this study the carboxyl groups in fa might have a similar effect on complexing ferrihydrite to prevent ferrihydrite from adsorbing free fe ii and then alleviated the mineralization of ferrihydrite the wavelet wt analysis showed shell contributions of fhy and fhy fa samples more intuitively fhy and fhy fa samples showed similar first shell contributions which backscattering maxima was around 4 å 1 it was in accordance with the fe o scattering differently the signal of fe fe of fhy fa samples was stronger than that of fhy sample which indicated that the grain size of the sample might increase it was probably because the bridging effect of fa made adjacent ferrihydrite unit cells more interconnecting debye waller factors of first and second fe shells in fhy fa sample 43 3 7 6 and 22 1 19 7 were significantly higher than that of fhy sample 15 9 3 6 and 13 6 6 9 which meant the spatial structure of fe in fhy became more disordered it was likely that the presence of fa disordered the arrangement of ferrihydrite unit cell to weaken the nucleation of ferrihydrite and prevented it from transforming into crystalline iron oxides dft calculations were used to simulate the adsorption complex models of fe ii and fhy with or without fa to simplify the calculations fe oh 6 3 was used as geometrical model to represent the hexa coordinate fe o bond of fhy karlsson and persson 2012 c mikutta 2011 low molecular weight hydroxybenzoic acids were served as model substances for fa because they had the same dominating functional groups e g carboxyl and phenol groups c mikutta 2011 fe oh 2 was used as fe ii model due to the precipitation of fe ii in the neutral environment after optimizing the geometry structure of fa fe oh 2 and fhy their most stable states with lowest energy were obtained fig s4 as shown in fig 7a the adsorption of fe oh 2 on the surface of fhy did not break the structure of fe oh 2 and fhy but just made the bond angle and bond distance of o fe o of fe oh 2 changed after frequency calculations the adsorption energy of fe ii between fhy was 1 40 ev differently the adsorption of fa on the surface of fhy changed the structures of fa and fhy as a result it formed a five membered chelate ring via a bidentate structure then generated two molecules of h2o by identifying the label of o atom fig s4 it was confirmed that the o of h2o was originated from the oh of fhy the bidentate structure made the fa fhy complex more stable correspondingly it produced 2 87 ev adsorption energy which was higher than that of fe oh 2 fhy it meant that fa would be prior to adsorb on fhy compared to fe ii when they both existed in the environment fig 7c showed that the adsorption energy between fe ii and the fa fhy complex was 1 38 ev it indicated that the complex of fhy and fa could weaken the absorption of fe ii 3 3 potential mechanism of fa to affect mineral transformation of ferrihydrite in previous studies fe ii was considered as one of the most important factors to cause the transformation of ferrihydrite into more crystalline minerals boland et al 2014 hansel et al 2005 jones et al 2009 the main mechanism is ascribed that fe ii adsorbed on the surface of ferrihydrite releases an electron to the solid fe iii of ferrihydrite with itself oxidized to fe iii the newly formed fe iii has a lower energy than that of original ferrihydrite due to the energy lost during electron transfer resultantly it transforms into a relatively stable iron mineral such as goethite hematite and magnetite types of iron oxides depended on external circumstances as a result the electron generated on oxidation of the surface fe ii keeps hop from one fe iii atom to adjacent fe iii atom in ferrihydrite until the whole ferrihydrite are consumed boland et al 2014 namely fe ii is able to catalyze the transformation of ferrihydrite and the adsorption of fe ii on the surface of ferrihydrite is the inducement of the transformation of ferrihydrite in this study fa likely formed stable complexes with ferrihydrite via functional groups to occupy the reactive surface sites of ferrihydrite then decreased the opportunity of fe ii directly adsorbed on the ferrihydrite surface in addition fa also might combine with fe ii to keep it disperse in the liquid phase which was confirmed by the higher aqueous fe ii content and the dominant exchangeable and organic bonding iron species in fhy fa reactor fig 2a 3b it was ascribed that fa was able to capture the fe ii produced from the interface of ferrihydrite and cell during dir after it released to the liquid phase then the combination of fa and fe ii formed organic bonding iron to prevent fe ii to precipitate on the surface of ferrihydrite this might further retard the adsorption of fe ii and therefore alleviated the negative effects of fe ii on dir based on the above results we proposed a mechanism diagram of the effects of fa on the secondary mineralization of ferrihydrite as follows 3 4 microbial community analysis microbial community structure was analyzed to gain the microbial factors linked to the anaerobic performances as shown in fig 9 irbs were the dominant bacteria in all three reactors statistically about 23 types of irbs on the genus level were detected e g bacteroides clostridium desulfomicrobium geobacter etc li et al 2019 lovley and phillips 1988 park et al 2008 the total abundance of irbs accounted for 34 05 for control 41 88 for fhy and 54 99 for fhy fa respectively it meant that the total abundance of irbs was enhanced by 7 83 with ferrihydrite supplement and the addition of fa further increased by 13 11 the high abundance of irbs in fhy and fhy fa reactors accelerated the consumption of organic matters and utilized acetate prior to methanogenesis it was in agreement with the low concentration of acetate and methane production in fhy and fhy fa reactors at the archaea level the main methanogens detected in the reactors were methanosarcina methanospirillum and methanothrix maeder et al 2006 rotaru et al 2014 the addition of ferrihydrite and fa seemed not to change the abundance of methanosarcina which was ca 25 in all three reactors methanospirillum usually utilizing hydrogen and carbon dioxide as substrates to produce methane accounted for 7 51 24 44 and 40 86 of the abundance of the control fhy and fhy fa reactors respectively methanothrix was restricted to use acetate as substrates for methanogenesis whose abundance was 42 79 38 85 and 13 42 in control fhy and fhy fa reactors respectively it seemed that the abundance of acetate utilizing methanogens significantly decreased in fhy and fhy fa reactors due to the part of acetate utilized by dir instead hydrogen utilizing methanogens was enriched in the addition of ferrihydrite and fa the results indicated that the additon of fhy and fhy fa affected the methanogenesis process via changing its community structure in the real natural systems most of nom are more complicated than glucose used in this study which may lead to the different microbial community composition for example stern et al 2018 found that using nom as feed substrate enriched a more diverse microbial community related to decomposing complex organic carbon e g spirochaetes bacteroidetes firmicutes and chloroflexi on phyla level than glucose yan and zhou 2019 further demonstrated that the presence of ferrihydrite and humic substances stimulated the degradation of refractory compounds via enhancement of dir that might produce more simple substrates available for the potential methanogenesis or other microbial metabolisms it implied that the roles of dir in producing simple substrates available for methanogenesis and in competing with methanogenesis for electron donors should be taken in account when evaluating the actual effect of hs mediated dir on inhibiting methane emission especially in the real natural systems 4 environmental significance to date numerous studies have highlighted the importance of fe iii reduction in controlling methanogenesis using ferrihydrite bond and lovley 2002 zhuang et al 2015 but the secondary mineralization of poorly crystalline ferrihydrite during the microbial reduction was frequently neglected such transformation could result in the formation of crystalline iron oxides that were more inactive in dir to weaken the inhibition of fe iii reduction on methanogenesis tang et al 2016 previous studies have shown that compared with pure ferrihydrite coprecipitates of ferrihydrite and organics are more uneasy to transform into crystalline phases cismasu et al 2011 shimizu et al 2013 here our results clarified that fa can cover on the surface of ferrihydrite and complexing with fe ii to decrease its catalysis in the transformation of ferrihydrite these observations may help explain why soils and sediments often contain substantial amounts of ferrihydrite like iron oxides our studies further showed that fa could both serve as electron shuttle to enhance dir and postpone the secondary mineralization of ferrihydrite then reduced the production of methane these two aspects might further alter the composition of the microbial community and affect the metabolic activity of microorganisms kulikova and perminova 2021 in this study the addition of fa increased the abundance of irbs and changed the community structure of methanogens with the results of hydrogen utilizing methanogens increased and acetate utilizing methanogens decreased fig 9 understanding the role of hs cooperated with fe iii reduction has profound environmental implications for example sediments wetland and paddy soil systems are the primary source of global methane emission where hs and iron oxides such as iron fertilizer poured on the paddy soil extensively existed catrouillet et al 2014 miller et al 2015 xu et al 2013 rational use of iron oxides and hs may reduce the conversion of organics to methane in these systems in engineered systems the effluent from anaerobic digesters usually contains quite high concentration of organic matters that are still potential to produce methane in the subsequent oxygen free processes such as sedimentation and anoxic tank which is an important source of methane emission but the methane is not collected from the economic standpoint due to the low energy density in addition municipal wastewater pipelines also contribute the greenhouse gas emission hs and fe iii as natural matters extensively exist in these systems but they are likely in an incompatible ratio to just forming complexation that enhances dir to reduce methane generation thus adjusting hs and fe iii in the these system may be a feasible measure to control the greenhouse gas emission since the important role of hs mentioned above further studies of regulating the formation of hs in situ fe iii reduction or methanogenic system and developing hs like material cai et al 2020 klüpfel et al 2014 sun et al 2017 wang et al 2021 yuan et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 e g functional groups rich biochar to replace hs for use are warranted 5 conclusion dir is one of the major factors controlling methane production from natural environments it was well known that hs could mediate dir via serving as electron shuttles to realize the long distance electron transfer between cells and ferrihydrite our results further found that fa a type of hs could complex with ferrihydrite via forming a fe c o structure on the second shell of fe atom then reduced the adsorption energy of between fe ii and ferrihydrite it significantly prevented the secondary mineralization of ferrihydrite to maintain it at a high reductive reactivity our study proposed that rational use of hs to mediate mineralization pathway of iron oxides could efficiently improve the availability of iron oxide to proceed dir and control the conversion of organics into ch4 it also promoted a more comprehensive understanding of controlling the greenhouse gas emission in natural environment or engineered systems with abundant fe iii and hs existed author contributions mingwei wang carried out the major experiments and data

16001,harmful algal blooms habs have become a global issue affecting public health and water industries in numerous countries because funds for monitoring habs are limited model development may be an alternative approach for understanding and managing habs continuous monitoring based on grab sampling is time consuming costly and labor intensive however improving simulation performance remains a major challenge in modeling and current methods are limited to simulating phytoplankton e g microcystis sp anabaena sp aulacoseira sp cyclotella sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp and zooplankton e g cyclotella sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp at the genus level the traditional modeling approach is limited for evaluating the interactions between phytoplankton and zooplankton recently deep learning dl models have been proposed for solving modeling problems because of their large data handling capabilities and model structure flexibilities in this study we evaluated the applicability of dl for simulating phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels and zooplankton at the genus level our work was an explicit representation of the taxonomic and ecological hierarchy of the dl model structure the prerequisite for this model design was the data collection at two taxonomic and hierarchical levels our model consisted of hierarchical dl with classification transformer tf and regression tf models these dl models were hierarchically connected the output of the phylum class level model was transferred to the genus level simulation model and the output of the genus level model was fed into the zooplankton simulation model the classification tf model determined the phytoplankton occurrence initiation date whereas the regression tf model quantified the cell concentration of plankton the hierarchical dl showed potential to simulate phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels by producing average r2 and root mean standard error values of 0 42 and 0 83 log cells ml 1 respectively all simulated plankton results closely matched the measured concentrations particularly the simulated cyanobacteria showed good agreement with the measured cell concentration with an r2 value of 0 72 in addition our simulated result showed good agreement in peak concentration compared to observations however a limitation remained in following the temporal variation of tintinnopsis sp and bosmia sp using an importance map from the tf model water temperature total phosphorus and total nitrogen were identified as significant variables influencing phytoplankton and zooplankton blooms overall our study demonstrated that dl can be used for modeling habs at the phylum class and genus levels graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

dynamics in inland waters using data assimilation with a kalman filter although these efforts have contributed to advancements in algal bloom simulation limitations remain because of the complexity of algal dynamics which is dependent on multiple physical chemical and biological factors mcgillicuddy jr 2010 in addition previous studies focused on chlorophyll a simulation for quantifying habs kim et

compared to traditional ml agarap 2017 chaganti et al 2020 however these hab modeling studies focused on chlorophyll a and phytoplankton and at the phylum class level whereas the genus level has not

evaluated the applicability of dl for modeling phytoplankton at the phylum class level e g cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms and genus level microcystis sp anabaena sp aulacoseira sp cyclotella sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp as well as zooplankton at the genus level tintinnopsis sp and bosmina sp our work consists of an explicit representation of the taxonomic and ecological hierarchy of the machine learning model structure a dl model with a hierarchical structure was used which could transfer upper taxonomic rank information to lower phytoplankton and or to zooplankton simulation we interpreted the modeling results by extracting informative features and input variables chefer et al 2021 the objectives of this study were 1 to monitor phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels and zooplankton at the genus level in the nakdong river 2 to simulate the dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton using hierarchical dl and 3 to interpret the modeling results by identifying

drinking water management hur et al 2013 the nakdong river basin is the largest river basin in south korea with a drainage area of 23 647 km2 and main channel length of 510 4 km over the last 10 years the annual temperature and rainfall have averaged 15 c and 1 253 mm respectively with rainfall occurring intensively from june to september center 2020 seo et al 2021 the phytoplankton organisms observed at the phylum class level were cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae microcystis sp anabaena sp aulacoseira sp cyclotella sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp were observed at the genus level the zooplankton observed were tintinnopsis sp and bosmina sp samples were collected from october 2012 to december 2020 from the water surface sampling was conducted at a fixed site on the lower nakdong river 3 4 times per week the sampling point was near the water intake station which has been used as the drinking water supply the water samples were conserved using lugol solution final concentration of 5 which was injected into the samples immediately on site before they were transported to the laboratory depending on the density of cells 5 50 ml aliquots of fixed samples were condensed by overnight settlement phytoplankton and zooplankton were identified using an upright microscope at 200 400 magnification zeiss axioscope 2 oberkochen germany the daily flow rate and meteorological data

monsoon climate characteristics cha et al 2014 kim et al 2021 the hydrometeorological and water quality variables could influence the degree to which stream water is contaminated the rainfall and flow

bae and seo 2018 holm and armstrong 1981 to analyze the relationship between variables the correlation was drawn based on the pearson correlation coefficient this analysis was implemented using statistics and machine learning toolboxes in matlab 2021a 2 2 simulation of phytoplankton and zooplankton with the hierarchical deep learning model 2 2 1 deep learning with transformer models the transformer tf model is a state of the art deep learning model that extracts features from data strings fig 2 a this model was originally developed by google inc for language translation vaswani et al 2017 and has recently been applied in various fields such as hyperspectral imagery classification and earthquake detection he and chen 2019 mousavi et al 2020 nambiar et al 2020 the tf model contains one or several encoder layers that function in sequence the layers convert numerical representations of distinctive string elements and their combinations into individual features these features are mathematical objects that describe the interrelations between string elements both encoder and decoder layers contain sublayers that reduce ambiguity via normalization dimensionality reduction or random subsampling and other sublayers forming a classic feed forward neural network that uses the features as input and generate features that are more useful for recognition vaswani et al 2017 the purpose of the tf model is to include in encoders a sublayer implementing the multi head attention mechanism that mimics cognitive attention vaswani et al 2017 this mechanism adopts a neural network to transfer the input signal into three matrices query q key k and value v gong et al 2020 the attention layer is calculated as follows 1 a t t e n t i o n q k v s o f t m a x q k t d k v where d k is the dimensionality and softmax is the function that normalizes the neural network output to a probability distribution over the predicted output classes vaswani et al 2017 the advantage of the tf model is that it can pick up features that include string elements positioned relatively far from each other in addition to the attention layer the residual connection layer normalization and feed forward layer were employed in the tf model the residual connection transfers the output information into the next layer he et al 2016 while normalization is performed in the normalization layer with the means and variances of the input layer ba et al 2016 the feed forward layer converts the output from the previous layer into a one dimensional feature vector this layer uses a loss function to characterize the model error ioffe and szegedy 2015 in addition we used the drop out function to prevent overfitting dropout is a widely used and effective technique for preventing overfitting in neural networks ying 2019 more detailed explanations of the residual connection layer normalization layer and fully connected layer can be found in the supplementary materials additionally using the importance map we identified the factors that influenced plankton simulation the importance map illustrates the simulation results by highlighting important variables and was calculated using the attention weight from the tf model 2 2 2 structure of plankton models the phytoplankton and zooplankton simulation layouts are shown in fig 2b the simulation comprised three dl models based on taxonomy the phylum class level model genus level model and zooplankton model fig 2b these models were built depending on taxonomy level the phylum class level model simulated the dynamics of cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae fig 2b 1 the genus level model simulated the dynamics of microcystis sp anabaena sp aulacoseira sp cyclotella sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp fig 2b 2 and the zooplankton model simulated tintinnopsis sp and bosmina sp fig 2b 3 these models were hierarchically connected the output of the phylum class level model fig 2b 1 served as the input to the genus level simulation model fig 2b 2 the output of which was fed into the zooplankton simulation model fig 2b 3 hence each model had different input variables depending on the taxonomy level these three models received six hydrometeorological and seven water quality data as input variables to simulate the target plankton concentrations table 1 for example the phylum class model used six hydrometeorological and seven water quality data as input variables the genus level model used six hydrometeorological data and seven water quality data and the results from the phylum class model and zooplankton model included the plankton result from the phylum class and genus level model as well as hydrometeorological and water quality data we adopted the tf structure among dl models to simulate plankton and each model consisted of the classification tf and regression tf fig 2c the classification tf determined the target plankton occurrence initiation whereas the regression tf computed the cell concentration number of cells after the target plankton occurrence initiation using two tf structures with different roles could prevent bias in model training as many monitoring data points had values of zero indicating that no target plankton was present baek et al 2021b our study used the softmax function and mean square error mse as the loss functions for the classification and regression tf respectively fig s1 the softmax and mse functions are specialized for solving the classification and regression problem respectively chicco et al 2021 martins and astudillo 2016 the softmax function normalizes the value obtained from the previous layer to the probability distribution by assigning a value between 0 and 1 goodfellow et al 2016 whereas the mse function is used as a loss function in regression analysis srivastava et al 2014 the classification tf detected the occurrence of target plankton whereas the regression tf generated the number of target plankton cells when it occurred the classification tf produced a value of either zero or one zero indicated no occurrence and one indicated occurrence initiation the regression tf model then estimated the cell concentration when the classification tf model produced a value of one a detailed explanation of the softmax and mse is provided in the supplementary material we split the training and validation data sets based on the period and the proportion of training samples and testing samples was 2 1 model training was conducted with data collected from october 2012 to march 2018 whereas model validation was performed using data collected from april 2018 to december 2020 numerous ml dl and water quality modeling studies have used this approach for model training and validation baek et al 2019 cho et al 2016 lin et al 2016 yun et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 model development was performed using an intel xeon cp u e 52687w v4 at 3 00 ghz 128 gb ram and nvidia gtx 1080 ti these models were implemented with tensorflow 2 0 and a python based keras environment google brain mountain view ca usa 2 2 3 model optimization in our model we used seven hyperparameters batch size learning rate number of heads stack size dropout rate hidden unit and lookback which are described in table s1 the performance of the data driven model is influenced by the hyperparameters used in the model training step hutter et al 2015 to improve the model s performance we conducted hyperparameter optimization using the bayesian optimization method which can determine the optimal values of the parameter set in a relatively small number of steps shahriari et al 2015 this algorithm is based on a posterior distribution in the form of a gaussian function this distribution has been verified for hyper parameter optimization in various fields e g computer science environmental engineering hydraulics and algal bloom bhagat et al 2021 nofrizal et al 2021 tang et al 2022 victoria and maragatham 2021 this posterior distribution improves with each iteration when a new parameter set is evaluated the ranges of these parameters used for hyper optimization are listed in table s1 2 2 4 model performance evaluation the root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 were employed to assess the simulation performance moriasi et al 2007 and were determined as follows 2 rmse i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m 2 n 3 r 2 i 1 n y i

of observed values 3 results 3 1 monitoring results of phytoplankton and zooplankton the monthly variations in cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae acquired by monitoring from october 2012 to december 2020 are summarized in fig 3 the black dot and error bar indicate the mean and standard deviation of the cell concentration the cyanobacteria and green algae were correlated with the water temperature high concentrations of cyanobacteria and green algae were predominantly observed from may to august spring and summer in the nakdong river fig 3a in contrast the diatoms showed no seasonal variation fig s2 shows the monthly variations in phytoplankton at the genus level although the trends in phytoplankton were similar at the genus and phylum class levels the genus level showed higher variance compared to that of the phylum class level particularly the cell concentrations of microcystis sp anabaena sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp increased during the spring and summer seasons whereas aulacoseira sp and cyclotella sp showed no notable seasonality pattern monthly variations in zooplankton e g tintinnopsis sp and bosmina sp were not detected fig s3 table s2 shows a correlation with observed plankton environmental and methodological variables most planktons were correlated with water temperature without bosmina sp specifically cyanobacteria had a coefficient of correlation of 0 4 with water temperature total nitrogen was also correlated with cyanobacteria and diatom with coefficients of correlation of 0 34 and 0 33 respectively these results indicate that the water temperature and nitrogen are related to the life cycles of cyanobacteria and diatom 3 2 phylum class level simulations the simulated and observed cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae are shown in fig 4 overall the simulated time series results from the dl model were comparable to observations made at the study site the simulated concentrations of cyanobacteria and green algae were elevated during the summer season but decreased during the winter season the simulated concentrations of green algae were underestimated compared to observed concentrations in diatom simulations although diatoms showed no notable seasonal pattern the simulated temporal distribution was similar to the observed distribution the temporal patterns of cyanobacteria and green algae were predominantly controlled by water temperature high cell concentrations were observed in may and august however no cyanobacteria were observed during the winter unlike cyanobacteria and green algae diatoms were relatively insensitive to seasonal variations the model training at phylum class level gave r2 values of 0 78 0 45 and 0 49 and rmse values of 0 79 0 50 and 0 83 log cells ml 1 for cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae respectively table 2 the validation performance metrics at the phylum class level had r2 values of 0 72 0 48 and 0 21 and rmse values of 0 84 0 55 and 1 15 log cells ml 1 respectively the model performance for green algae and diatoms showed rmse values of 3 14 and 3 07 log cells ml 1 respectively 3 3 genus level phytoplankton and zooplankton simulation using hierarchical dl the hierarchical dl simulated six phytoplankton at the genus level microcystis sp anabaena sp aulacoseira sp cyclotella sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp fig 5 the simulated time series of microcystis sp anabaena sp aulacoseira sp and pediastrum sp aligned with the observations whereas the model showed worse performance in simulating cyclotella sp and eudorina sp specifically the simulated microcystis sp and aulacoseira sp showed good agreement with the measurements in terms of the peak cell concentration and peak position whereas the simulated concentrations of anabaena sp were underestimated the simulated pediastrum sp and eudorina sp followed the seasonal pattern showing an increase in summer june to august at the study site in addition zero concentrations were observed occasionally for all species except for microcystis sp and aulacoseira sp during the peak period fig s4 shows the temporal distributions of the simulated and observed zooplankton the simulated cell concentration was underestimated during the high concentration periods table 2 lists the metrics of the model performance for the genus level phytoplankton and zooplankton simulations training resulted in an r2 value of 0 45 and rmse value of 0 77 log cells ml 1 whereas validation gave an r2 value of 0 34 and rmse value of 0 91 log cells ml 1 table s3 lists the optimal hyperparameters from hyperparameter optimization the batch size was 8 64 learning rate was 0 001 0 0013 and dropout rate was 0 05 0 5 the optimal numbers of heads stack sizes and hidden units were 1 64 1 64 4 64 and 7 29 respectively 3 4 model interpretability based on importance map the importance map shows the feature maps of the tf model for phylum class level simulation fig 6 and genus level simulations fig 7 these maps were generated depending on the cell concentrations e g 5th 25th 25th 50th 50th 75th and 75th 95th percentiles regions with high values were regarded as important features in the map water temperature was an important variable for the growth of cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae with higher values compared to the other variables fig 6 specifically in cyanobacteria and diatom the importance value of the water temperature increased with increasing cell concentrations at the genus level discharge and water temperature prominently impacted the microcystis sp and anabaena sp simulations fig 7 a 1 and a 2 in anabaena sp the green algae and diatom affected this simulation results aulacoseira sp and cyclotella sp were influenced considerably by water temperature in the importance map of zooplankton rainfall and nh3 n were important variables fig 7 fig s5 8 present an important transition with lookback which can define the number of previous time steps for simulation for example if the lookback is five the model considers temporal information from the previous five days to the current simulation time although these maps showed a slight change in importance depending on lookback their effect was negligible on the model simulation compared to the transition of variables this result indicates that the change in the variable has a greater influence than lookback on the model simulation 4 discussion 4 1 monitoring results of phytoplankton and zooplankton we observed severe algal blooms of cyanobacteria and green algae that occurred in late spring and summer may to august fig 3a in the winter november to january cyanobacteria were not observed and green algae showed low concentrations these results are related to the water temperature as the growth of cyanobacteria and green algae predominantly depend on temperature butterwick et al 2005 pyo et al 2021 singh and singh 2015 in addition excessive nutrients from runoff create preferred conditions for the formation of cyanobacteria and green algae blooms chen et al 2011 paerl 1996 the diatoms showed no noticeable season dependent change because these organisms can tolerate temperature variations during growth elliott 2010 at the genus level the monthly trend in plankton was similar to that at the phylum class level specifically the cell concentrations of microcystis sp anabaena sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp showed a seasonality pattern oh et al 2007 and cirés et al 2013 found that microcystis sp and anabaena sp grew rapidly in the summer season because of the high water temperatures compared to in the other seasons the growth of eudorina sp is also accelerated by an abundance of light and nutrients in summer yang et al 2011 however aulacoseira sp and cyclotella sp can survive under low light and nutrient conditions resulting in unclear seasonal patterns chen et al 2014 malik and saros 2016 shafik et al 1997 in contrast to phytoplankton zooplankton e g tintinnopsis sp and bosmina sp showed no specific season dependent pattern fig s3 previous studies demonstrated that the dynamics of zooplankton are highly uncertain because of numerous ecological factors such as grazers that control algal and bacterial populations and fish that feed on zooplankton benedetti et al 2018 bollens and frost 1991 bruce et al 2006 dumitru et al 2001 in the correlation table the water temperature and nitrogen were related to the cell concentration of cyanobacteria diatom green algae and microcystis sp with coefficients of correlation greater than 0 3 table s2 numerous studies have verified that temperature and nitrogen influence plankton growth demir and kirkagac 2005 holligan et al 1984 solidoro et al 2005 4 2 phylum class level simulations compared to the observed plankton at the phylum class level the simulated results exhibited reasonable performance at the study site the simulated cyanobacteria and green algae increased during the summer season and decreased during the winter season this seasonal pattern was caused by changes in the water temperature and nutrient inflow bouterfas et al 2006 joehnk et al 2008 the model performance for cyanobacteria was similar to that of previous studies pyo et al 2021 reported an rmse value of 0 94 log cells ml 1 in the simulation of cyanobacteria populations using a convolutional neural network chirico et al 2020 achieved an rmse value of 0 83 log cells ml 1 in cyanobacteria simulations using a multiple linear regression model in addition our simulated showed good agreement in peak concentration compared to observations the model performance for green algae and diatoms in this work was superior to that of models in previous research by using rmse values of 3 14 and 3 07 log cells ml 1 for diatoms and green algae respectively pyo et al 2019 demonstrated that the numerical model may be limited for improving the model simulation of diatoms and green algae the simulation of green algae in model validation exhibited relatively low accuracy compared with other phytoplankton e g cyanobacteria and diatom table 2 this discrepancy may be caused by distinct ecological complexities depending on the species type chisholm et al 1980 gaidarenko et al 2019 nelson and brand 1979 particularly the model could not fully explain the appearance of peak concentrations of green algae simulated concentrations were underestimated compared to the observed concentrations this was because green algae were not detected during the summer season the dl model showed a limited ability to simulate sudden changes in green algae liu et al 2018 and pyo et al 2021 also encountered an underestimation problem in simulations of algae concentrations when using machine learning in diatom simulations although diatoms did not show a notable seasonal pattern the simulated temporal distribution was similar to the observed distribution this is because the vulnerability to water temperature differed depending on the cyanobacteria and diatom high cell concentrations were observed in may and august however no cyanobacteria were observed in winter unlike cyanobacteria diatoms were relatively insensitive to seasonal variations additionally most studies simulating algae in inland water focused on cyanobacteria and showed mediocre model performance for diatoms cha et al 2014 kim et al 2020 pyo et al 2021 pyo et al 2019 4 3 genus level phytoplankton and zooplankton simulation using hierarchical dl the simulated microcystis sp and aulacoseira sp showed good agreement with the measurements whereas the simulated concentrations of anabaena sp were underestimated the differences in performance among these species may be attributed to temporal features unique to each species the peak concentrations of microcystis sp anabaena sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp were observed in august and those of aulacoseira sp and cyclotella sp were observed in october and january in august our study site experienced warm water and stratified conditions which causes massive blooms of microcystis sp and anabaena sp because of growth acceleration jeong et al 2007 tekile et al 2015 pediastrum sp and eudorina sp also increased from june to august which is the summer season in addition zero concentrations were observed occasionally for all species except for microcystis sp and aulacoseira sp during the peak period this result indicates that these species are sensitive to environmental changes e g weather nutrients and ecosystems resulting in simulation uncertainty moss et al 2003 vanni and temte 1990 xu et al 2021 these algal species has species specific traits such as diazotrophy and buoyancy regulation microcystis sp can move in the water column through buoyancy regulation while anabaena sp is a diazotrophic species that is able to fix atmospheric nitrogen amorim et al 2020 borics et al 2000 rigosi et al 2014 rousso et al 2022 these features may explain their ability to thrive in warm or stratified conditions or during low nutrient availability zhao et al 2017 conducted a numerical simulation of microcystis sp colonies whereas millie et al 2014 and maier et al 2001b estimated the temporal distribution of microcystis sp and anabaena sp respectively using an artificial neural network they used machine learning and a numerical model resulting in a limited improvement in the simulation accuracy although the simulation results of cyclotella and eudorina were relatively close to the seasonal patterns the peak cell concentration was underestimated this is because zooplankton e g cyclotella and eudorina are influenced by ecological interactions e g predation prey and competition water quality variables e g nutrients and hydrometeorological factors e g weather and water flow barinova et al 2014 jeppesen et al 2011 previous studies of phytoplankton modeling focused solely on cyanobacteria species microcystis sp and anabaena sp other organisms found in algal blooms have not been evaluated creating a gap in existing knowledge hence this study pioneers research on the simulation of various phytoplankton and zooplankton in inland water environments using monitoring datasets and hierarchical dl models we demonstrated that the simulation tasks in various environmental fields are feasible by using a combination of rich data sources and dl approaches the high values of the hyperparameters related to transfer modeling indicate a need for a more complex transfer models and stronger computational power table s3 han et al 2021 huang et al 2020 the zooplankton simulations required higher values of these parameters demonstrating that these species had more complex dynamics than other species ng et al 2009 suggested that zooplankton have complex features in terms of diversity and coexistence with phytoplankton increasing the model complexity and uncertainty because of their mechanisms van donk and van de bund 2002 demonstrated that zooplankton is affected by numerous physical e g hydrometeorology and biological factors e g phytoplankton fish and aquatic plants that were not characterized in this study 4 4 model interpretability based on importance map water temperature had the greatest influence on the growth of cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae with higher importance value than the other variables fig 6 specifically in cyanobacteria and diatom the importance value of the water temperature increased with increasing cell concentrations thus a higher water temperature is preferred for bloom formation previous studies reported that water temperature is related to algal growth rate maier et al 2001a wang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 additionally cyanobacteria are sensitive to wind force which affects stratification and thus cell settling fig 6a kiørboe et al 1998 kopczyńska 2008 weyhenmeyer 1996 at the genus level water temperature and discharge prominently impacted the microcystis sp and anabaena sp simulations fig 7a 1 and a 2 these variables were related to the stratification phenomenon to provoke massive habs maier et al 2001a demonstrated that a change in discharge can inhibit the formation of algal colonies resulting in the mitigation of bloom events wind can restrict the formation of floating phytoplankton scum due to turbulent mixing webster and hutchinson 1994 choi et al 2020 observed that stratification was affected by discharge and water temperature jeong et al 2007 demonstrated that hydrological and meteorological changes influence the stratification and algal bloom our study site also frequently showed stratification phenomena jeong et al 2007 lee et al 2022 tekile et al 2015 in anabaena sp the green algae and diatom affected the simulation results holm and armstrong 1981 suggested that anabaena sp compete with green algae for nutrients in addition anabaena is sensitive to solar intensity o farrell et al 2001 and horn et al 2011 found that the intensity of solar radiation correlates with the cell growth of anabaena as the solar radiation intensity controls the light volume underwater aulacoseira sp and cyclotella sp were influenced considerably by the water temperature reavie et al 2017 demonstrated that an increase in water temperature can cause an increase in the concentration of cyclotella sp the wind speed was also the most important feature for the aulacoseira sp and pediastrum sp simulation whereas the solar duration and total phosphorous were highlighted in the eudorina sp simulation in the importance map of zooplankton rainfall and nh3 n were identified as important variables fig 7 choi et al 2011 and campbell 2002 found that the rainfall volume affects the dynamics of zooplankton by changing the water velocity condition our study showed that the nutrients and water temperature accelerated the bloom of plankton the water temperature was related to stratification when nutrients entered the water body through agriculture activity berger et al 2007 busse et al 2006 he et al 2019 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 although the modeling environmental ecosystem is complex and uncertain most previous studies have applied simple model structures e g one and two layer long short term memory and simple convolutional neural network jang et al 2021 jeong et al 2021 yun et al 2021 abbas et al 2021 applied two long short term memory models with different roles one long short term memory model generated flow and the other simulated the concentration of escherichia coli with the flow simulation result however their model performance was still limited in simulating e coli abbas et al 2021 hab modeling of inland water ecosystems should consider several environmental factors as well as symbiosis among different species our study simulated phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels and zooplankton at the genus level based on dl previous studies related to habs modeling focused on chlorophyll a and phytoplankton at the phylum class level but very few studies related to modeling at the genus level although our dl model showed a limited ability to improve the model accuracy in simulating plankton at the genus level its potential has been explored to simulate phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels as well as to analyze significant variables influencing phytoplankton and zooplankton blooms in addition the use of data driven models is limited for simulation with data outside of training amasyali and el gohary 2018 sarma et al 2021 the paucity of related research in this field can be improved by coupling data driven modeling statistical inference and physical models further research is needed to understand the water ecosystem between algae species as each species exhibits distinct ecological diversity and complexity chisholm et al 1980 gaidarenko et al 2019 the interactive relationship between species e g predation prey and competition should be considered along with additional ecosystem monitoring thereby improving the zooplankton simulation our study also suggested that dl using site specific and species specific information can be applied to simulate phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels and zooplankton at the genus level however to establish a data driven based hab modeling system the following challenges remain 1 the model must be optimized for the network structure to improve model performance and 2 a model structure that reflects ecological interactions e g prey competition predation and symbiosis is required 5 conclusions we applied regression and classification dl models with a hierarchical structure to simulate phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels and zooplankton concentrations our model was developed with an explicit representation of the taxonomic and ecological hierarchy of the dl model structure using the data collection at two taxonomic and hierarchical levels we performed plankton and zooplankton monitoring to train and validate the model from october 2012 to december 2020 the phytoplankton organisms observed at the phylum class level were cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae microcystis sp anabaena sp aulacoseira sp cyclotella sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp were observed at the genus level the observed zooplankton were tintinnopsis sp and bosmina sp the hierarchical dl showed the potential to simulate phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus level with average r2 and rmse values of 0 42 and 0 83 log cells ml 1 respectively all simulated plankton results followed the observed plankton and zooplankton particularly the simulated cyanobacteria showed good agreement with the observations with r2 of 0 72 the model had a limited ability to follow a steep change in the zooplankton concentration however most previously reported algal simulations on inland water focused on chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria whereas phytoplankton have not been widely examined at the genus level and zooplankton and limited species were analyzed therefore our model shows potential for exploring phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels and analyzing significant variables influencing phytoplankton and zooplankton the importance map of the model explained the simulation results by demonstrating the importance of the variables at the phylum class level water temperature and nutrients influenced the growth of cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae at the genus level water temperature and discharge prominently impacted the microcystis sp and anabaena sp simulations this study improves the understanding and management of habs which is important for reducing economic loss and public health damage further research can improve these models via continuous data acquisition the findings of this research are expected to improve the accuracy expendability and applicability of algal modeling using dl hence

16001,harmful algal blooms habs have become a global issue affecting public health and water industries in numerous countries because funds for monitoring habs are limited model development may be an alternative approach for understanding and managing habs continuous monitoring based on grab sampling is time consuming costly and labor intensive however improving simulation performance remains a major challenge in modeling and current methods are limited to simulating phytoplankton e g microcystis sp anabaena sp aulacoseira sp cyclotella sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp and zooplankton e g cyclotella sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp at the genus level the traditional modeling approach is limited for evaluating the interactions between phytoplankton and zooplankton recently deep learning dl models have been proposed for solving modeling problems because of their large data handling capabilities and model structure flexibilities in this study we evaluated the applicability of dl for simulating phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels and zooplankton at the genus level our work was an explicit representation of the taxonomic and ecological hierarchy of the dl model structure the prerequisite for this model design was the data collection at two taxonomic and hierarchical levels our model consisted of hierarchical dl with classification transformer tf and regression tf models these dl models were hierarchically connected the output of the phylum class level model was transferred to the genus level simulation model and the output of the genus level model was fed into the zooplankton simulation model the classification tf model determined the phytoplankton occurrence initiation date whereas the regression tf model quantified the cell concentration of plankton the hierarchical dl showed potential to simulate phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels by producing average r2 and root mean standard error values of 0 42 and 0 83 log cells ml 1 respectively all simulated plankton results closely matched the measured concentrations particularly the simulated cyanobacteria showed good agreement with the measured cell concentration with an r2 value of 0 72 in addition our simulated result showed good agreement in peak concentration compared to observations however a limitation remained in following the temporal variation of tintinnopsis sp and bosmia sp using an importance map from the tf model water temperature total phosphorus and total nitrogen were identified as significant variables influencing phytoplankton and zooplankton blooms overall our study demonstrated that dl can be used for modeling habs at the phylum class and genus levels graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

pediastrum sp and eudorina sp as well as zooplankton at the genus level tintinnopsis sp and bosmina sp our work consists of an explicit representation of the taxonomic and ecological hierarchy of the machine learning model structure a dl model with a hierarchical structure was used which could transfer upper taxonomic rank information to lower phytoplankton and or to zooplankton simulation we interpreted the modeling results by extracting informative features and input variables chefer et al 2021 the objectives of this study were 1 to monitor phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels and zooplankton at the genus level in the nakdong river 2 to simulate the dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton using hierarchical dl and 3 to interpret the modeling results by identifying

drinking water management hur et al 2013 the nakdong river basin is the largest river basin in south korea with a drainage area of 23 647 km2 and main channel length of 510 4 km over the last 10 years the annual temperature and rainfall have averaged 15 c and 1 253 mm respectively with rainfall occurring intensively from june to september center 2020 seo et al 2021 the phytoplankton organisms observed at the phylum class level were cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae microcystis sp anabaena sp aulacoseira sp cyclotella sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp were observed at the genus level the zooplankton observed were tintinnopsis sp and bosmina sp samples were collected from october 2012 to december 2020 from the water surface sampling was conducted at a fixed site on the lower nakdong river 3 4 times per week the sampling point was near the water intake station which has been used as the drinking water supply the water samples were conserved using lugol solution final concentration of 5 which was injected into the samples immediately on site before they were transported to the laboratory depending on the density of cells 5 50 ml aliquots of fixed samples were condensed by overnight settlement phytoplankton and zooplankton were identified using an upright microscope at 200 400 magnification zeiss axioscope 2 oberkochen germany the daily flow rate and meteorological data

bae and seo 2018 holm and armstrong 1981 to analyze the relationship between variables the correlation was drawn based on the pearson correlation coefficient this analysis was implemented using statistics and machine learning toolboxes in matlab 2021a 2 2 simulation of phytoplankton and zooplankton with the hierarchical deep learning model 2 2 1 deep learning with transformer models the transformer tf model is a state of the art deep learning model that extracts features from data strings fig 2 a this model was originally developed by google inc for language translation vaswani et al 2017 and has recently been applied in various fields such as hyperspectral imagery classification and earthquake detection he and chen 2019 mousavi et al 2020 nambiar et al 2020 the tf model contains one or several encoder layers that function in sequence the layers convert numerical representations of distinctive string elements and their combinations into individual features these features are mathematical objects that describe the interrelations between string elements both encoder and decoder layers contain sublayers that reduce ambiguity via normalization dimensionality reduction or random subsampling and other sublayers forming a classic feed forward neural network that uses the features as input and generate features that are more useful for recognition vaswani et al 2017 the purpose of the tf model is to include in encoders a sublayer implementing the multi head attention mechanism that mimics cognitive attention vaswani et al 2017 this mechanism adopts a neural network to transfer the input signal into three matrices query q key k and value v gong et al 2020 the attention layer is calculated as follows 1 a t t e n t i o n q k v s o f t m a x q k t d k v where d k is the dimensionality and softmax is the function that normalizes the neural network output to a probability distribution over the predicted output classes vaswani et al 2017 the advantage of the tf model is that it can pick up features that include string elements positioned relatively far from each other in addition to the attention layer the residual connection layer normalization and feed forward layer were employed in the tf model the residual connection transfers the output information into the next layer he et al 2016 while normalization is performed in the normalization layer with the means and variances of the input layer ba et al 2016 the feed forward layer converts the output from the previous layer into a one dimensional feature vector this layer uses a loss function to characterize the model error ioffe and szegedy 2015 in addition we used the drop out function to prevent overfitting dropout is a widely used and effective technique for preventing overfitting in neural networks ying 2019 more detailed explanations of the residual connection layer normalization layer and fully connected layer can be found in the supplementary materials additionally using the importance map we identified the factors that influenced plankton simulation the importance map illustrates the simulation results by highlighting important variables and was calculated using the attention weight from the tf model 2 2 2 structure of plankton models the phytoplankton and zooplankton simulation layouts are shown in fig 2b the simulation comprised three dl models based on taxonomy the phylum class level model genus level model and zooplankton model fig 2b these models were built depending on taxonomy level the phylum class level model simulated the dynamics of cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae fig 2b 1 the genus level model simulated the dynamics of microcystis sp anabaena sp aulacoseira sp cyclotella sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp fig 2b 2 and the zooplankton model simulated tintinnopsis sp and bosmina sp fig 2b 3 these models were hierarchically connected the output of the phylum class level model fig 2b 1 served as the input to the genus level simulation model fig 2b 2 the output of which was fed into the zooplankton simulation model fig 2b 3 hence each model had different input variables depending on the taxonomy level these three models received six hydrometeorological and seven water quality data as input variables to simulate the target plankton concentrations table 1 for example the phylum class model used six hydrometeorological and seven water quality data as input variables the genus level model used six hydrometeorological data and seven water quality data and the results from the phylum class model and zooplankton model included the plankton result from the phylum class and genus level model as well as hydrometeorological and water quality data we adopted the tf structure among dl models to simulate plankton and each model consisted of the classification tf and regression tf fig 2c the classification tf determined the target plankton occurrence initiation whereas the regression tf computed the cell concentration number of cells after the target plankton occurrence initiation using two tf structures with different roles could prevent bias in model training as many monitoring data points had values of zero indicating that no target plankton was present baek et al 2021b our study used the softmax function and mean square error mse as the loss functions for the classification and regression tf respectively fig s1 the softmax and mse functions are specialized for solving the classification and regression problem respectively chicco et al 2021 martins and astudillo 2016 the softmax function normalizes the value obtained from the previous layer to the probability distribution by assigning a value between 0 and 1 goodfellow et al 2016 whereas the mse function is used as a loss function in regression analysis srivastava et al 2014 the classification tf detected the occurrence of target plankton whereas the regression tf generated the number of target plankton cells when it occurred the classification tf produced a value of either zero or one zero indicated no occurrence and one indicated occurrence initiation the regression tf model then estimated the cell concentration when the classification tf model produced a value of one a detailed explanation of the softmax and mse is provided in the supplementary material we split the training and validation data sets based on the period and the proportion of training samples and testing samples was 2 1 model training was conducted with data collected from october 2012 to march 2018 whereas model validation was performed using data collected from april 2018 to december 2020 numerous ml dl and water quality modeling studies have used this approach for model training and validation baek et al 2019 cho et al 2016 lin et al 2016 yun et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 model development was performed using an intel xeon cp u e 52687w v4 at 3 00 ghz 128 gb ram and nvidia gtx 1080 ti these models were implemented with tensorflow 2 0 and a python based keras environment google brain mountain view ca usa 2 2 3 model optimization in our model we used seven hyperparameters batch size learning rate number of heads stack size dropout rate hidden unit and lookback which are described in table s1 the performance of the data driven model is influenced by the hyperparameters used in the model training step hutter et al 2015 to improve the model s performance we conducted hyperparameter optimization using the bayesian optimization method which can determine the optimal values of the parameter set in a relatively small number of steps shahriari et al 2015 this algorithm is based on a posterior distribution in the form of a gaussian function this distribution has been verified for hyper parameter optimization in various fields e g computer science environmental engineering hydraulics and algal bloom bhagat et al 2021 nofrizal et al 2021 tang et al 2022 victoria and maragatham 2021 this posterior distribution improves with each iteration when a new parameter set is evaluated the ranges of these parameters used for hyper optimization are listed in table s1 2 2 4 model performance evaluation the root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 were employed to assess the simulation performance moriasi et al 2007 and were determined as follows 2 rmse i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m 2 n 3 r 2 i 1 n y i

december 2020 are summarized in fig 3 the black dot and error bar indicate the mean and standard deviation of the cell concentration the cyanobacteria and green algae were correlated with the water temperature high concentrations of cyanobacteria and green algae were predominantly observed from may to august spring and summer in the nakdong river fig 3a in contrast the diatoms showed no seasonal variation fig s2 shows the monthly variations in phytoplankton at the genus level although the trends in phytoplankton were similar at the genus and phylum class levels the genus level showed higher variance compared to that of the phylum class level particularly the cell concentrations of microcystis sp anabaena sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp increased during the spring and summer seasons whereas aulacoseira sp and cyclotella sp showed no notable seasonality pattern monthly variations in zooplankton e g tintinnopsis sp and bosmina sp were not detected fig s3 table s2 shows a correlation with observed plankton environmental and methodological variables most planktons were correlated with water temperature without bosmina sp specifically cyanobacteria had a coefficient of correlation of 0 4 with water temperature total nitrogen was also correlated with cyanobacteria and diatom with coefficients of correlation of 0 34 and 0 33 respectively these results indicate that the water temperature and nitrogen are related to the life cycles of cyanobacteria and diatom 3 2 phylum class level simulations the simulated and observed cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae are shown in fig 4 overall the simulated time series results from the dl model were comparable to observations made at the study site the simulated concentrations of cyanobacteria and green algae were elevated during the summer season but decreased during the winter season the simulated concentrations of green algae were underestimated compared to observed concentrations in diatom simulations although diatoms showed no notable seasonal pattern the simulated temporal distribution was similar to the observed distribution the temporal patterns of cyanobacteria and green algae were predominantly controlled by water temperature high cell concentrations were observed in may and august however no cyanobacteria were observed during the winter unlike cyanobacteria and green algae diatoms were relatively insensitive to seasonal variations the model training at phylum class level gave r2 values of 0 78 0 45 and 0 49 and rmse values of 0 79 0 50 and 0 83 log cells ml 1 for cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae respectively table 2 the validation performance metrics at the phylum class level had r2 values of 0 72 0 48 and 0 21 and rmse values of 0 84 0 55 and 1 15 log cells ml 1 respectively the model performance for green algae and diatoms showed rmse values of 3 14 and 3 07 log cells ml 1 respectively 3 3 genus level phytoplankton and zooplankton simulation using hierarchical dl the hierarchical dl simulated six phytoplankton at the genus level microcystis sp anabaena sp aulacoseira sp cyclotella sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp fig 5 the simulated time series of microcystis sp anabaena sp aulacoseira sp and pediastrum sp aligned with the observations whereas the model showed worse performance in simulating cyclotella sp and eudorina sp specifically the simulated microcystis sp and aulacoseira sp showed good agreement with the measurements in terms of the peak cell concentration and peak position whereas the simulated concentrations of anabaena sp were underestimated the simulated pediastrum sp and eudorina sp followed the seasonal pattern showing an increase in summer june to august at the study site in addition zero concentrations were observed occasionally for all species except for microcystis sp and aulacoseira sp during the peak period fig s4 shows the temporal distributions of the simulated and observed zooplankton the simulated cell concentration was underestimated during the high concentration periods table 2 lists the metrics of the model performance for the genus level phytoplankton and zooplankton simulations training resulted in an r2 value of 0 45 and rmse value of 0 77 log cells ml 1 whereas validation gave an r2 value of 0 34 and rmse value of 0 91 log cells ml 1 table s3 lists the optimal hyperparameters from hyperparameter optimization the batch size was 8 64 learning rate was 0 001 0 0013 and dropout rate was 0 05 0 5 the optimal numbers of heads stack sizes and hidden units were 1 64 1 64 4 64 and 7 29 respectively 3 4 model interpretability based on importance map the importance map shows the feature maps of the tf model for phylum class level simulation fig 6 and genus level simulations fig 7 these maps were generated depending on the cell concentrations e g 5th 25th 25th 50th 50th 75th and 75th 95th percentiles regions with high values were regarded as important features in the map water temperature was an important variable for the growth of cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae with higher values compared to the other variables fig 6 specifically in cyanobacteria and diatom the importance value of the water temperature increased with increasing cell concentrations at the genus level discharge and water temperature prominently impacted the microcystis sp and anabaena sp simulations fig 7 a 1 and a 2 in anabaena sp the green algae and diatom affected this simulation results aulacoseira sp and cyclotella sp were influenced considerably by water temperature in the importance map of zooplankton rainfall and nh3 n were important variables fig 7 fig s5 8 present an important transition with lookback which can define the number of previous time steps for simulation for example if the lookback is five the model considers temporal information from the previous five days to the current simulation time although these maps showed a slight change in importance depending on lookback their effect was negligible on the model simulation compared to the transition of variables this result indicates that the change in the variable has a greater influence than lookback on the model simulation 4 discussion 4 1 monitoring results of phytoplankton and zooplankton we observed severe algal blooms of cyanobacteria and green algae that occurred in late spring and summer may to august fig 3a in the winter november to january cyanobacteria were not observed and green algae showed low concentrations these results are related to the water temperature as the growth of cyanobacteria and green algae predominantly depend on temperature butterwick et al 2005 pyo et al 2021 singh and singh 2015 in addition excessive nutrients from runoff create preferred conditions for the formation of cyanobacteria and green algae blooms chen et al 2011 paerl 1996 the diatoms showed no noticeable season dependent change because these organisms can tolerate temperature variations during growth elliott 2010 at the genus level the monthly trend in plankton was similar to that at the phylum class level specifically the cell concentrations of microcystis sp anabaena sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp showed a seasonality pattern oh et al 2007 and cirés et al 2013 found that microcystis sp and anabaena sp grew rapidly in the summer season because of the high water temperatures compared to in the other seasons the growth of eudorina sp is also accelerated by an abundance of light and nutrients in summer yang et al 2011 however aulacoseira sp and cyclotella sp can survive under low light and nutrient conditions resulting in unclear seasonal patterns chen et al 2014 malik and saros 2016 shafik et al 1997 in contrast to phytoplankton zooplankton e g tintinnopsis sp and bosmina sp showed no specific season dependent pattern fig s3 previous studies demonstrated that the dynamics of zooplankton are highly uncertain because of numerous ecological factors such as grazers that control algal and bacterial populations and fish that feed on zooplankton benedetti et al 2018 bollens and frost 1991 bruce et al 2006 dumitru et al 2001 in the correlation table the water temperature and nitrogen were related to the cell concentration of cyanobacteria diatom green algae and microcystis sp with coefficients of correlation greater than 0 3 table s2 numerous studies have verified that temperature and nitrogen influence plankton growth demir and kirkagac 2005 holligan et al 1984 solidoro et al 2005 4 2 phylum class level simulations compared to the observed plankton at the phylum class level the simulated results exhibited reasonable performance at the study site the simulated cyanobacteria and green algae increased during the summer season and decreased during the winter season this seasonal pattern was caused by changes in the water temperature and nutrient inflow bouterfas et al 2006 joehnk et al 2008 the model performance for cyanobacteria was similar to that of previous studies pyo et al 2021 reported an rmse value of 0 94 log cells ml 1 in the simulation of cyanobacteria populations using a convolutional neural network chirico et al 2020 achieved an rmse value of 0 83 log cells ml 1 in cyanobacteria simulations using a multiple linear regression model in addition our simulated showed good agreement in peak concentration compared to observations the model performance for green algae and diatoms in this work was superior to that of models in previous research by using rmse values of 3 14 and 3 07 log cells ml 1 for diatoms and green algae respectively pyo et al 2019 demonstrated that the numerical model may be limited for improving the model simulation of diatoms and green algae the simulation of green algae in model validation exhibited relatively low accuracy compared with other phytoplankton e g cyanobacteria and diatom table 2 this discrepancy may be caused by distinct ecological complexities depending on the species type chisholm et al 1980 gaidarenko et al 2019 nelson and brand 1979 particularly the model could not fully explain the appearance of peak concentrations of green algae simulated concentrations were underestimated compared to the observed concentrations this was because green algae were not detected during the summer season the dl model showed a limited ability to simulate sudden changes in green algae liu et al 2018 and pyo et al 2021 also encountered an underestimation problem in simulations of algae concentrations when using machine learning in diatom simulations although diatoms did not show a notable seasonal pattern the simulated temporal distribution was similar to the observed distribution this is because the vulnerability to water temperature differed depending on the cyanobacteria and diatom high cell concentrations were observed in may and august however no cyanobacteria were observed in winter unlike cyanobacteria diatoms were relatively insensitive to seasonal variations additionally most studies simulating algae in inland water focused on cyanobacteria and showed mediocre model performance for diatoms cha et al 2014 kim et al 2020 pyo et al 2021 pyo et al 2019 4 3 genus level phytoplankton and zooplankton simulation using hierarchical dl the simulated microcystis sp and aulacoseira sp showed good agreement with the measurements whereas the simulated concentrations of anabaena sp were underestimated the differences in performance among these species may be attributed to temporal features unique to each species the peak concentrations of microcystis sp anabaena sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp were observed in august and those of aulacoseira sp and cyclotella sp were observed in october and january in august our study site experienced warm water and stratified conditions which causes massive blooms of microcystis sp and anabaena sp because of growth acceleration jeong et al 2007 tekile et al 2015 pediastrum sp and eudorina sp also increased from june to august which is the summer season in addition zero concentrations were observed occasionally for all species except for microcystis sp and aulacoseira sp during the peak period this result indicates that these species are sensitive to environmental changes e g weather nutrients and ecosystems resulting in simulation uncertainty moss et al 2003 vanni and temte 1990 xu et al 2021 these algal species has species specific traits such as diazotrophy and buoyancy regulation microcystis sp can move in the water column through buoyancy regulation while anabaena sp is a diazotrophic species that is able to fix atmospheric nitrogen amorim et al 2020 borics et al 2000 rigosi et al 2014 rousso et al 2022 these features may explain their ability to thrive in warm or stratified conditions or during low nutrient availability zhao et al 2017 conducted a numerical simulation of microcystis sp colonies whereas millie et al 2014 and maier et al 2001b estimated the temporal distribution of microcystis sp and anabaena sp respectively using an artificial neural network they used machine learning and a numerical model resulting in a limited improvement in the simulation accuracy although the simulation results of cyclotella and eudorina were relatively close to the seasonal patterns the peak cell concentration was underestimated this is because zooplankton e g cyclotella and eudorina are influenced by ecological interactions e g predation prey and competition water quality variables e g nutrients and hydrometeorological factors e g weather and water flow barinova et al 2014 jeppesen et al 2011 previous studies of phytoplankton modeling focused solely on cyanobacteria species microcystis sp and anabaena sp other organisms found in algal blooms have not been evaluated creating a gap in existing knowledge hence this study pioneers research on the simulation of various phytoplankton and zooplankton in inland water environments using monitoring datasets and hierarchical dl models we demonstrated that the simulation tasks in various environmental fields are feasible by using a combination of rich data sources and dl approaches the high values of the hyperparameters related to transfer modeling indicate a need for a more complex transfer models and stronger computational power table s3 han et al 2021 huang et al 2020 the zooplankton simulations required higher values of these parameters demonstrating that these species had more complex dynamics than other species ng et al 2009 suggested that zooplankton have complex features in terms of diversity and coexistence with phytoplankton increasing the model complexity and uncertainty because of their mechanisms van donk and van de bund 2002 demonstrated that zooplankton is affected by numerous physical e g hydrometeorology and biological factors e g phytoplankton fish and aquatic plants that were not characterized in this study 4 4 model interpretability based on importance map water temperature had the greatest influence on the growth of cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae with higher importance value than the other variables fig 6 specifically in cyanobacteria and diatom the importance value of the water temperature increased with increasing cell concentrations thus a higher water temperature is preferred for bloom formation previous studies reported that water temperature is related to algal growth rate maier et al 2001a wang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 additionally cyanobacteria are sensitive to wind force which affects stratification and thus cell settling fig 6a kiørboe et al 1998 kopczyńska 2008 weyhenmeyer 1996 at the genus level water temperature and discharge prominently impacted the microcystis sp and anabaena sp simulations fig 7a 1 and a 2 these variables were related to the stratification phenomenon to provoke massive habs maier et al 2001a demonstrated that a change in discharge can inhibit the formation of algal colonies resulting in the mitigation of bloom events wind can restrict the formation of floating phytoplankton scum due to turbulent mixing webster and hutchinson 1994 choi et al 2020 observed that stratification was affected by discharge and water temperature jeong et al 2007 demonstrated that hydrological and meteorological changes influence the stratification and algal bloom our study site also frequently showed stratification phenomena jeong et al 2007 lee et al 2022 tekile et al 2015 in anabaena sp the green algae and diatom affected the simulation results holm and armstrong 1981 suggested that anabaena sp compete with green algae for nutrients in addition anabaena is sensitive to solar intensity o farrell et al 2001 and horn et al 2011 found that the intensity of solar radiation correlates with the cell growth of anabaena as the solar radiation intensity controls the light volume underwater aulacoseira sp and cyclotella sp were influenced considerably by the water temperature reavie et al 2017 demonstrated that an increase in water temperature can cause an increase in the concentration of cyclotella sp the wind speed was also the most important feature for the aulacoseira sp and pediastrum sp simulation whereas the solar duration and total phosphorous were highlighted in the eudorina sp simulation in the importance map of zooplankton rainfall and nh3 n were identified as important variables fig 7 choi et al 2011 and campbell 2002 found that the rainfall volume affects the dynamics of zooplankton by changing the water velocity condition our study showed that the nutrients and water temperature accelerated the bloom of plankton the water temperature was related to stratification when nutrients entered the water body through agriculture activity berger et al 2007 busse et al 2006 he et al 2019 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 although the modeling environmental ecosystem is complex and uncertain most previous studies have applied simple model structures e g one and two layer long short term memory and simple convolutional neural network jang et al 2021 jeong et al 2021 yun et al 2021 abbas et al 2021 applied two long short term memory models with different roles one long short term memory model generated flow and the other simulated the concentration of escherichia coli with the flow simulation result however their model performance was still limited in simulating e coli abbas et al 2021 hab modeling of inland water ecosystems should consider several environmental factors as well as symbiosis among different species our study simulated phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels and zooplankton at the genus level based on dl previous studies related to habs modeling focused on chlorophyll a and phytoplankton at the phylum class level but very few studies related to modeling at the genus level although our dl model showed a limited ability to improve the model accuracy in simulating plankton at the genus level its potential has been explored to simulate phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels as well as to analyze significant variables influencing phytoplankton and zooplankton blooms in addition the use of data driven models is limited for simulation with data outside of training amasyali and el gohary 2018 sarma et al 2021 the paucity of related research in this field can be improved by coupling data driven modeling statistical inference and physical models further research is needed to understand the water ecosystem between algae species as each species exhibits distinct ecological diversity and complexity chisholm et al 1980 gaidarenko et al 2019 the interactive relationship between species e g predation prey and competition should be considered along with additional ecosystem monitoring thereby improving the zooplankton simulation our study also suggested that dl using site specific and species specific information can be applied to simulate phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels and zooplankton at the genus level however to establish a data driven based hab modeling system the following challenges remain 1 the model must be optimized for the network structure to improve model performance and 2 a model structure that reflects ecological interactions e g prey competition predation and symbiosis is required 5 conclusions we applied regression and classification dl models with a hierarchical structure to simulate phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels and zooplankton concentrations our model was developed with an explicit representation of the taxonomic and ecological hierarchy of the dl model structure using the data collection at two taxonomic and hierarchical levels we performed plankton and zooplankton monitoring to train and validate the model from october 2012 to december 2020 the phytoplankton organisms observed at the phylum class level were cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae microcystis sp anabaena sp aulacoseira sp cyclotella sp pediastrum sp and eudorina sp were observed at the genus level the observed zooplankton were tintinnopsis sp and bosmina sp the hierarchical dl showed the potential to simulate phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus level with average r2 and rmse values of 0 42 and 0 83 log cells ml 1 respectively all simulated plankton results followed the observed plankton and zooplankton particularly the simulated cyanobacteria showed good agreement with the observations with r2 of 0 72 the model had a limited ability to follow a steep change in the zooplankton concentration however most previously reported algal simulations on inland water focused on chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria whereas phytoplankton have not been widely examined at the genus level and zooplankton and limited species were analyzed therefore our model shows potential for exploring phytoplankton at the phylum class and genus levels and analyzing significant variables influencing phytoplankton and zooplankton the importance map of the model explained the simulation results by demonstrating the importance of the variables at the phylum class level water temperature and nutrients influenced the growth of cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae at the genus level water temperature and discharge prominently impacted the microcystis sp and anabaena sp simulations this study improves the understanding and management of habs which is important for reducing economic loss and public health damage further research can improve these models via continuous data acquisition the findings of this research are expected to improve the accuracy expendability and applicability of algal modeling using dl hence

16002,coupling the cultivation of microalgae with wastewater treatment is a promising technology to recover bioresources from wastewater however toxic pollutants in wastewater seriously inhibit the growth of microalgae and the removal of pollutants phenolic acids are similar to phytohormones could potentially relieve the toxicity to microalgae and simultaneously promote pollutant degradation and lipid accumulation chlorella and 4 chlorophenol 4 cp were utilized to simulate the toxic wastewater treatment and the roles of two typical phenolic acids such as p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba and caffeic acid ca were explored the 0 2 μm concentration of p hba or ca improved the specific growth rate by 7 6 by enhancing photosynthesis and dna replication the oxidative damage caused by 4 cp was reduced by 30 3 49 7 via the synthesis of more antioxidant enzymes and the direct scavenging of free radicals by phenolic acids furthermore the 4 cp removal rate increased by 27 0 and toxic 4 cp was degraded into non toxic compounds the phenolic acids did not change the 4 cp degradation pathway but accelerated its removal and detoxification by enhancing the expression of 4 cp degradation enzymes simultaneously lipid production increased by 20 5 23 1 due to the upregulation of enzymes related to fatty acid and triacylglycerol synthesis trace phenolic acids stimulated the mitogen activated protein kinase signaling cascade and the calcium signaling pathway to regulate the physiology of the microalgae and protect cells from toxic stress this study provides a promising new strategy for toxic wastewater treatment and bioresource recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phytohormone p hydroxybenzoic acid microalgae chlorophenol degradation signaling pathway 1 introduction microalgae based wastewater treatment and bioresource recovery is an eco friendly and sustainable technology that has been utilized for various types of wastewater such as municipal wastewater brewery wastewater swine wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater sharma et al 2022 microalgae use nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater to grow and produce high value bioresources including biodiesel salama et al 2017 shahid et al 2020 microalgae have been cultivated in wastewater and biomass productivity was 0 64 14 80 g l d depending on the species salama et al 2017 furthermore many studies have reported that microalgae including chlorella regularis chlorella pyrenoidosa and scenedesmus obliquus degrade organic pollutants such as personal care products pharmaceuticals pesticides and industrial products dayana priyadharshini et al 2021 hena et al 2021 chlorophenols cps are widely used to manufacture biocides pharmaceuticals and industrial products kayan et al 2021 about 59 8 tons of volatile phenols are discharged as wastewater every year in china according to 2020 data from the national bureau of statistics 2021 cps are universal pollutants in nature as they have been widely detected in surface water groundwater sediment ambient air soil and the human body at ng μg l levels olaniran and igbinosa 2011 schmied tobies et al 2021 due to their highly toxic mutagenic carcinogenic and persistent properties cps are regarded as priority pollutants by the world health organization and the united states environmental protection agency long et al 2020 nowak and mrozik 2018 most microalgae are sensitive to toxic pollutants in wastewater and cps can decrease the rate of photosynthesis which inhibits the growth of microalgae and causes cellular oxidative damage papazi et al 2019 supplementing with phytohormones is an effective strategy to improve the physiology of microalgae and enhance their tolerance to abiotic stress stirk and van staden 2020 zhao et al 2019b phytohormones regulate cell growth metabolism and development in plants and microalgae at extremely low levels μm mm and are regarded as signaling molecules stirk and van staden 2020 many phytohormones and analogs such as auxin melatonin gibberellin and jasmonic acid alleviate intracellular oxidative stress maintain growth and improve lipid production of microalgae under abiotic stress li et al 2017a yu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019b most studies have focused on the role of phytohormones in improving lipid production of microalgae under adverse conditions such as nitrogen starvation or high light intensity li et al 2017a yu et al 2018 but neglected the regulation of exogenous phytohormones in microalgae exposed to toxic pollutants several phenolic acids e g salicylic acid have similar functions as phytohormones as they are capable of regulating the growth and metabolism of microalgae behera et al 2021 phenolic acids can be divided into two categories of hydroxybenzoic acids and hydroxycinnamic acids the former include p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba salicylic acid protocatechuic acid and gallic acid whereas the latter include caffeic acid ca p coumaric acid ferulic acid and sinapic acid marchiosi et al 2020 many studies have reported the detection of phenolic acids in microalgae and their outstanding antioxidant capacity to scavenge free radicals korzeniowska et al 2020 vo dinh et al 2018 phenolic acids trigger lipid production similar to phytohormones esakkimuthu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 in addition phenolic acids also effectively relieve the inhibition of photosystem ii ps ii and protect plants from oxidative damage caused by abiotic stress arikan et al 2021 guan et al 2020 therefore we hypothesized that phenolic acids would improve the antioxidant capacity of microalgae under toxic pollutant stress and promote the production of biomass and lipids we also examined whether phenolic acids regulate microalgal growth and metabolism to defend against cp stress p hba and ca as representatives of the two different categories of phenolic acids were utilized in the present study to explore the hypothesis that trace phenolic acids promote chlorella to simultaneously degrade cps and produce biofuel the effects of the phenolic acids on microalgal growth cp degradation and lipid production were also determined in particular photosynthesis dna replication antioxidant defense the toxicity of intermediates degradation pathways and signaling regulation were investigated to reveal the mechanism of the phenolic acids in microalgae under toxic pollutant stress this study will provide new insight into the protective effect of phenolic acids on microalgae from toxic stress and will provide a promising strategy for toxic wastewater treatment and bioresource recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions 2 1 1 microalgal strain and chemicals chlorella regularis fachb 729 was used in this study and was purchased from the freshwater algae culture collection of the institute of hydrobiology wuhan china c regularis was purified and rejuvenated according to the methods described in our previous work zhou et al 2017 4 chlorophenol 4 cp cas 106 48 9 p hba cas 99 96 7 and ca cas 331 39 5 were purchased from sigma aldrich usa the three chemicals were dissolved in milli q water and their concentrations were 5 mg l 4 cp 0 2 μm p hba and 0 2 μm ca respectively the concentration of 4 cp used in this study was similar to that found in pesticide wastewater sanni et al 2022 and a 1 10 mg l concentration has been typically used to simulate chlorophenol wastewater li et al 2022 zhao et al 2018 the supplement of p hba and ca was 0 2 μmol l in experiments according to the content of phenolic acids in microalgae culture fu et al 2021 simon et al 2015 in addition the trace supplement of phenolic acid also considered the cost and ecofriendly phenolic acids 10 μmol l have negative effects on photosynthesis in microalgae gao et al 2018 and the mm level causes ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms szabelak and bownik 2021 2 1 2 microalgal cultivation c regularis was inoculated into 250 ml flasks with 150 ml bg11 medium at an initial cell density of 0 4 107 cell ml four experimental treatments were designed in this study 4 cp was added to the medium to prepare a 5 mg l solution 4 cp both 4 cp and p hba or ca were added to explore the effects of phenolic acids on microalgae under toxic pollutant stress this medium contained 5 mg l of 4 cp and 0 2 μm of p hba or ca and these treatments were called p hba and ca c regularis was cultured under normal conditions without 4 cp or phenolic acids control the flasks were placed in an incubator is 6l crystal usa under

dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dcfh da sigma aldrich usa dcfh da is converted to dcfh in cells after catalysis by hydrolases and dcfh is oxidized by ros to produce fluorescent dcf therefore the fluorescence intensity of dcf is positively correlated with the ros level in cells knauert and knauer 2008 c regularis was collected by centrifugation at 8 000 rpm for 5 min and 1 ml of 10 μm dcfh da solution was added to the pellet and incubated at 25 for 30 min in the dark the pellets were washed twice with 0 02 m pbs and resuspended to determine fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm zhang et al 2021b 2 3 3 malondialdehyde mda and antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and peroxidase pod are the main antioxidant enzymes in

pbs 0 2 mm was added to dissolve the intracellular contents and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation the supernatant was used for the mda sod cat and pod analyses with assay kits nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute china piotrowska niczyporuk et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the procedures were conducted according to the manufacturer s instructions 2 4 biofuel production the lipids

liquid chromatography system uplc acquityh waters usa the mobile phase was 50 acetonitrile miliq water at a flow rate of 0 4 ml min the samples were filtered through 0 22 μm membranes before analysis and 10 μl of the filtrate was injected into the uplc a c18 column 100 2 1 mm 2 6 μm thermo scientific usa temperature 40 and ultraviolet detector wavelength 280 nm were used to detect 4 cp papazi et al 2019 the chromatograms were analyzed with empower3 software waters usa the intermediates of 4 cp degradation were identified using a uplc mass spectrometer uplc ms 6470 lc tq agilent technologies usa the culture 50 ml was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane and the filtrate was lyophilized to obtain a powder then the samples were dissolved in miliq water 2 ml and filtered before analysis using the same method methanol and miliq water were the mobile phases following a gradient program of 5 95 v v at 2 min 50 50 v v at 4 min 95 5 v v at 6 min and 5 95 v v from 7 min to 13 min the flow rate was 0 4 ml min and the c18 column temperature was maintained at 40 the mass spectra were detected in the negative and positive electrospray ionization mode with a mass scan range of 50 500 m z the ion source temperature was 300 and the ion spray voltages for the negative and positive modes were 4 0 and 3 5 kv respectively 2 5 2 toxicity assays a luminescent bacterial test was used to evaluate the acute toxicity of effluent containing residual 4 cp and the intermediates a decrease in luminescence corresponded to the degree of toxicity the vibrio qinghaiensis sp q67 lyophilized powder cs235 beijing hamamatsu photon techniques inc china was rejuvenated with resuscitation diluent at room temperature for 10 min before the test the samples were the same as used for the uplc analysis a sample 2 ml was mixed with the luminescent bacterial suspension 0 05 ml and incubated for 15 min at room temperature li et al 2017b qiu et al 2020 the luminescent intensity was measured with a microplate reader varioskan lux thermo scientific usa and analyzed with skanit software the inhibition ratio μ was calculated using eq 5 5 μ l 0 l i l 0 where l 0 is the luminescent intensity of the control and l i is the luminescent intensity of the samples the toxicity estimation software tool was used to assess acute toxicity bioaccumulation factor and mutagenicity of 4 cp and its degradation products using a consensus method zhou et al 2020 acute toxicity was analyzed with the lc50 value which is the concentration of chemical causing 50 of daphnia magna to die after 96 h of exposure the bioaccumulation factor was the ratio of the pollutant concentration in the aquatic organisms to that in the surrounding water mutagenicity was analyzed by inducing revertant salmonella typhimurium colony growth 2 6 transcriptomic analysis c regularis cells were collected by centrifugation after the initial 48 h and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen transcriptome sequencing was performed using the illumina novaseq platform novogene beijing china total rna was extracted using the rnaprep pure plant plus kit and purified with poly t oligo attached magnetic beads the library was constructed according to the normal neb method to perform de novo sequencing and analyze the differentially expressed genes p 0 05 and log2fc 1 represented differences that were significant in addition go function enrichment and kegg pathway analyses were also performed with the goseq r package young et al 2010 and kobas software mao et al 2005 respectively 2 7 statistical analysis differences in growth rate antioxidant capacity and 4 cp removal efficiency were compared between the treatments the statistical analysis was conducted with spss software spss statistics 21 ibm usa the differences were detected with the independent samples t test both p 0 05 and p 0 01 represented significant differences which were marked with and in the figures respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 stimulating microalgal growth and maintaining cell integrity 3 1 1 growth profile and photosynthetic activity the growth of c regularis was inhibited by 5 mg l 4 cp and the specific growth rate decreased by 6 9 during the initial days of the incubation fig 1 a however p hba and ca significantly relieved the growth inhibitory effect of 4 cp p 0 05 adding either p hba or ca 0 2 μm during the first 2 days recovered the specific growth rate to 0 292 which was a 7 6 increase compared to the 4 cp treatment and slightly higher than the control 0 288 in addition 4 cp disrupted the photosynthetic system notably adding either p hba or ca prevented damage to the ps ii reaction centers decrease of abs rc and dio rc and enhanced electron transport decrease of vj increase of phi eo therefore photosynthetic activity improved fig 1b furthermore p hba or ca also induced upregulation of the dna replication enzymes helicase dna polymerase ε and dna polymerase δ over 1 0 fold compared to the 4 cp treatment and the important components pcna rfc and pra of dna repair processes davies et al 2008 shen et al 2021 also significantly increased indicating that phenolic acids play an important role in the repair of damaged dna fig 1c the phenolic acids relieved the inhibitory effect of 4 cp and enhanced microalgal growth by improving photosynthesis and upregulating dna replication previous studies have reported that phenolic acids improve the growth of microalgae or relieve the effects of adverse stress on plants bahador et al 2019 fu et al 2021 guan et al 2020 these results also show that p hba and ca alleviated the growth inhibitory effect of the toxic pollutant on the microalgae indicating that phenolic acids may have potential application in wastewater treatment using microalgae 3 1 2 cell integrity the morphology of c regularis cells differed between the control and the treatments the sem micrographs revealed that the spherical cells in the control had diameters of 2 3 μm fig 2 a the surface of the c regularis cells exhibited many wrinkles under 4 cp stress moreover extracellular polymeric substances eps also increased and most cells adhered to each other fig 2b the changes in the morphology of the cells and the increase in eps corresponds with toxicity characteristics song et al 2020 tong et al 2019 interestingly the morphology of c regularis cells in the p hba and ca treatments was similar to that of the control where eps was less than that of 4 cp fig 2c d these morphological changes verified that phenolic acids effectively protected the microalgae from the cytotoxicity of 4 cp 3 1 3 antioxidant defense toxic pollutants usually cause the accumulation of ros in cells and stimulate the antioxidant defense system of microalgae intracellular ros generated via the electron transport chain in chloroplasts foyer 2018 increased with the concentration of 4 cp and pearson s correlation coefficient was 0 738 fig 3 a ros such as 1o2 o2 h2o2 and oh react with key components including dna proteins and lipids to produce more free radicals resulting in cell damage monaghan et al 2009 shaikh et al 2016 however the ros level decreased by 17 5 43 1 after adding p hba or ca fig s1 mda an index of membrane lipid peroxidation represents the extent of oxidative damage in cells induced by ros cheng et al 2017 mda content was 30 3 49 7 less after adding p hba or ca than that of the 4 cp treatment fig 3b therefore phenolic acids relieved the adverse effects of the toxic pollutants by scavenging ros in microalgal cells the antioxidant system of the microalgae was stimulated by phenolic acids to defend against ros the antioxidant enzymes sod cat and pod scavenge ros and protect cells from oxidative damage staerck et al 2017 sod is responsible for converting o2 to h2o2 which is further reduced to h2o by cat and pod cheng et al 2017 staerck et al 2017 sod activity increased significantly by 32 4 38 7 p 0 01 in the p hba and ca treatments compared to that in the 4 cp treatment fig 3b moreover the effects of ca on sod were stronger than those of p hba and ca improved pod synthesis as pod content increased 1 3 fold p 0 01 these results are similar to those of cinnamic acid and salicylic acid of increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes in plants under high salinity or heavy metal stress hediji et al 2021 singh et al 2013 in addition phenolic acids scavenge ros via their direct chemical reactions korzeniowska et al 2020 which may have occurred here phenolic acids stimulated the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes to scavenge ros and further relieved the pollutant stress this represents a potential strategy to overcome the inhibition of microalgae during toxic wastewater treatment 3 2 effects on 4 cp degradation 3 2 1 4 cp removal and detoxification trace amounts of p hba and ca promoted the removal of 4 cp after adding 0 2 μm p hba or ca the percentage of 4 cp removed increased by 27 0 on day 8 fig 4 a furthermore the 4 cp removal rate normalized by cell density also significantly improved particularly during the first 2 days the removal rate increased to 1 1 107 mg d cell which was 44 8 higher than the control p 0 01 these results indicate that the phenolic acids promoted 4 cp removal efficiency and degradation capacity of the microalgae phenolic acids play a role in cell growth but they also have roles in the regulation of toxic pollutant removal in microalgae therefore trace phenolic acids could be utilized to enhance wastewater treatment with microalgae instead of co metabolism or a domestication strategy wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a the toxicity of effluent containing residual 4 cp and its degradation intermediates were evaluated by vibrio qinghaiensis in which luminescence decreases in response to toxic chemicals luminescence decreased by 85 after the initial 4 cp was added while luminescence gradually recovered during 4 cp degradation and inhibition dropped to 34 in the 4 cp treatment fig s2 furthermore the inhibition of luminescence in the bacteria of the p hba and ca treatments decreased slightly by 12 and 9 respectively fig s2 which corresponded to the trend in the 4 cp removal rate the residual 4 cp concentration and the decrease of luminescence were positively correlated pearson s r 0 909 fig 4c this finding indicates that phenolic acids promoted the degradation of 4 cp and reduced effluent toxicity six 4 cp degradation intermediates were detected in the c regularis culture such as c6h5clo2 c6h5clo4 c6h4o4 c6h6o5 c6h6o3 and c6h8o3 fig s3 the acute toxicity bioaccumulation factor and mutagenicity of 4 cp and its degradation products were evaluated fig 4d f most of these intermediates except c6h5clo2 are less toxic to daphnia magna and reveal lower mutagenicity than 4 cp the bioaccumulation factor of all intermediates decreased due to their increased hydrophilicity compared to 4 cp in addition the toxicity assessment showed that the c6h6o5 degradation product was not acutely toxic and did not bioaccumulate or induce mutagenicity this result indicates that microalgae can degrade highly toxic 4 cp to less toxic chemicals and then convert them to non toxic products 3 2 2 degradation pathway and enzyme expression the 4 cp degradation pathway under c regularis functional degrading enzymes was proposed according to the intermediate products fig 5 a generally the ring of the mono chlorophenols was opened and then dechlorinated yang et al 2021 in the main pathway monooxygenases reacted with 4 cp which was converted to 4 chlorocatechol c6h5clo2 via ortho hydroxylation thus the chemical activity of these intermediates also increased compared to 4 cp finkel shtein et al 2000 then the benzene ring of this intermediate was cracked and further oxidized to 3 chloromuconic acid c6h5clo4 by dioxygenases via the ortho cleavage pathway type i of course the meta cleavage pathway type ii has also been reported li et al 2011 after cleavage of the benzene ring the chlorine of 3 chloromuconic acid was removed by isomerase catalysis to generate c6h4o4 which was hydrolyzed to c6h6o5 or converted to c6h8o3 moreover c6h5clo2 could have been converted to c6h6o3 and further oxidized to c6h6o5 via oxidization and dichlorination finally the non toxic products were utilized as organic carbon sources by c regularis adding p hba or ca did not change the 4 cp degradation pathway however they upregulated the gene expression of monooxygenases dioxygenases isomerases dehydrogenases and hydrolases fig 5b resulting in a higher accumulation of intermediates fig s4 these enzymes contributed to 4 cp degradation as non specific degrading enzymes they also play important roles in the degradation of other aromatic compounds and antibiotics hena et al 2021 mendez garcia and garcia de llasera 2021 therefore the phenolic acids probably induced the higher expression of degrading enzymes to promote the degradation of 4 cp and other toxic pollutants during wastewater treatment 3 3 effects on lipid accumulation 3 3 1 lipid production the microalgae accumulated lipids accompanied by 4 cp degradation which is the feedstock of biodiesel the lipid content increased in the p hba and ca treatments and the enhancement was slightly higher in the p hba treatment fig 6 a lipid content was 30 5 on day 8 which was a 10 9 increase p 0 01 compared to the 4 cp treatment lipid production was determined by biomass and lipid content considering the positive effects of the phenolic acids on microalgal growth lipid production was significantly enhanced by 23 1 in the p hba treatment and by 20 5 in the ca treatment p 0 01 it has been reported that phytohormones such as auxins methyl jasmonate and melatonin relieve the environmental stress nitrogen starvation salt stress and high light intensity on microalgae growth and increase lipid production arroussi et al 2015 cui et al 2021 zhao et al 2019b similarly the present results show that the trace phenolic acids enhanced lipid production during the degradation of toxic pollutants by microalgae 3 3 2 promoting pathways acetyl coa carboxylase accase and fatty acid synthases are important enzymes for lipid synthesis the primary and rate limiting step for fatty acid biosynthesis is accase which catalyzes the conversion of acetyl coa to malonyl coa ran et al 2019 accase was upregulated log2fc 1 after adding p hba or ca fig 6b malonyl coa was converted to malonyl acp which was utilized to synthesize free fatty acids by polymerization reactions catalyzed by β ketoacyl acp synthase kas and β ketoacyl acp reductase kar ran et al 2019 the expression of kas and kar were upregulated by p hba and ca in particular the gene encoding kas was more significantly upregulated log2fc 5 in addition lipid synthesis requires nadph as a hydrogen donor for the reduction reaction which is produced by glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase osada et al 2017 xue et al 2017 these enzymes were also significantly upregulated log2fc 2 to improve lipid synthesis table s2 fatty acids are catalyzed by a series of enzymes to form triacylglycerol tag which is stored as energy in microalgae ananthi et al 2021 at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase gpat converts glycerol 3 phosphate g 3 p into lysophosphatidic acid lpa munoz et al 2021 gpat is a key enzyme in tag biosynthesis and its gene expression was significantly upregulated log2fc 4 by p hba and ca fig 6b moreover lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase lpat and phosphatidic acid phosphatase pap were also upregulated to different degrees 1 log2fc 7 these enzymes are responsible for the successive conversion of lpa to phosphatidic acid pa and 1 2 diacylglycerol dat munoz et al 2021 in previous reports the high expression of lipid synthetases such as gpat improved tag synthesis in chlamydomonas reinhardtii deng et al 2012 in conclusion most of the lipid synthesis enzymes were upregulated under the p hba and ca treatments which was consistent with the increase in lipid accumulation these results confirm that the phenolic acids improved lipid production by upregulating the activities of key lipid synthetases during 4 cp stress this strategy is promising for wastewater treatment of toxic pollutants and microalgal lipid production 3 4 signal transduction of phenolic acids in chlorella phenolic acids likely induce the mitogen activated protein kinase mapk signaling cascade pathway and calcium signaling pathway mapk is a general signal transduction pathway in eukaryotes of which two mapkkks anp and yda regulate cytokinesis and cell development xu and zhang 2015 adding p hba or ca stimulated the expression of anp and yda log2fc 3 to promote the growth of c regularis under 4 cp stress fig 7 a mekk1 mkk1 and mkk2 are sensitive enzymes and part of the abiotic stress signaling pathway that is upregulated in wounding cold drought or salty conditions nakagami et al 2005 adding p hba or ca downregulated mekk1 mkk1 and mkk2 fig 7a confirming that phenolic acids alleviated the 4 cp stress in c regularis furthermore calcium signaling transduction was also stimulated by p hba and ca ca2 is a secondary messenger utilized by microorganisms to regulate cellular responses in various environments yang and poovaiah 2003 the ca2 channel ca2 transport atpase and ca2 sensors cdpk and cam were upregulated in the p hba and ca treatments fig 7b thus the cytosolic ca2 level increased and the ca2 sensors perceived the change in ca2 concentration and transmitted signals downstream to regulate lipid synthesis and antioxidant processes to relieve toxic pollutant stress cui et al 2020 qiao et al 2021 ros production rapidly increased in the microalgae under 4 cp stress in wastewater resulting in oxidative damage and inhibited cell growth and metabolism fig 7c the trace phenolic acids p hba and ca effectively relieved the negative effects of 4 cp in two ways the phenolic acids scavenged ros by direct chemical reactions and stimulated the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes to reduce oxidative damage the other mechanism was the regulation of the mapk signaling and calcium signaling pathways which were upregulated by the phenolic acids to promote dna replication photosynthetic efficiency and antioxidant capacity these processes relieved the inhibited microalgal growth and 4 cp degradation and lipid accumulation improved simultaneously in this way the phenolic acids protected the survival of the microalgae under toxic stress while degrading pollutants and producing a potential bioresource 4 conclusions trace phenolic acids 0 2 μm p hba or ca effectively relieved the inhibition of cell growth by enhancing photosynthesis and dna replication these phenolic acids also stimulated antioxidant defense to scavenge ros resulting in higher tolerance to 4 cp in addition the 4 cp removal rate increased by 27 0 and 4 cp was degraded into non toxic compounds after the benzene ring was opened and dechlorinated the phenolic acids did not change the 4 cp degradation pathway but accelerated the removal and detoxification of 4 cp by enhancing the expression of 4 cp degradation enzymes including monooxygenases dioxygenases isomerases dehydrogenases and hydrolases more importantly lipid content and lipid production increased by 10 9 and 20 5 23 1 respectively as the genes encoding enzymes related to fatty acid and tag synthesis were upregulated the phenolic acids stimulated the mapk and calcium signaling pathways to regulate microalgal growth antioxidant defense 4 cp degradation and lipid accumulation these results provide new insight into toxic wastewater treatment and recovery of

16002,coupling the cultivation of microalgae with wastewater treatment is a promising technology to recover bioresources from wastewater however toxic pollutants in wastewater seriously inhibit the growth of microalgae and the removal of pollutants phenolic acids are similar to phytohormones could potentially relieve the toxicity to microalgae and simultaneously promote pollutant degradation and lipid accumulation chlorella and 4 chlorophenol 4 cp were utilized to simulate the toxic wastewater treatment and the roles of two typical phenolic acids such as p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba and caffeic acid ca were explored the 0 2 μm concentration of p hba or ca improved the specific growth rate by 7 6 by enhancing photosynthesis and dna replication the oxidative damage caused by 4 cp was reduced by 30 3 49 7 via the synthesis of more antioxidant enzymes and the direct scavenging of free radicals by phenolic acids furthermore the 4 cp removal rate increased by 27 0 and toxic 4 cp was degraded into non toxic compounds the phenolic acids did not change the 4 cp degradation pathway but accelerated its removal and detoxification by enhancing the expression of 4 cp degradation enzymes simultaneously lipid production increased by 20 5 23 1 due to the upregulation of enzymes related to fatty acid and triacylglycerol synthesis trace phenolic acids stimulated the mitogen activated protein kinase signaling cascade and the calcium signaling pathway to regulate the physiology of the microalgae and protect cells from toxic stress this study provides a promising new strategy for toxic wastewater treatment and bioresource recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phytohormone p hydroxybenzoic acid microalgae chlorophenol degradation signaling pathway 1 introduction microalgae based wastewater treatment and bioresource recovery is an eco friendly and sustainable technology that has been utilized for various types of wastewater such as municipal wastewater brewery wastewater swine wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater sharma et al 2022 microalgae use nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater to grow and produce high value bioresources including biodiesel salama et al 2017 shahid et al 2020 microalgae have been cultivated in wastewater and biomass productivity was 0 64 14 80 g l d depending on the species salama et al 2017 furthermore many studies have reported that microalgae including chlorella regularis chlorella pyrenoidosa and scenedesmus obliquus degrade organic pollutants such as personal care products pharmaceuticals pesticides and industrial products dayana priyadharshini et al 2021 hena et al 2021 chlorophenols cps are widely used to manufacture biocides pharmaceuticals and industrial products kayan et al 2021 about 59 8 tons of volatile phenols are discharged as wastewater every year in china according to 2020 data from the national bureau of statistics 2021 cps are universal pollutants in nature as they have been widely detected in surface water groundwater sediment ambient air soil and the human body at ng μg l levels olaniran and igbinosa 2011 schmied tobies et al 2021 due to their highly toxic mutagenic carcinogenic and persistent properties cps are regarded as priority pollutants by the world health organization and the united states environmental protection agency long et al 2020 nowak and mrozik 2018 most microalgae are sensitive to toxic pollutants in wastewater and cps can decrease the rate of photosynthesis which inhibits the growth of microalgae and causes cellular oxidative damage papazi et al 2019 supplementing with phytohormones is an effective strategy to improve the physiology of microalgae and enhance their tolerance to abiotic stress stirk and van staden 2020 zhao et al 2019b phytohormones regulate cell growth metabolism and development in plants and microalgae at extremely low levels μm mm and are regarded as signaling molecules stirk and van staden 2020 many phytohormones and analogs such as auxin melatonin gibberellin and jasmonic acid alleviate intracellular oxidative stress maintain growth and improve lipid production of microalgae under abiotic stress li et al 2017a yu et al 2018 zhao et al 2019b most studies have focused on the role of phytohormones in improving lipid production of microalgae under adverse conditions such as nitrogen starvation or high light intensity li et al 2017a yu et al 2018 but neglected the regulation of exogenous phytohormones in microalgae exposed to toxic pollutants several phenolic acids e g salicylic acid have similar functions as phytohormones as they are capable of regulating the growth and metabolism of microalgae behera et al 2021 phenolic acids can be divided into two categories of hydroxybenzoic acids and hydroxycinnamic acids the former include p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba salicylic acid protocatechuic acid and gallic acid whereas the latter include caffeic acid ca p coumaric acid ferulic acid and sinapic acid marchiosi et al 2020 many studies have reported the detection of phenolic acids in microalgae and their outstanding antioxidant capacity to scavenge free radicals korzeniowska et al 2020 vo dinh et al 2018 phenolic acids trigger lipid production similar to phytohormones esakkimuthu et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 in addition phenolic acids also effectively relieve the inhibition of photosystem ii ps ii and protect plants from oxidative damage caused by abiotic stress arikan et al 2021 guan et al 2020 therefore we hypothesized that phenolic acids would improve the antioxidant capacity of microalgae under toxic pollutant stress and promote the production of biomass and lipids we also examined whether phenolic acids regulate microalgal growth and metabolism to defend against cp stress p hba and ca as representatives of the two different categories of phenolic acids were utilized in the present study to explore the hypothesis that trace phenolic acids promote chlorella to simultaneously degrade cps and produce biofuel the effects of the phenolic acids on microalgal growth cp degradation and lipid production were also determined in particular photosynthesis dna replication antioxidant defense the toxicity of intermediates degradation pathways and signaling regulation were investigated to reveal the mechanism of the phenolic acids in microalgae under toxic pollutant stress this study will provide new insight into the protective effect of phenolic acids on microalgae from toxic stress and will provide a promising strategy for toxic wastewater treatment and bioresource recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions 2 1 1 microalgal strain and chemicals chlorella regularis fachb 729 was used in this study and was

discussion 3 1 stimulating microalgal growth and maintaining cell integrity 3 1 1 growth profile and photosynthetic activity the growth of c regularis was inhibited by 5 mg l 4 cp and the specific growth rate decreased by 6 9 during the initial days of the incubation fig 1 a however p hba and ca significantly relieved the growth inhibitory effect of 4 cp p 0 05 adding either p hba or ca 0 2 μm during the first 2 days recovered the specific growth rate to 0 292 which was a 7 6 increase compared to the 4 cp treatment and slightly higher than the control 0 288 in addition 4 cp disrupted the photosynthetic system notably adding either p hba or ca prevented damage to the ps ii reaction centers decrease of abs rc and dio rc and enhanced electron transport decrease of vj increase of phi eo therefore photosynthetic activity improved fig 1b furthermore p hba or ca also induced upregulation of the dna replication enzymes helicase dna polymerase ε and dna polymerase δ over 1 0 fold compared to the 4 cp treatment and the important components pcna rfc and pra of dna repair processes davies et al 2008 shen et al 2021 also significantly increased indicating that phenolic acids play an important role in the repair of damaged dna fig 1c the phenolic acids relieved the inhibitory effect of 4 cp and enhanced microalgal growth by improving photosynthesis and upregulating dna replication previous studies have reported that phenolic acids improve the growth of microalgae or relieve the effects of adverse stress on plants bahador et al 2019 fu et al 2021 guan et al 2020 these results also show that p hba and ca alleviated the growth inhibitory effect of the toxic pollutant on the microalgae indicating that phenolic acids may have potential application in wastewater treatment using microalgae 3 1 2 cell integrity the morphology of c regularis cells differed between the control and the treatments the sem micrographs revealed that the spherical cells in the control had diameters of 2 3 μm fig 2 a the surface of the c regularis cells exhibited many wrinkles under 4 cp stress moreover extracellular polymeric substances eps also increased and most cells adhered to each other fig 2b the changes in the morphology of the cells and the increase in eps corresponds with toxicity characteristics song et al 2020 tong et al 2019 interestingly the morphology of c regularis cells in the p hba and ca treatments was similar to that of the control where eps was less than that of 4 cp fig 2c d these morphological changes verified that phenolic acids effectively protected the microalgae from the cytotoxicity of 4 cp 3 1 3 antioxidant defense toxic pollutants usually cause the accumulation of ros in cells and stimulate the antioxidant defense system of microalgae intracellular ros generated via the electron transport chain in chloroplasts foyer 2018 increased with the concentration of 4 cp and pearson s correlation coefficient was 0 738 fig 3 a ros such as 1o2 o2 h2o2 and oh react with key components including dna proteins and lipids to produce more free radicals resulting in cell damage monaghan et al 2009 shaikh et al 2016 however the ros level decreased by 17 5 43 1 after adding p hba or ca fig s1 mda an index of membrane lipid peroxidation represents the extent of oxidative damage in cells induced by ros cheng et al 2017 mda content was 30 3 49 7 less after adding p hba or ca than that of the 4 cp treatment fig 3b therefore phenolic acids relieved the adverse effects of the toxic pollutants by scavenging ros in microalgal cells the antioxidant system of the microalgae was stimulated by phenolic acids to defend against ros the antioxidant enzymes sod cat and pod scavenge ros and protect cells from oxidative damage staerck et al 2017 sod is responsible for converting o2 to h2o2 which is further reduced to h2o by cat and pod cheng et al 2017 staerck et al 2017 sod activity increased significantly by 32 4 38 7 p 0 01 in the p hba and ca treatments compared to that in the 4 cp treatment fig 3b moreover the effects of ca on sod were stronger than those of p hba and ca improved pod synthesis as pod content increased 1 3 fold p 0 01 these results are similar to those of cinnamic acid and salicylic acid of increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes in plants under high salinity or heavy metal stress hediji et al 2021 singh et al 2013 in addition phenolic acids scavenge ros via their direct chemical reactions korzeniowska et al 2020 which may have occurred here phenolic acids stimulated the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes to scavenge ros and further relieved the pollutant stress this represents a potential strategy to overcome the inhibition of microalgae during toxic wastewater treatment 3 2 effects on 4 cp degradation 3 2 1 4 cp removal and detoxification trace amounts of p hba and ca promoted the removal of 4 cp after adding 0 2 μm p hba or ca the percentage of 4 cp removed increased by 27 0 on day 8 fig 4 a furthermore the 4 cp removal rate normalized by cell density also significantly improved particularly during the first 2 days the removal rate increased to 1 1 107 mg d cell which was 44 8 higher than the control p 0 01 these results indicate that the phenolic acids promoted 4 cp removal efficiency and degradation capacity of the microalgae phenolic acids play a role in cell growth but they also have roles in the regulation of toxic pollutant removal in microalgae therefore trace phenolic acids could be utilized to enhance wastewater treatment with microalgae instead of co metabolism or a domestication strategy wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a the toxicity of effluent containing residual 4 cp and its degradation intermediates were evaluated by vibrio qinghaiensis in which luminescence decreases in response to toxic chemicals luminescence decreased by 85 after the initial 4 cp was added while luminescence gradually recovered during 4 cp degradation and inhibition dropped to 34 in the 4 cp treatment fig s2 furthermore the inhibition of luminescence in the bacteria of the p hba and ca treatments decreased slightly by 12 and 9 respectively fig s2 which corresponded to the trend in the 4 cp removal rate the residual 4 cp concentration and the decrease of luminescence were positively correlated pearson s r 0 909 fig 4c this finding indicates that phenolic acids promoted the degradation of 4 cp and reduced effluent toxicity six 4 cp degradation intermediates were detected in the c regularis culture such as c6h5clo2 c6h5clo4 c6h4o4 c6h6o5 c6h6o3 and c6h8o3 fig s3 the acute toxicity bioaccumulation factor and mutagenicity of 4 cp and its degradation products were evaluated fig 4d f most of these intermediates except c6h5clo2 are less toxic to daphnia magna and reveal lower mutagenicity than 4 cp the bioaccumulation factor of all intermediates decreased due to their increased hydrophilicity compared to 4 cp in addition the toxicity assessment showed that the c6h6o5 degradation product was not acutely toxic and did not bioaccumulate or induce mutagenicity this result indicates that microalgae can degrade highly toxic 4 cp to less toxic chemicals and then convert them to non toxic products 3 2 2 degradation pathway and enzyme expression the 4 cp degradation pathway under c regularis functional degrading enzymes was proposed according to the intermediate products fig 5 a generally the ring of the mono chlorophenols was opened and then dechlorinated yang et al 2021 in the main pathway monooxygenases reacted with 4 cp which was converted to 4 chlorocatechol c6h5clo2 via ortho hydroxylation thus the chemical activity of these intermediates also increased compared to 4 cp finkel shtein et al 2000 then the benzene ring of this intermediate was cracked and further oxidized to 3 chloromuconic acid c6h5clo4 by dioxygenases via the ortho cleavage pathway type i of course the meta cleavage pathway type ii has also been reported li et al 2011 after cleavage of the benzene ring the chlorine of 3 chloromuconic acid was removed by isomerase catalysis to generate c6h4o4 which was hydrolyzed to c6h6o5 or converted to c6h8o3 moreover c6h5clo2 could have been converted to c6h6o3 and further oxidized to c6h6o5 via oxidization and dichlorination finally the non toxic products were utilized as organic carbon sources by c regularis adding p hba or ca did not change the 4 cp degradation pathway however they upregulated the gene expression of monooxygenases dioxygenases isomerases dehydrogenases and hydrolases fig 5b resulting in a higher accumulation of intermediates fig s4 these enzymes contributed to 4 cp degradation as non specific degrading enzymes they also play important roles in the degradation of other aromatic compounds and antibiotics hena et al 2021 mendez garcia and garcia de llasera 2021 therefore the phenolic acids probably induced the higher expression of degrading enzymes to promote the degradation of 4 cp and other toxic pollutants during wastewater treatment 3 3 effects on lipid accumulation 3 3 1 lipid production the microalgae accumulated lipids accompanied by 4 cp degradation which is the feedstock of biodiesel the lipid content increased in the p hba and ca treatments and the enhancement was slightly higher in the p hba treatment fig 6 a lipid content was 30 5 on day 8 which was a 10 9 increase p 0 01 compared to the 4 cp treatment lipid production was determined by biomass and lipid content considering the positive effects of the phenolic acids on microalgal growth lipid production was significantly enhanced by 23 1 in the p hba treatment and by 20 5 in the ca treatment p 0 01 it has been reported that phytohormones such as auxins methyl jasmonate and melatonin relieve the environmental stress nitrogen starvation salt stress and high light intensity on microalgae growth and increase lipid production arroussi et al 2015 cui et al 2021 zhao et al 2019b similarly the present results show that the trace phenolic acids enhanced lipid production during the degradation of toxic pollutants by microalgae 3 3 2 promoting pathways acetyl coa carboxylase accase and fatty acid synthases are important enzymes for lipid synthesis the primary and rate limiting step for fatty acid biosynthesis is accase which catalyzes the conversion of acetyl coa to malonyl coa ran et al 2019 accase was upregulated log2fc 1 after adding p hba or ca fig 6b malonyl coa was converted to malonyl acp which was utilized to synthesize free fatty acids by polymerization reactions catalyzed by β ketoacyl acp synthase kas and β ketoacyl acp reductase kar ran et al 2019 the expression of kas and kar were upregulated by p hba and ca in particular the gene encoding kas was more significantly upregulated log2fc 5 in addition lipid synthesis requires nadph as a hydrogen donor for the reduction reaction which is produced by glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase osada et al 2017 xue et al 2017 these enzymes were also significantly upregulated log2fc 2 to improve lipid synthesis table s2 fatty acids are catalyzed by a series of enzymes to form triacylglycerol tag which is stored as energy in microalgae ananthi et al 2021 at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase gpat converts glycerol 3 phosphate g 3 p into lysophosphatidic acid lpa munoz et al 2021 gpat is a key enzyme in tag biosynthesis and its gene expression was significantly upregulated log2fc 4 by p hba and ca fig 6b moreover lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase lpat and phosphatidic acid phosphatase pap were also upregulated to different degrees 1 log2fc 7 these enzymes are responsible for the successive conversion of lpa to phosphatidic acid pa and 1 2 diacylglycerol dat munoz et al 2021 in previous reports the high expression of lipid synthetases such as gpat improved tag synthesis in chlamydomonas reinhardtii deng et al 2012 in conclusion most of the lipid synthesis enzymes were upregulated under the p hba and ca treatments which was consistent with the increase in lipid accumulation these results confirm that the phenolic acids improved lipid production by upregulating the activities of key lipid synthetases during 4 cp stress this strategy is promising for wastewater treatment of toxic pollutants and microalgal lipid production 3 4 signal transduction of phenolic acids in chlorella phenolic acids likely induce the mitogen activated protein kinase mapk signaling cascade pathway and calcium signaling pathway mapk is a general signal transduction pathway in eukaryotes of which two mapkkks anp and yda regulate cytokinesis and cell development xu and zhang 2015 adding p hba or ca stimulated the expression of anp and yda log2fc 3 to promote the growth of c regularis under 4 cp stress fig 7 a mekk1 mkk1 and mkk2 are sensitive enzymes and part of the abiotic stress signaling pathway that is upregulated in wounding cold drought or salty conditions nakagami et al 2005 adding p hba or ca downregulated mekk1 mkk1 and mkk2 fig 7a confirming that phenolic acids alleviated the 4 cp stress in c regularis furthermore calcium signaling transduction was also stimulated by p hba and ca ca2 is a secondary messenger utilized by microorganisms to regulate cellular responses in various environments yang and poovaiah 2003 the ca2 channel ca2 transport atpase and ca2 sensors cdpk and cam were upregulated in the p hba and ca treatments fig 7b thus the cytosolic ca2 level increased and the ca2 sensors perceived the change in ca2 concentration and transmitted signals downstream to regulate lipid synthesis and antioxidant processes to relieve toxic pollutant stress cui et al 2020 qiao et al 2021 ros production rapidly increased in the microalgae under 4 cp stress in wastewater resulting in oxidative damage and inhibited cell growth and metabolism fig 7c the trace phenolic acids p hba and ca effectively relieved the negative effects of 4 cp in two ways the phenolic acids scavenged ros by direct chemical reactions and stimulated the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes to reduce oxidative damage the other mechanism was the regulation of the mapk signaling and calcium signaling pathways which were upregulated by the phenolic acids to promote dna replication photosynthetic efficiency and antioxidant capacity these processes relieved the inhibited microalgal growth and 4 cp degradation and lipid accumulation improved simultaneously in this way the phenolic acids protected the survival of the microalgae under toxic stress while degrading pollutants and producing a potential bioresource 4 conclusions trace phenolic acids 0 2 μm p hba or ca effectively relieved the inhibition of cell growth by enhancing photosynthesis and dna replication these phenolic acids also stimulated antioxidant defense to scavenge ros resulting in higher tolerance to 4 cp in addition the 4 cp removal rate increased by 27 0 and 4 cp was degraded into non toxic compounds after the benzene ring was opened and dechlorinated the phenolic acids did not change the 4 cp degradation pathway but accelerated the removal and detoxification of 4 cp by enhancing the expression of 4 cp degradation enzymes including monooxygenases dioxygenases isomerases dehydrogenases and hydrolases more importantly lipid content and lipid production increased by 10 9 and 20 5 23 1 respectively as the genes encoding enzymes related to fatty acid and tag synthesis were upregulated the phenolic acids stimulated the mapk and calcium signaling pathways to regulate microalgal growth antioxidant defense 4 cp degradation and lipid accumulation these results provide new insight into toxic wastewater treatment and recovery of

16003,coastal wetland reclamation contributed to development of aquaculture industry and the residual bait accumulation in aquaculture processes could influence biogeochemical elements cycling which threaten ecological functions and services in aquaculture and adjacent ecosystems however systematic studies for changes in sediment microbial community structure and greenhouse gasses ghgs production as well as environmental parameters following bait input at time scale are still rare a 90 day incubation experiment was conducted using sediment collected from coastal wetland in qi ao island in southern china followed by the observations of temporal variations of physicochemical properties sediment microbial community and ghgs production in response to different amounts of bait input 0 20 and 40 mg bait g 1 wet sediment the results showed that dissolved oxygen of overlying water was profoundly decreased owing to bait input while dissolved organic carbon of overlying water and several sediment properties e g organic matter sulfide and ammonium varied in reverse patterns meanwhile bait input led to significant loss of microbial community richness and diversity and strongly altered microbial compositions from aerobic slow growing and oligotrophic actinobacteriota chloroflexi and acidobacteriota to anaerobic fast growing and copiotrophic firmicutes and bacteroidota moreover both ghgs production and global warming potential were significantly enhanced by bait input implying that aquaculture ecosystem is an important hotspot for global ghgs emission overall bait input triggered quick responses of physicochemical properties sediment microbial community and ghgs production followed by long term resilience of the ecosystem this study could provide new insight into temporal interactive effects of bait input on physicochemical properties microbial community and ghgs production which can enhance the understanding of the temporal dynamics and ecological impacts of coastal aquaculture activities and emphasize the necessity of sustainable assessment and management in aquaculture ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bait input microbial community greenhouse gases production aquaculture coastal wetland reclamation 1 introduction aquaculture is an important complement to the supply of global fishery resources especially in developing countries fao 2020 aquaculture in china has made remarkable achievements in recent decades which is becoming the world s largest producer consumer processor and exporter of aquaculture products wu et al 2014 luo et al 2018 the total mariculture production of china increased from 6 38 105 t in 1984 to 1 96 107 t in 2016 and the total mariculture area also increased from 2 42 103 km2 in 1984 to 2 17 104 km2 23 of the global total in 2016 ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china 1985 2017 rapid aquaculture development greatly increased the inputs of reactive nitrogen in aquaculture ecosystem from 9 43 tg n yr 1 in 1978 to 18 54 tg n yr 1 in 2015 in china luo et al 2018 thus the rapid development of aquaculture has sustained aquatic food production but has also led to a host of environmental problems such as hypoxia expansion increased harmful blooms of cyanobacteria and eutrophication accelerating greenhouse gasses ghgs emission and widespread pollution wu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2020 to meet the demand of unprecedentedly rapid development of aquaculture industry land use conversion has stimulated the expansion of coastal aquaculture area and the loss of natural coastal wetland mainly including estuarine and coastal waters seagrasses mangroves saltmarshes etc richards and friess 2016 in china coastal earthen ponds from the tidal flat reclamation accounted for 28 of the total mariculture area in 2016 which contributed more than 31 of the total mariculture production ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china 2017 the loss of wetlands and arable land contributed over 50 to the construction of land based aquaculture ponds ren et al 2019 and it has exerted a profound and complex impact on the ecological functions and services delivery underlying coastal wetland ecosystem murray et al 2019 therefore it is of ecological and environmental significance to investigate the biogeochemical cycles in land use conversion of coastal wetland to aquaculture bait is the major input source of organic matter and pollutant in aquaculture ecosystems a small proportion of input bait 4 0 27 4 is utilized by cultured animals chen et al 2016 and most uneaten bait accumulates in sediment which causes some serious environmental issues shen et al 2020 meanwhile sediment acts as an important source of excess organic carbon nitrogenous compounds and other substances to the water column hargreaves 1998 murphy et al 2016 such excess gives rise to a series of negative effects on the aquaculture water and the surrounding environment such as eutrophication and biodiversity loss and a vast amount of ammonia nh3 hydrogen sulfide and ghgs emissions feng et al 2004 according to the quantification of nitrogen budgets aquaculture significantly aggravated ammonium nh4 and nitrogen loadings to coastal wetland by promoting the production of bioavailable nh4 and through sediment discharge which poses risk of eutrophication wu et al 2014 gao et al 2019 however the effects of bait input on the sediment physicochemical properties microbial community and ghgs production have not been simultaneously well studied at time scale to determine the effects of bait input on sediment physicochemical properties microbial community and ghgs production at time scale an incubation experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions for 90 days in this study the main objectives of this study were to 1 elucidate the temporal variations of responses of sediment microbial community to bait input and determine the key environmental drivers in coastal wetland ecosystem 2 evaluate ghgs production and estimate global warming potential under different levels of bait input this study can enhance the understanding of the temporal dynamics and ecological impacts of coastal aquaculture activities as well as facilitating the sustainable management and development of coastal wetlands 2 material and methods 2 1 sediment incubation experiment sediment was collected from coastal wetland in qi ao island guangdong province china 22 427 n 113 629 e fig 1 a in november 2020

ghgs production rates measurements potential production rates of ghgs were determined with a headspace technique based on the vapor liquid equilibrium holland et al 1999 using the ideal gas law henry

changed overlying water and sediment properties over time most overlying water and sediment properties were significantly changed with bait input fig 2 table s3 sediment water content toc tn sulfide nh4 din and overlying water doc in two treatments were both significantly higher than those in the blank p 0 01 for all conversely sediment bulk density toc tn and overlying water do in two treatments were both significantly lower than those in the blank p 0 001 for all some of these properties were further sensitive to the bait input amount fig 2 table s3 sediment toc tn and overlying water do were significantly decreased with the increasing bait input amount p 0 001 simultaneously a series of properties were significantly enhanced with the increasing bait input amount including sediment toc tn sulfide and overlying water doc moreover nh4 and no3 of overlying water showed no significant differences between the blank and m treatment but were significantly inhibited in h treatment p 0 01 distinct trends of physicochemical properties over time were observed in two treatments relative to the blank fig 2 table s3 sediment toc and tn displayed continuously decreasing trends while the enhancement of sediment toc tn was detected during the 90 day incubation experiment bait input induced both sediment sulfide and no3 to peak on day 5 and then decline overlying water doc exhibited an early sharp increase followed by a gradually decrease in both treatments while the counterparts in the blank remained stable at relative low levels 2 72 4 10 mg l 1 for most properties the trends in two treatments were consistent and to a lesser extent in m treatment 3 2 bait input modified sediment microbial community structure over time according to the alpha diversity metrics bait input led to significant microbial community richness and diversity loss fig 3 a table s4 the chao1 estimator values ranged from 5109 223 to 5863 97 in the blank and it was significantly diminished to 3676 4027 p

blank 314 13 427 10 p 0 01 meanwhile both chao1 and inverse simpson index in h treatment were significantly lower than those in m treatment thus higher bait amount influenced community richness and diversity more intensively according to bray curtis based non metric multidimensional scaling nmds samples in the same treatment were tightly clustered together fig 3 b analysis of similarities anosim also revealed that the blank and two treatments harbored distinct microbial communities r 0 95 p 0 001 community structure continued to shift within two treatments representing obvious community succession throughout the experimental time course whereas unclear trend of the shifts over time in the microbial community structure was observed within the blank fig 3 b consistent observations were also obtained through anosim the blank r 0 43 m treatment r 0 94 h treatment r 0 98 p 0 001 for all at the phylum level the count number of abundant phyla relative abundance 1 in the blank was 10 14 which was higher than that of the m 8 10 and h 6 8 treatments fig 3 c similar to the observation in sediment before the incubation experiment fig s1 proteobacteria 21 99 27 32 actinobacteriota 18 12 23 23 chloroflexi 14 03 16 99 and acidobacteriota 9 18 15 13 were most abundant in the blank but less abundant in the m and h treatment proteobacteria 7 56 20 35 except on day 0 in m treatment actinobacteriota 6 34 15 67 chloroflexi 2 74 7 36 acidobacteriota 1 80 5 15 alternatively bait input significantly increased relative abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidota in m treatment firmicutes was initially promoted from 28 29 0 75 on day 0 to 33 92 4 63 on day 5 and then gradually decreased to 19 66 0 13 by the final time point day 90 in h treatment firmicutes was overwhelmingly the most abundant comprising 40 59 50 05 of the total microbial community meanwhile bacteroidota was a rising phylum over time in both treatments in m treatment the relative abundance of bacteroidota was initially the lowest 9 10 0 51 which bloomed to 16 30 18 95 on day 5 45 and over 24 on day 60 90 in h treatment the relative abundance of bacteroidota was 3 10 8 87 during the first five days and then increased to 18 56 0 04 on day 10 and 27 16 29 79 at later time points a total of 24 and 25 genera displayed significant increases and decreases in relative abundance in two treatments compared with the blank at one or more time points respectively corrected p 0 05 fig 4 four genera affiliated with firmicutes were significantly promoted by bait input throughout the incubation experiment the relative abundances of which relied on bait input amount another 11 genera affiliated with firmicutes were also significantly enriched in two treatments at different time points acetobacteroides affiliated with bacteroidota was sparse in the blank relative abundance 0 01 which steadily increased from 0 57 0 08 on day 0 to 17 84 2 98 on day 90 in m treatment and became the most abundant genera in h treatment during day 10 90 with the relative abundance 13 56 24 82 in contrast several genera were significantly inhibited by bait input at all the nine time points including three genera affiliated with actinobacteriota one genus affiliated with chloroflexi one genus affiliated with gemmatimonadota and two genera affiliated with proteobacteria functional prediction by faprotax revealed that bait input induced the increase of fermentation by more than ten fold several processes involved in biogeochemical elements cycling were further strengthened by high bait input amount including respiration of nitrogen and sulfur compounds and nitrogen fixation fig s2 3 3 bait input altered the ghgs production rates over time the production rates of co2 were significantly enhanced by bait input fig 5 a the rates in the blank were 7 31 μmol kg 1 h 1 to 26 92 μmol kg 1h 1 which did not vary significantly over time in m treatment the rates increased from 141 30 17 01 μmol kg 1h 1 on day 0 to 288 80 25 02 μmol kg 1h 1 on day 20 and then gradually declined to 152 95 15 21 μmol kg 1h 1 on day 90 similarly the rates in h treatment increased from 307 82 23 72 μmol kg 1h 1 on day 0 to 755 31 53 37 μmol kg 1h 1 on day 20 and then decreased to 404 44 26 51 μmol kg 1h 1 on day 90 the rates in two treatments were significantly higher than that in the blank at all the nine time points p 0 01 the production rates of ch4 responded quickly to the bait input fig 5 b in the blank the production rates of ch4 were stable and remained at low levels 0 62 1 22 μmol kg 1h 1 however the rates in the m 94 05 10 69 μmol kg 1h 1 and h 190 63 19 20 μmol kg 1h 1 treatments were both significantly higher than those in the blank 1 02 0 09 μmol kg 1h 1 p 0 001 on day 0 afterwards the rates slowed down and reached 8 34 1 52 μmol kg 1h 1 and 17 12 3 90 μmol kg 1h 1 in m treatment and h treatment on day 30 respectively which were also significantly higher than those in the blank 0 81 0 13 μmol kg 1h 1 on day 90 the rates in h treatment 4 33 0 55 μmol kg 1h 1 were still significantly higher than those in the blank 0 62 0 12 μmol kg 1h 1 while no significant difference existed between the blank and m treatment 1 69 0 85 μmol kg 1h 1 the production rates of n2o in the blank and two treatments showed no significant differences on day 0 while the rates in two treatments were even significantly lower than those in the blank p 0 01 on day 5 fig 5 c starting from day 10 the rates enhanced substantially in m treatment in comparison with the blank p 0 01 which increased from 589 96 74 48 nmol kg 1h 1 on day 10 to 1352 62 208 32 nmol kg 1h 1 on day 20 and then decreased to 321 83 50 87 nmol kg 1h 1 on day 90 for h treatment the rates on day 10 were still lower than the blank but increased from 177 90 30 54 nmol kg 1h 1 on day 15 to 2159 34 355 82 nmol kg 1h 1 on day 30 and then decreased to 605 00 133 05 nmol kg 1h 1 on day 90 during day 15 to day 90 the rates in h treatment were significantly higher than the blank the overall ghgs production rates were calculated by converting ch4 and n2o production rates to co2 equivalent co2e rates and summing up co2e rates of co2 ch4 and n2o together fig 5 d the rates in the blank were 1 00 mg co2e kg 1h 1 to 1 84 mg co2e kg 1h 1 in m treatment the rates decreased from 48 61 5 58 mg co2e kg 1h 1 to 29 03 1 96 mg co2e kg 1h 1 during day 0 to day 10 and then slightly increased to 36 69 4 57 mg co2e kg 1h 1 on day 20 and continuously decreased during day 20 to day 90 and reached 11 24 1 37 mg co2e kg 1h 1 on day 90 in h treatment the rates also first decreased from 99 07 9 58 mg co2e kg 1h 1 to 44 50 6 31 mg co2e kg 1h 1 during day 0 to day 15 and then increased to 70 78 5 93 mg co2e kg 1h 1 on day 20 and continuously decreased during day 20 to day 90 and reached 26 79 2 86 mg co2e kg 1h 1 on day 90 altogether the rates in two treatments were both significantly higher than those in the blank during the 90 day incubation experiment p 0 01 in addition along with significantly reduced overlying water do concentration induced by bait input fig 2 and fig 5 e p 0 001 for all both co2 and ch4 production rates were strongly negatively correlated with overlying water do concentration fig 5 f 3 4 interactions between physicochemical properties microbial community and ghgs production mantel test revealed strong correlations between environmental variables and sediment microbial community r 0 87 p 0 001 table s5 regarding pearson correlation analyses two alpha diversity indices chao 1 and inverse simpson showed significantly positive correlations with do of overlying water as well as sediment bulk density and toc tn while simultaneously negatively correlated with water content toc tn sulfide nh4 din and ghgs production rates a few genera also showed such consistent patterns and all these lineages displayed significant decreases in relative abundance in two treatments compared with the blank in comparison most of the correlations with statistical significance between significantly increasing genera and environmental variables showed reverse patterns fig 6 4 discussion over the past decades a large area of coastal wetland has been reclaimed due to economic and social development and aquaculture pond is a major way of wetland reclamation cao et al 2011 china has the largest area of aquaculture ponds in the world with many of them widely distributed in the subtropical estuarine and coastal regions yang et al 2020 the aquaculture ponds are generally maintained by daily supply of bait with a relatively low utilization efficiency 4 0 27 4 chen et al 2016 consequently remaining unutilized bait could deposit on surface sediment which may lead to great changes in sediment physicochemical properties microbial community and biological activities 4 1 most physicochemical properties showed significant responses to bait input in this study significantly higher water content and lower sediment bulk density were observed after bait input which might be attributed to the large amounts of gasses co2 ch4 h2s n2o etc arisen from decomposition of excess bait in sediment gas pressure shaped abundant pores or voids in sediment and water molecules subsequently filled up these pores or voids through inward diffusion this observation showed consistency with a previous study about the comparison between those in reclamation aquaculture ponds and natural marsh wetland gao et al 2018 suggesting that mudflat reclamation and bait input can seriously change sediment physical properties in addition these pores or voids act as structures that connect the interior sediment with the overlying water and allow for diffusion of o2 and nutrients through walls this physical change may enhance the vertical nutrients delivery which in return stimulate the processes of biogeochemical cycles in deeper sediments however verification of this conjecture requires more comprehensive and further study as we all know the expansion of aquaculture operations can induce great risks to estuarine and coastal ecosystems such as reactive nitrogen accumulation which leads to eutrophication loss of biodiversity and increased emissions of nh3 and n2o luo et al 2018 aquaculture sediments are generally characterized by high organic matter and nutrients contents and bait is supposed to be a main source of them lv et al 2018 overlying water do was significantly and continuously reduced with the increasing amount of bait input in this study which is mainly attributed to the oxygen demand from bait degradation benthic hypoxia or even anoxia can occur when the flux of organic matter input exceeds oxygen input which may impact on the distribution and abundance of some potential pathogens and probiotic bacteria and further influence health status of cultured species zeng et al 2021 this study revealed that bait input can significantly increase sediment toc tn and nh4 contents p 0 01 and such co occurrence potentially fostered risks of eutrophication intriguingly overlying water nh4 was reduced in bait input treatments and was even below 30 μm on day 0 65 in h treatment nh4 immobilization nitrification and anammox are three major nh4 removal processes in aquatic environments on the condition of heavily bait input sediment organic matter and overlying water doc generally decreased with time implying that nh4 produced by nitrogen mineralization was higher than that consumed by nh4 immobilization in both overlying water and sediments meanwhile substantial nitrification products were not detected in h treatment 0 24 06 μm no2 and 0 5 03 μm no3 thus it was speculated that partial nitrification coupled with denitrification anammox may become important nitrogen removal processes in anaerobic environments with limited electron acceptors liu et al 2017 also significantly negative correlation between overlying water do and nh4 in h treatment fig s3a further evidenced increasing nitrogen removal rates along with decreasing do 3 mg l 1 as previous observations in wastewater treatment plants jenni et al 2014 jia et al 2020 sediment sulfide was also significantly enhanced by bait input in this study the increment sulfide is mainly generated by bait decomposition and can also result from sulfate so4 2 reduction with high organic loading canfield et al 1993 organic carbon can not only serve as electron donor but also create an anaerobic condition to stimulate this process lam and kuypers 2011 the relationship between sulfide and reactive nitrogen removal is still debatable in aquatic ecosystems jensen et al 2008 lin et al 2017 caffrey et al 2019 heavily bait input induced significantly negative correlation between sediment sulfide and din fig s3b evidencing that high sulfide concentration 41 6 394 91 μg s g 1 may inhibit nitrogen removal this result was consistent with several previous studies reported in sediments with high sulfide concentration jensen et al 2008 aelion and warttinger 2010 caffrey et al 2019 for one thing the toxicity of sulfide for affecting enzyme activity cellular structure and physiological functions of aquatic organisms bagarinao et al 1992 for another significantly enhanced level of sediment nh4 and relative static nox collectively suggested sulfide inhibition of nitrification through nitrification coupled with denitrification anammox process joye and hollibaugh 1995 an and gardner 2002 meanwhile high sulfide content can inhibit n2o reductase nosz and result in n2o accumulation and emission reyes avila et al 2004 as expected both n2o production rates and n2o co2 were largely enhanced by bait input in the middle and late stages 20 90 d which may be associated with high sulfide and organic carbon concentrations thus the reduced production and increased removal of sulfide can assure a healthy environment for aquaculture animals and reduce n2o emissions in aquaculture ecosystems 4 2 bait input altered microbial community diversity and composition sediment microbial community were modified by bait input driven by a series of environmental factors after bait input sediment microbial community exhibited much lower richness and diversity indicating the simplification of microbial community the result is in line with previous studies on fertilization experimental fields ramirez et al 2010 zeng et al 2016 also the decrease of community alpha diversity following bait input indicated the change of soil productivity xun et al 2018 regarding community composition the major phyla in the blank included proteobacteria actinobacteriota and chloroflexi comparable with microbial community composition in natural coastal wetland in southeast china wang et al 2012 in comparison firmicutes and bacteroidota became prevalent after bait input and these phyla have been recognized as dominant lineages in sediment of aquaculture environment in guangdong china xiong et al 2015 intriguingly we also found that acidobacteriota and chloroflexi are generally aerobic slow growing and oligotrophic taxa while firmicutes and bacteroidota are generally anaerobic fast growing and copiotrophic in soils or sediments eilers et al 2010 fierer et al 2012 xun et al 2018 the increase of firmicutes and bacteroidota accompanying the decrease of acidobacteriota and chloroflexi were induced by bait input which should be mainly associated with enhanced input of organic matter significant positive correlations between organic matter toc and tn and alpha diversity indices as well as significant mantel r statistics values further evidenced that toc and tn had significant impacts on sediment microbial community changes in sediment organic matter and associated microbial community characteristics could influence sediment carbon storage and cycling cusack et al 2011 in addition dozens of genera displayed significant increases or decreases in relative abundance in two treatments compared with the blank over time these genera could be indicators for soil health and productivity kennedy and stubbs 2006 the effects of bait input on environmental factors and sediment microbial community are likely time dependent doc of overlying water and sediment toc tn and sulfide were higher in two treatments compared with the blank while these properties showed reduction at later time points initial high relative abundances of several genera in the bait input treatment such as opportunistic pathogenic bacterial genera clostridium acinetobacter and pseudomonas doughari et al 2011 xiong et al 2015 also decreased over time instead the relative abundance of potential probiotic bacteria such as bacillus for cultured shrimp zhang et al 2016 steadily increased overall the evidence collectively suggested when encountering perturbation e g mineral fertilization and carbon amendment coastal wetland ecosystems possess quick responses and long term resilience allison and martiny 2008 4 3 bait input profoundly enhanced sediment ghgs production and global warming potential coastal wetland reclamation and nutrients input from aquaculture and agriculture activities to the ecosystems can strengthen ghgs production castillo et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 and subsequently result in the loss of carbon stock and the acceleration of nitrogen biochemical processes peng et al 2021 this study revealed that bait input induced fast ghgs production during the first one month and afterwards the rates slowed down but were still promoted significantly relative to the blank considering the overall ghgs production rates in the blank co2 was the dominant gas species followed by ch4 and n2o had less contributions agreed with previously reported deng et al 2020 three main ghgs responded to bait input in different ways to be specific ch4 showed the most rapid response to bait input relative to the blank ch4 production rates on day 0 were higher by 92 and 187 fold in medially and heavily bait input treatments respectively by contrast the highest fold change values of co2 production rates medially bait input treatment 33 fold heavily bait input treatment 89 fold and n2o medially bait input treatment 78 fold heavily bait input treatment 109 fold were detected on day 20 the highest fold change values of overall ghgs production rates were also detected on day 20 medially bait input treatment 36 fold heavily bait input treatment 70 fold such patterns backed the statement that initial land use shifts towards aquaculture ponds released high rates of ghgs cameron et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 do is supposed to be an important indicator for ghgs production during the aerobic to anaerobic environment as indicated by significant correlations between do and ghgs production as well as markedly increasing production rates along with bait input and oxygen consumption in early stage especially ch4 and co2 fig 5 several previous studies have also demonstrated that ch4 production rates is closely related to the anaerobic environment in various ecosystems raghoebarsing et al 2006 zhu et al 2012 yang et al 2020 meanwhile anaerobic environment can inhibit methane oxidation due to limited electron acceptors e g o2 no3 and so4 2 fan et al 2020 which would favor for ch4 accumulation and emission in aquaculture sediments notably bait input and the anaerobic environment can also significantly enhance the ratio of ch4 to co2 production rates during the first 10 days fig s4 this result is arguably more significant for global warming because ch4 is 28 times the warming potential of co2 ipcc 2013 therefore sufficient aeration during feeding may effectively reduce not only the occurrence of water hypoxia but also the global warming potential of aquaculture ecosystems the results also suggested potential connections between sediment microbial community and ghgs production significant mantel r statistics values and strong pearson s strength were obtained indicating sediment microbial community especially those significantly changed members may play important roles in ghgs production meanwhile as predicted by fprotax processes including fermentation nitrate reduction and nitrogen and nitrite respiration were promoted by bait input implying possible pathways which microbes get involved in ghgs production through additional work beyond taxonomic level is needed to clarify the interactions between microbial community and ghgs production the rapid growth in ghgs production owing to bait input is a nonnegligible ecological concern the coastal wetland area for aquaculture purpose has increased from 1 81 103 km2 in 1984 to 6 06 103 km2 in 2016 in china ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china 1985 2017 according to the data obtained in this study the average sediment bulk density was 0 41 0 07 g cm 3 and 0 39 0 06 g cm 3 for medially and heavily bait input respectively compared with the blank the increment of ghgs production rates were 24 40 mg co2e kg 1 h 1 and 50 12 mg co2e kg 1h 1 for medially and heavily bait input respectively fig 7 based on these data if bait was medially 20 mg bait g 1 sediment added the increased aquaculture area 4 25 103 km2 from the coastal wetland could produce 4 31 106 t co2e more ghgs within 90 days in china if bait was heavily 40 mg bait g 1 sediment added the estimation can potentially further increase to 8 71 106 t co2e the increment cumulative co2e production from the increased aquaculture area 4 25 103 km2 with medially and heavily bait input accounted for approximately 0 01 and 0 02 respectively of the global ghgs fluxes 4 94 1010 t co2e in 2016 ge 2020 despite only covering approximately 0 0008 of the earth s surface area 5 1 108 km2 these results indicated that the aquaculture ecosystem is an important hotspot for global ghgs emission therefore issues of bait input and utilization as well as coastal wetland reclamation should be taken seriously which could provide important data support for the realization of emission peak and carbon neutrality in china to obtain more accurate estimates future measurement of production rates and construction of prediction models should take diurnal variations in ghgs production into consideration also ghgs produced in aquaculture animals guts and those generally unquantified pathways in aquaculture systems including emissions induced by ebullition draining refilling aeration and sludge and effluent emission should also be included 5 conclusions bait input induced temporal effects on sediment microbial responses and ghgs production in coastal wetland ecosystem firstly physicochemical properties of overlying water and sediment were significantly altered secondly bait input led to significant loss of microbial community richness and diversity and strongly altered microbial compositions from aerobic slow growing and oligotrophic actinobacteriota chloroflexi and acidobacteriota to anaerobic fast growing and copiotrophic firmicutes and bacteroidota communities moreover both ghgs production and global warming potential were obviously enhanced by bait input although ghgs production rates inclined to recovery within the 90 day observations the rates were still promoted significantly based on these results several management measures for ghg emission reduction in aquaculture ecosystems can be raised for one thing wetland reclamation should be reduced and wetland restoration should be attached great importance in future for another some effective strategies e g improving bait utilization and ensuring sufficient do should be designed to reduce ghgs emission and global warming potential in aquaculture this study emphasized the need to assess the effects of land use conversion of coastal wetland to aquaculture suggesting that effective management of aquaculture systems through land use conversion is urgently required data availability the amplicon

16003,coastal wetland reclamation contributed to development of aquaculture industry and the residual bait accumulation in aquaculture processes could influence biogeochemical elements cycling which threaten ecological functions and services in aquaculture and adjacent ecosystems however systematic studies for changes in sediment microbial community structure and greenhouse gasses ghgs production as well as environmental parameters following bait input at time scale are still rare a 90 day incubation experiment was conducted using sediment collected from coastal wetland in qi ao island in southern china followed by the observations of temporal variations of physicochemical properties sediment microbial community and ghgs production in response to different amounts of bait input 0 20 and 40 mg bait g 1 wet sediment the results showed that dissolved oxygen of overlying water was profoundly decreased owing to bait input while dissolved organic carbon of overlying water and several sediment properties e g organic matter sulfide and ammonium varied in reverse patterns meanwhile bait input led to significant loss of microbial community richness and diversity and strongly altered microbial compositions from aerobic slow growing and oligotrophic actinobacteriota chloroflexi and acidobacteriota to anaerobic fast growing and copiotrophic firmicutes and bacteroidota moreover both ghgs production and global warming potential were significantly enhanced by bait input implying that aquaculture ecosystem is an important hotspot for global ghgs emission overall bait input triggered quick responses of physicochemical properties sediment microbial community and ghgs production followed by long term resilience of the ecosystem this study could provide new insight into temporal interactive effects of bait input on physicochemical properties microbial community and ghgs production which can enhance the understanding of the temporal dynamics and ecological impacts of coastal aquaculture activities and emphasize the necessity of sustainable assessment and management in aquaculture ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bait input microbial community greenhouse gases production aquaculture coastal wetland reclamation 1 introduction aquaculture is an important complement to the supply of global fishery resources especially in developing countries fao 2020 aquaculture in china has made remarkable achievements in recent decades which is becoming the world s largest producer consumer processor and exporter of aquaculture products wu et al 2014 luo et al 2018 the total mariculture production of china increased from 6 38 105 t in 1984 to 1 96 107 t in 2016 and the total mariculture area also increased from 2 42 103 km2 in 1984 to 2 17 104 km2 23 of the global total in 2016 ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china 1985 2017 rapid aquaculture development greatly increased the inputs of reactive nitrogen in aquaculture ecosystem from 9 43 tg n yr 1 in 1978 to 18 54 tg n yr 1 in 2015 in china luo et al 2018 thus the rapid development of aquaculture has sustained aquatic food production but has also led to a host of environmental problems such as hypoxia expansion increased harmful blooms of cyanobacteria and eutrophication accelerating greenhouse gasses ghgs emission and widespread pollution wu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2020 to meet the demand of unprecedentedly rapid development of aquaculture industry land use conversion has stimulated the expansion of coastal aquaculture area and the loss of natural coastal wetland mainly including estuarine and coastal waters seagrasses mangroves saltmarshes etc richards and friess 2016 in china coastal earthen ponds from the tidal flat reclamation accounted for 28 of the total mariculture area in 2016 which contributed more than 31 of the total mariculture production ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china 2017 the loss of wetlands and arable land contributed over 50 to the construction of land based aquaculture ponds ren et al 2019 and it has exerted a profound and complex impact on the ecological functions and services delivery underlying coastal wetland ecosystem murray et al 2019 therefore it is of ecological and environmental significance to investigate the biogeochemical cycles in land use conversion of coastal wetland to aquaculture bait is the major input source of organic matter and pollutant in aquaculture ecosystems a small proportion of input bait 4 0 27 4 is utilized by cultured animals chen et al 2016 and most uneaten bait accumulates in sediment which causes some serious environmental issues shen et al 2020 meanwhile sediment acts as an important source of excess organic carbon nitrogenous compounds and other substances to the water column hargreaves 1998 murphy et al 2016 such excess gives rise to a series of negative effects on the aquaculture water and the surrounding environment such as eutrophication and biodiversity loss and a vast amount of ammonia nh3 hydrogen sulfide and ghgs emissions feng et al 2004 according to the quantification of nitrogen budgets aquaculture significantly aggravated ammonium nh4 and nitrogen loadings to coastal wetland by promoting the production of bioavailable nh4 and through sediment discharge which poses risk of eutrophication wu et al 2014 gao et al 2019 however the effects of bait input on the sediment physicochemical properties microbial community and ghgs production have not been simultaneously well studied at time scale to determine the effects of bait input on sediment physicochemical properties microbial community and ghgs production at time scale an incubation experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions for 90 days in this study the main objectives of this study were to 1 elucidate the temporal variations of responses of sediment microbial community to bait input and determine the key environmental drivers in coastal wetland ecosystem 2 evaluate ghgs production and estimate global warming potential under different levels of bait input this study can enhance the understanding of the temporal dynamics and ecological impacts of coastal aquaculture activities as well as facilitating the sustainable management and development of coastal

ghgs production rates measurements potential production rates of ghgs were determined with a headspace technique based on the vapor liquid equilibrium holland et al 1999 using the ideal gas law henry

enhancement of sediment toc tn was detected during the 90 day incubation experiment bait input induced both sediment sulfide and no3 to peak on day 5 and then decline overlying water doc exhibited an early sharp increase followed by a gradually decrease in both treatments while the counterparts in the blank remained stable at relative low levels 2 72 4 10 mg l 1 for most properties the trends in two treatments were consistent and to a lesser extent in m treatment 3 2 bait input modified sediment microbial community structure over time according to the alpha diversity metrics bait input led to significant microbial community richness and diversity loss fig 3 a table s4 the chao1 estimator values ranged from 5109 223 to 5863 97 in the blank and it was significantly diminished to 3676 4027 p 0 01 and 2833 3561 p 0 001 in the m and h treatments respectively the range of inverse simpson index in the m 29 76 85 09 and h 13 78 57 75 treatments were both significantly lower than that in the blank 314 13 427 10 p 0 01 meanwhile both chao1 and inverse simpson index in h treatment were significantly lower than those in m treatment thus higher bait amount influenced community richness and diversity more intensively according to bray curtis based non metric multidimensional scaling nmds samples in the same treatment were tightly clustered together fig 3 b analysis of similarities anosim also revealed that the blank and two treatments harbored distinct microbial communities r 0 95 p 0 001 community structure continued to shift within two treatments representing obvious community succession throughout the experimental time course whereas unclear trend of the shifts over time in the microbial community structure was observed within the blank fig 3 b consistent observations were also obtained through anosim the blank r 0 43 m treatment r 0 94 h treatment r 0 98 p 0 001 for all at the phylum level the count number of abundant phyla relative abundance 1 in the blank was 10 14 which was higher than that of the m 8 10 and h 6 8 treatments fig 3 c similar to the observation in sediment before the incubation experiment fig s1 proteobacteria 21 99 27 32 actinobacteriota 18 12 23 23 chloroflexi 14 03 16 99 and acidobacteriota 9 18 15 13 were most abundant in the blank but less abundant in the m and h treatment proteobacteria 7 56 20 35 except on day 0 in m treatment actinobacteriota 6 34 15 67 chloroflexi 2 74 7 36 acidobacteriota 1 80 5 15 alternatively bait input significantly increased relative abundance of firmicutes and bacteroidota in m treatment firmicutes was initially promoted from 28 29 0 75 on day 0 to 33 92 4 63 on day 5 and then gradually decreased to 19 66 0 13 by the final time point day 90 in h treatment firmicutes was overwhelmingly the most abundant comprising 40 59 50 05 of the total microbial community meanwhile bacteroidota was a rising phylum over time in both treatments in m treatment the relative abundance of bacteroidota was initially the lowest 9 10 0 51 which bloomed to 16 30 18 95 on day 5 45 and over 24 on day 60 90 in h treatment the relative abundance of bacteroidota was 3 10 8 87 during the first five days and then increased to 18 56 0 04 on day 10 and 27 16 29 79 at later time points a total of 24 and 25 genera displayed significant increases and decreases in relative abundance in two treatments compared with the blank at one or more time points respectively corrected p 0 05 fig 4 four genera affiliated with firmicutes were significantly promoted by bait input throughout the incubation experiment the relative abundances of which relied on bait input amount another 11 genera affiliated with firmicutes were also significantly enriched in two treatments at different time points acetobacteroides affiliated with bacteroidota was sparse in the blank relative abundance 0 01 which steadily increased from 0 57 0 08 on day 0 to 17 84 2 98 on day 90 in m treatment and became the most abundant genera in h treatment during day 10 90 with the relative abundance 13 56 24 82 in contrast several genera were significantly inhibited by bait input at all the nine time points including three genera affiliated with actinobacteriota one genus affiliated with chloroflexi one genus affiliated with gemmatimonadota and two genera affiliated with proteobacteria functional prediction by faprotax revealed that bait input induced the increase of fermentation by more than ten fold several processes involved in biogeochemical elements cycling were further strengthened by high bait input amount including respiration of nitrogen and sulfur compounds and nitrogen fixation fig s2 3 3 bait input altered the ghgs production rates over time the production rates of co2 were significantly enhanced by bait input fig 5 a the rates in the blank were 7 31 μmol kg 1 h 1 to 26 92 μmol kg 1h 1 which did not vary significantly over time in m treatment the rates increased from 141 30 17 01 μmol kg 1h 1 on day 0 to 288 80 25 02 μmol kg 1h 1 on day 20 and then gradually declined to 152 95 15 21 μmol kg 1h 1 on day 90 similarly the rates in h treatment increased from 307 82 23 72 μmol kg 1h 1 on day 0 to 755 31 53 37 μmol kg 1h 1 on day 20 and then decreased to 404 44 26 51 μmol kg 1h 1 on day 90 the rates in two treatments were significantly higher than that in the blank at all the nine time points p 0 01 the production rates of ch4 responded quickly to the bait input fig 5 b in the blank the production rates of ch4 were stable and remained at low levels 0 62 1 22 μmol kg 1h 1 however the rates in the m 94 05 10 69 μmol kg 1h 1 and h 190 63 19 20 μmol kg 1h 1 treatments were both significantly higher than those in the blank 1 02 0 09 μmol kg 1h 1 p 0 001 on day 0 afterwards the rates slowed down and reached 8 34 1 52 μmol kg 1h 1 and 17 12 3 90 μmol kg 1h 1 in m treatment and h treatment on day 30 respectively which were also significantly higher than those in the blank 0 81 0 13 μmol kg 1h 1 on day 90 the rates in h treatment 4 33 0 55 μmol kg 1h 1 were still significantly higher than those in the blank 0 62 0 12 μmol kg 1h 1 while no significant difference existed between the blank and m treatment 1 69 0 85 μmol kg 1h 1 the production rates of n2o in the blank and two treatments showed no significant differences on day 0 while the rates in two treatments were even significantly lower than those in the blank p 0 01 on day 5 fig 5 c starting from day 10 the rates enhanced substantially in m treatment in comparison with the blank p 0 01 which increased from 589 96 74 48 nmol kg 1h 1 on day 10 to 1352 62 208 32 nmol kg 1h 1 on day 20 and then decreased to 321 83 50 87 nmol kg 1h 1 on day 90 for h treatment the rates on day 10 were still lower than the blank but increased from 177 90 30 54 nmol kg 1h 1 on day 15 to 2159 34 355 82 nmol kg 1h 1 on day 30 and then decreased to 605 00 133 05 nmol kg 1h 1 on day 90 during day 15 to day 90 the rates in h treatment were significantly higher than the blank the overall ghgs production rates were calculated by converting ch4 and n2o production rates to co2 equivalent co2e rates and summing up co2e rates of co2 ch4 and n2o together fig 5 d the rates in the blank were 1 00 mg co2e kg 1h 1 to 1 84 mg co2e kg 1h 1 in m treatment the rates decreased from 48 61 5 58 mg co2e kg 1h 1 to 29 03 1 96 mg co2e kg 1h 1 during day 0 to day 10 and then slightly increased to 36 69 4 57 mg co2e kg 1h 1 on day 20 and continuously decreased during day 20 to day 90 and reached 11 24 1 37 mg co2e kg 1h 1 on day 90 in h treatment the rates also first decreased from 99 07 9 58 mg co2e kg 1h 1 to 44 50 6 31 mg co2e kg 1h 1 during day 0 to day 15 and then increased to 70 78 5 93 mg co2e kg 1h 1 on day 20 and continuously decreased during day 20 to day 90 and reached 26 79 2 86 mg co2e kg 1h 1 on day 90 altogether the rates in two treatments were both significantly higher than those in the blank during the 90 day incubation experiment p 0 01 in addition along with significantly reduced overlying water do concentration induced by bait input fig 2 and fig 5 e p 0 001 for all both co2 and ch4 production rates were strongly negatively correlated with overlying water do concentration fig 5 f 3 4 interactions between physicochemical properties microbial community and ghgs production mantel test revealed strong correlations between environmental variables and sediment microbial community r 0 87 p 0 001 table s5 regarding pearson correlation analyses two alpha diversity indices chao 1 and inverse simpson showed significantly positive correlations with do of overlying water as well as sediment bulk density and toc tn while simultaneously negatively correlated with water content toc tn sulfide nh4 din and ghgs production rates a few genera also showed such consistent patterns and all these lineages displayed significant decreases in relative abundance in two treatments compared with the blank in comparison most of the correlations with statistical significance between significantly increasing genera and environmental variables showed reverse patterns fig 6 4 discussion over the past decades a large area of coastal wetland has been reclaimed due to economic and social development and aquaculture pond is a major way of wetland reclamation cao et al 2011 china has the largest area of aquaculture ponds in the world with many of them widely distributed in the subtropical estuarine and coastal regions yang et al 2020 the aquaculture ponds are generally maintained by daily supply of bait with a relatively low utilization efficiency 4 0 27 4 chen et al 2016 consequently remaining unutilized bait could deposit on surface sediment which may lead to great changes in sediment physicochemical properties microbial community and biological activities 4 1 most physicochemical properties showed significant responses to bait input in this study significantly higher water content and lower sediment bulk density were observed after bait input which might be attributed to the large amounts of gasses co2 ch4 h2s n2o etc arisen from decomposition of excess bait in sediment gas pressure shaped abundant pores or voids in sediment and water molecules subsequently filled up these pores or voids through inward diffusion this observation showed consistency with a previous study about the comparison between those in reclamation aquaculture ponds and natural marsh wetland gao et al 2018 suggesting that mudflat reclamation and bait input can seriously change sediment physical properties in addition these pores or voids act as structures that connect the interior sediment with the overlying water and allow for diffusion of o2 and nutrients through walls this physical change may enhance the vertical nutrients delivery which in return stimulate the processes of biogeochemical cycles in deeper sediments however verification of this conjecture requires more comprehensive and further study as we all know the expansion of aquaculture operations can induce great risks to estuarine and coastal ecosystems such as reactive nitrogen accumulation which leads to eutrophication loss of biodiversity and increased emissions of nh3 and n2o luo et al 2018 aquaculture sediments are generally characterized by high organic matter and nutrients contents and bait is supposed to be a main source of them lv et al 2018 overlying water do was significantly and continuously reduced with the increasing amount of bait input in this study which is mainly attributed to the oxygen demand from bait degradation benthic hypoxia or even anoxia can occur when the flux of organic matter input exceeds oxygen input which may impact on the distribution and abundance of some potential pathogens and probiotic bacteria and further influence health status of cultured species zeng et al 2021 this study revealed that bait input can significantly increase sediment toc tn and nh4 contents p 0 01 and such co occurrence potentially fostered risks of eutrophication intriguingly overlying water nh4 was reduced in bait input treatments and was even below 30 μm on day 0 65 in h treatment nh4 immobilization nitrification and anammox are three major nh4 removal processes in aquatic environments on the condition of heavily bait input sediment organic matter and overlying water doc generally decreased with time implying that nh4 produced by nitrogen mineralization was higher than that consumed by nh4 immobilization in both overlying water and sediments meanwhile substantial nitrification products were not detected in h treatment 0 24 06 μm no2 and 0 5 03 μm no3 thus it was speculated that partial nitrification coupled with denitrification anammox may become important nitrogen removal processes in anaerobic environments with limited electron acceptors liu et al 2017 also significantly negative correlation between overlying water do and nh4 in h treatment fig s3a further evidenced increasing nitrogen removal rates along with decreasing do 3 mg l 1 as previous observations in wastewater treatment plants jenni et al 2014 jia et al 2020 sediment sulfide was also significantly enhanced by bait input in this study the increment sulfide is mainly generated by bait decomposition and can also result from sulfate so4 2 reduction with high organic loading canfield et al 1993 organic carbon can not only serve as electron donor but also create an anaerobic condition to stimulate this process lam and kuypers 2011 the relationship between sulfide and reactive nitrogen removal is still debatable in aquatic ecosystems jensen et al 2008 lin et al 2017 caffrey et al 2019 heavily bait input induced significantly negative correlation between sediment sulfide and din fig s3b evidencing that high sulfide concentration 41 6 394 91 μg s g 1 may inhibit nitrogen removal this result was consistent with several previous studies reported in sediments with high sulfide concentration jensen et al 2008 aelion and warttinger 2010 caffrey et al 2019 for one thing the toxicity of sulfide for affecting enzyme activity cellular structure and physiological functions of aquatic organisms bagarinao et al 1992 for another significantly enhanced level of sediment nh4 and relative static nox collectively suggested sulfide inhibition of nitrification through nitrification coupled with denitrification anammox process joye and hollibaugh 1995 an and gardner 2002 meanwhile high sulfide content can inhibit n2o reductase nosz and result in n2o accumulation and emission reyes avila et al 2004 as expected both n2o production rates and n2o co2 were largely enhanced by bait input in the middle and late stages 20 90 d which may be associated with high sulfide and organic carbon concentrations thus the reduced production and increased removal of sulfide can assure a healthy environment for aquaculture animals and reduce n2o emissions in aquaculture ecosystems 4 2 bait input altered microbial community diversity and composition sediment microbial community were modified by bait input driven by a series of environmental factors after bait input sediment microbial community exhibited much lower richness and diversity indicating the simplification of microbial community the result is in line with previous studies on fertilization experimental fields ramirez et al 2010 zeng et al 2016 also the decrease of community alpha diversity following bait input indicated the change of soil productivity xun et al 2018 regarding community composition the major phyla in the blank included proteobacteria actinobacteriota and chloroflexi comparable with microbial community composition in natural coastal wetland in southeast china wang et al 2012 in comparison firmicutes and bacteroidota became prevalent after bait input and these phyla have been recognized as dominant lineages in sediment of aquaculture environment in guangdong china xiong et al 2015 intriguingly we also found that acidobacteriota and chloroflexi are generally aerobic slow growing and oligotrophic taxa while firmicutes and bacteroidota are generally anaerobic fast growing and copiotrophic in soils or sediments eilers et al 2010 fierer et al 2012 xun et al 2018 the increase of firmicutes and bacteroidota accompanying the decrease of acidobacteriota and chloroflexi were induced by bait input which should be mainly associated with enhanced input of organic matter significant positive correlations between organic matter toc and tn and alpha diversity indices as well as significant mantel r statistics values further evidenced that toc and tn had significant impacts on sediment microbial community changes in sediment organic matter and associated microbial community characteristics could influence sediment carbon storage and cycling cusack et al 2011 in addition dozens of genera displayed significant increases or decreases in relative abundance in two treatments compared with the blank over time these genera could be indicators for soil health and productivity kennedy and stubbs 2006 the effects of bait input on environmental factors and sediment microbial community are likely time dependent doc of overlying water and sediment toc tn and sulfide were higher in two treatments compared with the blank while these properties showed reduction at later time points initial high relative abundances of several genera in the bait input treatment such as opportunistic pathogenic bacterial genera clostridium acinetobacter and pseudomonas doughari et al 2011 xiong et al 2015 also decreased over time instead the relative abundance of potential probiotic bacteria such as bacillus for cultured shrimp zhang et al 2016 steadily increased overall the evidence collectively suggested when encountering perturbation e g mineral fertilization and carbon amendment coastal wetland ecosystems possess quick responses and long term resilience allison and martiny 2008 4 3 bait input profoundly enhanced sediment ghgs production and global warming potential coastal wetland reclamation and nutrients input from aquaculture and agriculture activities to the ecosystems can strengthen ghgs production castillo et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 and subsequently result in the loss of carbon stock and the acceleration of nitrogen biochemical processes peng et al 2021 this study revealed that bait input induced fast ghgs production during the first one month and afterwards the rates slowed down but were still promoted significantly relative to the blank considering the overall ghgs production rates in the blank co2 was the dominant gas species followed by ch4 and n2o had less contributions agreed with previously reported deng et al 2020 three main ghgs responded to bait input in different ways to be specific ch4 showed the most rapid response to bait input relative to the blank ch4 production rates on day 0 were higher by 92 and 187 fold in medially and heavily bait input treatments respectively by contrast the highest fold change values of co2 production rates medially bait input treatment 33 fold heavily bait input treatment 89 fold and n2o medially bait input treatment 78 fold heavily bait input treatment 109 fold were detected on day 20 the highest fold change values of overall ghgs production rates were also detected on day 20 medially bait input treatment 36 fold heavily bait input treatment 70 fold such patterns backed the statement that initial land use shifts towards aquaculture ponds released high rates of ghgs cameron et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 do is supposed to be an important indicator for ghgs production during the aerobic to anaerobic environment as indicated by significant correlations between do and ghgs production as well as markedly increasing production rates along with bait input and oxygen consumption in early stage especially ch4 and co2 fig 5 several previous studies have also demonstrated that ch4 production rates is closely related to the anaerobic environment in various ecosystems raghoebarsing et al 2006 zhu et al 2012 yang et al 2020 meanwhile anaerobic environment can inhibit methane oxidation due to limited electron acceptors e g o2 no3 and so4 2 fan et al 2020 which would favor for ch4 accumulation and emission in aquaculture sediments notably bait input and the anaerobic environment can also significantly enhance the ratio of ch4 to co2 production rates during the first 10 days fig s4 this result is arguably more significant for global warming because ch4 is 28 times the warming potential of co2 ipcc 2013 therefore sufficient aeration during feeding may effectively reduce not only the occurrence of water hypoxia but also the global warming potential of aquaculture ecosystems the results also suggested potential connections between sediment microbial community and ghgs production significant mantel r statistics values and strong pearson s strength were obtained indicating sediment microbial community especially those significantly changed members may play important roles in ghgs production meanwhile as predicted by fprotax processes including fermentation nitrate reduction and nitrogen and nitrite respiration were promoted by bait input implying possible pathways which microbes get involved in ghgs production through additional work beyond taxonomic level is needed to clarify the interactions between microbial community and ghgs production the rapid growth in ghgs production owing to bait input is a nonnegligible ecological concern the coastal wetland area for aquaculture purpose has increased from 1 81 103 km2 in 1984 to 6 06 103 km2 in 2016 in china ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic of china 1985 2017 according to the data obtained in this study the average sediment bulk density was 0 41 0 07 g cm 3 and 0 39 0 06 g cm 3 for medially and heavily bait input respectively compared with the blank the increment of ghgs production rates were 24 40 mg co2e kg 1 h 1 and 50 12 mg co2e kg 1h 1 for medially and heavily bait input respectively fig 7 based on these data if bait was medially 20 mg bait g 1 sediment added the increased aquaculture area 4 25 103 km2 from the coastal wetland could produce 4 31 106 t co2e more ghgs within 90 days in china if bait was heavily 40 mg bait g 1 sediment added the estimation can potentially further increase to 8 71 106 t co2e the increment cumulative co2e production from the increased aquaculture area 4 25 103 km2 with medially and heavily bait input accounted for approximately 0 01 and 0 02 respectively of the global ghgs fluxes 4 94 1010 t co2e in 2016 ge 2020 despite only covering approximately 0 0008 of the earth s surface area 5 1 108 km2 these results indicated that the aquaculture ecosystem is an important hotspot for global ghgs emission therefore issues of bait input and utilization as well as coastal wetland reclamation should be taken seriously which could provide important data support for the realization of emission peak and carbon neutrality in china to obtain more accurate estimates future measurement of production rates and construction of prediction models should take diurnal variations in ghgs production into consideration also ghgs produced in aquaculture animals guts and those generally unquantified pathways in aquaculture systems including emissions induced by ebullition draining refilling aeration and sludge and effluent emission should also be included 5 conclusions bait input induced temporal effects on sediment microbial responses and ghgs production in coastal wetland ecosystem firstly physicochemical properties of overlying water and sediment were significantly altered secondly bait input led to significant loss of microbial community richness and diversity and strongly altered microbial compositions from aerobic slow growing and oligotrophic actinobacteriota chloroflexi and acidobacteriota to anaerobic fast growing and copiotrophic firmicutes and bacteroidota communities moreover both ghgs production and global warming potential were obviously enhanced by bait input although ghgs production rates inclined to recovery within the 90 day observations the rates were still promoted significantly based on these results several management measures for ghg emission reduction in aquaculture ecosystems can be raised for one thing wetland reclamation should be reduced and wetland restoration should be attached great importance in future for another some effective strategies e g improving bait utilization and ensuring sufficient do should be designed to reduce ghgs emission and global warming potential in aquaculture this study emphasized the need to assess the effects of land use conversion of coastal wetland to aquaculture suggesting that effective management of aquaculture systems through land use conversion is urgently required data availability the amplicon

16004,adenoviruses are known to be one of the most resistant viruses to uv disinfection this study determined the inactivation kinetics of adenovirus freshly isolated from sewage samples and compared the results with reference adenovirus stocks grown in the laboratory human adenoviruses were isolated from sewage samples using the hek 293 cell line inactivation kinetics for uv irradiation was determined for monochromatic low pressure lp mercury uv lamp 254 nm and polychromatic medium pressure mp mercury uv lamp for each sewage isolate eleven 11 isolates were obtained from nine 9 different sewage samples with most isolates belonging to the enteric adenovirus group specifically adenovirus 41 the average dose required for 4 log inactivation using lp uv lamps for sewage isolates 220 mj cm2 was not significantly different p 0 1 from the average dose reported for lab grown enteric adenovirus 179 6 mj cm2 interestingly the average dose required for 4 log inactivation using mp uv lamps was significantly higher p 0 004 for sewage isolates 124 mj cm2 when compared to the average dose reported for laboratory stocks of adenovirus 40 and 41 71 mj cm2 viral capsid analysis using the propidium monoazide pma qpcr method showed that adenovirus isolates from group f were less affected by exposure to mp uv lamps than adenoviruses from group d and c adenovirus isolates obtained from sewage samples showed greater resistance to uv irradiation compared to laboratory grown strains although required doses for mp uv were still considerably lower than lp uv these data suggest that the required fluence for inactivation of adenoviruses in real world waters may be higher than previously understood graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords human adenovirus uv disinfection water treatment sewage isolates 1 introduction ultraviolet light irradiation is a commonly used technology for disinfection during water and wastewater treatment a uv dose of 40 mj cm2 would provide greater than 4 log inactivation for most waterborne pathogens hijnen et al 2006 however human adenoviruses are one of the most resistant waterborne pathogens to inactivation by uv irradiation requiring a uv dose higher than 150 mj cm2 for 4 log inactivation nwachuku n et al 2005 gerba 2002 thurston et al 2003 therefore adenovirus governs the usepa regulations for uv disinfection of viruses requiring the uv dose to be increased from the standard practice of 40 mj cm2 to 186 mj cm2 in order to obtain 4 log inactivation of viruses pirnie et al 2006 human adenoviruses adv are classified in groups a to g with more than 50 serotypes adenovirus 40 and 41 are associated with gastroenteritis second leading virus in childhood diarrhea worldwide and commonly found in wastewater and surface water contaminated with human fecal material rames et al 2016 fong et al 2010 adenoviruses are non enveloped double stranded dna virus with a genome size around 35 to 37 kbs as an obligatory parasite advs exploit host cells resources for replication including host dna replication machinery because the adenovirus genome is similar to its host cell genome it is believed that the extreme resistance to uv inactivation is because uv damaged viral dna is repaired during the infection process guo et al 2010 damage caused by uv irradiation was observed at similar rate as in other microbes but the damage to adv dna does not ultimately result in reduction of viral infectivity eischeid et al 2009 rodriguez et 2013 this is true for the commonly used low pressure lp uv mercury lamps which emits irradiation at 253 7 nm where the main inactivation mechanism is dna damage preventing replication of dna and eventual inactivation in the case of medium pressure mp uv mercury lamps which emit a polychromatic uv spectrum from 200 nm to 500 mm in addition to damaging viral dna the far uv c wavelengths 225 nm emitted by the mp lamp can also damage viral proteins which enhances the inactivation of adv linden et al 2007 eischeid et al 2009 most of the studies on adv uv inactivation have been performed using the reference strains of adenovirus 40 adenovirus 41 adenovirus 2 and adenovirus 5 continuously propagated in mammalian cell lines gerba et al 2002 shin et al 2009 linden 2007 rattanukul et al 2021 adenoviruses found in the sewage originating from an infected human population are difficult to grow in cell culture therefore information regarding uv disinfection for adenoviruses found in sewage is limited bayley et al 2018 qiu et al 2018 rodriguez et al 2008 the present study aims to investigate the uv disinfection of adenovirus isolated from sewage and to compare the inactivation kinetics with laboratory grown reference adenovirus strains to determine if there differences in their comparative uv resistance and consider the implications for regulatory uv dose requirements for viruses the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the uv lp and mp uv lamps inactivation kinetics of isolated adenovirus from sewage and compare it to uv inactivation of laboratory grown adenovirus 2 40 and 41 and with data from the literature and 2 to study the effect of mp uv polychromatic output on the viral capsid of different environmental isolates of adenovirus for this study infectious adenoviruses were isolated using the hek 293 cell line and adenovirus uv inactivation was measured using the mrna quantitative pcr method the quantitative polymerase reaction qpcr combined with propidium monoazide pre treatment was used to observe the damage on viral capsid caused by exposure mp polychromatic uv lamps 2 materials and methods 2 1 adenovirus stocks and cell culture the hek 293 cells atcc crl 1573 were maintained in eagle s minimum essential medium

propagation the infections were maintained up to 20 days the viruses were recovered by disrupting the infected cells with two freeze thaw cycles and removing the lysed cell debris by centrifugation 3500x g 30 min 4 c the supernatant was retained as virus stock and stored at 80 c 2 2 sewage sample and concentration sewage samples were collected from three separate wastewater treatment plants located in the city of el paso texas usa samples were collected in one liter bottles which were concentrated through organic flocculation by mixing 380 ml of raw sewage with 120 ml of 10 beef extract this mixture yielded a final 500 ml 3 beef extract solution and was transferred to a centrifuge wide 500 ml tube the ph was adjusted to 3 5 while the solution was stirred for 30 min at room temperature then samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 rpm to settle all organics to a pellet the pellets were resuspended into 30 ml of 0 35 m na2hpo4 ph 9 0 followed by readjustment of the ph to 7 0 with 0 1 m naoh solution the sample was further concentrated by peg precipitation 6 peg 0 3 m nacl ph 7 0 with overnight incubation on an orbital shaker at 4 c and 200 rpm the peg precipitated

plants and three sampling dates in el paso county texas from those samples a total of 10 advs isolates were obtained table 1 and propagated to viral concentrations over 107 copies per ml the sequence information obtained in the adv hexon gene was analyzed for each isolate and used for characterization into adenovirus groups the results of the ncbi blast analysis are shown in table 1 seven isolates are aligned with adenovirus group f all adv 41 one adenovirus group c adv 2 and two as adenovirus group d adv 33 and 56 the adenovirus isolated sequences were also compared with adenovirus sequences obtained from ncbi by using a neighbor joining method and presented in a phylogenetic tree fig 1 sewage isolated wild type wt advs that were identified as belonging to group f have high similarities with human adenovirus 41 forming a monophyletic group with adenovirus 41 sequence reported from a stool isolated in china ncbi accession number kt832688 1 the sequences of the laboratory stocks used in this study corresponded to adv 40 dugan strain and adv 41 tak strain and the sequences were different from wt isolates fig 1 calibration of the cc mrna rt qpcr assay was performed for each of the isolates see supplementary information fig s3 the resulting slopes m and intercept b of the calibration curve and the correlation coefficient r2 are presented in table 1 for all the isolates the correlation coefficient r2 was over 0 9 3 2 inactivation of adenovirus by uv irradiation table 2 shows the inactivation rate constant k value and the calculated dose required for 4 log reduction for the sewage isolated advs after lp and mp uv exposure supplementary information figs s4 and s5 for lp uv irradiation average dose for 4 log inactivation for advs isolates belonging to f group was 220 mj cm2 47 mj cm2 the doses observed for laboratory stock of adv40 and adv 41 were 314 mj cm2 and 233 mj cm2 respectively for the mp uv lamps the average dose required for 4 log inactivation of the isolates belonging to the group f adenovirus was 124 4 mj cm2 37 mj cm2 on the other hand the mp uv dose required for 4 log inactivation for adv41 and adv40 was 73 mj cm2 and 71 7 mj cm2 respectively the literature reported uv doses for 4 log inactivation of advs using lp lamps and mp lamps are shown in table 3 for lp lamps 32 reports were found averaging 160 mj cm2 36 5 mj cm2 for mp uv we found 11 different reports with an average of dose 60 mj cm2 21 mj cm2 most of the published results on advs inactivation data were based on adenovirus group c followed by adenovirus from group f the doses for 4 log reduction obtained in the present study are compared with those reported in the literature as illustrated in fig 2 when comparing the dose required for the inactivation of group f there was not a significant difference between the laboratory strains and the wt isolates p 0 1 with the reported 4 log reduction dose for lab strains averaging 179 6 mj cm2 and the wild type isolates averaging a dose of 220 mj cm2 interestingly when comparing all the adenovirus groups the difference between the reported results and the wt isolates was significant p 0 007 in case of medium pressure lamps the difference in the required dose for 4 log inactivation was significant in either of the comparisons made p 0 006 all and p 0 004 group f the average dose required for 4 log reduction for wild type isolates was significantly higher 124 4 mj cm2 than the doses reported in the literature average 71 mj cm2 interestingly for adv 2 wt isolates required very similar doses to those reported in the literature for lab strains for example the average 4 log reduction dose reported for adenovirus 2 was 154 mj cm2 and 42 mj cm2 for lp and mp lamps respectively table 3 for the wt isolates identified as adv 2 this study the doses for 4 log inactivation were 158 mj cm2 and 35 1 mj cm2 for lp and mp lamps respectively 3 3 effect of uv irradiation on viral capsid integrity of sewage isolated adenovirus fig 3 illustrates the impact of uv irradiation from the mp uv polychromatic source on the capsid integrity of various adenoviruses the difference between the pma treated and non treated samples after exposure to mp uv lamps indicates inhibition of pcr from the increased permeability of the viral capsid to pma and subsequent covalent bonding of the pma to the viral nucleic acids no significant difference p 0 05 between the advs groups was observed in the damaged caused to the viral capsid by mp uv exposures at doses equal to or lower than 80 mj cm2 however the results obtained for the viruses exposed to 200 mj cm2 or higher indicated damage to the capsid of all adv types but the effect of pma treatment and therefore capsid damage was significantly lower p 0 016 on the sewage isolates belonging to group f compared to those from group d 4 discussion most of the sewage isolated adenoviruses were identified as adenovirus 41 this observation agrees with other publications where the most dominant adenoviruses species found in sewage were identified as adenovirus 41 followed by adenoviruses from groups c and d these patterns of adenovirus species have been found to be similar in different geographical areas such as europe fernandez cassi et al 2017 orgazaly et al 2015 and taiwan kuo et al 2015 interestingly adenovirus from groups c and b have been found to be the dominant species in sewage and water samples from new england usa bibbi and peccia 2013 and rio de janeiro brazil staggemeier et al 2017 santos et al 2004 therefore variations in dominant adenovirus species could be found between locations and samples and been affected by the epidemiology and specific populations where the residual waters are produced in the case of our research samples were collected from different wwtps and across different seasons on average three months apart between sampling events and in all the samples adenovirus 41 was isolated the different cell lines used for the isolation of infectious adenovirus could also results in the identification of different adenovirus species with the a549 favouring the growth of respiratory adenovirus such as adenovirus from group c and hek 293 likely isolating a higher diversity of adenovirus population including enteric adenovirus ogorzaly et al 2015 reports on the relative effectiveness of different wavelengths of uv have demonstrated that the adenovirus dna will be damaged by irradiation at uv 254 nm e g from a lp lamp at similar rate as that of other organisms but this dna damage does not translate to viral inactivation beck et al 2014 suggesting that viral dna could be repaired during cell culture guo et al 2010 in the case of sewage isolates our hypothesis was that because they are not customized to growth on laboratory cell lines dna repair while on these cells could be less effective than in laboratory strains however our results demonstrated that environmental isolates are equally resistant to lp inactivation as the laboratory propagated stocks of adenovirus 41 and 40 in the case of inactivation by mp uv lamps the sewage isolated adenoviruses were more resistant to inactivation than the laboratory stock for the reference stocks of adv 41 and 40 the dose required for 4 log inactivation was 70 mj cm2 and this dose is similar to results published for those viruses linden et al 2007 however advs isolates from sewage samples groups f and d were significantly more resistant to mp irradiation requiring approximately 120 mj cm2 for 4 log reduction the inactivation mechanism of polychromatic mp uv irradiation for adenovirus results primarily from the lower wavelengths 230 nm damaging the viral proteins of adv beck et al 2018 the resulting protein degradations after exposures to uv wavelengths below 230nm were similar for major adenoviral proteins such as hexon penton capsid iii and core v beck et al 2018 advs proteins are involved in different stages on the initiation of viral infection entering the cell migration to cell nucleus protection of viral dna from cell immune response and initiation of viral gene expression hoeben and uil 2013 therefore there are multiple steps in adenovirus infection cycles that can be inhibited by irradiation with lower wavelengths due to protein damage the pma pre treatment pcr assays determine the permeability of the viral capsid to mono azide dye where increase in permeability could be related to damage of the viral capsid and associated with loss in viral infectivity cliver 2009 parshionikar et al 2010 leifels et al 2020 pma pcr has been successfully used to determine the damage to the viral capsid upon exposure to polychromatic uv sangsanont et al 2014 given the higher resistance of adenovirus isolates from groups f and d to mp uv the pma pcr assay was used to compare the differences in mp uv impact on the capsid proteins between the isolates the pma pcr assay demonstrated that for enteric adenovirus group f adv 41 after exposure to mp uv light the viral capsid permeability to the monoazide dye was less affected than adenoviruses from group d and c tested in this study this increase resistance lower capsid damage may indicate that the viral capsid of enteric adenoviruses is more resistant than the other adenoviruses considering the faecal oral infection route of enteric adenoviruses a more resilient viral capsid could help the virus maintain viability after exposure to environmental stress cliver 2009 therefore selection for a sturdier viral capsid for enteric adv could occur and this sturdy viral capsid could increase resistance to polychromatic uv exposure for the adenoviruses from group d isolated in this study the pma pcr assay demonstrated similar susceptibility to mp uv light as adenovirus from group c however the cell culture infectivity analysis shows that the isolates from group d were as resistant to mp uv irradiation as the isolates from adenovirus group f this discrepancy may indicate possible differences in the viral capsid between both groups that led to different mechanisms of inactivation between both adenovirus groups further studies are needed to improve our understanding of differences in the mechanisms of viral inactivation by polychromatic uv light during potable water reuse advanced wwtps are designed using disinfection treatment as the most important barriers for the removal and inactivation of viruses therefore it is important to understand the factors that govern the inactivation of human viruses found in sewage and the differences from laboratory strains other studies with echovirus 11 have demonstrated the possibility of enrichment for more resistant strains to chlorine dioxide zhong et al 2017 which may indicate the potential of selection for more resistant viruses during some treatment approaches in addition there are physical factors not commonly considered during disinfection studies such as viral aggregation gerba and betancourt 2017 and interaction of viruses with microbial compounds waldman et al 2017 that could have an impact on the inactivation of viruses in sewage 5 conclusion adenovirus isolates obtained from sewage samples showed greater resistance to uv irradiation compared to laboratory grown strains although required doses for mp uv was still considerably lower than lp uv these data suggest that the required fluence for inactivation of adenoviruses in real world waters may be higher than previously understood declaration of competing interest the

16004,adenoviruses are known to be one of the most resistant viruses to uv disinfection this study determined the inactivation kinetics of adenovirus freshly isolated from sewage samples and compared the results with reference adenovirus stocks grown in the laboratory human adenoviruses were isolated from sewage samples using the hek 293 cell line inactivation kinetics for uv irradiation was determined for monochromatic low pressure lp mercury uv lamp 254 nm and polychromatic medium pressure mp mercury uv lamp for each sewage isolate eleven 11 isolates were obtained from nine 9 different sewage samples with most isolates belonging to the enteric adenovirus group specifically adenovirus 41 the average dose required for 4 log inactivation using lp uv lamps for sewage isolates 220 mj cm2 was not significantly different p 0 1 from the average dose reported for lab grown enteric adenovirus 179 6 mj cm2 interestingly the average dose required for 4 log inactivation using mp uv lamps was significantly higher p 0 004 for sewage isolates 124 mj cm2 when compared to the average dose reported for laboratory stocks of adenovirus 40 and 41 71 mj cm2 viral capsid analysis using the propidium monoazide pma qpcr method showed that adenovirus isolates from group f were less affected by exposure to mp uv lamps than adenoviruses from group d and c adenovirus isolates obtained from sewage samples showed greater resistance to uv irradiation compared to laboratory grown strains although required doses for mp uv were still considerably lower than lp uv these data suggest that the required fluence for inactivation of adenoviruses in real world waters may be higher than previously understood graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords human adenovirus uv disinfection water treatment sewage isolates 1 introduction ultraviolet light irradiation is a commonly used technology for disinfection during water and wastewater treatment a uv dose of 40 mj cm2 would provide greater than 4 log inactivation for most waterborne pathogens hijnen et al 2006 however human adenoviruses are one of the most resistant waterborne pathogens to inactivation by uv irradiation requiring a uv dose higher than 150 mj cm2 for 4 log inactivation nwachuku n et al 2005 gerba 2002 thurston et al 2003 therefore adenovirus governs the usepa regulations for uv disinfection of viruses requiring the uv dose to be increased from the standard practice of 40 mj cm2 to 186 mj cm2 in order to obtain 4 log inactivation of viruses pirnie et al 2006 human adenoviruses adv are classified in groups a to g with more than 50 serotypes adenovirus 40 and 41 are associated with gastroenteritis second leading virus in childhood diarrhea worldwide and commonly found in wastewater and surface water contaminated with human fecal material rames et al 2016 fong et al 2010 adenoviruses are non enveloped double stranded dna virus with a genome size around 35 to 37 kbs as an obligatory parasite advs exploit host cells resources for replication including host dna replication machinery because the adenovirus genome is similar to its host cell genome it is believed that the extreme resistance to uv inactivation is because uv damaged viral dna is repaired during the infection process guo et al 2010 damage caused by uv irradiation was observed at similar rate as in other microbes but the damage to adv dna does not ultimately result in reduction of viral infectivity eischeid et al 2009 rodriguez et 2013 this is true for the commonly used low pressure lp uv mercury lamps which emits irradiation at 253 7 nm where the main inactivation mechanism is dna damage preventing replication of dna and eventual inactivation in the case of medium pressure mp uv mercury lamps which emit a polychromatic uv spectrum from 200 nm to 500 mm in addition to damaging viral dna the far uv c wavelengths 225 nm emitted by the mp lamp can also damage viral proteins which enhances the inactivation of adv linden et al 2007 eischeid et al 2009 most of the studies on adv uv inactivation have been performed using the reference strains of adenovirus 40 adenovirus 41 adenovirus 2 and adenovirus 5 continuously propagated in mammalian cell lines gerba et al 2002 shin et al 2009 linden 2007 rattanukul et al 2021 adenoviruses found in the sewage originating from an infected human population are difficult to grow in cell culture therefore information regarding uv disinfection for adenoviruses found in sewage is limited bayley et al 2018 qiu et al 2018 rodriguez et al 2008 the present study aims to investigate the uv disinfection of adenovirus isolated from sewage and to compare the inactivation kinetics with laboratory grown reference adenovirus strains to determine if there differences in their comparative uv resistance and consider the implications for regulatory uv dose requirements for viruses the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the uv lp and mp uv lamps inactivation kinetics of isolated adenovirus from sewage and compare it to uv inactivation of laboratory grown adenovirus 2 40 and 41 and with data from the literature and 2 to study the effect of mp uv polychromatic output on the viral capsid of different environmental isolates of adenovirus for this study infectious adenoviruses were isolated using the hek 293 cell line and adenovirus uv

required for 4 log inactivation and the effect of pma qpcr at different doses 3 results 3 1 isolation of adenovirus from sewage samples samples were collected from three different wastewater treatment plants and three sampling dates in el paso county texas from those samples a total of 10 advs isolates were obtained table 1 and propagated to viral concentrations over 107 copies per ml the sequence information obtained in the adv hexon gene was analyzed for each isolate and used for characterization into adenovirus groups the results of the ncbi blast analysis are shown in table 1 seven isolates are aligned with adenovirus group f all adv 41 one adenovirus group c adv 2 and two as adenovirus group d adv 33 and 56 the adenovirus isolated sequences were also compared with adenovirus sequences obtained from ncbi by using a neighbor joining method and presented in a phylogenetic tree fig 1 sewage isolated wild type wt advs that were identified as belonging to group f have high similarities with human adenovirus 41 forming a monophyletic group with adenovirus 41 sequence reported from a stool isolated in china ncbi accession number kt832688 1 the sequences of the laboratory stocks used in this study corresponded to adv 40 dugan strain and adv 41 tak strain and the sequences were different from wt isolates fig 1 calibration of the cc mrna rt qpcr assay was performed for each of the isolates see supplementary information fig s3 the resulting slopes m and intercept b of the calibration curve and the correlation coefficient r2 are presented in table 1 for all the isolates the correlation coefficient r2 was over 0 9 3 2 inactivation of adenovirus by uv irradiation table 2 shows the inactivation rate constant k value and the calculated dose required for 4 log reduction for the sewage isolated advs after lp and mp uv exposure supplementary information figs s4 and s5 for lp uv irradiation average dose for 4 log inactivation for advs isolates belonging to f group was 220 mj cm2 47 mj cm2 the doses observed for laboratory stock of adv40 and adv 41 were 314 mj cm2 and 233 mj cm2 respectively for the mp uv lamps the average dose required for 4 log inactivation of the isolates belonging to the group f adenovirus was 124 4 mj cm2 37 mj cm2 on the other hand the mp uv dose required for 4 log inactivation for adv41 and adv40 was 73 mj cm2 and 71 7 mj cm2 respectively the literature reported uv doses for 4 log inactivation of advs using lp lamps and mp lamps are shown in table 3 for lp lamps 32 reports were found averaging 160 mj cm2 36 5 mj cm2 for mp uv we found 11 different reports with an average of dose 60 mj cm2 21 mj cm2 most of the published results on advs inactivation data were based on adenovirus group c followed by adenovirus from group f the doses for 4 log reduction obtained in the present study are compared with those reported in the literature as illustrated in fig 2 when comparing the dose required for the inactivation of group f there was not a significant difference between the laboratory strains and the wt isolates p 0 1 with the reported 4 log reduction dose for lab strains averaging 179 6 mj cm2 and the wild type isolates averaging a dose of 220 mj cm2 interestingly when comparing all the adenovirus groups the difference between the reported results and the wt isolates was significant p 0 007 in case of medium pressure lamps the difference in the required dose for 4 log inactivation was significant in either of the comparisons made p 0 006 all and p 0 004 group f the average dose required for 4 log reduction for wild type isolates was significantly higher 124 4 mj cm2 than the doses reported in the literature average 71 mj cm2 interestingly for adv 2 wt isolates required very similar doses to those reported in the literature for lab strains for example the average 4 log reduction dose reported for adenovirus 2 was 154 mj cm2 and 42 mj cm2 for lp and mp lamps respectively table 3 for the wt isolates identified as adv 2 this study the doses for 4 log inactivation were 158 mj cm2 and 35 1 mj cm2 for lp and mp lamps respectively 3 3 effect of uv irradiation on viral capsid integrity of sewage isolated adenovirus fig 3 illustrates the impact of uv irradiation from the mp uv polychromatic source on the capsid integrity of various adenoviruses the difference between the pma treated and non treated samples after exposure to mp uv lamps indicates inhibition of pcr from the increased permeability of the viral capsid to pma and subsequent covalent bonding of the pma to the viral nucleic acids no significant difference p 0 05 between the advs groups was observed in the damaged caused to the viral capsid by mp uv exposures at doses equal to or lower than 80 mj cm2 however the results obtained for the viruses exposed to 200 mj cm2 or higher indicated damage to the capsid of all adv types but the effect of pma treatment and therefore capsid damage was significantly lower p 0 016 on the sewage isolates belonging to group f compared to those from group d 4 discussion most of the sewage isolated adenoviruses were identified as adenovirus 41 this observation agrees with other publications where the most dominant adenoviruses species found in sewage were identified as adenovirus 41 followed by adenoviruses from groups c and d these patterns of adenovirus species have been found to be similar in different geographical areas such as europe fernandez cassi et al 2017 orgazaly et al 2015 and taiwan kuo et al 2015 interestingly adenovirus from groups c and b have been found to be the dominant species in sewage and water samples from new england usa bibbi and peccia 2013 and rio de janeiro brazil staggemeier et al 2017 santos et al 2004 therefore variations in dominant adenovirus species could be found between locations and samples and been affected by the epidemiology and specific populations where the residual waters are produced in the case of our research samples were collected from different wwtps and across different seasons on average three months apart between sampling events and in all the samples adenovirus 41 was isolated the different cell lines used for the isolation of infectious adenovirus could also results in the identification of different adenovirus species with the a549 favouring the growth of respiratory adenovirus such as adenovirus from group c and hek 293 likely isolating a higher diversity of adenovirus population including enteric adenovirus ogorzaly et al 2015 reports on the relative effectiveness of different wavelengths of uv have demonstrated that the adenovirus dna will be damaged by irradiation at uv 254 nm e g from a lp lamp at similar rate as that of other organisms but this dna damage does not translate to viral inactivation beck et al 2014 suggesting that viral dna could be repaired during cell culture guo et al 2010 in the case of sewage isolates our hypothesis was that because they are not customized to growth on laboratory cell lines dna repair while on these cells could be less effective than in laboratory strains however our results demonstrated that environmental isolates are equally resistant to lp inactivation as the laboratory propagated stocks of adenovirus 41 and 40 in the case of inactivation by mp uv lamps the sewage isolated adenoviruses were more resistant to inactivation than the laboratory stock for the reference stocks of adv 41 and 40 the dose required for 4 log inactivation was 70 mj cm2 and this dose is similar to results published for those viruses linden et al 2007 however advs isolates from sewage samples groups f and d were significantly more resistant to mp irradiation requiring approximately 120 mj cm2 for 4 log reduction the inactivation mechanism of polychromatic mp uv irradiation for adenovirus results primarily from the lower wavelengths 230 nm damaging the viral proteins of adv beck et al 2018 the resulting protein degradations after exposures to uv wavelengths below 230nm were similar for major adenoviral proteins such as hexon penton capsid iii and core v beck et al 2018 advs proteins are involved in different stages on the initiation of viral infection entering the cell migration to cell nucleus protection of viral dna from cell immune response and initiation of viral gene expression hoeben and uil 2013 therefore there are multiple steps in adenovirus infection cycles that can be inhibited by irradiation with lower wavelengths due to protein damage the pma pre treatment pcr assays determine the permeability of the viral capsid to mono azide dye where increase in permeability could be related to damage of the viral capsid and associated with loss in viral infectivity cliver 2009 parshionikar et al 2010 leifels et al 2020 pma pcr has been successfully used to determine the damage to the viral capsid upon exposure to polychromatic uv sangsanont et al 2014 given the higher resistance of adenovirus isolates from groups f and d to mp uv the pma pcr assay was used to compare the differences in mp uv impact on the capsid proteins between the isolates the pma pcr assay demonstrated that for enteric adenovirus group f adv 41 after exposure to mp uv light the viral capsid permeability to the monoazide dye was less affected than adenoviruses from group d and c tested in this study this increase resistance lower capsid damage may indicate that the viral capsid of enteric adenoviruses is more resistant than the other adenoviruses considering the faecal oral infection route of enteric adenoviruses a more resilient viral capsid could help the virus maintain viability after exposure to environmental stress cliver 2009 therefore selection for a sturdier viral capsid for enteric adv could occur and this sturdy viral capsid could increase resistance to polychromatic uv exposure for the adenoviruses from group d isolated in this study the pma pcr assay demonstrated similar susceptibility to mp uv light as adenovirus from group c however the cell culture infectivity analysis shows that the isolates from group d were as resistant to mp uv irradiation as the isolates from adenovirus group f this discrepancy may indicate possible differences in the viral capsid between both groups that led to different mechanisms of inactivation between both adenovirus groups further studies are needed to improve our understanding of differences in the mechanisms of viral inactivation by polychromatic uv light during potable water reuse advanced wwtps are designed using disinfection treatment as the most important barriers for the removal and inactivation of viruses therefore it is important to understand the factors that govern the inactivation of human viruses found in sewage and the differences from laboratory strains other studies with echovirus 11 have demonstrated the possibility of enrichment for more resistant strains to chlorine dioxide zhong et al 2017 which may indicate the potential of selection for more resistant viruses during some treatment approaches in addition there are physical factors not commonly considered during disinfection studies such as viral aggregation gerba and betancourt 2017 and interaction of viruses with microbial compounds waldman et al 2017 that could have an impact on the inactivation of viruses in sewage 5 conclusion adenovirus isolates obtained from sewage samples showed greater resistance to uv irradiation compared to laboratory grown strains although required doses for mp uv was still considerably lower than lp uv these data suggest that the required fluence for inactivation of adenoviruses in real world waters may be higher than previously understood declaration of competing interest the
