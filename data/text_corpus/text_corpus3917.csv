results 3 1 the degradation of hexadecane by the extracellular fluid of p aeruginosa ny3 as shown in fig 1 both the harvested cells of p aeruginosa ny3 and all of their corresponding cell free extracellular fluid tested in fig 1 had the capacity to degrade hexadecane the hexadecane degradation efficiency increases with time the coexisting secondary carbon source had an obvious effect on the degradation efficiency of hexadecane by cells and cell free extracellular fluid the extracellular secretions of p aeruginosa ny3 had the capacity to degrade alkanes under aerobic conditions we noted that the degradation rates of hexadecane by cell free extracellular fluids were largely in proportion to the phcs concentrations which could be ascertained by the color shade of the fluids according to pricewhelan pricewhelan et al 2006 and by our measuring results fig s1 3 2 extraction and characterization of phcs secreted in the extracellular fluid by p aeruginosa ny3 all the tested supernatants were green or blue green which was indicative of p aeruginosa secreting high levels of phcs pricewhelan et al 2006 using hplc esi ms and tandem mass spectrometry ms ms fig 3 the molecular structure of each phc extracted from the culture liquid of p aeruginosa ny3 was identified by analyzing the four peaks observed in the hplc spectra fig 2 peak 1 shown in fig 2 corresponds with a molecular weight of 196 attributed to hpe the similar fragmentation ion pattern in ms ms results fig 3b was also reported by prabhu et al 2014 and corresponded closely with the hpe standard purchased from sigma aldrich peak 2 4 8 min in fig 2 corresponded to a molecular weight of 211 and exhibited a fragmentation ion pattern similar to that of the ms ms spectrum of pyo reported previously el fouly et al 2014 peak 3 20 3 min in fig 2 corresponded to a molecular weight of 223 which was attributed to pcn by comparing with previously reported results fig 3f kennedy et al 2015 and the hplc esi ms and ms ms spectra of the pcn standard peak 4 21 4 min showed a fragmentation ion pattern similar to that of peak 3 fig 2 but exhibited a higher molecular weight peak 4 aligned closely with pca based on previously reported results zhou et al 2016 as seen in figs 2 and 3 the similar spectra of lc and hplc esi ms suggested that the types of the secreted phcs were same ones including hpe pyo pcn and pca regardless of the growing carbon source of p aeruginosa ny3 i e alkanes the mixture of alkanes or different small organic acids the concentrations of each phc were varied with the change of carbon source as seen from the liquid chromatography profile of corresponding colorful extracts data not shown in combining these results with that the observations in section 3 1 we think that the secreted phcs may play a role in the hexadecane degradation 3 3 chemical degradation of hexadecane with phcs and nadh or gsh the degradation efficiency of hexadecane by reacting phcs with nadh or gsh is shown in fig 4 results demonstrated that hexadecane was degraded in the presence of phc and nadh or gsh the concentration of each phcs influenced the removal rates of hexadecane however the concentration dependency of each phc was found to be compound specific when nadh was used as the co reductant in the reaction mixtures higher rates of hexadecane degradation were observed in the presence of pyo pca pcn and hpe from 4 0 to 8 0 μm when the amount of pyo or pcn was less than 0 4 μm hexadecane degradation rates within 8 h were found to remain below 20 compared with phc free experiments concentrations of 0 2 μm of pca or hpe or above were found to result in greater than 25 hexadecane degradation within 8 h the presence of iron was also found to increase the degradation rate of hexadecane by 29 compared with the control tests without iron fig s2 when gsh was used to replace nadh as the co reductant the degradation efficiency of hexadecane for all the tested concentrations of pcn and hpe was found to be less than 13 in contrast pyo and pca at 0 4 8 0 μm were capable of degrading 25 30 hexadecane the degradation efficiency of hexadecane in the presence of phcs and nadh was higher than that with phcs and gsh which may be attributed to differences in the redox potential of nad p nad p h e0 320 mv compared with that of gsh gssh e0 240 mv christian schwarzer 2011 the differences in redox potential between nad p nad p h and phcs pchs h2 were greater than those of gsh gssh and phcs pchs h2 among the four secreted phcs the redox potentials of both pyo 40 mv and pca 116 mv were higher than those of pcn 140 mv and hpe 174 mv when the higher redox potential gsh was used as the co reductant the differences in redox potentials of gsh gssh and pcn pcn h2 and hpe hpe h2 were 100 and 66 mv respectively therefore the hexadecane degradation efficiencies by gsh and hpe or pcn were obviously lower than those of other reaction systems fig 4b 3 4 reaction mechanism of hexadecane phcs and nadh or gsh prior studies have shown that dmpo ooh formed by the reaction of dmpo and superoxide anion radical o2 can be readily decomposed in a very short time approximately 30 s into dmpo oh which may also be produced by the reaction between dmpo and hydroxyl free radical oh rosen and finkelstein 1985 thus dmpo was not considered to be a suitable spin trapping reagent to determine the presence of superoxide anion radical in the current system to evaluate the initial free radical species formed in the reaction systems bmpo was selected as the spin trapping reagent for the reactions between nadh 0 016 mm and phcs 0 04 mm in the presence of dtpa 0 1 mm and bmpo 200 mm in pbs 0 1 mm ph 7 0 the epr spectra of reaction solutions were monitored at 25 c fig 5 pyo reacted with nadh under aerobic conditions which resulted in the generation of o2 as well as oh fig 5a these results are consistent with earlier reports hassan and fridovich 1980 hassett et al 1992 in addition three other phcs pca fig 5b pcn fig 5c and hpe fig 5d were observed to react with nadh and also form o2 and oh epr spectra from the reaction of phcs and gsh are shown in fig 5e h all the tested phcs were found to react with gsh accompanying with the production of free radicals of which only oh could be obviously detected fig 5e h to determine whether the free radicals could react with alkanes to form carbon free radicals 3 5 mm hexadecane was added to the reaction of pyo and nadh dmpo was selected as the spin trapping reagent to detect carbon free radicals the epr spectra fig 6 f showed that the levels of carbon free radicals were beyond the detection limits when a more soluble alkane pentane was used in place of hexadecane the signals of carbon free radicals were also invisible fig 6e to make clear whether the intensity of carbon free radicals is in proportion to water solubility of organic pollutants a series of organic compounds with different solubilities were compared with hexadecane we observed that the relative intensity of the hydroxyl free radical was increasing as the organic compounds of higher solubility were added fig 6a d these results suggest that 1 phcs reacted with nadh to form free radicals of o2 and oh or with gsh to form oh only 2 oh produced by the reactions or transformed from o2 attacked alkanes and generated carbon free radicals causing the degradation of hexadecane these results may allow for predicting the types of organic pollutants which can be degraded in the presence of phcs and nadh or gsh 3 5 epr measurements of free radicals generated in the hexadecane degradation medium to evaluate chemical degradation of hexadecane through free radicals during bio degradation of hexadecane by p aeruginosa ny3 170 mm dmpo was mixed with 20 μl cell culture of hexadecane degradation culture medium of strain ny3 or 20 μl cell free extracellular fluid of hexadecane degradation by strain ny3 and then supplemented with 100 mm dtpa epr spectra of both the cell culture and the cell free extracellular fluid showed abundant signal peaks correlated with free radicals fig 7 fig 7 shows that at least two types of free radicals including hydroxyl and carbon free radicals existed in the culture liquid in the cell free extracellular fluid the relative intensity of carbon free radical was observed to decrease and produce stronger signals of hydroxyl free radical the results suggest that in bacteria cultural medium with the help of the secreted phcs nadh gsh and iron the organic pollutants may be oxidized or degraded via free radical mechanisms 4 discussion secretion of phcs particularly pyo which has been used as a broad spectrum antibiotic often makes p aeruginosa more competitive for carbon sources compared with other microorganisms reszka et al 2004 ahmad et al 2011 interestingly when p aeruginosa ny3 used alkane as a sole carbon source the extracellular secreted phcs could promote the degradation efficiency of alkane and also raise cell growth rates based on the high hexadecane degradation ability by cell free extracellular fluid of p aeruginosa ny3 a considerable amount of alkane was degraded by the reaction of phcs and nadh or gsh by this pathway the relatively low solubility alkanes were transformed into smaller and more polar metabolites which were readily bioavailable ma et al 2006 this may be a reasonable explanation for the promotion effects of secreted phcs on cell growth of p aeruginosa ny3 a possible degradation pathway of alkanes by phcs and nadh or gsh in extracellular fluid is depicted in fig 8 under aerobic conditions the extracellular phcs particularly pyo can react with molecular oxygen and some reducing agents such as nadh or gsh fahey et al 1978 kuwahara et al 1984 cronan et al 2005 bachhawat et al 2012 to generate free radicals such as o2 and oh britigan et al 1992 reszka et al 2004 o malley et al 2004 ahmad et al 2011 these ros with the aid of iron a common constituent in culture medium of p aeruginosa ny3 were proved to be able to enhance the generation of hydroxy free radicals which could degrade hexadecane with higher efficiency through the same mechanism as for although the high activity of both catalase and superoxide dismutase generally acts to eliminate free radicals during the metabolism of p aeruginosa ny3 norman et al 2004 the epr spectra of o2 oh and some carbon radicals from both hexadecane degradation cultural medium and its corresponding cell free extracellular fluid were still detectable these results suggest that besides enzymatic degradation of hexadecane the chemical degradation and transformation of hexadecane through free radical mechanisms also occurred in the cultural medium the secretion of phcs has been found to be the characteristic of many bacterial genera including some gram positive genus rao and sureshkumar 2000 and some gram negative genus villavicencio 1983 especially pseudomonas which is often involved in or related to the degradation of organic pollutants this implied that the extracellular degradation of organic contaminants through free radical reactions can concur ubiquitously during bio remediation and bio treatment phcs could act as an electron shuttles es to promote the growth and survival of p aeruginosa under conditions of oxidant limitation wang et al 2009 and also could serve as electron carrier to participate in reversible redox reaction and to achieve extracellular electron respiration friedheim 1931 hernandez and newman 2001 during bio treatment of organic contaminants the extracellular electron transfer could involve some typical endogenous redox mediator including benzoquinone phcs flavin or some microbial pigment which exist outside cells biosynthesis of these es only consumes small amount of total atp microbial energy synthesized by cells yet the extracellular es could be reused not to accelerate the electron transfer harald von canstein 2008 but also to initiate the free radical reactions outside cells to promote the oxidation of organic pollutants which has been proven by our studies the extracellular respiration and free radical reactions led to growth of microbial cells on the hydrophobic organic pollutants brutinel and gralnick 2012 although free radicals in biological systems have long been known they have not received great attentions besides the intracellular processes of enzymatic oxidations a considerable amount of organic pollutants could be oxidized and degraded through free radical pathway outside cells so far there is still an urgent need for studying the effects of extracellular free radical oxidations on the bio removal bio detoxification bio mineralization and carbon cycling of organic pollutants we will further investigate the relationship and interaction between the concurrent free radical oxidation and enzymatic biodegradation of organic pollutants in our future research and to identify their ecological and environmental significance 5 conclusions under aerobic conditions p aeruginosa ny3 secretes pyo hpe pca and pcn simultaneously these secreted phcs coupling with nadh or gsh initiated the oxidation of alkanes outside cells through the free radical reactions cell free extracellular fluid containing these four phcs degrades hexadecane effectively the electron spin resonance epr signals of superoxide anion radical o2 hydroxyl radical oh and or carbon free radicals r generated from all the in vivo and in vitro mixtures were high enough to confirm the oxidation of hexadecane through mechanism similar to for as secretion of phcs has been found to be characteristic of pseudomonas this work demonstrated that certain amount of organic contaminants may be oxidized

hexadecane and 0 160 μm phcs pyo or pca or pcn or hpe the degradation of hexadecane by reacting phcs with gsh sigma aldrich was evaluated by combining 40 μm gsh 20 mm hexadecane and 0 160 μm phcs pyo or pca or pcn or hpe all phcs were purchased from sigma aldrich and used as received degradation experiments were carried out on a rotary shaker at 30 c and 151 rpm after 8 h the residual hexadecane was recovered by extraction with 5 ml hexane for three times the amount of residual hexadecane and degradation efficiency was measured and calculated as 2 3 referred all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 6 electron spin resonance epr measurements the epr reactions for phcs contained 0 1 mm pbs ph 7 0 0 1 mm diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid dtpa 200 mm bmpo 0 04 mm phcs and 0 016 mm nadh or 0 016 mm gsh with a total volume of 50 μl epr reactions for the degradation systems and the extracellular fluid consisted of 20 μl culture broth or 20 μl extracellular fluid 200 mm dmpo 0 1 mm dtpa with a total volume of 30 μl epr reactions were run in 1 5 ml centrifuge tubes at room temperature 25 1 c and then transferred to the sealed capillary which was placed in a quartz tube the quartz tube was measured with a bruker emxmicro spectrometer bruker biospin billerica ma usa and immediately the microwave power of the spectrometer was 20 mw the modulation frequency was 100 khz with a modulation amplitude of 1 0 g the time constant was 0 327 or 0 655 s and the receive gain was 5 0 105 all epr spectra shown are representative of experiments performed at a minimum of three times 3 results 3 1 the degradation of hexadecane by the extracellular fluid of p aeruginosa ny3 as shown in fig 1 both the harvested cells of p aeruginosa ny3 and all of their corresponding cell free extracellular fluid tested in fig 1 had the capacity to degrade hexadecane the hexadecane degradation efficiency increases with time the coexisting secondary carbon source had an obvious effect on the degradation efficiency of hexadecane by cells and cell free extracellular fluid the extracellular secretions of p aeruginosa ny3 had the capacity to degrade alkanes under aerobic conditions we noted that the degradation rates of hexadecane by cell free extracellular fluids were largely in proportion to the phcs concentrations which could be ascertained by the color shade of the fluids according to pricewhelan pricewhelan et al 2006 and by our measuring results fig s1 3 2 extraction and characterization of phcs secreted in the extracellular fluid by p aeruginosa ny3 all the tested supernatants were green or blue green which was indicative of p aeruginosa secreting high levels of phcs pricewhelan et al 2006 using hplc esi ms and tandem mass spectrometry ms ms fig 3 the molecular structure of each phc extracted from the culture liquid of p aeruginosa ny3 was identified by analyzing the four peaks observed in the hplc spectra fig 2 peak 1 shown in fig 2 corresponds with a molecular weight of 196 attributed to hpe the similar fragmentation ion pattern in ms ms results fig 3b was also reported by prabhu et al 2014 and corresponded closely with the hpe standard purchased from sigma aldrich peak 2 4 8 min in fig 2 corresponded to a molecular weight of 211 and exhibited a fragmentation ion pattern similar to that of the ms ms spectrum of pyo reported previously el fouly et al 2014 peak 3 20 3 min in fig 2 corresponded to a molecular weight of 223 which was attributed to pcn by comparing with previously reported results fig 3f kennedy et al 2015 and the hplc esi ms and ms ms spectra of the pcn standard peak 4 21 4 min showed a fragmentation ion pattern similar to that of peak 3 fig 2 but exhibited a higher molecular weight peak 4 aligned closely with pca based on previously reported results zhou et al 2016 as seen in figs 2 and 3 the similar spectra of lc and hplc esi ms suggested that the types of the secreted phcs were same ones including hpe pyo pcn and pca regardless of the growing carbon source of p aeruginosa ny3 i e alkanes the mixture of alkanes or different small organic acids the concentrations of each phc were varied with the change of carbon source as seen from the liquid chromatography profile of corresponding colorful extracts data not shown in combining these results with that the observations in section 3 1 we think that the secreted phcs may play a role in the hexadecane degradation 3 3 chemical degradation of hexadecane with phcs and nadh or gsh the degradation efficiency of hexadecane by reacting phcs with nadh or gsh is shown in fig 4 results demonstrated that hexadecane was degraded in the presence of phc and nadh or gsh the concentration of each phcs influenced the removal rates of hexadecane however the concentration dependency of each phc was found to be compound specific when nadh was used as the co reductant in the reaction mixtures higher rates of hexadecane degradation were observed in the presence of pyo pca pcn and hpe from 4 0 to 8 0 μm when the amount of pyo or pcn was less than 0 4 μm hexadecane degradation rates within 8 h were found to remain below 20 compared with phc free experiments concentrations of 0 2 μm of pca or hpe or above were found to result in greater than 25 hexadecane degradation within 8 h the presence of iron was also found to increase the degradation rate of hexadecane by 29 compared with the control tests without iron fig s2 when gsh was used to replace nadh as the co reductant the degradation efficiency of hexadecane for all the tested concentrations of pcn and hpe was found to be less than 13 in contrast pyo and pca at 0 4 8 0 μm were capable of degrading 25 30 hexadecane the degradation efficiency of hexadecane in the presence of phcs and nadh was higher than that with phcs and gsh which may be attributed to differences in the redox potential of nad p nad p h e0 320 mv compared with that of gsh gssh e0 240 mv christian schwarzer 2011 the differences in redox potential between nad p nad p h and phcs pchs h2 were greater than those of gsh gssh and phcs pchs h2 among the four secreted phcs the redox potentials of both pyo 40 mv and pca 116 mv were higher than those of pcn 140 mv and hpe 174 mv when the higher redox potential gsh was used as the co reductant the differences in redox potentials of gsh gssh and pcn pcn h2 and hpe hpe h2 were 100 and 66 mv respectively therefore the hexadecane degradation efficiencies by gsh and hpe or pcn were obviously lower than those of other reaction systems fig 4b 3 4 reaction mechanism of hexadecane phcs and nadh or gsh prior studies have shown that dmpo ooh formed by the reaction of dmpo and superoxide anion radical o2 can be readily decomposed in a very short time approximately 30 s into dmpo oh which may also be produced by the reaction between dmpo and hydroxyl free radical oh rosen and finkelstein 1985 thus dmpo was not considered to be a suitable spin trapping reagent to determine the presence of superoxide anion radical in the current system to evaluate the initial free radical species formed in the reaction systems bmpo was selected as the spin trapping reagent for the reactions between nadh 0 016 mm and phcs 0 04 mm in the presence of dtpa 0 1 mm and bmpo 200 mm in pbs 0 1 mm ph 7 0 the epr spectra of reaction solutions were monitored at 25 c fig 5 pyo reacted with nadh under aerobic conditions which resulted in the generation of o2 as well as oh fig 5a these results are consistent with earlier reports hassan and fridovich 1980 hassett et al 1992 in addition three other phcs pca fig 5b pcn fig 5c and hpe fig 5d were observed to react with nadh and also form o2 and oh epr spectra from the reaction of phcs and gsh are shown in fig 5e h all the tested phcs were found to react with gsh accompanying with the production of free radicals of which only oh could be obviously detected fig 5e h to determine whether the free radicals could react with alkanes to form carbon free radicals 3 5 mm hexadecane was added to the reaction of pyo and nadh dmpo was selected as the spin trapping reagent to detect carbon free radicals the epr spectra fig 6 f showed that the levels of carbon free radicals were beyond the detection limits when a more soluble alkane pentane was used in place of hexadecane the signals of carbon free radicals were also invisible fig 6e to make clear whether the intensity of carbon free radicals is in proportion to water solubility of organic pollutants a series of organic compounds with different solubilities were compared with hexadecane we observed that the relative intensity of the hydroxyl free radical was increasing as the organic compounds of higher solubility were added fig 6a d these results suggest that 1 phcs reacted with nadh to form free radicals of o2 and oh or with gsh to form oh only 2 oh produced by the reactions or transformed from o2 attacked alkanes and generated carbon free radicals causing the degradation of hexadecane these results may allow for predicting the types of organic pollutants which can be degraded in the presence of phcs and nadh or gsh 3 5 epr measurements of free radicals generated in the hexadecane degradation medium to evaluate chemical degradation of hexadecane through free radicals during bio degradation of hexadecane by p aeruginosa ny3 170 mm dmpo was mixed with 20 μl cell culture of hexadecane degradation culture medium of strain ny3 or 20 μl cell free extracellular fluid of hexadecane degradation by strain ny3 and then supplemented with 100 mm dtpa epr spectra of both the cell culture and the cell free extracellular fluid showed abundant signal peaks correlated with free radicals fig 7 fig 7 shows that at least two types of free radicals including hydroxyl and carbon free radicals existed in the culture liquid in the cell free extracellular fluid the relative intensity of carbon free radical was observed to decrease and produce stronger signals of hydroxyl free radical the results suggest that in bacteria cultural medium with the help of the secreted phcs nadh gsh and iron the organic pollutants may be oxidized or degraded via free radical mechanisms 4 discussion secretion of phcs particularly pyo which has been used as a broad spectrum antibiotic often makes p aeruginosa more competitive for carbon sources compared with other microorganisms reszka et al 2004 ahmad et al 2011 interestingly when p aeruginosa ny3 used alkane as a sole carbon source the extracellular secreted phcs could promote the degradation efficiency of alkane and also raise cell growth rates based on the high hexadecane degradation ability by cell free extracellular fluid of p aeruginosa ny3 a considerable amount of alkane was degraded by the reaction of phcs and nadh or gsh by this pathway the relatively low solubility alkanes were transformed into smaller and more polar metabolites which were readily bioavailable ma et al 2006 this may be a reasonable explanation for the promotion effects of secreted phcs on cell growth of p aeruginosa ny3 a possible degradation pathway of alkanes by phcs and nadh or gsh in extracellular fluid is depicted in fig 8 under aerobic conditions the extracellular phcs particularly pyo can react with molecular oxygen and some reducing agents such as nadh or gsh fahey et al 1978 kuwahara et al 1984 cronan et al 2005 bachhawat et al 2012 to generate free radicals such as o2 and oh britigan et al 1992 reszka et al 2004 o malley et al 2004 ahmad et al 2011 these ros with the aid of iron a common constituent in culture medium of p aeruginosa ny3 were proved to be able to enhance the generation of hydroxy free radicals which could degrade hexadecane with higher efficiency through the same mechanism as for although the high activity of both catalase and superoxide dismutase generally acts to eliminate free radicals during the metabolism of p aeruginosa ny3 norman et al 2004 the epr spectra of o2 oh and some carbon radicals from both hexadecane degradation cultural medium and its corresponding cell free extracellular fluid were still detectable these results suggest that besides enzymatic degradation of hexadecane the chemical degradation and transformation of hexadecane through free radical mechanisms also occurred in the cultural medium the secretion of phcs has been found to be the characteristic of many bacterial genera including some gram positive genus rao and sureshkumar 2000 and some gram negative genus villavicencio 1983 especially pseudomonas which is often involved in or related to the degradation of organic pollutants this implied that the extracellular degradation of organic contaminants through free radical reactions can concur ubiquitously during bio remediation and bio treatment phcs could act as an electron shuttles es to promote the growth and survival of p aeruginosa under conditions of oxidant limitation wang et al 2009 and also could serve as electron carrier to participate in reversible redox reaction and to achieve extracellular electron respiration friedheim 1931 hernandez and newman 2001 during bio treatment of organic contaminants the extracellular electron transfer could involve some typical endogenous redox mediator including benzoquinone phcs flavin or some microbial pigment which exist outside cells biosynthesis of these es only consumes small amount of total atp microbial energy synthesized by cells yet the extracellular es could be reused not to accelerate the electron transfer harald von canstein 2008 but also to initiate the free radical reactions outside cells to promote the oxidation of organic pollutants which has been proven by our studies the extracellular respiration and free radical reactions led to growth of microbial cells on the hydrophobic organic pollutants brutinel and gralnick 2012 although free radicals in biological systems have long been known they have not received great attentions besides the intracellular processes of enzymatic oxidations a considerable amount of organic pollutants could be oxidized and degraded through free radical pathway outside cells so far there is still an urgent need for studying the effects of extracellular free radical oxidations on the bio removal bio detoxification bio mineralization and carbon cycling of organic pollutants we will further investigate the relationship and interaction between the concurrent free radical oxidation and enzymatic biodegradation of organic pollutants in our future research and to identify their ecological and environmental significance 5 conclusions under aerobic conditions p aeruginosa ny3 secretes pyo hpe pca and pcn simultaneously these secreted phcs coupling with nadh or gsh initiated the oxidation of alkanes outside cells through the free radical reactions cell free extracellular fluid containing these four phcs degrades hexadecane effectively the electron spin resonance epr signals of superoxide anion radical o2 hydroxyl radical oh and or carbon free radicals r generated from all the in vivo and in vitro mixtures were high enough to confirm the oxidation of hexadecane through mechanism similar to for as secretion of phcs has been found to be characteristic of pseudomonas this work demonstrated that certain amount of organic contaminants may be oxidized

19586,uv vis differential spectroscopy was applied to characterize and quantify the spectral changes after clo2 oxidation of ten humic substances seven aromatic model compounds and four surface waters the differential spectra of ten humic substances after clo2 oxidation all exhibited a peak near 230 nm and a broad absorbance band with a maximum at around 316 nm the differential spectra after clo2 oxidation were distinguished from the one after chlorination which was indicative of their different oxidation mechanisms the differential spectra after clo2 treatment were well fitted by seven gaussian bands with maxima at about 200 225 240 276 316 385 and 457 nm differential absorbance at 316 nm and 400 nm denoted as da316 and da400 respectively were found to best quantify the degradation of organic matters during clo2 oxidation with negligible interferences from water matrixes oxidation of substituted functional groups on aromatic structures rather than destruction of aromatic rings was more responsible for chlorite formation spectral parameters da316 and da400 showed strong correlations with clo2 consumption and chlorite formation during clo2 oxidation of humic substances and surface water samples the results demonstrate that da316 and da400 can serve as promising indicators of chlorite formation and clo2 consumption which provide a practical approach for online water quality monitoring during clo2 water purification graphical abstract image 1 keywords humic substances absorbance differential spectra chlorine dioxide chlorite water treatment 1 introduction chlorine dioxide clo2 is an alternative to chlorine as a disinfectant in water purification because it tends to form halogenated disinfection by products dbps e g trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas at much lower concentrations hua and reckhow 2007 richardson et al 2009 besides clo2 has advantages over chlorine in inactivation of cryptosporidium giardia and ms2 coliphages murphy et al 2014 sigstam et al 2014 zhong et al 2016 clo2 is commonly used in pre oxidation due to its effective removal of algae color taste and odor from source waters jones et al 2012 kull et al 2006 shah et al 2012 yang et al 2013 however clo2 application also generates toxic by products such as aldehydes ketones chlorite and chlorate richardson et al 2000 swietlik et al 2004 among these by products chlorite and chlorate are of greatest concern sorlini et al 2016 veschetti et al 2005 chlorite is produced from reduction of clo2 per se with 40 80 conversion depending on water qualities schmidt et al 2000 werdehoff and singer 1987 meanwhile up to 10 of applied clo2 is converted to chlorate korn et al 2002 considering their adverse effects on human health many countries have stringent regulations for chlorite and chlorate concentrations in drinking water e g 700 μg l 1 for chlorite and chlorate in china and 1 mg l 1 for chlorite in the usa ministry of health 2006 usepa 2006 humic substances are known to be precursors of dbps from both chlorination and clo2 oxidation during the reaction with humic substances the decay of clo2 and chlorine both follow a two step pattern a rapid decay in the initial several minutes followed by a slow decay over time schmidt et al 2000 sohn et al 2004 however they react with humic substances via very different reaction mechanisms clo2 is a selective oxidant and it is highly reactive towards phenolic aniline olefin and amine moieties hoigné and bader 1994 lee and von gunten 2012 clo2 generally reacts with organic compounds via one electron transfer and generated few chlorine substituted products han et al 2017 hua and reckhow 2007 chlorination however involves both oxidation and chlorine substitution of organic molecules producing significant levels of chlorinated by products krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2007 thus clo2 oxidation is expected to exploit distinct decomposition mechanisms from chlorination many technologies have been applied in characterization of humic substances structures and their changes during water treatment including uv vis spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy size exclusion chromatography sec low and high resolution mass spectrometry and others matilainen et al 2011 however extraction or solvent exchange is necessary in preparing aqueous samples for spectroscopic analysis the chemical and physical properties of natural organic matter nom are inevitably altered during the sample preparations in comparison uv vis spectroscopy requires no specific sample preparation which can better preserve the nom s natural characteristics meanwhile uv vis spectroscopy can provide information about the chromophores in humic substances stedmon et al 2000 which are reactive sites toward chlorine and clo2 this study therefore employed differential uv spectroscopy to reflect the changes on the structures of humic substances during clo2 oxidation in previous studies good correlations have been observed between chlorinated dbps formation and differential uv absorbance upon chlorination korshin et al 2002 roccaro et al 2008 yan et al 2014 spectral parameters derived from differential absorbance have shown more reliable correlations with dbps formation than other water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon doc and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva differential uv absorbance at 272 nm da272 and 254 nm da254 and log transformed absorbance at 350 nm dlna350 are good indicators for decomposition of humic substances and corresponding dbps formation during chlorination korshin et al 1996 2002 2007 roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 roccaro et al 2015 weishaar et al 2003 yan et al 2014 to date few published studies used differential uv spectra to investigate clo2 oxidation of humic substance wenk and his co workers found that decrease in the absorbance ranging from 300 to 600 nm was prominent during clo2 oxidation the significant change in the differential absorbance at 272 nm a distinct feature for chlorination however was not observed during clo2 oxidation wenk et al 2013 in other words differential uv absorbance after clo2 oxidation visualized distinguished mechanisms from chlorination exploring and characterizing the changes of uv absorbance during clo2 oxidation thus aids to interpret reactions between clo2 and humic substances in addition correlations between the changes of the specific uv absorbance and the formation of chlorite and or chlorate during clo2 oxidation remains largely unexplored differential uv spectroscopy has the great practical potential for quantifying clo2 consumption and monitoring chlorite and chlorate formation clo2 dose control and monitoring of chlorite and chlorate formation are always tricky problems for water utilities due to the regulatory limits of chlorite and chlorate demonstrating the feasibility of differential spectra in predicting or monitoring dbps formation would thus be conducive to clo2 involved water treatment facilities the objectives of this study are i to examine the structural changes of humic substances during clo2 oxidation using uv vis spectroscopy ii to evaluate the correlations between the changes in the spectra of humic substances and clo2 consumption chlorite formation and chlorate formation respectively and iii to investigate the feasibility of using uv differential spectra in monitoring by products formation during clo2 oxidation of real surface waters 2

filtering through a 0 45 μm membrane to remove any undissolved particulate matter four surface water samples sw 1 4 were collected from three rivers in guangdong province china the water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane before use water quality parameters of surface water samples are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental procedures the filtered humic substance solutions were diluted to a united doc level of 2 mg l 1 and buffered to ph 7 0 with 2 mm phosphate before clo2 oxidation a 4 mg l 1 clo2 dose was applied and 20 ml sample were then withdrawn after 2 5 15 30 60 120 360 720 and 1440 min the clo2 dose 4 mg l 1 was determined based on the preliminary clo2 demand test to guarantee the residual clo2 above 0 1 mg l 1 after the 24 h reaction with all humic substances samples another sub sample was purged with nitrogen gas to remove the residual clo2 and the uv vis spectra were recorded ethylenediamine was then added as a preservation agent for chlorite and chlorate analysis chlorination of humic substances was also conducted as a comparative group with an equivalent chlorine dose 4 mg l 1 chlorination was quenched by adding sodium sulfite at a stoichiometric ratio based on the residual chlorine concentration 2 mg sulfite per mg residual chlorine the uv absorbance of chlorinated samples was collected after dechlorination the experiments with model

ratio between clo2 and doc of 2 1 the sw 3 water was diluted to a doc level of 2 mg l 1 before clo2 oxidation due to its relatively high doc level 7 26 mg l 1 the residual clo2 chlorite chlorate and

using a 5 cm quartz cell on a shimadzu uv 2700 spectrophotometer all spectra were normalized to a 1 cm cell length 3 results and discussion 3 1 spectral characteristics of humic substances after clo2 oxidation 3 1 1 humic substances fig 1 a and b shows the uv vis spectra of the srfa and ppha before and after clo2 oxidation respectively the intensity of absorbance in the 200 600 nm range decreased with increasing clo2 oxidation time since the changes of the absorbance were quite small the linear differential absorbance da spectra was applied in processing initial absorbance data followed the practices in previous studies roccaro et al 2015 yan et al 2014 the calculation is 1 d a λ a λ i a λ 0 aλ i here represents the absorbance value at a specific wavelength λ for a clo2 treated sample after reaction period i and aλ 0 represents the absorbance before clo2 treatment clo2 oxidation of humic substances forms chlorite and chlorate which introduce absorbance in the 200 340 nm range figure si 1 the absorbance of the chlorite generated aclo2 i and the chlorate generated aclo3 i after different reaction periods were thus be subtracted from the differential spectra daλ i to reflect the spectral changes attributable to humic substances exclusively as in eq 2 2 d a λ a λ i a λ 0 a c l o 2 i a c l o 3 i differential absorbance used in this study thus referred to the spectra derived from eq 2 the interference from chlorite and chlorate is negligible at λ 310 nm figure si 1 differential spectra of srfa and ppha after clo2 treatment are shown in fig 1c and d as examples the peak with strong differential absorbance was at approximately 230 nm a broad absorbance band from 300 to 400 nm with a maximum at 316 nm was also observed the scale of the differential spectra slowly increased with increasing reaction time the differential spectra of srfa and ppha exhibited similar intensities at 230 nm but stronger intensity at λ 300 nm was observed in ppha than srfa this indicated that the differential spectra should be attributed to multiple clo2 reactive moieties because of the dissimilar intensity changes at these two absorbance bands besides this observation also demonstrated that the fractions of clo2 reactive moieties varied among different humic substances notably differential spectra of humic substances after clo2 treatment had peaks different from those after chlorination see srfa as an example in figure si 2 differential spectra of humic substances upon clo2 treatment featured a peak at 230 nm but the chlorinated samples had a prominent peak at approximately 270 nm korshin et al 2002 2007 roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 yan et al 2014 differential absorbance after chlorination showed no distinct peaks at λ 300 nm in contrast a significant broad absorbance band was observed at λ 300 nm in clo2 treated samples the different reaction mechanisms and corresponding distinct reaction intermediates and final products may contribute to the differences in spectral characters between chlorination and clo2 oxidation for example quinone moieties are prominent products in reactions between phenolic compounds and clo2 phenoxyl radicals are formed first via one electron transfer from clo2 and then further oxidized to quinones or they undergo irreversible coupling reactions figure si 3 merenyi et al 1988 wajon et al 1982 that is the ring structures are preserved during clo2 oxidation which leads to slight changes in absorbance at 250 λ 280 nm wenk et al 2013 in comparison chlorination involves both oxidation and substitution reactions after chlorine substitution benzene rings become vulnerable with weakened electron clouds due to the strong electron attracting ability of chlorine atoms de vera et al 2017 gallard and von gunten 2002 hence poly chlorinated phenols and smaller chlorinated molecules produced after ring cleavage were the main products of chlorination of phenols figure si 3 criquet et al 2015 li et al 2000 3 1 2 aromatic compounds to examine the idea that those featured peaks upon clo2 oxidation reflect reactions with certain distinct functional groups seven aromatic compounds were selected to measure their differential absorbance spectra during clo2 oxidation aromatic moieties substituted with phenolic carboxylic and methylic groups were found to be reactive towards clo2 and these compounds constitute a large portion of humic substances hoigné and bader 1994 lee and von gunten 2012 the differential absorbance of humic substances may reflect the decomposition of those activated aromatics chen et al 2002 traina et al 1990 none of the tested model compounds showed identical differential spectral features with clo2 oxidation of humic substances although differential spectra of salicylic acid exhibited some similarity with humic substances a sharp peak at 230 nm and a broad absorbance band at 300 nm fig 2 an increasing absorbance at 240 λ 270 nm was observed in clo2 treated salicylic acid which did not occur in clo2 oxidation of humic substances increasing absorbance at 240 λ 270 nm with increasing reaction time was also observed in phenolic compounds including resorcinol hydroquinone and 3 methylphenol table s2 and figure si 4 this may be relevant with the formation of quinone groups as reaction intermediates or products absorbance in the neighborhood of roughly 240 270 nm is common for quinones or aldehydes as a result of a n π transition on c o groups and π π transition on unsaturated c c structures kalsi 2007 in contrast the absorbance of benzoic acids e g 4 methoxybenzoic acid decreased continuously during clo2 oxidation in the range of 240 λ 270 nm in addition clo2 oxidation of model compounds caused increasing absorbance at higher wavelength λ 300 nm except for hydroquinone and salicylic acid this indicated that the decreased of absorbance at λ 300 nm may involved with oxidation of certain carboxylic and polyphenolic moieties which was consistent with differential spectra with changes of these groups in previous studies chlorination of carboxylic or phenolic moieties caused decrease of absorbance from 200 to 400 nm korshin et al 1997 metal binding with carboxyl and hydroxyl substituted organics also exhibited featured peaks at λ 300 nm in differential spectra yan et al 2013 unlike the case for model compounds the absorbance during clo2 oxidation of humic substances decreased steadily over the entire wavelength range the polyphenolic structures in the humic substances may exhibit different patterns in spectral changes from model compounds meanwhile other than phenolic moieties polyenes aniline and polycyclic aromatic groups are also clo2 reactive moieties their decomposition by clo2 would cause reduced absorptivity in the region 250 λ 280 nm peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 that is the differential absorbance during clo2 oxidation integrates the degradation of different clo2 reactive moieties and the corresponding formation of intermediates no single model compounds can completely represent the overall absorbance properties of the complicated structure of humic substances 3 2 spectral coefficients and correlations with clo2 consumption and by product formation 3 2 1 deconvolution of the differential spectra deconvolution of the differential spectra was conducted to determine the presence and contributions of the distinct bands using the software peakfit version 4 12 followed the established practices in previous study yan et al 2013 yan and korshin 2014 details in text s1 the bands were assumed to have a gaussian shape when represented versus photon energy measured in ev calculated as 3 e e v 1240 λ n m each gaussian band ai was characterized by the location of its maximum e0i its width wi and its amplitude a0i this generated differential spectra a e computed as 4 δ a e δ a i δ a o i exp 1 2 e e o i w i 2 the differential spectra upon clo2 oxidation was fitted well with r2 0 98 in all cases fig 3 and figure si 5 the deconvolutions in the range of 200 λ 500 nm showed seven gaussian bands although the width and intensity of the fitted gaussian peaks varied with different humic substances the positions of these bands maxima were consistent among different humic substances table s3 five of the fitted gaussian bands matched positions derived from previous studies on humic substances he et al 2015 yan et al 2013 2014 they are denoted as a6 a5 a4 a3 and a1 with maxima located at 385 nm 3 22 0 07 ev 316 nm 3 92 0 04 ev 276 nm 4 50 0 07 ev 240 nm 5 19 0 08 ev and 200 nm 6 23 0 12 ev respectively the a7 band which peaked at 475 nm 2 61 0 08 ev featured in differential spectra upon clo2 oxidation the a2 band at 225 nm 5 51 0 07 ev was introduced to represent the clo2 oxidation peak around 230 nm changes in these featured gaussian peaks reflect the response of structural changes of humic substances after clo2 oxidation evaluation of proper spectral coefficients derived from gaussian bands was conducted to represent the changes of humic substances during clo2 oxidation spectroscopic interference and matrix influence e g absorbance from inorganic ions led to a negative a1 band with a maximum at about 200 nm a1 whose properties were very tricky to analyze though the differential spectra of the humic substance had a peak at 230 nm a2 the absorbance at this wavelength is always interfered by the presence of nitrite and nitrate figure si 6 which also obstructs the analysis of water samples in practical applications in addition absorbance of chlorite overlaps with those of a3 240 nm and a4 276 nm figure si 1 although the interference of chlorite was subtracted in this study we did not use the spectral changes at 240 nm or 276 nm for further quantification considering the needs for potential online monitoring of chlorite formation in real waters spectral parameters da240 and da276 were unsuitable because subtracting interferences of chlorite from differential spectra in real time is unrealistic and impractical generally interferences from inorganic ions fade away at λ 310 nm however precise measurement of minor changes in a7 457 nm during clo2 oxidation was challenging because of the rapid decrease in absorbance at λ 400 nm fig 1 among the seven gaussian peaks a5 316 nm and a6 385 nm were dominant averagely accounting for 17 and 31 of the area of differential spectra upon clo2 oxidation table s3 both a5 and a6 contributed to the broad differential absorbance band 300 λ 400 nm observed from the humic substances after clo2 oxidation since a6 385 nm partially overlapped with a5 316 nm fig 3 differential absorbance at 400 nm instead of 385 nm was selected to represent changes in a6 thus the differential absorbance at 316 nm da316 and 400 nm da400 were selected to represent and quantify the spectral changes during clo2 oxidation without interference of inorganic ions 3 2 2 correlations among spectral coefficients clo2 consumption and chlorite chlorate formation as shown in fig 4 strong correlations were observed among spectral parameters da316 and da400 and clo2 consumption chlorite formation chlorate formation respectively during clo2 oxidation of humic substances the r2 values were all larger than 0 84 table s4 it is noteworthy that the linear functions slope and intercept varied among different humic substances correlations between da400 were taken as examples figure s7 an interesting observation was that these correlations formed two groups depending on their linear intercepts figure si 7 and si 8 one including srfa nlfa and lha with positive intercepts and the other humic substances e g srha and ppha with negative intercepts positive intercepts in the correlations indicated that some fast clo2 reactive moieties in the humic substances can form chlorite during clo2 oxidation without significant changes in spectral absorbance at 316 nm and 400 nm oppositely some clo2 reactive moieties in the humic substances had significant spectral decreases but did not form chlorite upon clo2 oxidation the results also demonstrated the distinct reaction moieties in humic substances when reacting with clo2 the slope of the linear relationships denoted as s represents the by product production mg l 1 per unit of absorbance change cm 1 it should be noted that as the linear relationship did not pass the origin the s values here reflect the changes of humic substances which can still react with clo2 after the first 2 min the first sampling point in this study in other words s values in the correlation represented the slow reacting precursors during clo2 oxidation instead of fast reacting precursors which react with clo2 in the initial 2 min the s value at 400 nm varied among the different humic substances table s4 the s400 chlorite values predicting chlorite formation ranged from 332 to 731 mg cm l 1 and those predicting clo2 consumption s400 clo2 ranged from 507 to 1567 mg cm l 1 considering the low concentrations of chlorate 6 conversion from consumed clo2 correlations with chlorate formation was not discussed further the results demonstrated that the relationships between spectral parameters clo2 demand and chlorite formation were site specific as shown in fig 5 greater s values s400 clo2 and s400 chlorite were observed in humic substances with lower suva values indeed the best fit curve was not linear but exponential this indicated that chlorite formation and clo2 consumption in response to absorbance changes in 400 nm tended to relate with substituted functional groups on aromatic benzene rings rather than destruction of aromatic ring structures this may be related with the carboxylic and polyphenolic groups which was suggested by results from model compounds in this study in addition previous studies suggested that the spectral changes at 350 λ 400 nm related to reactions metal binding deprotonation and oxidation with carboxylic and phenolic groups in organic matter del vecchio and blough 2004 yan et al 2013 2017 on the other hand the site specificity of spectral parameters was attributed with varied amount and species of clo2 reactive substituted functional groups in different waters overall the strong correlations with spectra parameters da316 and da400 show the considerable advantages of using as indicators for clo2 consumption and chlorite formation firstly correlations with da316 and da400 were stronger and more reliable than bulk organic indicators such as doc and suva values no correlations were observed between doc removal and clo2 consumption and chlorite formation during clo2 oxidation figure si 9 although suva removal correlated well with clo2 consumption and chlorite formation in some humic substances e g r2 0 92 for srfa but the correlations were unstable in general e g r2 0 57 and 0 72 for umnom and lha respectively figure si 9 another feature of spectral parameters da316 and da400 was that they both changed with increasing reaction time which provided a possibility to predict residual clo2 and chlorite and chlorate concentrations at different sites along a distribution system 3 3 application of differential uv spectroscopy with multiple water sources to further examine the applicability and feasibility of using da316 or da400 in practice tests with natural surface waters were conducted the absorbance spectra and the differential spectra of four surface waters after clo2 oxidation were shown in figure si 10 the differential spectra had varied featured peaks after clo2 oxidation of different water samples for example a peak at 230 nm in differential spectra was observed in sw 1 and sw 2 but not in sw 4 while absorbance decreased over the whole wavelength range during clo2 oxidation of sw 3 and sw 4 increased absorbance in the range of 250 λ 300 nm was exhibited in sw 1 and sw 2 although the differential spectra of the natural waters were not identical with those of humic substances the presence of the broad absorbance band from 300 to 400 nm was common in different water samples thus da316 and da400 are still feasible and viable indicators of clo2 oxidation of real waters strong correlations among spectra parameters da316 and da400 clo2 consumption and chlorite formation also existed in surface water samples with r2 values 0 8 fig 6 since the chlorate concentrations were less than 0 2 mg l 1 correlations with chlorate were not evaluated in surface waters considering the site specificity of correlation coefficients preliminary tests with local source waters would be required in practice since the intensities of absorbance correlate with the contents of aromatic compounds novak et al 1992 more sensitive uv vis techniques will be necessary to capture accurate data during clo2 oxidation of water samples with low suva values in practical application such as a cell with a longer path length overall da316 and da400 should still be useful in practical implementation based on their reliable and strong correlations found in this study online monitoring during clo2 oxidation by determining changes of da316 and da400 would be a promising approach of refining clo2 dose and monitoring chlorite formation application of da272 to monitor chlorinated dbps during chlorination had already evaluated in full scale condition beauchamp et al 2018 which supports the possible application of spectra parameters da316 and da400 during clo2 oxidation in water treatment facilities in the future further work can focus on practices of spectra parameters in full scale conditions influence of varied source water properties and water treatment processes ahead of clo2 application needs to be evaluated factors like seasonal temperature changes and ph variation of different source waters should be considered to establish more applicable and reliable correlations with spectra parameters in practical implementation 4 conclusions changes in uv vis spectra provide an integrated reflection of clo2 oxidation of organic matters the differential spectra of humic substances upon clo2 oxidation exhibited a sharp peak at 230 nm and a broad absorbance band at λ 300 nm the broad absorbance band at 300 λ 400 nm commonly existed in different humic substances and real water samples results with model aromatic compounds supported that differential spectra upon clo2 oxidation were contributed by reactions with varied clo2 reactive moieties seven gaussian bands with maxima at 200 225 240 276 316 385 and 457 nm were closely fitted the differential spectra of humic substances during clo2 oxidation differential absorbance at 316 nm and 400 nm da316 and da400 can nicely quantify the structural changes of humic substances and real waters during clo2 oxidation with negligible influence of water matrixes strong correlations were observed among spectral parameters da316 and da400 clo2 consumption chlorite formation and chlorate formation in both humic substances and real waters the correlation coefficients slopes and intercepts were found to be site specific this study has identified the spectra parameters da316 and da400 can reflect the changes in organic moieties during clo2 oxidation which give insights in the different reaction mechanisms between clo2 oxidation and chlorination the strong correlations among da316 and da400 clo2 consumption chlorite and chlorate formation demonstrated the promising potential for online monitoring of clo2 application in full scale drinking water treatment and predicting chlorite and chlorate concentrations in the

19586,uv vis differential spectroscopy was applied to characterize and quantify the spectral changes after clo2 oxidation of ten humic substances seven aromatic model compounds and four surface waters the differential spectra of ten humic substances after clo2 oxidation all exhibited a peak near 230 nm and a broad absorbance band with a maximum at around 316 nm the differential spectra after clo2 oxidation were distinguished from the one after chlorination which was indicative of their different oxidation mechanisms the differential spectra after clo2 treatment were well fitted by seven gaussian bands with maxima at about 200 225 240 276 316 385 and 457 nm differential absorbance at 316 nm and 400 nm denoted as da316 and da400 respectively were found to best quantify the degradation of organic matters during clo2 oxidation with negligible interferences from water matrixes oxidation of substituted functional groups on aromatic structures rather than destruction of aromatic rings was more responsible for chlorite formation spectral parameters da316 and da400 showed strong correlations with clo2 consumption and chlorite formation during clo2 oxidation of humic substances and surface water samples the results demonstrate that da316 and da400 can serve as promising indicators of chlorite formation and clo2 consumption which provide a practical approach for online water quality monitoring during clo2 water purification graphical abstract image 1 keywords humic substances absorbance differential spectra chlorine dioxide chlorite water treatment 1 introduction chlorine dioxide clo2 is an alternative to chlorine as a disinfectant in water purification because it tends to form halogenated disinfection by products dbps e g trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas at much lower concentrations hua and reckhow 2007 richardson et al 2009 besides clo2 has advantages over chlorine in inactivation of cryptosporidium giardia and ms2 coliphages murphy et al 2014 sigstam et al 2014 zhong et al 2016 clo2 is commonly used in pre oxidation due to its effective removal of algae color taste and odor from source waters jones et al 2012 kull et al 2006 shah et al 2012 yang et al 2013 however clo2 application also generates toxic by products such as aldehydes ketones chlorite and chlorate richardson et al 2000 swietlik et al 2004 among these by products chlorite and chlorate are of greatest concern sorlini et al 2016 veschetti et al 2005 chlorite is produced from reduction of clo2 per se with 40 80 conversion depending on water qualities schmidt et al 2000 werdehoff and singer 1987 meanwhile up to 10 of applied clo2 is converted to chlorate korn et al 2002 considering their adverse effects on human health many countries have stringent regulations for chlorite and chlorate concentrations in drinking water e g 700 μg l 1 for chlorite and chlorate in china and 1 mg l 1 for chlorite in the usa ministry of health 2006 usepa 2006 humic substances are known to be precursors of dbps from both chlorination and clo2 oxidation during the reaction with humic substances the decay of clo2 and chlorine both follow a two step pattern a rapid decay in the initial several minutes followed by a slow decay over time schmidt et al 2000 sohn et al 2004 however they react with humic substances via very different reaction mechanisms clo2 is a selective oxidant and it is highly reactive towards phenolic aniline olefin and amine moieties hoigné and bader 1994 lee and von gunten 2012 clo2 generally reacts with organic compounds via one electron transfer and generated few chlorine substituted products han et al 2017 hua and reckhow 2007 chlorination however involves both oxidation and chlorine substitution of organic molecules producing significant levels of chlorinated by products krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2007 thus clo2 oxidation is expected to exploit distinct decomposition mechanisms from chlorination many technologies have been applied in characterization of humic substances structures and their changes during water treatment including uv vis spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy size exclusion chromatography sec low and high resolution mass spectrometry and others matilainen et al 2011 however extraction or solvent exchange is necessary in preparing aqueous samples for spectroscopic analysis the chemical and physical properties of natural organic matter nom are inevitably altered during the sample preparations in comparison uv vis spectroscopy requires no specific sample preparation which can better preserve the nom s natural characteristics meanwhile uv vis spectroscopy can provide information about the chromophores in humic substances stedmon et al 2000 which are reactive sites toward chlorine and clo2 this study therefore employed differential uv spectroscopy to reflect the changes on the structures of humic substances during clo2 oxidation in previous studies good correlations have been observed between chlorinated dbps formation and differential uv absorbance upon chlorination korshin et al 2002 roccaro et al 2008 yan et al 2014 spectral parameters derived from differential absorbance have shown more reliable correlations with dbps formation than other water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon doc and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva differential uv absorbance at 272 nm da272 and 254 nm da254 and log transformed absorbance at 350 nm dlna350 are good indicators for decomposition of humic substances and corresponding dbps formation during chlorination korshin et al 1996 2002 2007 roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 roccaro et al 2015 weishaar et al 2003 yan et al 2014 to date few published studies used differential uv spectra to investigate clo2 oxidation of humic substance wenk and his co workers found that decrease in the absorbance ranging from 300 to 600 nm was prominent during clo2 oxidation the significant change in the differential absorbance at 272 nm a distinct feature for chlorination however was not observed during clo2 oxidation wenk et al 2013 in other words differential uv absorbance after clo2 oxidation visualized distinguished mechanisms from chlorination exploring and characterizing the changes of uv absorbance during clo2 oxidation thus aids to interpret reactions between clo2 and humic substances in addition correlations between the changes of the specific uv absorbance and the formation of chlorite and or chlorate during clo2 oxidation remains largely unexplored differential uv spectroscopy has the great practical potential for quantifying clo2 consumption and monitoring chlorite and chlorate formation clo2 dose control and monitoring of chlorite and chlorate formation are always tricky problems for water utilities due to the regulatory limits of chlorite and chlorate demonstrating the feasibility of differential spectra in predicting or monitoring dbps formation would thus be conducive to clo2 involved water treatment facilities the objectives of this study are i to examine the structural changes of humic substances during clo2 oxidation using uv vis spectroscopy ii to evaluate the correlations between the changes in the spectra of humic substances and clo2 consumption chlorite formation and chlorate formation respectively and iii to investigate the feasibility of using uv differential spectra in monitoring by products formation during clo2 oxidation of real surface waters 2

filtering through a 0 45 μm membrane to remove any undissolved particulate matter four surface water samples sw 1 4 were collected from three rivers in guangdong province china the water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane before use water quality parameters of surface water samples are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental procedures the filtered humic substance solutions were diluted to a united doc level of 2 mg l 1 and buffered to ph 7 0 with 2 mm phosphate before clo2 oxidation a 4 mg l 1 clo2 dose was applied and 20 ml sample were then withdrawn after 2 5 15 30 60 120 360 720 and 1440 min the clo2 dose 4 mg l 1 was determined based on the preliminary clo2 demand test to guarantee the residual clo2 above 0 1 mg l 1 after the 24 h reaction with all humic substances samples another sub sample was purged with nitrogen gas to remove the residual clo2 and the uv vis spectra were recorded ethylenediamine was then added as a preservation agent for chlorite and chlorate analysis chlorination of humic substances was also conducted as a comparative group with an equivalent chlorine dose 4 mg l 1 chlorination was quenched by adding sodium sulfite at a stoichiometric ratio based on the residual chlorine concentration 2 mg sulfite per mg residual chlorine the uv absorbance of chlorinated samples was collected after dechlorination the experiments with model

ratio between clo2 and doc of 2 1 the sw 3 water was diluted to a doc level of 2 mg l 1 before clo2 oxidation due to its relatively high doc level 7 26 mg l 1 the residual clo2 chlorite chlorate and the uv absorbance were recorded using the same methods as in the humic substance tests 2 3 analytical methods doc levels of samples were measured with a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan the clo2

as9 hc dionex usa the eluent was 4 5 mm na2co3 and 0 8 mm nahco3 at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the detection limits for both chlorite and chlorate were 50 μg l 1 uv vis absorbance spectra were recorded using a 5 cm quartz cell on a shimadzu uv 2700 spectrophotometer all spectra were normalized to a 1 cm cell length 3 results and discussion 3 1 spectral characteristics of humic substances after clo2 oxidation 3 1 1 humic substances fig 1 a and b shows the uv vis spectra of the srfa and ppha before and after clo2 oxidation respectively the intensity of absorbance in the 200 600 nm range decreased with increasing clo2 oxidation time since the changes of the absorbance were quite small the linear differential absorbance da spectra was applied in processing initial absorbance data followed the practices in previous studies roccaro et al 2015 yan et al 2014 the calculation is 1 d a λ a λ i a λ 0 aλ i here represents the absorbance value at a specific wavelength λ for a clo2 treated sample after reaction period i and aλ 0 represents the absorbance before clo2 treatment clo2 oxidation of humic substances forms chlorite and chlorate which introduce absorbance in the 200 340 nm range figure si 1 the absorbance of the chlorite generated aclo2 i and the chlorate generated aclo3 i after different reaction periods were thus be subtracted from the differential spectra daλ i to reflect the spectral changes attributable to humic substances exclusively as in eq 2 2 d a λ a λ i a λ 0 a c l o 2 i a c l o 3 i differential absorbance used in this study thus referred to the spectra derived from eq 2 the interference from chlorite and chlorate is negligible at λ 310 nm figure si 1 differential spectra of srfa and ppha after clo2 treatment are shown in fig 1c and d as examples the peak with strong differential absorbance was at approximately 230 nm a broad absorbance band from 300 to 400 nm with a maximum at 316 nm was also observed the scale of the differential spectra slowly increased with increasing reaction time the differential spectra of srfa and ppha exhibited similar intensities at 230 nm but stronger intensity at λ 300 nm was observed in ppha than srfa this indicated that the differential spectra should be attributed to multiple clo2 reactive moieties because of the dissimilar intensity changes at these two absorbance bands besides this observation also demonstrated that the fractions of clo2 reactive moieties varied among different humic substances notably differential spectra of humic substances after clo2 treatment had peaks different from those after chlorination see srfa as an example in figure si 2 differential spectra of humic substances upon clo2 treatment featured a peak at 230 nm but the chlorinated samples had a prominent peak at approximately 270 nm korshin et al 2002 2007 roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 yan et al 2014 differential absorbance after chlorination showed no distinct peaks at λ 300 nm in contrast a significant broad absorbance band was observed at λ 300 nm in clo2 treated samples the different reaction mechanisms and corresponding distinct reaction intermediates and final products may contribute to the differences in spectral characters between chlorination and clo2 oxidation for example quinone moieties are prominent products in reactions between phenolic compounds and clo2 phenoxyl radicals are formed first via one electron transfer from clo2 and then further oxidized to quinones or they undergo irreversible coupling reactions figure si 3 merenyi et al 1988 wajon et al 1982 that is the ring structures are preserved during clo2 oxidation which leads to slight changes in absorbance at 250 λ 280 nm wenk et al 2013 in comparison chlorination involves both oxidation and substitution reactions after chlorine substitution benzene rings become vulnerable with weakened electron clouds due to the strong electron attracting ability of chlorine atoms de vera et al 2017 gallard and von gunten 2002 hence poly chlorinated phenols and smaller chlorinated molecules produced after ring cleavage were the main products of chlorination of phenols figure si 3 criquet et al 2015 li et al 2000 3 1 2 aromatic compounds to examine the idea that those featured peaks upon clo2 oxidation reflect reactions with certain distinct functional groups seven aromatic compounds were selected to measure their differential absorbance spectra during clo2 oxidation aromatic moieties substituted with phenolic carboxylic and methylic groups were found to be reactive towards clo2 and these compounds constitute a large portion of humic substances hoigné and bader 1994 lee and von gunten 2012 the differential absorbance of humic substances may reflect the decomposition of those activated aromatics chen et al 2002 traina et al 1990 none of the tested model compounds showed identical differential spectral features with clo2 oxidation of humic substances although differential spectra of salicylic acid exhibited some similarity with humic substances a sharp peak at 230 nm and a broad absorbance band at 300 nm fig 2 an increasing absorbance at 240 λ 270 nm was observed in clo2 treated salicylic acid which did not occur in clo2 oxidation of humic substances increasing absorbance at 240 λ 270 nm with increasing reaction time was also observed in phenolic compounds including resorcinol hydroquinone and 3 methylphenol table s2 and figure si 4 this may be relevant with the formation of quinone groups as reaction intermediates or products absorbance in the neighborhood of roughly 240 270 nm is common for quinones or aldehydes as a result of a n π transition on c o groups and π π transition on unsaturated c c structures kalsi 2007 in contrast the absorbance of benzoic acids e g 4 methoxybenzoic acid decreased continuously during clo2 oxidation in the range of 240 λ 270 nm in addition clo2 oxidation of model compounds caused increasing absorbance at higher wavelength λ 300 nm except for hydroquinone and salicylic acid this indicated that the decreased of absorbance at λ 300 nm may involved with oxidation of certain carboxylic and polyphenolic moieties which was consistent with differential spectra with changes of these groups in previous studies chlorination of carboxylic or phenolic moieties caused decrease of absorbance from 200 to 400 nm korshin et al 1997 metal binding with carboxyl and hydroxyl substituted organics also exhibited featured peaks at λ 300 nm in differential spectra yan et al 2013 unlike the case for model compounds the absorbance during clo2 oxidation of humic substances decreased steadily over the entire wavelength range the polyphenolic structures in the humic substances may exhibit different patterns in spectral changes from model compounds meanwhile other than phenolic moieties polyenes aniline and polycyclic aromatic groups are also clo2 reactive moieties their decomposition by clo2 would cause reduced absorptivity in the region 250 λ 280 nm peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 that is the differential absorbance during clo2 oxidation integrates the degradation of different clo2 reactive moieties and the corresponding formation of intermediates no single model compounds can completely represent the overall absorbance properties of the complicated structure of humic substances 3 2 spectral coefficients and correlations with clo2 consumption and by product formation 3 2 1 deconvolution of the differential spectra deconvolution of the differential spectra was conducted to determine the presence and contributions of the distinct bands using the software peakfit version 4 12 followed the established practices in previous study yan et al 2013 yan and korshin 2014 details in text s1 the bands were assumed to have a gaussian shape when represented versus photon energy measured in ev calculated as 3 e e v 1240 λ n m each gaussian band ai was characterized by the location of its maximum e0i its width wi and its amplitude a0i this generated differential spectra a e computed as 4 δ a e δ a i δ a o i exp 1 2 e e o i w i 2 the differential spectra upon clo2 oxidation was fitted well with r2 0 98 in all cases fig 3 and figure si 5 the deconvolutions in the range of 200 λ 500 nm showed seven gaussian bands although the width and intensity of the fitted gaussian peaks varied with different humic substances the positions of these bands maxima were consistent among different humic substances table s3 five of the fitted gaussian bands matched positions derived from previous studies on humic substances he et al 2015 yan et al 2013 2014 they are denoted as a6 a5 a4 a3 and a1 with maxima located at 385 nm 3 22 0 07 ev 316 nm 3 92 0 04 ev 276 nm 4 50 0 07 ev 240 nm 5 19 0 08 ev and 200 nm 6 23 0 12 ev respectively the a7 band which peaked at 475 nm 2 61 0 08 ev featured in differential spectra upon clo2 oxidation the a2 band at 225 nm 5 51 0 07 ev was introduced to represent the clo2 oxidation peak around 230 nm changes in these featured gaussian peaks reflect the response of structural changes of humic substances after clo2 oxidation evaluation of proper spectral coefficients derived from gaussian bands was conducted to represent the changes of humic substances during clo2 oxidation spectroscopic interference and matrix influence e g absorbance from inorganic ions led to a negative a1 band with a maximum at about 200 nm a1 whose properties were very tricky to analyze though the differential spectra of the humic substance had a peak at 230 nm a2 the absorbance at this wavelength is always interfered by the presence of nitrite and nitrate figure si 6 which also obstructs the analysis of water samples in practical applications in addition absorbance of chlorite overlaps with those of a3 240 nm and a4 276 nm figure si 1 although the interference of chlorite was subtracted in this study we did not use the spectral changes at 240 nm or 276 nm for further quantification considering the needs for potential online monitoring of chlorite formation in real waters spectral parameters da240 and da276 were unsuitable because subtracting interferences of chlorite from differential spectra in real time is unrealistic and impractical generally interferences from inorganic ions fade away at λ 310 nm however precise measurement of minor changes in a7 457 nm during clo2 oxidation was challenging because of the rapid decrease in absorbance at λ 400 nm fig 1 among the seven gaussian peaks a5 316 nm and a6 385 nm were dominant averagely accounting for 17 and 31 of the area of differential spectra upon clo2 oxidation table s3 both a5 and a6 contributed to the broad differential absorbance band 300 λ 400 nm observed from the humic substances after clo2 oxidation since a6 385 nm partially overlapped with a5 316 nm fig 3 differential absorbance at 400 nm instead of 385 nm was selected to represent changes in a6 thus the differential absorbance at 316 nm da316 and 400 nm da400 were selected to represent and quantify the spectral changes during clo2 oxidation without interference of inorganic ions 3 2 2 correlations among spectral coefficients clo2 consumption and chlorite chlorate formation as shown in fig 4 strong correlations were observed among spectral parameters da316 and da400 and clo2 consumption chlorite formation chlorate formation respectively during clo2 oxidation of humic substances the r2 values were all larger than 0 84 table s4 it is noteworthy that the linear functions slope and intercept varied among different humic substances correlations between da400 were taken as examples figure s7 an interesting observation was that these correlations formed two groups depending on their linear intercepts figure si 7 and si 8 one including srfa nlfa and lha with positive intercepts and the other humic substances e g srha and ppha with negative intercepts positive intercepts in the correlations indicated that some fast clo2 reactive moieties in the humic substances can form chlorite during clo2 oxidation without significant changes in spectral absorbance at 316 nm and 400 nm oppositely some clo2 reactive moieties in the humic substances had significant spectral decreases but did not form chlorite upon clo2 oxidation the results also demonstrated the distinct reaction moieties in humic substances when reacting with clo2 the slope of the linear relationships denoted as s represents the by product production mg l 1 per unit of absorbance change cm 1 it should be noted that as the linear relationship did not pass the origin the s values here reflect the changes of humic substances which can still react with clo2 after the first 2 min the first sampling point in this study in other words s values in the correlation represented the slow reacting precursors during clo2 oxidation instead of fast reacting precursors which react with clo2 in the initial 2 min the s value at 400 nm varied among the different humic substances table s4 the s400 chlorite values predicting chlorite formation ranged from 332 to 731 mg cm l 1 and those predicting clo2 consumption s400 clo2 ranged from 507 to 1567 mg cm l 1 considering the low concentrations of chlorate 6 conversion from consumed clo2 correlations with chlorate formation was not discussed further the results demonstrated that the relationships between spectral parameters clo2 demand and chlorite formation were site specific as shown in fig 5 greater s values s400 clo2 and s400 chlorite were observed in humic substances with lower suva values indeed the best fit curve was not linear but exponential this indicated that chlorite formation and clo2 consumption in response to absorbance changes in 400 nm tended to relate with substituted functional groups on aromatic benzene rings rather than destruction of aromatic ring structures this may be related with the carboxylic and polyphenolic groups which was suggested by results from model compounds in this study in addition previous studies suggested that the spectral changes at 350 λ 400 nm related to reactions metal binding deprotonation and oxidation with carboxylic and phenolic groups in organic matter del vecchio and blough 2004 yan et al 2013 2017 on the other hand the site specificity of spectral parameters was attributed with varied amount and species of clo2 reactive substituted functional groups in different waters overall the strong correlations with spectra parameters da316 and da400 show the considerable advantages of using as indicators for clo2 consumption and chlorite formation firstly correlations with da316 and da400 were stronger and more reliable than bulk organic indicators such as doc and suva values no correlations were observed between doc removal and clo2 consumption and chlorite formation during clo2 oxidation figure si 9 although suva removal correlated well with clo2 consumption and chlorite formation in some humic substances e g r2 0 92 for srfa but the correlations were unstable in general e g r2 0 57 and 0 72 for umnom and lha respectively figure si 9 another feature of spectral parameters da316 and da400 was that they both changed with increasing reaction time which provided a possibility to predict residual clo2 and chlorite and chlorate concentrations at different sites along a distribution system 3 3 application of differential uv spectroscopy with multiple water sources to further examine the applicability and feasibility of using da316 or da400 in practice tests with natural surface waters were conducted the absorbance spectra and the differential spectra of four surface waters after clo2 oxidation were shown in figure si 10 the differential spectra had varied featured peaks after clo2 oxidation of different water samples for example a peak at 230 nm in differential spectra was observed in sw 1 and sw 2 but not in sw 4 while absorbance decreased over the whole wavelength range during clo2 oxidation of sw 3 and sw 4 increased absorbance in the range of 250 λ 300 nm was exhibited in sw 1 and sw 2 although the differential spectra of the natural waters were not identical with those of humic substances the presence of the broad absorbance band from 300 to 400 nm was common in different water samples thus da316 and da400 are still feasible and viable indicators of clo2 oxidation of real waters strong correlations among spectra parameters da316 and da400 clo2 consumption and chlorite formation also existed in surface water samples with r2 values 0 8 fig 6 since the chlorate concentrations were less than 0 2 mg l 1 correlations with chlorate were not evaluated in surface waters considering the site specificity of correlation coefficients preliminary tests with local source waters would be required in practice since the intensities of absorbance correlate with the contents of aromatic compounds novak et al 1992 more sensitive uv vis techniques will be necessary to capture accurate data during clo2 oxidation of water samples with low suva values in practical application such as a cell with a longer path length overall da316 and da400 should still be useful in practical implementation based on their reliable and strong correlations found in this study online monitoring during clo2 oxidation by determining changes of da316 and da400 would be a promising approach of refining clo2 dose and monitoring chlorite formation application of da272 to monitor chlorinated dbps during chlorination had already evaluated in full scale condition beauchamp et al 2018 which supports the possible application of spectra parameters da316 and da400 during clo2 oxidation in water treatment facilities in the future further work can focus on practices of spectra parameters in full scale conditions influence of varied source water properties and water treatment processes ahead of clo2 application needs to be evaluated factors like seasonal temperature changes and ph variation of different source waters should be considered to establish more applicable and reliable correlations with spectra parameters in practical implementation 4 conclusions changes in uv vis spectra provide an integrated reflection of clo2 oxidation of organic matters the differential spectra of humic substances upon clo2 oxidation exhibited a sharp peak at 230 nm and a broad absorbance band at λ 300 nm the broad absorbance band at 300 λ 400 nm commonly existed in different humic substances and real water samples results with model aromatic compounds supported that differential spectra upon clo2 oxidation were contributed by reactions with varied clo2 reactive moieties seven gaussian bands with maxima at 200 225 240 276 316 385 and 457 nm were closely fitted the differential spectra of humic substances during clo2 oxidation differential absorbance at 316 nm and 400 nm da316 and da400 can nicely quantify the structural changes of humic substances and real waters during clo2 oxidation with negligible influence of water matrixes strong correlations were observed among spectral parameters da316 and da400 clo2 consumption chlorite formation and chlorate formation in both humic substances and real waters the correlation coefficients slopes and intercepts were found to be site specific this study has identified the spectra parameters da316 and da400 can reflect the changes in organic moieties during clo2 oxidation which give insights in the different reaction mechanisms between clo2 oxidation and chlorination the strong correlations among da316 and da400 clo2 consumption chlorite and chlorate formation demonstrated the promising potential for online monitoring of clo2 application in full scale drinking water treatment and predicting chlorite and chlorate concentrations in the

19587,wastewater treatment ecotechnologies such as constructed wetlands and denitrifying bioreactors are commonly perceived as robust and resilient to shock loading but this has proved difficult to quantify particularly when comparing different systems this study proposes a method of quantifying and comparing performance resilience in response to a standard disturbance in a side by side study we compare the treatment performance of four different configurations of wetlands and denitrifying bioreactors subjected to hydraulic shock loads of five times the standard inflow rate of primary treated sewage for five days the systems consist of horizontal flow gravel bed wetlands hg single pass vertical flow sand or gravel media wetlands followed by carbonaceous denitrifying bioreactors vs c and vg c respectively and a recirculating anoxic attached growth bioreactor and vertical sand media wetland followed by carbonaceous denitrifying bioreactors r a vs c resilience was quantified for total suspended solids tss five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and total nitrogen tn by time integration of relative disturbance in performance relative to pre shock loading performance days equivalent performance reduction and by the recovery time after shock loading ceased the quantification method allowed an unbiased comparison of the four different systems it highlighted important differences in the resilience for different removal mechanisms associated with the configuration of the wetlands bioreactor systems relative disturbances in performance were expressed in comparison to percent daily removal under standard loading and for the different pollutants were equivalent to loss of between 0 08 and 2 51 days of removal capacity average recovery times ranged from zero to three days with all systems exhibiting substantial recovery even during the five day shock loading period this study demonstrated that both the horizontal gravel wetland and the vertical flow wetland systems combined with carbonaceous bioreactors tested are generally resilient to shock loading of five times hydraulic and organic loading for periods of up to five days standard quantification of performance resilience to shock loadings or other perturbations has potential application across a wide range of technologies and research fields graphical abstract image 1 keywords resilience shock loading performance recovery constructed wetlands bioreactors 1 introduction wastewater treatment systems are often exposed to perturbations such as variations in the quantity and composition of inflows this can be particularly significant in tourist and recreational areas where dramatic increases in population occur during holidays or events leading to associated increases in flow rate i e shock loading castillo et al 1997 leitão et al 2006 masi et al 2007 although there are a range of studies in the literature on the influence of shock loads on treatment performance comparisons between different systems are difficult due to the different types and intensity of shock loading applied and the lack of equivalent measurements between studies shock loading techniques include increased hydraulic loading badkoubi et al 1998 fountoulakis et al 2009 saeed et al 2016 organic loading galvão and matos 2012 mulling et al 2013 environmental pollutants mungur et al 1997 or a combination of the above masi et al 2007 saeed and sun 2013 sharma et al 2013 zapater et al 2011 similarly diverse methods are used for shock loading bioreactors e g biological aerated filters fluidised bed reactors denitrification beds etc reflecting the wide range of environmental perturbations such systems are exposed to borja and banks 1995 he et al 2007 hu et al 2011 leitão et al 2006 due to the different shock loading approaches different reporting methodologies have been used in these studies such as percent reduction in performance changes in mass removal rates or simply reduced effluent quality despite different approaches there is a widespread recognition within these studies that to quantify a system s resilience key indices are its ability to resist change measured as relative disturbance in performance and the time taken to recover to pre disturbance levels of performance recovery time indeed these definitions have been used to describe resilience to disturbance in a wide variety of fields including environmental research winkelman et al 2010 engineering buildings and communities after earthquakes bruneau et al 2003 karamlou and bocchini 2015 and economics pant et al 2014 by mathematically integrating relative disturbance in performance and quantifying recovery time a comparative framework is available to assess the resilience of different treatment systems in a quantitative manner it is also important to realise that resilience is not the same as performance but is indexed to it i e to pre disturbance performance for instance one system may have relatively low performance under steady state operation and yet be relatively unaffected by a disturbance event i e high resilience another system may have a high level of performance under steady state operation but have markedly reduced performance during and after disturbance i e lower resilience in fact the second system may still have a higher level of performance throughout the disturbance than the system which was least affected this study demonstrates a method of quantifying performance of various configurations of constructed wetlands and bioreactors in response to a standard disturbance and allows unbiased comparisons of each systems resilience the 5 fold increase in hydraulic loading provides a significant but realistic challenge to the systems such as might occur for on site treatment at holiday homes camping grounds or beach side resorts during tourist seasons the method mathematically integrates the period of reduced performance and its extent to quantify performance resilience in terms of three key contaminants tss bod5 and tn the wetland and bioreactor combinations chosen represent a range of treatment complexity currently in use or proposed for on site treatment from a simple horizontal gravel system to a multi stage recirculating wetland with separate modules for nitrification and denitrification 2 materials and methods 2 1 constructed wetland and bioreactor set up pilot scale wetland and denitrifying bioreactor systems were installed and the experiment conducted in the 2012 austral winter at the pukete wastewater treatment plant 140 000 person equivalents which serves the city of hamilton north island new zealand 37 43 s 175 13 e the configurations of each wetland system tested are illustrated in fig 1 and their specifications and measured hydraulic loading rates summarised in table 1 all of the system components had been established and in operation for around four years prior to this experiment with detailed configuration and performance of the systems under long term standard loads characterized and reported in tanner et al 2012 during the standard operation period primary treated screened and settled domestic wastewater chosen to simulate septic tank effluent was pumped hourly into each of the four pilot scale treatment trains from a common wastewater sump the primary settled wastewater available from this municipal source over the wet winter period was moderately influenced by groundwater infiltration and stormwater intrusion into the sewerage system so was of lower strength than some on site septic tank effluents crites and tchobanoglous 1998 the pilot systems which were 20 40 of household scale one to two person equivalents comprised 1 hg a two stage passive horizontal subsurface flow wetlands

gravel media wetlands planted with carex virgata nine plants per m2 followed by carbonaceous denitrifying bioreactors 3 vs c paired single pass vertical flow sand media wetlands planted with carex virgata nine plants per m2 followed by carbonaceous denitrifying bioreactors 4 r a vs c a single v ertical flow s and media wetland planted with carex virgata nine plants per m2 preceded by an a ttached growth anoxic bioreactor packed with biofilm growth media which received the raw inflow the outflow from the vertical flow wetland was r ecirculated at a 4 1 ratio through these two modules with outflow from these entering the c arbonaceous denitrifying bioreactors the hg system was permanently saturated with wastewater to just below the gravel surface the vertical flow components of the remaining systems vg c vs c and r a vs c fig 1 comprised 0 9 m deep tanks which passively drained between inflows the carbonaceous bioreactors 0 9 m deep operated in permanently saturated down flow mode with the influent entering the top of the tanks and exiting through the base with water levels maintained near the surface of the media using an exterior stand pipe the carbonaceous media in the denitrifying bioreactors comprised woodchip cw and coconut husk ch in series each carbonaceous bioreactor was covered to exclude rainfall and shade out weed growth the attached growth anoxic bioreactor a at the start of the recirculating vertical flow systems r a vs c fig 1 received the raw wastewater inflow as well as 4 5 of the outflow from the vertical flow wetland via a recycle loop the bioreactor was an enclosed tank filled to a volume of 400 l containing loosely crumpled woven polypropylene shade cloth 5 0 m long by 1 5 m wide 85 shade to provide biofilm attachment surfaces outflow from this system entered a small sump which was dosed onto the surface of the vertical flow wetland via a pump triggered by a float valve 2 2 shock loading methodology shock loading of these systems during the southern hemisphere winter june july 2012 was achieved by increasing the inflows from hourly to once every 12 min resulting in equivalent five fold increases in the hydraulic loading rates and equivalent decreases in hydraulic retention times hrt table 1 hydraulic loading rates for the systems during the standard operational period was 28 mm d 1 for hg giving an hrt of 5 3 days which is within the range commonly used for on site household applications 64 mm d 1 for the vg c hrt 2 7 d 56 mm d 1 for the complete vs c system hrt 3 1 d and 52 mm d 1 for the r a vs c system

quantified as 1 relative disturbance in performance and 2 recovery time relative disturbance in performance is measured by mathematically integrating percent loss of performance as a proportion of pre shock loading summed over the number of days taken to return to pre shock loading performance using equations 1 3 below and illustrated in fig 2 determining when post disturbance performance is equivalent to pre disturbance performance depends upon how variable these periods are recovery time is defined as the time taken for performance to either reach pre shock loading performance or if

during the new zealand winter experimental period ranged from 3 1 c to 9 8 c with a minimum of 4 5 c average influent wastewater temperatures varied between 7 3 c and 13 7 c measured at time of collection 9 10 a m frequent rainfall events reflected typical nz winter conditions in this location with direct input of rainfall to the uncovered wetland portions ranging from 0 4 to 0 8 of total flows during the shock loading period and from 0 8 to 1 9 during the post shock loading recovery period see supplementary fig s1 for detailed temperature and rainfall information 3 2 removal of total suspended solids tss all four treatment systems tested consistently achieved high tss removal 94 during the pre shock loading period of standard loading fig 3 some variability in inflow concentration was apparent with a reduction in inflow from nearly 80 g m 3 to a low of around 50 g m 3 this variability was likely associated with variable concentrations of inflow strength reaching the wastewater treatment plant either associated with local industry or stormwater infiltration to the municipal sewerage system during the shock loading mean tss concentrations in the hg outflow increased four fold from 3 to 12 g m 3 resulting in a decrease in tss removal efficiency by 20 fig 4 the hg system recovered to pre shock loading levels within two to four days when the shock loading was ceased in contrast the increase in final outflow tss concentrations for the three systems with vertical flow wetlands during the shock loading period was small from means of 3 0 3 3 g m 3 during the pre shock loading to 3 6 5 0 g m 3 during the shock loading fig 3 resulting in about 4 5 fold increase in the areal tss mass removal rate from 2 9 to 3 6 g m 2 d 1 up to 12 8 14 5 g m 2 d 1 table 2 removal of solids associated pollutants such as tp and organic nitrogen during the shock loading are shown in regression graphs in the supplementary data section fig s3 the resilience of the four systems for tss removal in terms of magnitude and duration of system perturbation relative to the pre shock loading performance is shown in fig 4 while all the wetland systems recovered to pre shock tss removal performance before the five day shock loading had ended the vertical flow wetland systems had only 0 06 0 33 days equivalent relative disturbance in performance compared with 0 96 days in the hg system i e horizontal gravel bed wetland 3 3 removal of bod5 all four treatment systems consistently achieved high bod5 removal 96 during the pre shock loading period fig 5 of the systems tested the hg showed the greatest increase in effluent concentration during the shock loading period from 10 pre shock loading up to a peak of 25 g m 3 however this was associated with an increase in the areal mass removal rate from 2 9 g m 2 d 1 up to 9 9 g m 2 d 1 about 3 4 fold the bod5 removal in the hg system recovered to pre shock loading levels within two to four days from when the shock loading ceased fig 5 areal bod5 mass removal rate in the other three systems each with vertical flow wetland components increased by three to four fold 5 8 7 1 g m 2 d 1 up to 21 24 g m 2 d 1 during the shock loading period table 2 as a result overall percent removals relative to inflow concentrations were not greatly affected maintaining between 86 and 99 fig 6 of pre shock loading levels averages of 91 and 97 reduction in bod5 removal fig 6 under the shock loading was similar to tss removal for example the hg system had 1 20 days equivalent performance reduction compared with 0 12 0 23 days for the vertical flow wetland systems 3 4 removal of tn shock loading of the hg system resulted in only a small transient increase in effluent tn concentrations corresponding to a 4 5 fold increase in tn and nh4 n mass removal similar to the increase in inflow volumes table 3 however the tn and constituent nh4 n removal performance of the hg system was relatively poor during this winter pre shock loading period areal tn and nh4 n mass removal rates respectively 0 21 and 0 11 g m 2 d 1 percent tn and nh4 n mass removal 23 and 14 table 3 and supplementary fig s2 presumably due to restricted nitrification rates under the low oxygen supply characteristic of these saturated horizontal flow systems and the low ambient winter temperatures kadlec and wallace 2009 during shock loading effluent nh4 n concentrations in both the first and second hg stages were slightly elevated immediately after the shock loading effluent nh4 n concentrations in the first hg stage stayed elevated but were reduced to pre shock loading levels in the second hg stage nox n which only occurred at low concentrations 1 2 g m 3 in the second hg stage pre shock loading effluent declined during shock loading and then slowly recovered to original levels in comparison to the hg systems the systems with vertical flow stages achieved substantially higher tn and nh4 n efficiencies and areal mass removal rates prior to shock loading in the range of 64 89 3 1 3 6 g m 2 1 for tn and 63 94 2 0 3 4 g m 2d 1 for nh4 n table 3 these were similar to removal rates reported previously for these systems operating under consistent inflow rates tanner et al 2012 shock loading of the systems with vertical flow stages resulted in greater relative reductions in tn treatment performance than recorded for hg fig 7 with days equivalent relative disturbance in performance ranging from 0 76 days vg c to 2 5 days r a vs c table 3 under shock loading the areal nh4 n mass removal rates in the single pass vertical flow systems increased 4 1 4 4 fold which was a similar proportional increase to that shown by the hg system areal nh4 n mass removal rates in the recirculating system r a vs c which received slightly higher mass loadings during shock loadings 5 4 times standard rose even more to 6 2 fold table 3 for the single pass vertical flow systems the wood chip carbonaceous bioreactors cw achieved 1 89 2 07 g m 2 d 1 areal nox n mass removal rate based on nox n reduction at mean mass nox n loadings of 2 45 2 95 g m 2 d 1 during the standard operation period table 3 during the shock loading period apparent denitrification rates in the cw bioreactors did not alter greatly reducing to 1 40 g m 2 d 1 after the vs module but increasing slightly after the vg module to 2 20 g m 2 d 1 mass nox n removal rates 1 g m 2 d 1 within the coconut husk modules ch which because of their position after the cw modules in the treatment train normally received lower mass loadings rose slightly but remained much less than those achieved in the wood chip cw bioreactors the wetland systems studied exhibited some relative disturbance in performance in tn removal during the shock loading period but rapidly recovered in most instances with each beginning to recover before shock loading had finished fig 7 percent tn removal in the vg c system declined from 89 to 85 equivalent to 0 76 days relative disturbance in performance table 3 and then recovered to 89 in the post shock loading period the similarly configured vs c system slightly reduced tn removal from 68 to 63 1 4 days relative disturbance in performance during the shock loading but had improved performance throughout the remaining experimental period with post shock loading tn removal of 78 the recirculating vertical flow system r a vs c system had 64 tn removal which fell to 55 during the shock loading 2 51 days relative disturbance in performance in terms of tn removal the hg system was the most resilient to the shock loading compared with pre shock loading performance with only minor relative disturbance in performance 0 29 days and rapid recovery time fig 7 the single pass vertical flow systems were next most affected followed by the recirculating vertical flow system the vg c system had the highest performance prior to the shock loading and also showed the highest average resilience during the shock loading table 4 the shock loading resulted in a reduction in nitrate concentrations in the outlet of the vg but there was no associated rise in nh4 n concentrations fig s2b org n increased only slightly in the outlet of the vg during the shock loading period indicating much of the increased load was being retained within this module nitrate concentrations in the outlet from the carbonaceous bioreactors were mildly elevated during the shock loading dropping to normal concentrations in the subsequent five days the woodchip filter cw showed only about a 6 increase in apparent denitrification rates the coconut husk filter ch had much lower apparent denitrification rates under standard loading which increased more than 4 fold under the shock loading table 3 but remained below the rate in the cw thus additional compensatory capacity was available in the system to buffer treatment performance during the shock loading maintaining overall tn removal performance similar to that under standard loading in contrast concentrations of nh4 n in the outlet of the vs stage of the recirculating system r a vs c system rose during shock loading with a concomitant drop in no3 n concentration indicating reduced nitrification efficiency at the very high hydraulic loads resulting from 4 1 recirculation 4 discussion 4 1 system resilience tss and bod5 response by increasing the flow rate five fold during the shock loading period all systems received the equivalent of 25 days flow over the 5 day shock loading period despite its lower areal loading and passive operation i e not dependant on periodic dosing or use of recirculation loops the horizontal gravel flow wetland hg system was the least resilient system for tss and bod5 removal removal in the hg system dropped to a minimum of 76 of the performance under standard loading for tss figs 4 and 90 for bod5 fig 6 resulting in 1 07 and 0 55 days equivalent relative disturbance in performance respectively over the five day shock loading and subsequent period until performance returned to pre shock loading levels table 4 in comparison the vertical flow systems only reduced performance equivalent to 0 11 0 32 days for tss and from 0 08 to 0 29 for bod5 the superior performance resilience of the vertical flow wetland systems for tss and bod5 is likely to reflect differences in the dominant removal mechanisms for particulate materials compared to the horizontal flow wetlands the vertical flow wetlands remove suspended solids via physical filtration or straining through a fine matrix brix and arias 2005 gross et al 2007 sklarz et al 2009 tondera et al 2018 whereas gravity sedimentation adsorption and mineralization within the coarse gravel media are likely to be the dominant removal mechanisms in the saturated horizontal flow hg system mulling et al 2013 sundaravadivel and vigneswaran 2001 tondera et al 2018 therefore the hg system appeared to be more influenced by the reduced hrt and associated higher interstitial horizontal flow velocities that would have occurred during the shock loading period mobilising accumulated solids in the media and elevating tss and bod5 concentrations in the final outflow 4 2 system resilience tn response the tn performance resilience for the different systems was quite different to that for tss and bod5 with the horizontal and vertical flow gravel media based hg and vg c systems showing greater resilience than the single pass and recirculating vertical flow sand media based systems vs c and r a vs c the primary tn removal mechanism in wetland systems is commonly assumed to be sequential nitrification and denitrification tanner et al 2002 2012 while a reduction in nitrate outlet concentrations of the vg module was observed this was not associated with an increase in nh4 n concentrations i e a reduction in nitrification this module is designed primarily for nitrification thus reduction in effluent concentrations for both nh4 n and no3 n suggests processes other than nitrification were operating during the shock loading period this could be either increased adsorption within the bed or development of conditions suitable for partial denitrification associated with elevated organic loadings and reduced rest periods sikora et al 1995 wojciechowska et al 2017 as denitrification in the wood chip and coconut husk filters is likely to be a zero order reaction schipper et al 2010 some reduction in tn removal was expected under shock loadings as was observed table 3 the large relative treatment volume of the hg system provides greater capacity for such nh4 n sorption and also org n retention with slow n spiralling through the system enabling subsequent processing kadlec et al 2005 tanner et al 2002 repeated shock loadings could overwhelm this buffering capacity resulting in reduced long term performance as retained n and organic matter was subsequently processed or clogging compromises flow through the bed knowles et al 2011 in contrast to nh4 n no3 n is mobile and minimally adsorbed the intermittent dosing of wastewater to the surface of the vertical flow wetland modules substantially increases the supply of oxygen to the bed ye et al 2012 enabling nitrification to occur as the effluent gradually drains through the unsaturated sand or gravel matrix denitrification occurred either where it was recycled to the anoxic bioreactor or in the subsequent carbonaceous bioreactors cw and ch in comparison the sequential nitrogen removal processes are not separated into different optimized modules in the hg system resulting in relatively poor overall nitrogen removal nitrification in the hg system is likely to be oxygen limited because it is reliant on passive aeration processes such as root zone oxygen release and atmospheric diffusion into the wastewater surface between the gravel matrix nivala et al 2013 moreover denitrification occurred in the same module using the limited supply of organic carbon remaining in the influent wastewater and supplied from root exudation zhai et al 2013 and decomposing biomass from the resident wetland plants gersberg et al 1983 within such systems aerobic and anoxic zones form a matrix enabling nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria to sequentially remove nitrogen but at restricted rates the higher net nh4 n removal achieved in the single pass intermittently dosed vertical flow wetland systems can be directly attributed to improved oxygen supply promoting more effective nitrification brix and arias 2005 gross et al 2007 sklarz et al 2009 wastewater applied to the surface of the vertical flow wetlands normally drains through the media rapidly 5 10 min permitting aerobic conditions to re establish in interstitial pore spaces between applications increasing wastewater applications to every 12 min during shock loading still permitted sufficient time for effective drainage between doses enabling aerobic conditions to be re established prior to subsequent applications the recirculating vertical flow wetland system also showed a marked increase in nh4 n removal rates under shock loading with a greater maximum percentage and days equivalent relative disturbance in performance but similar duration compared to the single pass vertical flow or hg wetlands recirculation continuing at a rate of 4 1 resulted in a pumping interval of around 2 5 min under shock loading which in contrast to the single pass systems was inadequate for the system to drain completely between doses this resulted in a marked reduction in tn removal in the recirculating wetland during the initial shock loading period equating to 2 5 days equivalent relative disturbance in performance although tn removal performance improved as the shock loading continued it showed marked fluctuations and did not return fully to normal levels during the post shock loading monitoring period the performance of the denitrification modules cw and ch was more variable although apparent denitrification rates decreased in some modules and increased in others the magnitude of this change was much smaller than that shown in the nitrifying modules the zero order rate of organic carbon release schipper et al 2010 expected from the wood chip cw and coconut husk ch modules would have limited the potential for denitrification to match the increase in nitrification the decreases shown in some denitrification modules e g cw and ch of vs c system may have been due to a greater influx of aerobic wastewater having an inhibitory effect as denitrifers will generally use oxygen rather than nitrate as an electron acceptor if it is available henze et al 1995 4 3 system resilience performance reduction and recovery time comparison of the resilience of the different wetland systems as measured by relative disturbance in performance and recovery time is summarised in table 4 of the four systems subjected to shock loading the hg system had the lowest resilience for tss and bod5 removal however it was the best for tn removal average loss of performance as an overall measure of system resilience was 0 64 days under standard loading while this may be a fair measure of the system resilience it highlights the importance of considering these resilience measures in relation to overall performance for instance while the hg system was more resilient to tn removal than the other vertical flow systems tested tn removal based on an aerial mass removal rate and percent mass removal was still well below that of the vertical flow systems that included an aerobic nitrification module followed by dedicated denitrification bioreactors to achieve equivalent tn removal performance under standard loading to the other vertical flow systems while retaining the benefit of resilient tn removal under shock loading the hg wetland system would need to be considerably enlarged or provided supplementary aeration for enhanced nitrification nivala et al 2013 the hg system showed considerable recovery even during the shock loading period figs 4 6 7 as did all of the treatment systems this was unexpected particularly for removal pathways dominated by microbial metabolisms such as sequential nitrification and denitrification the five day shock loading period during winter weather conditions was likely to be too brief to permit substantial microbial growth the recovery in the removal rate of tss and bod5 may have been associated with reduction in pore spaces within the wetland matrices resulting in increased straining and surface filtration tondera et al 2018 as the increased inflow of organic particles may have caused minor clogging knowles et al 2011 the causal mechanisms associated with this recovery will require further investigation the two single pass vertical flow systems with denitrification bioreactors showed high resilience for tss and bod5 removal under shock loading with recovery times of one day or less and a maximum relative disturbance in performance equivalent to 0 13 days removal table 4 the recirculating vertical flow system showed intermediate resilience for tss and bod5 removal with rapid recovery under the same shock loading with maximum relative disturbance in performance equivalent to 0 32 days removal while nh4 n removal in the vertical flow components increased up to 6 2 fold during the shock loading period mass nitrate removal in the denitrification modules showed either minimal increases or sometimes decreases in various modules reflecting their zero order removal kinetics thus overall their resilience to increased tn loads was lower e g the relative disturbance in performance in the vs c system was equivalent to 1 41 days while the r a vs c system loss was 2 50 days than the hg system which had a relative disturbance in performance equivalent to only 0 29 days removal table 4 4 4 overall system resilience comparison to compare overall resilience of the different constructed wetland systems the relative disturbance in performance of the three water quality measures tss bod5 and tn was averaged confirming that the recirculating system had a greater net relative disturbance in performance 1 04 days than the single pass vertical wetland systems vs c 0 55 days vg c 0 32 days however considering the magnitude and duration of the shock loading 5 fold over 5 days these levels of relative disturbance in performance are relatively small recovery time for tss bod5 and tn removal for each system was a maximum of 2 4 days after shock loading halted table 4 although the recirculating system showed some lingering performance instability and did not return completely to initial levels suggesting possible longer term impairment of performance scenario 3 fig 1 the constructed wetland systems tested showed considerable performance recovery even during the period of disturbance scenario 2 fig 1 making it difficult to define recovery time in situations where such recovery is evident it may be more relevant to consider recovery time from the initial point of disturbance other responses to disturbance could be temporary or permanent impairment of performance temporary impairment could result from accumulation of excess solids and organic matter causing a transient increase in clogging of the media with effects on the hydraulic efficiency and gaseous exchange particularly oxygen supply potentially causing die off of nitrifying microbial communities that are slow to recover additionally retained org n and adsorbed nh4 n could create a backlog of nitrogenous oxygen demand which are subsequently processed causing lingering effects on treatment performance impairment may become permanent where a systems operational limits are exceeded e g due to complete clogging of the wetland media thus a further metric such as failure magnitude juan garcía et al 2017 might be added to quantify this this study illustrated the application of a method of comparing and quantifying the resilience of different wetland and bioreactor treatment systems based on responses measured for a single shock loading event involving a step change in hydrological loading ideally such trials would have been done over a range of shock loading intensities and durations relevant to the situation and used replicate systems to enable full statistical comparisons furthermore in some cases transient increases in wastewater strength may be more relevant than increases in hydrological loads while in others some mix of hydrological and contaminant concentration changes e g higher hydraulic loads of dilute wastewater for combined sewerage systems would be more appropriate however regardless of the method of shock loading used the standard quantification method applied in this study allows fair comparison between different systems and potentially between different studies we believe the methodology builds on the quantification techniques previously developed by bruneau et al 2003 and others and could be applicable to a range of different treatment systems such as wastewater and drinking water treatment systems to compare their resilience or conversely vulnerability to shock loadings 5 conclusions four different configurations of constructed wetlands and bioreactors were subjected to a shock loading of 5 times normal flow for 5 days these included a horizontal flow gravel wetland system hg two vertical flow wetland filled with either gravel or sand followed by carbonaceous bioreactors vg c and vs c and a recirculating vertical flow wetland preceded by an anoxic tank and followed by carbonaceous bioreactors r a vs c an adapted resilience quantification method was used to assess relative reductions in performance for each system for each water quality variable allowing comparisons between each system on average the recirculating system had the most reduced performance equivalent to just over one day s removal 1 04 d followed by the hg 0 64 d and the vs c 0 56 d the vertical gravel plus sand vg c showed the greatest resilience only reducing average performance equivalent to 0 32 days removal each system gave a different response for three key water quality measures tss bod5 and nitrogen where decreases in nitrogen removal were apparent under shock loading performance recovered or nearly so within 2 4 days to pre shock loading treatment levels after shock loading ceased this study demonstrated that the denitrifying bioreactors were less able to accommodate increased influxes of nitrate n this suggests that to maintain nitrate removal performance under shock loading conditions the denitrifying bioreactors would need to be either oversized for standard loading or temporary addition of other available carbon sources would be required the method applied to quantify treatment resilience in relation to a standardised level and period of perturbation allows unbiased quantitative comparison between systems it

19587,wastewater treatment ecotechnologies such as constructed wetlands and denitrifying bioreactors are commonly perceived as robust and resilient to shock loading but this has proved difficult to quantify particularly when comparing different systems this study proposes a method of quantifying and comparing performance resilience in response to a standard disturbance in a side by side study we compare the treatment performance of four different configurations of wetlands and denitrifying bioreactors subjected to hydraulic shock loads of five times the standard inflow rate of primary treated sewage for five days the systems consist of horizontal flow gravel bed wetlands hg single pass vertical flow sand or gravel media wetlands followed by carbonaceous denitrifying bioreactors vs c and vg c respectively and a recirculating anoxic attached growth bioreactor and vertical sand media wetland followed by carbonaceous denitrifying bioreactors r a vs c resilience was quantified for total suspended solids tss five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and total nitrogen tn by time integration of relative disturbance in performance relative to pre shock loading performance days equivalent performance reduction and by the recovery time after shock loading ceased the quantification method allowed an unbiased comparison of the four different systems it highlighted important differences in the resilience for different removal mechanisms associated with the configuration of the wetlands bioreactor systems relative disturbances in performance were expressed in comparison to percent daily removal under standard loading and for the different pollutants were equivalent to loss of between 0 08 and 2 51 days of removal capacity average recovery times ranged from zero to three days with all systems exhibiting substantial recovery even during the five day shock loading period this study demonstrated that both the horizontal gravel wetland and the vertical flow wetland systems combined with carbonaceous bioreactors tested are generally resilient to shock loading of five times hydraulic and organic loading for periods of up to five days standard quantification of performance resilience to shock loadings or other perturbations has potential application across a wide range of technologies and research fields graphical abstract image 1 keywords resilience shock loading performance recovery constructed wetlands bioreactors 1 introduction wastewater treatment systems are often exposed to perturbations such as variations in the quantity and composition of inflows this can be particularly significant in tourist and recreational areas where dramatic increases in population occur during holidays or events leading to associated increases in flow rate i e shock loading castillo et al 1997 leitão et al 2006 masi et al 2007 although there are a range of studies in the literature on the influence of shock loads on treatment performance comparisons between different systems are difficult due to the different types and intensity of shock loading applied and the lack of equivalent measurements between studies shock loading techniques include increased hydraulic loading badkoubi et al 1998 fountoulakis et al 2009 saeed et al 2016 organic loading galvão and matos 2012 mulling et al 2013 environmental pollutants mungur et al 1997 or a combination of the above masi et al 2007 saeed and sun 2013 sharma et al 2013 zapater et al 2011 similarly diverse methods are used for shock loading bioreactors e g biological aerated filters fluidised bed reactors denitrification beds etc reflecting the wide range of environmental perturbations such systems are exposed to borja and banks 1995 he et al 2007 hu et al 2011 leitão et al 2006 due to the different shock loading approaches different reporting methodologies have been used in these studies such as percent reduction in performance changes in mass removal rates or simply reduced effluent quality despite different approaches there is a widespread recognition within these studies that to quantify a system s resilience key indices are its ability to resist change measured as relative disturbance in performance and the time taken to recover to pre disturbance levels of performance recovery time indeed these definitions have been used to describe resilience to disturbance in a wide variety of fields including environmental research winkelman et al 2010 engineering buildings and communities after earthquakes bruneau et al 2003 karamlou and bocchini 2015 and economics pant et al 2014 by mathematically integrating relative disturbance in performance and quantifying recovery time a comparative framework is available to assess the resilience of different treatment systems in a quantitative manner it is also important to realise that resilience is not the same as performance but is indexed to it i e to pre disturbance performance for instance one system may have relatively low performance under steady state operation and yet be relatively unaffected by a disturbance event i e high resilience another system may have a high level of performance under steady state operation but have markedly reduced performance during and after disturbance i e lower resilience in fact the second system may still have a higher level of performance throughout the disturbance than the system which was least affected this study demonstrates a method of quantifying performance of various configurations of constructed wetlands and bioreactors in response to a standard disturbance and allows unbiased comparisons of each systems resilience the 5 fold increase in hydraulic loading provides a significant but realistic challenge to the systems such as might occur for on site treatment at holiday homes camping grounds or beach side resorts during tourist seasons the method mathematically integrates the period of reduced performance and its extent to quantify performance resilience in terms of three key contaminants tss bod5 and tn the wetland and bioreactor combinations chosen represent a range of treatment complexity currently in use or proposed for on site treatment from a simple horizontal gravel system to a multi stage recirculating wetland with separate modules for nitrification and denitrification 2 materials and methods 2 1 constructed wetland and bioreactor set up pilot scale wetland and denitrifying bioreactor systems were installed and the experiment conducted in the 2012 austral winter at the pukete wastewater treatment plant 140 000 person equivalents which serves the city of hamilton north island new zealand 37 43 s 175 13 e the configurations of each wetland system tested are illustrated in fig 1 and their specifications and measured hydraulic loading rates summarised in table 1 all of the system components had been established and in operation for around four years prior to this experiment with detailed configuration and performance of the systems under long term standard loads characterized and reported in tanner et al 2012 during the standard operation period primary treated screened and settled domestic wastewater chosen to simulate septic tank effluent was pumped hourly into each of the four pilot scale treatment trains from a common wastewater sump the primary settled wastewater available from this municipal source over the wet winter period was moderately influenced by groundwater infiltration and stormwater intrusion into the sewerage system so was of lower strength than some on site septic tank effluents crites and tchobanoglous 1998 the pilot systems which were 20 40 of household scale one to two person equivalents comprised 1 hg a two stage passive horizontal subsurface flow wetlands filled with gravel media and planted with a 50 50 mix of jointed twig rush machaerina articulata and soft stem bulrush schoenoplectus tabernaemontani 2 vg c paired single pass vertical flow fine gravel media wetlands planted with carex virgata nine plants per m2 followed by carbonaceous denitrifying bioreactors 3 vs c paired single pass vertical flow sand media wetlands planted with carex virgata nine plants per m2 followed by carbonaceous denitrifying bioreactors 4 r a vs c a single v ertical flow s and media wetland planted with carex virgata nine plants per m2 preceded by an a ttached growth anoxic bioreactor packed with biofilm growth media which received the raw inflow the outflow from the vertical flow wetland was r ecirculated at a 4 1 ratio through these two modules with outflow from these entering the c arbonaceous denitrifying bioreactors the hg system was permanently saturated with wastewater to just below the gravel surface the vertical flow components of the remaining systems vg c vs c and r a vs c fig 1 comprised 0 9 m deep tanks which passively drained between inflows the carbonaceous bioreactors 0 9 m deep operated in permanently saturated down flow mode with the influent entering the top of the tanks and exiting through the base with water levels maintained near the surface of the media using an exterior stand pipe the carbonaceous media in the denitrifying bioreactors comprised woodchip cw and coconut husk ch in series each carbonaceous bioreactor was covered to exclude rainfall and shade out weed growth the attached growth anoxic bioreactor a at the start of the recirculating vertical flow systems r a vs c fig 1 received the raw wastewater inflow as well as 4 5 of the outflow from the vertical flow wetland via a recycle loop the bioreactor was an enclosed tank filled to a volume of 400 l containing loosely crumpled woven polypropylene shade cloth 5 0 m long by 1 5 m wide 85 shade to provide biofilm attachment surfaces outflow from this system entered a small sump which was dosed onto the surface of the vertical flow wetland via a pump triggered by a float valve 2 2 shock loading methodology shock loading of these systems during the southern hemisphere winter june july 2012 was achieved by increasing the inflows from hourly to once every 12 min resulting in equivalent five fold increases in the hydraulic loading rates and equivalent decreases in hydraulic retention times hrt table 1 hydraulic loading rates for the systems during the standard operational period was 28 mm d 1 for hg giving an hrt of 5 3 days which is within the range commonly used for on site household applications 64 mm d 1 for the vg c hrt 2 7 d 56 mm d 1 for the complete vs c system hrt 3 1 d and 52 mm d 1 for the r a vs c system

quantified as 1 relative disturbance in performance and 2 recovery time relative disturbance in performance is measured by mathematically integrating percent loss of performance as a proportion of pre shock loading summed over the number of days taken to return to pre shock loading performance using equations 1 3 below and illustrated in fig 2 determining when post disturbance performance is equivalent to pre disturbance performance depends upon how variable these periods are recovery time is defined as the time taken for performance to either reach pre shock loading performance or if

during the new zealand winter experimental period ranged from 3 1 c to 9 8 c with a minimum of 4 5 c average influent wastewater temperatures varied between 7 3 c and 13 7 c measured at time of collection 9 10 a m frequent rainfall events reflected typical nz winter conditions in this location with direct input of rainfall to the uncovered wetland portions ranging from 0 4 to 0 8 of total flows during the shock loading period and from 0 8 to 1 9 during the post shock loading recovery period see supplementary fig s1 for detailed temperature and rainfall information 3 2 removal of total suspended solids tss all four treatment systems tested consistently achieved high tss removal 94 during the pre shock loading period of standard loading fig 3 some variability in inflow concentration was apparent with a reduction in inflow from nearly 80 g m 3 to a low of around 50 g m 3 this variability was likely associated with variable concentrations of inflow strength reaching the wastewater treatment plant either associated with local industry or stormwater infiltration to the municipal sewerage system during the shock loading mean tss concentrations in the hg outflow increased four fold from 3 to 12 g m 3 resulting in a decrease in tss removal efficiency by 20 fig 4 the hg system recovered to pre shock loading levels within two to four days when the shock loading was ceased in contrast the increase in final outflow tss concentrations for the three systems with vertical flow wetlands during the shock loading period was small from means of 3 0 3 3 g m 3 during the pre shock loading to 3 6 5 0 g m 3 during the shock loading fig 3 resulting in about 4 5 fold increase in the areal tss mass removal rate from 2 9 to 3 6 g m 2 d 1 up to 12 8 14 5 g m 2 d 1 table 2 removal of solids associated pollutants such as tp and organic nitrogen during the shock loading are shown in regression graphs in the supplementary data section fig s3 the resilience of the four systems for tss removal in terms of magnitude and duration of system perturbation relative to the pre shock loading performance is shown in fig 4 while all the wetland systems recovered to pre shock tss removal performance before the five day shock loading had ended the vertical flow wetland systems had only 0 06 0 33 days equivalent relative disturbance in performance compared with 0 96 days in the hg system i e horizontal gravel bed wetland 3 3 removal of bod5 all four treatment systems consistently achieved high bod5 removal 96 during the pre shock loading period fig 5 of the systems tested the hg showed the greatest increase in effluent concentration during the shock loading period from 10 pre shock loading up to a peak of 25 g m 3 however this was associated with an increase in the areal mass removal rate from 2 9 g m 2 d 1 up to 9 9 g m 2 d 1 about 3 4 fold the bod5 removal in the hg system recovered to pre shock loading levels within two to four days from when the shock loading ceased fig 5 areal bod5 mass removal rate in the other three systems each with vertical flow wetland components increased by three to four fold 5 8 7 1 g m 2 d 1 up to 21 24 g m 2 d 1 during the shock loading period table 2 as a result overall percent removals relative to inflow concentrations were not greatly affected maintaining between 86 and 99 fig 6 of pre shock loading levels averages of 91 and 97 reduction in bod5 removal fig 6 under the shock loading was similar to tss removal for example the hg system had 1 20 days equivalent performance reduction compared with 0 12 0 23 days for the vertical flow wetland systems 3 4 removal of tn shock loading of the hg system resulted in only a small transient increase in effluent tn concentrations corresponding to a 4 5 fold increase in tn and nh4 n mass removal similar to the increase in inflow volumes table 3 however the tn and constituent nh4 n removal performance of the hg system was relatively poor during this winter pre shock loading period areal tn and nh4 n mass removal rates respectively 0 21 and 0 11 g m 2 d 1 percent tn and nh4 n mass removal 23 and 14 table 3 and supplementary fig s2 presumably due to restricted nitrification rates under the low oxygen supply characteristic of these saturated horizontal flow systems and the low ambient winter temperatures kadlec and wallace 2009 during shock loading effluent nh4 n concentrations in both the first and second hg stages were slightly elevated immediately after the shock loading effluent nh4 n concentrations in the first hg stage stayed elevated but were reduced to pre shock loading levels in the second hg stage nox n which only occurred at low concentrations 1 2 g m 3 in the second hg stage pre shock loading effluent declined during shock loading and then slowly recovered to original levels in comparison to the hg systems the systems with vertical flow stages achieved substantially higher tn and nh4 n efficiencies and areal mass removal rates prior to shock loading in the range of 64 89 3 1 3 6 g m 2 1 for tn and 63 94 2 0 3 4 g m 2d 1 for nh4 n table 3 these were similar to removal rates reported previously for these systems operating under consistent inflow rates tanner et al 2012 shock loading of the systems with vertical flow stages resulted in greater relative reductions in tn treatment performance than recorded for hg fig 7 with days equivalent relative disturbance in performance ranging from 0 76 days vg c to 2 5 days r a vs c table 3 under shock loading the areal nh4 n mass removal rates in the single pass vertical flow systems increased 4 1 4 4 fold which was a similar proportional increase to that shown by the hg system areal nh4 n mass removal rates in the recirculating system r a vs c which received slightly higher mass loadings during shock loadings 5 4 times standard rose even more to 6 2 fold table 3 for the single pass vertical flow systems the wood chip carbonaceous bioreactors cw achieved 1 89 2 07 g m 2 d 1 areal nox n mass removal rate based on nox n reduction at mean mass nox n loadings of 2 45 2 95 g m 2 d 1 during the standard operation period table 3 during the shock loading period apparent denitrification rates in the cw bioreactors did not alter greatly reducing to 1 40 g m 2 d 1 after the vs module but increasing slightly after the vg module to 2 20 g m 2 d 1 mass nox n removal rates 1 g m 2 d 1 within the coconut husk modules ch which because of their position after the cw modules in the treatment train normally received lower mass loadings rose slightly but remained much less than those achieved in the wood chip cw bioreactors the wetland systems studied exhibited some relative disturbance in performance in tn removal during the shock loading period but rapidly recovered in most instances with each beginning to recover before shock loading had finished fig 7 percent tn removal in the vg c system declined from 89 to 85 equivalent to 0 76 days relative disturbance in performance table 3 and then recovered to 89 in the post shock loading period the similarly configured vs c system slightly reduced tn removal from 68 to 63 1 4 days relative disturbance in performance during the shock loading but had improved performance throughout the remaining experimental period with post shock loading tn removal of 78 the recirculating vertical flow system r a vs c system had 64 tn removal which fell to 55 during the shock loading 2 51 days relative disturbance in performance in terms of tn removal the hg system was the most resilient to the shock loading compared with pre shock loading performance with only minor relative disturbance in performance 0 29 days and rapid recovery time fig 7 the single pass vertical flow systems were next most affected followed by the recirculating vertical flow system the vg c system had the highest performance prior to the shock loading and also showed the highest average resilience during the shock loading table 4 the shock loading resulted in a reduction in nitrate concentrations in the outlet of the vg but there was no associated rise in nh4 n concentrations fig s2b org n increased only slightly in the outlet of the vg during the shock loading period indicating much of the increased load was being retained within this module nitrate concentrations in the outlet from the carbonaceous bioreactors were mildly elevated during the shock loading dropping to normal concentrations in the subsequent five days the woodchip filter cw showed only about a 6 increase in apparent denitrification rates the coconut husk filter ch had much lower apparent denitrification rates under standard loading which increased more than 4 fold under the shock loading table 3 but remained below the rate in the cw thus additional compensatory capacity was available in the system to buffer treatment performance during the shock loading maintaining overall tn removal performance similar to that under standard loading in contrast concentrations of nh4 n in the outlet of the vs stage of the recirculating system r a vs c system rose during shock loading with a concomitant drop in no3 n concentration indicating reduced nitrification efficiency at the very high hydraulic loads resulting from 4 1 recirculation 4 discussion 4 1 system resilience tss and bod5 response by increasing the flow rate five fold during the shock loading period all systems received the equivalent of 25 days flow over the 5 day shock loading period despite its lower areal loading and passive operation i e not dependant on periodic dosing or use of recirculation loops the horizontal gravel flow wetland hg system was the least resilient system for tss and bod5 removal removal in the hg system dropped to a minimum of 76 of the performance under standard loading for tss figs 4 and 90 for bod5 fig 6 resulting in 1 07 and 0 55 days equivalent relative disturbance in performance respectively over the five day shock loading and subsequent period until performance returned to pre shock loading levels table 4 in comparison the vertical flow systems only reduced performance equivalent to 0 11 0 32 days for tss and from 0 08 to 0 29 for bod5 the superior performance resilience of the vertical flow wetland systems for tss and bod5 is likely to reflect differences in the dominant removal mechanisms for particulate materials compared to the horizontal flow wetlands the vertical flow wetlands remove suspended solids via physical filtration or straining through a fine matrix brix and arias 2005 gross et al 2007 sklarz et al 2009 tondera et al 2018 whereas gravity sedimentation adsorption and mineralization within the coarse gravel media are likely to be the dominant removal mechanisms in the saturated horizontal flow hg system mulling et al 2013 sundaravadivel and vigneswaran 2001 tondera et al 2018 therefore the hg system appeared to be more influenced by the reduced hrt and associated higher interstitial horizontal flow velocities that would have occurred during the shock loading period mobilising accumulated solids in the media and elevating tss and bod5 concentrations in the final outflow 4 2 system resilience tn response the tn performance resilience for the different systems was quite different to that for tss and bod5 with the horizontal and vertical flow gravel media based hg and vg c systems showing greater resilience than the single pass and recirculating vertical flow sand media based systems vs c and r a vs c the primary tn removal mechanism in wetland systems is commonly assumed to be sequential nitrification and denitrification tanner et al 2002 2012 while a reduction in nitrate outlet concentrations of the vg module was observed this was not associated with an increase in nh4 n concentrations i e a reduction in nitrification this module is designed primarily for nitrification thus reduction in effluent concentrations for both nh4 n and no3 n suggests processes other than nitrification were operating during the shock loading period this could be either increased adsorption within the bed or development of conditions suitable for partial denitrification associated with elevated organic loadings and reduced rest periods sikora et al 1995 wojciechowska et al 2017 as denitrification in the wood chip and coconut husk filters is likely to be a zero order reaction schipper et al 2010 some reduction in tn removal was expected under shock loadings as was observed table 3 the large relative treatment volume of the hg system provides greater capacity for such nh4 n sorption and also org n retention with slow n spiralling through the system enabling subsequent processing kadlec et al 2005 tanner et al 2002 repeated shock loadings could overwhelm this buffering capacity resulting in reduced long term performance as retained n and organic matter was subsequently processed or clogging compromises flow through the bed knowles et al 2011 in contrast to nh4 n no3 n is mobile and minimally adsorbed the intermittent dosing of wastewater to the surface of the vertical flow wetland modules substantially increases the supply of oxygen to the bed ye et al 2012 enabling nitrification to occur as the effluent gradually drains through the unsaturated sand or gravel matrix denitrification occurred either where it was recycled to the anoxic bioreactor or in the subsequent carbonaceous bioreactors cw and ch in comparison the sequential nitrogen removal processes are not separated into different optimized modules in the hg system resulting in relatively poor overall nitrogen removal nitrification in the hg system is likely to be oxygen limited because it is reliant on passive aeration processes such as root zone oxygen release and atmospheric diffusion into the wastewater surface between the gravel matrix nivala et al 2013 moreover denitrification occurred in the same module using the limited supply of organic carbon remaining in the influent wastewater and supplied from root exudation zhai et al 2013 and decomposing biomass from the resident wetland plants gersberg et al 1983 within such systems aerobic and anoxic zones form a matrix enabling nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria to sequentially remove nitrogen but at restricted rates the higher net nh4 n removal achieved in the single pass intermittently dosed vertical flow wetland systems can be directly attributed to improved oxygen supply promoting more effective nitrification brix and arias 2005 gross et al 2007 sklarz et al 2009 wastewater applied to the surface of the vertical flow wetlands normally drains through the media rapidly 5 10 min permitting aerobic conditions to re establish in interstitial pore spaces between applications increasing wastewater applications to every 12 min during shock loading still permitted sufficient time for effective drainage between doses enabling aerobic conditions to be re established prior to subsequent applications the recirculating vertical flow wetland system also showed a marked increase in nh4 n removal rates under shock loading with a greater maximum percentage and days equivalent relative disturbance in performance but similar duration compared to the single pass vertical flow or hg wetlands recirculation continuing at a rate of 4 1 resulted in a pumping interval of around 2 5 min under shock loading which in contrast to the single pass systems was inadequate for the system to drain completely between doses this resulted in a marked reduction in tn removal in the recirculating wetland during the initial shock loading period equating to 2 5 days equivalent relative disturbance in performance although tn removal performance improved as the shock loading continued it showed marked fluctuations and did not return fully to normal levels during the post shock loading monitoring period the performance of the denitrification modules cw and ch was more variable although apparent denitrification rates decreased in some modules and increased in others the magnitude of this change was much smaller than that shown in the nitrifying modules the zero order rate of organic carbon release schipper et al 2010 expected from the wood chip cw and coconut husk ch modules would have limited the potential for denitrification to match the increase in nitrification the decreases shown in some denitrification modules e g cw and ch of vs c system may have been due to a greater influx of aerobic wastewater having an inhibitory effect as denitrifers will generally use oxygen rather than nitrate as an electron acceptor if it is available henze et al 1995 4 3 system resilience performance reduction and recovery time comparison of the resilience of the different wetland systems as measured by relative disturbance in performance and recovery time is summarised in table 4 of the four systems subjected to shock loading the hg system had the lowest resilience for tss and bod5 removal however it was the best for tn removal average loss of performance as an overall measure of system resilience was 0 64 days under standard loading while this may be a fair measure of the system resilience it highlights the importance of considering these resilience measures in relation to overall performance for instance while the hg system was more resilient to tn removal than the other vertical flow systems tested tn removal based on an aerial mass removal rate and percent mass removal was still well below that of the vertical flow systems that included an aerobic nitrification module followed by dedicated denitrification bioreactors to achieve equivalent tn removal performance under standard loading to the other vertical flow systems while retaining the benefit of resilient tn removal under shock loading the hg wetland system would need to be considerably enlarged or provided supplementary aeration for enhanced nitrification nivala et al 2013 the hg system showed considerable recovery even during the shock loading period figs 4 6 7 as did all of the treatment systems this was unexpected particularly for removal pathways dominated by microbial metabolisms such as sequential nitrification and denitrification the five day shock loading period during winter weather conditions was likely to be too brief to permit substantial microbial growth the recovery in the removal rate of tss and bod5 may have been associated with reduction in pore spaces within the wetland matrices resulting in increased straining and surface filtration tondera et al 2018 as the increased inflow of organic particles may have caused minor clogging knowles et al 2011 the causal mechanisms associated with this recovery will require further investigation the two single pass vertical flow systems with denitrification bioreactors showed high resilience for tss and bod5 removal under shock loading with recovery times of one day or less and a maximum relative disturbance in performance equivalent to 0 13 days removal table 4 the recirculating vertical flow system showed intermediate resilience for tss and bod5 removal with rapid recovery under the same shock loading with maximum relative disturbance in performance equivalent to 0 32 days removal while nh4 n removal in the vertical flow components increased up to 6 2 fold during the shock loading period mass nitrate removal in the denitrification modules showed either minimal increases or sometimes decreases in various modules reflecting their zero order removal kinetics thus overall their resilience to increased tn loads was lower e g the relative disturbance in performance in the vs c system was equivalent to 1 41 days while the r a vs c system loss was 2 50 days than the hg system which had a relative disturbance in performance equivalent to only 0 29 days removal table 4 4 4 overall system resilience comparison to compare overall resilience of the different constructed wetland systems the relative disturbance in performance of the three water quality measures tss bod5 and tn was averaged confirming that the recirculating system had a greater net relative disturbance in performance 1 04 days than the single pass vertical wetland systems vs c 0 55 days vg c 0 32 days however considering the magnitude and duration of the shock loading 5 fold over 5 days these levels of relative disturbance in performance are relatively small recovery time for tss bod5 and tn removal for each system was a maximum of 2 4 days after shock loading halted table 4 although the recirculating system showed some lingering performance instability and did not return completely to initial levels suggesting possible longer term impairment of performance scenario 3 fig 1 the constructed wetland systems tested showed considerable performance recovery even during the period of disturbance scenario 2 fig 1 making it difficult to define recovery time in situations where such recovery is evident it may be more relevant to consider recovery time from the initial point of disturbance other responses to disturbance could be temporary or permanent impairment of performance temporary impairment could result from accumulation of excess solids and organic matter causing a transient increase in clogging of the media with effects on the hydraulic efficiency and gaseous exchange particularly oxygen supply potentially causing die off of nitrifying microbial communities that are slow to recover additionally retained org n and adsorbed nh4 n could create a backlog of nitrogenous oxygen demand which are subsequently processed causing lingering effects on treatment performance impairment may become permanent where a systems operational limits are exceeded e g due to complete clogging of the wetland media thus a further metric such as failure magnitude juan garcía et al 2017 might be added to quantify this this study illustrated the application of a method of comparing and quantifying the resilience of different wetland and bioreactor treatment systems based on responses measured for a single shock loading event involving a step change in hydrological loading ideally such trials would have been done over a range of shock loading intensities and durations relevant to the situation and used replicate systems to enable full statistical comparisons furthermore in some cases transient increases in wastewater strength may be more relevant than increases in hydrological loads while in others some mix of hydrological and contaminant concentration changes e g higher hydraulic loads of dilute wastewater for combined sewerage systems would be more appropriate however regardless of the method of shock loading used the standard quantification method applied in this study allows fair comparison between different systems and potentially between different studies we believe the methodology builds on the quantification techniques previously developed by bruneau et al 2003 and others and could be applicable to a range of different treatment systems such as wastewater and drinking water treatment systems to compare their resilience or conversely vulnerability to shock loadings 5 conclusions four different configurations of constructed wetlands and bioreactors were subjected to a shock loading of 5 times normal flow for 5 days these included a horizontal flow gravel wetland system hg two vertical flow wetland filled with either gravel or sand followed by carbonaceous bioreactors vg c and vs c and a recirculating vertical flow wetland preceded by an anoxic tank and followed by carbonaceous bioreactors r a vs c an adapted resilience quantification method was used to assess relative reductions in performance for each system for each water quality variable allowing comparisons between each system on average the recirculating system had the most reduced performance equivalent to just over one day s removal 1 04 d followed by the hg 0 64 d and the vs c 0 56 d the vertical gravel plus sand vg c showed the greatest resilience only reducing average performance equivalent to 0 32 days removal each system gave a different response for three key water quality measures tss bod5 and nitrogen where decreases in nitrogen removal were apparent under shock loading performance recovered or nearly so within 2 4 days to pre shock loading treatment levels after shock loading ceased this study demonstrated that the denitrifying bioreactors were less able to accommodate increased influxes of nitrate n this suggests that to maintain nitrate removal performance under shock loading conditions the denitrifying bioreactors would need to be either oversized for standard loading or temporary addition of other available carbon sources would be required the method applied to quantify treatment resilience in relation to a standardised level and period of perturbation allows unbiased quantitative comparison between systems it

19588,the conventional biological processes for municipal wastewater are facing the challenges of high energy consumption and production of excessive sludge to address these two emerging issues this study demonstrated the feasibility to integrate mainstream anammox into an a 2b process for municipal wastewater treatment towards energy efficient operation with reduced sludge production in the proposed a 2b process an anaerobic fixed bed reactor afbr served as a stage for cod capture an anammox moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr was employed as b2 stage which received effluent containing nitrite from a sequencing batch reactor sbr at b1 stage the results showed that under the operation conditions studied 58 of influent cod was converted methane gas at a stage and 87 total inorganic nitrogen tin removal was achieved with the effluent tin concentration of 6 5 mg l moreover it was shown that at least 75 of sludge reduction was obtained due to the cod capture at a stage the high throughput sequencing analysis further revealed that candidatus kuenenia was the dominant genus responsible for the observed anammox at b2 stage mbbr this study clearly demonstrated a novel process configuration for sustaining mainstream anammox for municipal wastewater reclamation towards energy efficient operation with minimized sludge production graphical abstract image keywords a 2b process mainstream anammox energy efficient moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr nitritation denitritation 1 introduction the conventional activated sludge cas process for municipal wastewater treatment is an energy intensive endeavor that produces huge amount of excess sludge in wwtps adopting cas process nearly half of the in plant energy input was utilized for aeration to oxidize organic matters to biomass and carbon dioxide while about 25 65 of the total plant operation expenditure was used for the post treatment of excess activated sludge zhao and kugel 1996 apparently new configurations of wwtps are urgently needed for concurrently achieving energy efficient nitrogen removal enhanced energy recovery from wastewater reduced energy consumption and less excess sludge production anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anammox which is capable of anaerobically oxidize ammonium with nitrite as the electron acceptor strous et al 1998 has been considered as an alternative for energy efficient nitrogen removal although anammox process has been successfully applied for treating high concentration ammonia wastewater e g reject liquor from anaerobic sludge digestion van der star et al 2007 wett 2007 landfill leachate anfruns et al 2013 sun et al 2016 etc however mainstream anammox for low strength municipal wastewater still remains challenging in fact it is very difficult to sustain short cut nitrification which is essential for anammox in municipal wastewater with low ammonium n concentration of about 40 mg l and anammox bacteria were outcompeted by denitrifiers at high cod n ratio xu et al 2015 in addition the effective retention of anammox bacteria is crucial due to the extremely slow growth rate hendrickx et al 2012 strous et al 1998 although two stage partial nitritation and anammox process had been reported it appeared difficult to effectively control a proper ratio of ammonia to nitrite for anammox ma et al 2011 regmi et al 2015 2016 in order to tackle such a situation highly complex control strategies relying on online monitoring of ammonia nitrite and nitrate had been developed regmi et al 2015 therefore this study aimed to develop an integrated a 2b process where most of cod was captured in the form of biomethane at a stage while nitrogen was removed through nitritation and denitritation at b1 stage and anammox at b2 stage it was demonstrated that the proposed process had high operation stability and may lead to significant energy recovery reduced energy consumption and sludge production 2 materials and methods 2 1 process design and operation in this study a novel integrated a 2b process was developed for concurrently achieving mainstream deammonification and energy recovery from municipal wastewater in this system an anaerobic fixed bed reactor afbr was used as a stage for cod capture while a sequencing batch reactor sbr and a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr were employed to serve as b1 stage and b2 stage respectively fig 1 for nitrogen removal the operation temperature of the integrated system was maintained at 30 1 c while the hydraulic retention time hrt of the afbr was controlled at 6 4 h and the effluent was introduced into a flash chamber with a working volume of 0 15 l operated at a mixing speed of 800 rpm for the recovery of dissolved methane as shown in fig 1 a portion of influent was bypassed via bypass 1 and mixed with a stage effluent in the holding tank 1 and the mixed stream was then fed into b1 stage sbr for nitritation and denitritation the sbr was operated in 4 alternating sub cycles of anoxic 20 min and oxic 13min phases with step feed prior each anoxic phase followed by sludge discharge settling phase and effluent discharge phase dissolved oxygen do concentration was set to 1 5 mg l in oxic phases while the sludge retention time srt was controlled at 4 days subsequently mixed b1 stage effluent and anaerobic effluent via bypass 2 was fed to b2 stage mbbr for nitrogen removal through anammox the ratio of bypass 2 was manually adjusted to achieve equimolar of nh4 n and no2 n from day 1 73 phase 1 after which i e phase 2 this ratio was fixed at 22 the mbbr with a working volume of 4 l was packed with 1 cm3 cubic sponges at a packing ratio of 50 by volume nisshinbo chemical inc japan and was inoculated with enriched anammox bacteria mechanical mixing at 120 rpm was provided in the mbbr in the steady state operation the ph values in b1 and b2 stage reactor were relatively constant in the range of 7 4 and 7 9 synthetic wastewater used in this study mainly contained 400 mg cod l as sucrose 45 mg l nh4 n 750 mg l nahco3 22 mg l kh2po4 20 mg l mgso4 7h2o 20 mg l feso4 7h2o 45 mg l cacl2 2h2o and 1 5 mg l fecl3 7h2o 2 2 analytical methods cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n and volatile suspended solids vss were determined according to standard methods apha 2005 to measure the dry biomass in biofilms the biocarriers suspended in pbs buffer were subjected to sonication e100h elmasonic elma germany for 50 60 min the collected pellets were further used for determination of fixed vss the composition of biogas produced in afbr was analyzed by a gas chromatography equipped with thermal conductivity detector gc tcd tcd agilent technologies 7890a gc system usa while its volume was measured by a gas meter tg 05 model 5 ritter germany the activity of aob and nob in the b1 stage sbr were quantified by the specific oxygen uptake rate sour which was determined according to the method by surmacz gorska et al 1996 2 3 in situ reaction kinetics of anammox the in situ batch experiment was carried out in the anammox mbbr the water samples were taken at different time intervals over a period of 4 h the specific anammox reaction rate qamx was calculated as follows 1 q amx r nh 4 r no 2 r no 3 x vss where rnh4 and rno2 are respective ammonium and nitrite removal rates mg n l d rno3 is nitrate production rate mg n l d and xvss is fixed biomass concentration g l 2 4 mass balance on cod and nitrogen in the a 2b process described in fig 1 the overall mass balance on cod can be written as follows 2 total influent cod mcod inf g d cod in

is the concentration of nitrogen removed via denitritation in b1 stage sbr mg l and qb1 is the flow rate in b1 stage sbr l d as for mcod o2 it is negligible since nearly all the cod in b1 stage sbr was used for denitritation the mass balance on nitrogen can be established in a similar manner 2 5 fluorescence in situ hybridization biofilm harvested from the b2 stage mbbr was observed by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish method biocarriers were fixed with 4 w v paraformaldehyde in pbs solution at 4 c for 6 h and were then washed 3 times with pbs solution the washed biocarriers were embedded in tissue freezing medium jung tissue freezing medium leica microsystems nussloch gmbh germany and were further sectioned into 20 μm slices leica cm1950 leica biosystems nussloch gmbh germany which could be fixed onto slides pretreated according to the method by nielsen et al 2009 for the observation of anammox biofilms the probes for hybridization included eubmix equimolar of eub338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii daims et al 1999 for staining all bacteria and amx368 for staining all anammox bacteria schmid et al 2005 the fish samples were finally visualized with a zeiss lsm 880 confocal laser scanning microscope carl zeiss jena germany 2 6 dna extraction pcr amplification and 16s rrna gene sequencing the microbial community in the stable anammox mbbr was analyzed by high throughput sequencing technique briefly dna was extracted with a fast dna spin kit mp biomedicals llc while bacterial universal primers nobar 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and nobar 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc were used to amplify v3 v4 region of 16s rrna genes afterwards high throughput sequencing analysis was performed with illumina miseq platform sangon biotech shanghai china 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of a stage afbr the performances of the steady state afbr were summarized in table 1 it can be seen that the effluent cod concentration was stabilized at the level of about 29 mg l on average with the direct biogas production of about 0 27 l methane cod removed however for the low strength organic wastewater studied it was found that about 41 of the produced methane was eventually dissolved in the afbr effluent about 90 of which was thereafter recovered in the subsequent flash chamber it should be also realized that due to the direct cod capture the sludge yield in the afbr was as low as 0 06 g biomass g cod removed which was 85 smaller than that of activated sludge with a typical growth yield of 0 4 g biomass g cod removed in cas process wan et al 2016 similar to other anaerobic systems influent ammonium was almost not removed in the afbr which would be handled in the subsequent b stages 3 2 performance of b1 stage sbr in this study the b1 stage sbr was designed for producing nitrite for anammox process in b2 stage mbbr this is because the alternating anoxic and oxic conditions coupled with the control of srt had been shown to be effective in repression of nob against aob xu et al 2017 fig 2 a showed that most of the influent ammonium was converted into nitrite with a clear nitritation for example the nitrite concentration in the sbr effluent was gradually increased to around 15 mg n l due to the reduced cod concentration coming from the in a stage afbr since then the effluent nitrite concentration stabilized at about 15 mg n l while nitrate concentration remained low these clearly indicated the establishment of stable nitrite shunt i e nob was successfully repressed against aob further evidenced by the specific aob and nob activities presented in fig 2b as illustrated in fig 1 16 of influent wastewater was bypassed to the b1 stage sbr with the cod in the bypassed flow it was found that about 33 of the total inorganic nitrogen was removed through nitritation and denitritation 3 3 performance of b2 stage anammox mbbr fig 3 a and b showed the nh4 n and no2 n concentration profiles in the anammox mbbr throughout the whole operation period it can be seen that in phase 1 obvious removal of nh4 n and no2 n concentration were observed after 25 day operation when influent no2 n concentration started to build up after fixing the bypass 2 ratio at 22 in phase 2 the ratio between no2 n and nh4 n concentration was about 1 1 which was ideal for anammox process accordingly the averaged effluent no2 n concentration was reduced to below 1 mg n l while nh4 n concentration in the effluent was below 2 mg n l the small amount of no3 n was produced under anaerobic condition fig 3c together with nearly no cod consumed fig 3d these in turn suggested that nh4 n and no2 n were mainly removed via the anammox reaction in the mbbr the nitrogen loading rate reached 0 12 kg n m3 d with 74 nitrogen removal efficiency inside the anammox mbbr the results of in situ batch tests at around day 100 table 2 showed that the no2 nh4 and no3 nh4 ratios were 1 27 0 05 and 0 28 0 03 respectively which are comparable with those reported by strous et al 1998 i e 1 32 and 0 26 respectively and later reported at 1 2 and 0 21 respectively by lotti et al 2014 the maximum specific anammox reaction rate was measured at 0 14 0 01 g n2 n g vss d the routine measurements throughout the operation period revealed that from day 45 the ratios gradually stabilized and approached the theoretical value as previously reported fig 4 indicating fast star up of anammox process this might be attributed to the biocarriers unique sponge structure which was capable for effectively trap the anammox granules after the physical trapping effect the anammox biofilm would eventually grow on the surface of the biocarriers compared with one stage processes two stage partial nitritation anammox processes segregated the anammox process and the partial nitritation process which firstly could avoid the inhibition on anammox bacteria due to oxygen exposure li et al 2011 and achieve higher aob activity in partial nitritation reactor because higher do concentration could be applied regmi et al 2014 2015 in order to provide equimolar ratio of nh4 n and no2 n for subsequent anammox process the normal strategy was to biologically oxidize about half of the ammonium to nitrite ma et al 2011 wyffels et al 2004 which often rely on no3 no2 and nh4 sensors for aeration control regmi et al 2014 comparatively adoption of such an a 2b process configuration may lead to an easy control of equimolar ratio of nh4 n and no2 n for anammox 3 4 microbial community analysis fig 5 a presented the main functional bacteria at genus level with the relative abundance greater than 1 three genera affiliated with anammox i e candidatus kuenenia candidatus brocadia and candidatus anammoxoglobus were identified in the b2 stage biofilms among which candidatus kuenenia appeared to be dominant with the abundance of 14 19 the presence of anammox bacteria in the b2 stage biofilms were also affirmed by the fish images fig 5b nitrolancea with the abundance of 1 52 was found to be the dominant nob which could tolerate high concentration nitrite while nitrospira and nitrobacter which were often reported as ubiquitously dominant nob in wwtps whang et al 2009 were observed at the aboundance below 0 94 on the other hand nitrosomonas was only present at the aboundance of 0 14 and other ammonia oxidizing bacteria i e nitrosococcus and nitrosospira were almost not detectable these further confirmed a culture environment primarily dominated by anammox bacteria in the b2 stage mbbr 3 5 engineering implications for the comparison purpose the mass flows of cod and nitrogen were determined over the proposed a 2b process fig 6 as can be seen 58 of the influent cod was directly converted to methane in a stage afbr with only 11 channeled into wasted sludge it should be realized that about 30 50 of the influent cod ended up in excess sludge in the conventional activated sludge process in fact the total sludge production yield in the a 2b process was only about 0 1 g vss g cod removed which was 75 less than that in the conventional activated sludge process with a typical value of 0 4 g vss g cod removed in fact huge amount of excess sludge is currently produced in wwtps adopting conventional activated sludge process i e in 2010 8 million tons of dry sludge produced in the united states and about 11 million tons in china to tackle such a challenging situation anaerobic digestion of waste sludge has been widely applied for both volume reduction and biogas generation however the overall energy efficiency of anaerobic digestion was found to be very low e g only about 30 50 of vss could be degraded and digested solid residue still needs further disposal ideally soluble cod in wastewater should be captured for direct energy production as in the proposed a 2b process on the other hand 87 of total nitrogen removal was achieved in the a 2b process of which 33 and 34 were removed through nitritation denitritation and anammox respectively as such the energy associated with nitrogen removal could be reduced by about 47 it had been reported that the overall energy efficiency of the current municipal wastewater treatment plants was only about of 20 50 zhou et al 2013 indeed the design of the present wastewater treatment plants has a serious drawback of that soluble cod in wastewater is converted to biomass at high energy cost from which energy is subsequently recovered through anaerobic digestion but at low energy efficiency as demonstrated in this study cod in influent wastewater should be anaerobically captured for direct methane production with minimized waste sludge production in this sense the proposed a 2b process provides a feasible engineering solution towards energy neutral or even energy positive operation of wastewater treatment i e significantly improved energy recovery at a stage together with markedly reduced energy consumption at b stage 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the engineering feasibility of a novel a 2b process with integrated direct cod capture and mainstream anammox in this process about 58 of influent cod was directly converted to biomethane in the a stage anaerobic fixed film reactor while stable and sustainable anammox was achieved with 74 of nitrogen removal the detailed mass balance clearly revealed that 33 of inorganic nitrogen was removed in the b1 stage sbr via nitritation denitritation together with 34 removal in the b2 stage mbbr via anammox candidatus kuenenia known as anammox bacteria accounted 14 19 of total microbial population in the b2 stage mbbr compared to the conventional activated sludge process the excess sludge production was reduced by 75 while aeration associated energy consumption for cod oxidation could be completely waived in addition to 47 cut in energy demand for nitrogen removal in the proposed a 2b process the a 2b process developed in this study opens a new window towards the sustainable energy self sufficient wastewater reclamation which is obviously of significance especially in the scenario where global climate change is of a serious concern

calculated as follows 1 q amx r nh 4 r no 2 r no 3 x vss where rnh4 and rno2 are respective ammonium and nitrite removal rates mg n l d rno3 is nitrate production rate mg n l d and xvss is fixed biomass concentration g l 2 4 mass balance on cod and nitrogen in the a 2b process described in fig 1 the overall mass balance on cod can be written as follows 2 total influent cod mcod inf g d cod in the effluent mcod eff g d cod converted to biomass m cod sludge g d cod converted to methane m cod ch 4 g d carbonaneous cod oxidized mcod o2 g d cod utilized for denitritation m cod dn g d the cod converted to biomass could be estimated by eq 3 3 m cod sludge q sludge x sludge f where q sludge is the flow rate of wasted sludge liquor l d x sludge is the concentration of produced biomass mg vss

is the concentration of nitrogen removed via denitritation in b1 stage sbr mg l and qb1 is the flow rate in b1 stage sbr l d as for mcod o2 it is negligible since nearly all the cod in b1 stage sbr was used for denitritation the mass balance on nitrogen can be established in a similar manner 2 5 fluorescence in situ hybridization biofilm harvested from the b2 stage mbbr was observed by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish method biocarriers were fixed with 4 w v paraformaldehyde in pbs solution at 4 c for 6 h and were then washed 3 times with pbs solution the washed biocarriers were embedded in tissue freezing medium jung tissue freezing medium leica microsystems nussloch gmbh germany and were further sectioned into 20 μm slices leica cm1950 leica biosystems nussloch gmbh germany which could be fixed onto slides pretreated according to the method by nielsen et al 2009 for the observation of anammox biofilms the probes for hybridization included eubmix equimolar of eub338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii daims et al 1999 for staining all bacteria and amx368 for staining all anammox bacteria schmid et al 2005 the fish samples were finally visualized with a zeiss lsm 880 confocal laser scanning microscope carl zeiss jena germany 2 6 dna extraction pcr amplification and 16s rrna gene sequencing the microbial community in the stable anammox mbbr was analyzed by high throughput sequencing technique briefly dna was extracted with a fast dna spin kit mp biomedicals llc while bacterial universal primers nobar 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and nobar 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc were used to amplify v3 v4 region of 16s rrna genes afterwards high throughput sequencing analysis was performed with illumina miseq platform sangon biotech shanghai china 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of a stage afbr the performances of the steady state afbr were summarized in table 1 it can be seen that the effluent cod concentration was stabilized at the level of about 29 mg l on average with the direct biogas production of about 0 27 l methane cod removed however for the low strength organic wastewater studied it was found that about 41 of the produced methane was eventually dissolved in the afbr effluent about 90 of which was thereafter recovered in the subsequent flash chamber it should be also realized that due to the direct cod capture the sludge yield in the afbr was as low as 0 06 g biomass g cod removed which was 85 smaller than that of activated sludge with a typical growth yield of 0 4 g biomass g cod removed in cas process wan et al 2016 similar to other anaerobic systems influent ammonium was almost not removed in the afbr which would be handled in the subsequent b stages 3 2 performance of b1 stage sbr in this study the b1 stage sbr was designed for producing nitrite for anammox process in b2 stage mbbr this is because the alternating anoxic and oxic conditions coupled with the control of srt had been shown to be effective in repression of nob against aob xu et al 2017 fig 2 a showed that most of the influent ammonium was converted into nitrite with a clear nitritation for example the nitrite concentration in the sbr effluent was gradually increased to around 15 mg n l due to the reduced cod concentration coming from the in a stage afbr since then the effluent nitrite concentration stabilized at about 15 mg n l while nitrate concentration remained low these clearly indicated the establishment of stable nitrite shunt i e nob was successfully repressed against aob further evidenced by the specific aob and nob activities presented in fig 2b as illustrated in fig 1 16 of influent wastewater was bypassed to the b1 stage sbr with the cod in the bypassed flow it was found that about 33 of the total inorganic nitrogen was removed through nitritation and denitritation 3 3 performance of b2 stage anammox mbbr fig 3 a and b showed the nh4 n and no2 n concentration profiles in the anammox mbbr throughout the whole operation period it can be seen that in phase 1 obvious removal of nh4 n and no2 n concentration were observed after 25 day operation when influent no2 n concentration started to build up after fixing the bypass 2 ratio at 22 in phase 2 the ratio between no2 n and nh4 n concentration was about 1 1 which was ideal for anammox process accordingly the averaged effluent no2 n concentration was reduced to below 1 mg n l while nh4 n concentration in the effluent was below 2 mg n l the small amount of no3 n was produced under anaerobic condition fig 3c together with nearly no cod consumed fig 3d these in turn suggested that nh4 n and no2 n were mainly removed via the anammox reaction in the mbbr the nitrogen loading rate reached 0 12 kg n m3 d with 74 nitrogen removal efficiency inside the anammox mbbr the results of in situ batch tests at around day 100 table 2 showed that the no2 nh4 and no3 nh4 ratios were 1 27 0 05 and 0 28 0 03 respectively which are comparable with those reported by strous et al 1998 i e 1 32 and 0 26 respectively and later reported at 1 2 and 0 21 respectively by lotti et al 2014 the maximum specific anammox reaction rate was measured at 0 14 0 01 g n2 n g vss d the routine measurements throughout the operation period revealed that from day 45 the ratios gradually stabilized and approached the theoretical value as previously reported fig 4 indicating fast star up of anammox process this might be attributed to the biocarriers unique sponge structure which was capable for effectively trap the anammox granules after the physical trapping effect the anammox biofilm would eventually grow on the surface of the biocarriers compared with one stage processes two stage partial nitritation anammox processes segregated the anammox process and the partial nitritation process which firstly could avoid the inhibition on anammox bacteria due to oxygen exposure li et al 2011 and achieve higher aob activity in partial nitritation reactor because higher do concentration could be applied regmi et al 2014 2015 in order to provide equimolar ratio of nh4 n and no2 n for subsequent anammox process the normal strategy was to biologically oxidize about half of the ammonium to nitrite ma et al 2011 wyffels et al 2004 which often rely on no3 no2 and nh4 sensors for aeration control regmi et al 2014 comparatively adoption of such an a 2b process configuration may lead to an easy control of equimolar ratio of nh4 n and no2 n for anammox 3 4 microbial community analysis fig 5 a presented the main functional bacteria at genus level with the relative abundance greater than 1 three genera affiliated with anammox i e candidatus kuenenia candidatus brocadia and candidatus anammoxoglobus were identified in the b2 stage biofilms among which candidatus kuenenia appeared to be dominant with the abundance of 14 19 the presence of anammox bacteria in the b2 stage biofilms were also affirmed by the fish images fig 5b nitrolancea with the abundance of 1 52 was found to be the dominant nob which could tolerate high concentration nitrite while nitrospira and nitrobacter which were often reported as ubiquitously dominant nob in wwtps whang et al 2009 were observed at the aboundance below 0 94 on the other hand nitrosomonas was only present at the aboundance of 0 14 and other ammonia oxidizing bacteria i e nitrosococcus and nitrosospira were almost not detectable these further confirmed a culture environment primarily dominated by anammox bacteria in the b2 stage mbbr 3 5 engineering implications for the comparison purpose the mass flows of cod and nitrogen were determined over the proposed a 2b process fig 6 as can be seen 58 of the influent cod was directly converted to methane in a stage afbr with only 11 channeled into wasted sludge it should be realized that about 30 50 of the influent cod ended up in excess sludge in the conventional activated sludge process in fact the total sludge production yield in the a 2b process was only about 0 1 g vss g cod removed which was 75 less than that in the conventional activated sludge process with a typical value of 0 4 g vss g cod removed in fact huge amount of excess sludge is currently produced in wwtps adopting conventional activated sludge process i e in 2010 8 million tons of dry sludge produced in the united states and about 11 million tons in china to tackle such a challenging situation anaerobic digestion of waste sludge has been widely applied for both volume reduction and biogas generation however the overall energy efficiency of anaerobic digestion was found to be very low e g only about 30 50 of vss could be degraded and digested solid residue still needs further disposal ideally soluble cod in wastewater should be captured for direct energy production as in the proposed a 2b process on the other hand 87 of total nitrogen removal was achieved in the a 2b process of which 33 and 34 were removed through nitritation denitritation and anammox respectively as such the energy associated with nitrogen removal could be reduced by about 47 it had been reported that the overall energy efficiency of the current municipal wastewater treatment plants was only about of 20 50 zhou et al 2013 indeed the design of the present wastewater treatment plants has a serious drawback of that soluble cod in wastewater is converted to biomass at high energy cost from which energy is subsequently recovered through anaerobic digestion but at low energy efficiency as demonstrated in this study cod in influent wastewater should be anaerobically captured for direct methane production with minimized waste sludge production in this sense the proposed a 2b process provides a feasible engineering solution towards energy neutral or even energy positive operation of wastewater treatment i e significantly improved energy recovery at a stage together with markedly reduced energy consumption at b stage 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the engineering feasibility of a novel a 2b process with integrated direct cod capture and mainstream anammox in this process about 58 of influent cod was directly converted to biomethane in the a stage anaerobic fixed film reactor while stable and sustainable anammox was achieved with 74 of nitrogen removal the detailed mass balance clearly revealed that 33 of inorganic nitrogen was removed in the b1 stage sbr via nitritation denitritation together with 34 removal in the b2 stage mbbr via anammox candidatus kuenenia known as anammox bacteria accounted 14 19 of total microbial population in the b2 stage mbbr compared to the conventional activated sludge process the excess sludge production was reduced by 75 while aeration associated energy consumption for cod oxidation could be completely waived in addition to 47 cut in energy demand for nitrogen removal in the proposed a 2b process the a 2b process developed in this study opens a new window towards the sustainable energy self sufficient wastewater reclamation which is obviously of significance especially in the scenario where global climate change is of a serious concern

19589,the presence of antibiotics in aquatic environments has attracted global concern fenton process is an attractive yet challenging method for antibiotics degradation especially when such a reaction can be conducted at neutral ph values in this study a novel composite fe co catalyst was synthesized via the modification of steel converter slag scs by salicylic acid methanol sam and cobalt nitrate co no3 2 the catalysts were characterized by n2 brunauer emmett teller bet x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared ft ir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the results indicated that the co sam scs h2o2 fenton like system was very effective for sulfamethazine smz degradation at a wide ph range at initial ph of 7 0 the degradation rate of smz in co sam scs h2o2 system was 2 48 3 20 6 18 and 16 21 times of that in fe sam scs h2o2 sam scs h2o2 co no3 2 h2o2 and scs h2o2 system respectively the preliminary analysis suggested that high surface area of co sam scs sample and synergistic effect between introduced co and sam scs are responsible for the efficient catalytic activity during the degradation three main intermediates were identified by high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms analysis based on this a possible degradation pathway was proposed the sem images xrd patterns and xps spectra before and after the reactions demonstrate that the crystal and chemical structure of co sam scs after five cycles are almost unchanged besides the co sam scs presented low iron and cobalt leaching 0 17 mg l and 2 36 mg l respectively the studied fenton like process also showed high degradation of smz in river water and municipal wastewater the progress will bring valuable insights to develop high performance heterogeneous fenton like catalysts for environmental remediation graphical abstract image 1 keywords fenton like sulfamethazine steel converter slag cobalt degradation 1 introduction antibiotics have been excessively abused in veterinary and human medicine as emerging contaminants they have drawn increasing attention in recent years owing to their potential adverse effects on human health and aquatic ecology cheng et al 2016c zeng et al 2013a due to their antibacterial and polarity nature conventional waste water treatment plants wwtps can only partially remove antibiotics demonstrating the potential for these compounds to be consistently presented in effluents lai et al 2016 li et al 2017 yang et al 2010 as a result antibiotics have been repeatedly detected in surface water and sediment cheng et al 2018b guo et al 2017 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 thus an effective elimination of these compounds from the environment is important and necessary advanced oxidation processes aops are promising techniques for the disposal of toxic and persistent organic pollutants in wastewaters cheng et al 2017b huang et al 2017a yang et al 2016 2017 among these techniques fenton process based on the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ho has received particular attention cheng et al 2016b the fenton process holds many advantages including high degradation efficiency mild reaction conditions and simple operation cheng et al 2016a however fenton process also suffers from some drawbacks such as 1 it requires strict ph regulation ph 2 4 liu et al 2016 2 it requires the post treatment of the dissolved iron ions and sludge guo et al 2014 and 3 it may cause secondary pollution of acids burbano et al 2005 which make this technique complex and uneconomical in order to overcome these drawbacks fenton like processes using heterogeneous catalysts containing iron materials have been developed navalon et al 2010 in recent years hematite α fe2o3 maghemite γ fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 pyrite fes2 and goethite α feooh have been applied as heterogeneous fenton like catalysts for the degradation of many organic contaminants over a wider ph range steel converter slag scs a final waste material of the steel making process has high potential to be used in the fenton like process as heterogeneous catalyst owing to its abundance of iron oxides feo and fe2o3 yi et al 2012 on the other hand scs also contains calcium minerals which can negatively impact the performance of fenton like process it was reported that after adding scs into the system solution ph could be rapidly increased from 6 4 to 10 due to the dissolution of calcium minerals cheng et al 2017a 2018a under this condition the fenton fenton like reaction would be inefficient in our previous study salicylic acid methanol sam solution was used to dissolve calcium silicate minerals in scs and successfully improved the catalytic property of scs cheng et al 2017a however like other iron based heterogeneous fenton like processes the degradation was preferentially operated at acidic solutions ph 3 fan et al 2009 ozcan et al 2017 shen et al 2017 tang et al 2008 such a requirement of acidic environment however limited the industrial application of the technology because the pollutant solutions always have neutral or slightly basic ph values fan et al 2008 shen et al 2017 zeng et al 2013b previous studies have shown cobalt based fenton fenton like process can be operated in neutral ph condition bokare and choi 2014 on the one hand the homogeneous co2 h2o2 system was found able to completely decompose the dye pollutant without the control of ph ling et al 2010 on the other hand the degradation of organic pollutants by heterogeneous co catalysts was also studied in the presence of h2o2 in one study co2 loaded periodic mesoporous aluminum phosphate was utilized as heterogeneous catalyst for the degradation of phenol mahamallik and pal 2016 in a more recent work co2 adsorbed alumina was applied as heterogeneous catalyst to decompose methylene blue and methyl orange mahamallik and pal 2017 in both cases co based heterogeneous catalysts can effectively degrade the pollutants at neutral or even basic ph inspired by the above idea in this study we used co2 to further improve the catalytic property of scs in order to deal with the real wastewater which always has neutral or slightly basic ph values the sulfamethazine smz one of the most commonly used antibiotics was selected as model antibiotics contaminant because of its adverse effects on living being and frequently occurrence in natural water environment sopaj et al 2016 in recent years chemical oxidation methods especially the aops have been used for degradation of smz including fenton reaction based processes wan et al 2016 wan and wang 2017 wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2013 2014 photo catalysis babić et al 2015 yap et al 2012 gamma irradiation liu et al 2014 liu and wang 2013 ozonation bai et al 2016 garoma et al 2010 and dielectric barrier discharge plasma kim et al 2013 according to the literature fenton reaction based processes have been most widely used for the degradation of smz mainly due to their low cost and high efficiency the other methods may either suffer from high energy consumption or low efficiency many works have demonstrated the degradation of smz by fenton reaction based processes however most of them were conducted at acidic condition wan and wang 2017 wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2013 2014 besides few studies have considered the degradation pathways of smz in the system the main objectives of this work were to 1 produce a new heterogeneous fenton like catalyst and elucidate its morphology evolution process 2 study the degradation performance of smz at neutral ph values in this fenton like system and investigate affecting experimental parameters 3 clarify the fenton like reaction mechanism and reveal the promotional role of co2 in the fenton like process and 4 examine the degradation intermediates of smz and propose the possible degradation

in water were obtained from beijing sinopharm chemical reagent corp china ultrapure water 18 3 μω cm 1 was used in all the batch experiments 2 2 preparation of sam modified scs the preparation of sam modified scs sam scs was reported in a previously work cheng et al 2017a briefly 50 g of the dried scs powder was added in 100 ml sam solution 50 g l and stirred at 200 rpm for 4 h at 25 c the mixture was then filtered with the suction filter machine using a 0 45 μm filter membrane the filtration residue was washed repeatedly with ultrapure water and then dried at 105 c for 24 h 2 3 preparation of co sam scs co2 was introduced to the surface of sam scs by a simple adsorption process at first 1 g of prepared sam scs was dispersed in a glass beaker containing 50 ml of ultrapure water the beaker was placed in a constant temperature 25 c ultrasonic bath to obtain homogeneous sam scs dispersion after 30 min 2 ml of co no3 2 solution 0 2 m was equally and slowly added to the beaker and maintained for another 0 5 h ultrasonic treatment the beaker was then transferred to a magnetic stirrer and constantly stirred for 4 h at 25 c after that the suspension was filtered and filtration residue co2 loaded sam scs co sam scs was washed with ultrapure water for several times and dried in an oven at 80 c for 24 h as a comparison fe2 loaded sam scs fe sam scs catalyst was also prepared according to the above method where fe2 was used to replace co2 2 4 characterization characterization of the catalysts scs sam scs co sam scs was performed by using brunauer emmett teller bet scanning

2 5 adsorption experiments the adsorption characteristics of the prepared catalysts were evaluated by adsorption experiments using smz solution the initial smz concentration used in this study was 5 mg l all batch experiments were performed in 250 ml flasks containing 100 ml of smz solution and 50 mg of scs sam scs fe sam scs or co sam scs which were stirred in a water bath shaker at 160 rpm and 25 0 5 c for certain time intervals 0 5 ml of solution was sampled out for measurement of the concentration of smz the adsorbed amount of smz was calculated as follow 1 qt c0 ct v m where qt is the

solution at 25 c and stirred at 160 rpm smz concentration in all experiment groups was 50 mg l the initial ph of smz solution was set as 7 0 unless other mentioned typically in the comparative degradation experiment 50 mg of scs sam scs fe sam scs or co sam scs was added in 100 ml smz solution and then a certain amount of h2o2 solution 30 wt was added to trigger the fenton like reactions for certain time intervals 0 5 ml of reaction solution was sampled out for measurement of the concentration of smz in the preliminary experiment on the real wastewater treatment tap water derived from changsha running water company river water xiangjiang river changsha china and municipal wastewater obtained from changsha 1st sewage treatment plant changsha china were used as the solution for the preparation of 50 mg l smz wastewater in these experiments the catalyst loading is 0 7 g l h2o2 dosage is 4 and the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 9 0 the experiments were performed in 250 ml glass conical flasks containing 100 ml of reaction solution at 25 c and stirred at 160 rpm all the experiments including the adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate 2 7 analytical methods the concentration of smz was measured according to a published method teixido et al 2013 by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1100 series usa with an agilent tc c18 column 4

spectrophotometer hach usa cobalt concentration in the solution after the reaction was measured by flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy aas peaa700 perkin elmer usa the filtrate of the reaction solution was used in above mentioned measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization of the prepared catalysts the prepared catalysts scs sam scs co sam scs and used co sam scs were characterized via different methods firstly the surface properties of the catalysts were investigated by bet analysis we found that specific surface areas of scs increased from 67 14 to 179 62 m2 g table s2 after sam modification suggesting that sam modification significantly changed the morphology of scs the remarkable increase in specific surface area is because calcium silicate minerals in the surface of scs were selectively removed by sam treatment resulting in forming irregular surfaces cheng et al 2017a compared to sam scs co sam scs showed an even larger specific surface area this could be ascribed to the fact that co formed new structure on the surface of sam scs only a slight decrease was observed in the surface areas of used co sam scs indicated that no significant change occurred in the morphology of sam scs during the fenton like experiments on the other hand the hysteresis of modified scs sam scs co sam scs and used co sam scs was observed fig s1 indicating that the modified scs presented the larger number of mesoporous compared to scs sem was applied to further study the morphologies changes of scs as seen from fig 1 a the surface of scs was relatively flat and smooth after sam modification there was an obvious change in the surface morphology of scs as displayed in fig 1b sam scs presented irregular shapes and sizes fig 1c revealed that after co2 deposition sam scs surface was covered by a rather uniform co layer sem image of used co sam scs is very similar to that of co sam scs fig 1c further demonstrating that no significant change occurred in the morphology of co sam scs during the fenton like degradation experiments additional elemental mappings combined with eds analysis for the prepared catalysts were also performed eds analysis showed that the unmodified scs mainly consists of o ca fe si mg mn and al fig s2a after sam modification these elements are still detected fig s2b but a distinct variation in the signals of them was observed as illustrated in table s3 the content of ca was remarkably decreased while fe content was increased after sam modification in particular the mass ratio of ca to fe was decreased from 2 27 to 1 29 after sam modification the results from element mapping coincided well with the edx analysis for example we can clearly see from fig 2 that the signal intensity of ca gradually reduced after the modifications the co element distributed throughout the film of co sam scs fig 2o and used co sam scs fig 2t suggesting that co had been evenly dispersed on the surface of sam scs and maintained good stability xrd diffraction patterns of scs sam scs co sam scs and used co sam scs were obtained to evaluate the modification of scs with sam and co2 fig 3 as can be seen in fig 3a the intensities of dicalcium silicate peaks 2θ 32 02 and 32 92 jcpds 77 0409 prominently decreased after sam modification on the contrary the intensities of iron oxide peaks 2θ 36 21 42 07 and 61 16 jcpds 74 1880 of sam scs were enhanced as compared to those of unmodified scs xrd analysis indicated that the sam modification removed a portion of calcium silicate minerals from scs as for sam scs and co sam scs the similar xrd patterns were found fig 3 that is to say the introduction of co in the catalyst had no noticeable influence on its crystalline structure the peaks for coo 2θ 36 37 42 26 and 61 38 jcpds 48 1719 were found in co sam scs suggesting that co was successfully introduced onto the surface of sam scs no obvious decline in co peaks after 5 cycles of degradation test revealed that a negligible amount of co on the surface of sam scs was lost during the fenton like processes the decrease in the peak at 2θ values of 29 36 belongs to caco3 jcpds 05 0586 in co sam scs and used co sam scs may attribute to that part of caco3 in sam scs was removed under acidic condition during the preparation of co sam scs the structure of the catalysts was also studied by ft ir spectra as displayed in fig 3b the ft ir spectra of scs and sam modified scs are similar the broad bands in the range of 1400 1500 cm 1 and 800 1000 cm 1 are primarily associated to the stretching vibrations of ca o gadsden 1975 and si o criado et al 2007 respectively the bands of ca o and si o decreased obviously after sam modification which was in agreement with xrd analysis for co sam scs no discernible discrepancy was observed which is likely due to the small amount of co in the catalyst and it also inferred that the introduction of co has no impacts on the initial chemical structure of sam scs fig 4 a displays the comparison of the survey spectra of scs and sam modified scs the elements of si 102 3 ev ca 347 5 ev 351 2 ev fe 711 7ev 724 9 ev o 531 1 ev and mg 1303 7 ev can be clearly observed on the spectra of all the four samples while the elements of co can only be observed on the spectra of co sam scs and used co sam scs fig 4b and c presents the high resolution xps spectra of ca and fe respectively it can be clearly seen from fig 4b that ca 2p peaks with the binding energy of 347 5 ev and 351 2 ev in sam scs are much weaker than that in scs and these peaks in the spectra of co sam scs and used co sam scs further decreased as compared to those in sam scs fig 4c shows the fe 2p spectrum with two individual peaks located at 724 6 ev for fe 2p1 2 and the other one with the binding energy of 711 7 ev is assigned to fe 2p3 2 it was found that fe 2p peaks in the spectra of modified scs sam scs co sam scs and used co sam scs were enhanced as compared with those in the spectra of scs we found there was no discernible change in the xps spectra of co for co sam scs and used co sam scs fig 4d two major peaks with binding energies at 797 6 ev and 781 6 ev are attributed to co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 of co and the satellite peaks were found at 786 4 ev and 803 7 ev li et al 2016 overall the xps results coincided well with the sem eds and xrd analysis 3 2 adsorption of smz by the catalysts the adsorption of organic pollutants onto the surface of catalysts are important for the catalytic degradation since the heterogeneous fenton like degradation mainly occurs at the solid liquid interface xie et al 2014 thus in the first step the adsorption of smz by scs sam scs and co sam scs was studied by using 5 mg l of smz solution as revealed in fig 5 the adsorption of smz increased quickly in 30 min and achieved adsorption equilibrium within 2 h in all three studied systems fig 5 demonstrates that the adsorption performance of co sam scs is similar to that of sam scs whereas scs shows much lower adsorption capability the remarkable adsorption rate can be ascribed to the changes of surface structure and chemical composition of scs as shown in table s2 and fig 1 the surface area total porosity and total pore volume of scs increased largely after sam modification further study showed that the sorption kinetics of smz on scs sam scs and co sam scs can be well fitted by pseudo second order kinetic model r 2 0 9995 0 9994 and 0 9997 respectively suggesting chemisorption is the rate limiting step for sorption brusseau et al 1991 gong et al 2009 xu et al 2012 3 3 comparative degradation behavior of smz in different fenton like systems degradation behaviors of smz were investigated by homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton like processes to evaluate the catalytic activity of co sam scs fig 6 the degradation experiments were conducted at ph 7 0 with 50 mg l of smz solution fig 6a illustrated that the degradation rates of smz were very different to each other in these systems it was found that 4 79 of smz was removed in the scs h2o2 system within the first 1 h and then the concentration of smz did not significantly change during the subsequent 3 h fig 6a the sam modification enhanced the catalytic ability of scs approximately 20 degradation efficiency enhancement which mainly due to the reduction of calcium mineral and the formation of higher surface area what s more the removal rate of smz could reach to 77 62 when co2 was introduced to sam scs for comparison co no3 2 and fe sam scs were also taken into consideration as shown in fig 6a the efficiency of heterogeneous co2 h2o2 fenton like process was relatively low only 12 56 of smz was degraded in 240 min this is because high h2o2 concentration h2o2 co2 6 is required to achieve efficient oxidation in heterogeneous co2 h2o2 system bokare and choi 2014 ling et al 2010 compared with sam scs fe sam scs exhibited higher catalytic activity and smz concentration was reduced by 31 63 however this value is not comparable with that of co sam scs which could be ascribed to the fact that fe based fenton fenton like reactions are more efficient at acidic condition over all the corresponding degradation rates of all the catalysts were in the following order co sam scs fe sam scs sam scs co no3 2 scs besides these results are in good accordance with the results of toc analysis fig 6b demonstrating that co sam scs has high potential in practical applications 3 4 effects of catalyst loading h2o2 dosage and ph on smz degradation the effects of catalyst concentration on the degradation rates of smz were evaluated by performing experiments with the presence of increasing amounts of co sam scs as seen in fig 7 a smz removal in 240 min increased from 29 31 to 82 57 along with the increase of catalyst dosage from 0 1 to 0 7 g l this is probably due to that the number of active sites increased as the increased co sam scs loadings which accelerated the decomposition of h2o2 and the generation of ho on the other hand the decline in smz removal was observed when increasing co sam scs loading up to 1 0 g l the probable reason was that the excessive co sam scs decreased the density of surface adsorbed h2o2 and reduced the concentration of ho on the solid liquid inter surface wang et al 2016 besides there also research suggested that iron surfaces would then cause the undesirable consumption of radicals e g ho and hoo through the following equations cheng et al 2014 hu et al 2011b huang et al 2012 4 fe ii ho fe iii oh 5 fe iii ho2 fe ii ho2 the effect of h2o2 dosage 0 6 on the degradation of smz was then examined the experimental results fig 7b showed the removal of smz was quite limited less than 5 in the absence of h2o2 in fact this part of smz was removed by the adsorption of co sam scs the introduction of h2o2 into the smz solution significantly accelerated the removal of smz the degradation rate of smz increased along with the increase of h2o2 dosage from 1 to 4 indicating that the concentration of h2o2 was directly related to the degradation of smz that makes sense because h2o2 is directly involved in the generation of the reactive radicals however the degradation rate of smz decreased when the h2o2 dosage further increased to 6 which is possibly due to the scavenging of ho by excessive h2o2 through equations 6 and 7 hu et al 2011a huang et al 2008 xia et al 2011 6 h2o2 ho ho2 h2o 7 ho2 ho o2 h2o it has been well established that ph of the solution plays a critical role in the efficiency of the fenton fenton like oxidation in the tested ph range 5 9 at least 60 of smz can be degraded after 240 min suggesting that co sam scs could be used for degradation of organic contaminants over a wide range of ph values as illustrated in fig 7c the degradation efficiency increased gradually as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 which indicated that the increase of ph favored the catalytic degradation of smz in the co sam scs h2o2 system this result would be ascribed to the fact that co rather than fe played the major role in the catalytic degradation of smz under low ph condition in this regard the co sam scs catalyzed heterogeneous fenton like process showed a remarkable advantage due to the working environment 3 5 identification of the dominant radicals it has been widely accepted that the degradation of pollutants is attributed to the generation of radicals originated from the activation of h2o2 in the fenton fenton like process centi and perathoner 2003 in order to elucidate the reaction mechanism in depth the dominant radical that contributes to the degradation of smz was identified by free radical trapping experiments in this study tert butyl alcohol tba was utilized for hydroxyl radical ho scavenger and 1 4 benzoquinone bq was used for superoxide radical o2 scavenger feng et al 2010 ozcan et al 2017 as seen from fig 8 a addition of bq caused a slight decrease in the degradation rate of smz indicating that o2 played a minor role in smz degradation on the other hand tba caused prominently deactivation of the co sam scs catalyst the degradation rate of smz declined from 96 72 to 37 13 in the presence of 20 mm of tba which demonstrated the crucial role of ho in the catalytic degradation process according to these results it can be concluded that the major active specie in this heterogeneous fenton like reaction should be ho the formation of ho was also verified by epr spin trapping experiment fig 8b reveals that ho were generated in co sam scs h2o2 and sam scs h2o2 systems the intensity of the generated ho was found to be almost 3 times higher for co sam scs than for sam scs these results were consistent with the observed enhancement in smz removal 3 6 possible activation mechanisms of h2o2 it is generally accepted that in iron oxides based fenton oxidation systems ho is believed to be generated by the decomposition of h2o2 on the surface of the heterogeneous catalyst through eqs 8 and 9 zhao et al 2017 in these processes fe ii is produced via reduction of fe iii while ho is continuously generated from the decomposition of h2o2 meanwhile it should be noted that competitive reactions e g eqs 1 and 2 could occur hu et al 2011b huang et al 2012 zhang et al 2007 which negatively influence the fenton process 8 fe ii h2o2 fe iii ho 9 fe iii h2o2 fe ii h ho2 by contrast the generation of ho by co2 mediated activation of h2o2 has been documented only in a few studies based on previous researches bokare and choi 2014 shen et al 2017 and the experimental results obtained in this work a possible ho formation mechanism by co can be proposed as eqs 10 12 very interesting ho2 produced in the competitive reaction eq 5 of iron based fenton processes plays an important role in the reduction of co iii eq 12 what s more ho2 generated from eqs 9 and 12 can react with fe iii to produce ho2 via eq 5 that is to say co and fe on the surface of co sam scs present synergistic effects on the efficient generation of ho fig 9 10 co ii h2o2 co iii ho 11 h2o2 ho ho2 h2o 12 co iii ho2 co ii ho2 as shown in eq 11 ho plays an important role in the co ii co iii circulation which has been varied by our result in section 3 3 that the co sam scs catalyst exhibited better catalytic performance in alkaline solutions ph 9 than acidic solution ph 5 at higher ph a larger number of perhydroxyl anions ho2 were present in the solution eq 11 compared with h2o2 molecules ho2 is more nucleophilic and show higher activity to interact with co iii in the co sam scs catalyst eq 12 nguyen et al 2013 3 7 degradation intermediates and pathway of the smz degradation to fully understand the degradation process of smz by the co sam scs catalyzed fenton like reaction lc ms analyses were further performed to identify the oxidation products of smz the lc patterns showed that intensity of smz peak 3 52 min decreased quickly after h2o2 was added to the system fig 10 a meanwhile two peaks emerged between 0 60 min and 1 10 min and the intensity of them increased gradually with the reaction time in our study three main degradation intermediates of smz were detected by lc ms which included n 4 6 dimethylpyrimidin 2yl benzene 1 4 diamine a m z 215 4 aminophenol b m z 110 and 4 6 dimethylpyrimidin 2 ol c m z 125 fig s3 further we found that a was the dominant product at 60 min but c became the most abundant product after 120 min on the basis of these information and the studies guo et al 2013 li et al 2017 published previously a possible degradation pathway of smz in the co sam scs h2o2 system was proposed in fig 10b first so2 elimination driven by ho led to the formation of a which is a phenomenon frequently observed in the degradation of sulfonamides boreen et al 2005 huang et al 2017b neafsey et al 2010 then c n bond on the benzene ring was cleaved to form the degradation products of b and c finally b and c could be further attacked by ho leading to the formation of harmless inorganic species and small molecule organic acids 3 8 the stability and the degradation of smz in natural samples the stability of the catalyst is an important issue that should be considered before actual application the reusability is commonly used for evaluating the stability of co sam scs as shown in fig 11 the degradation efficiency was nearly maintained at the level of fresh sample after five successive runs furthermore the structural stability of the co sam scs catalyst was examined by sem fig 1 eds fig 2 xrd fig 3 and xps fig 4 as can be seen the crystal structure and morphology of used co sam scs are very similar to those of fresh co sam scs in addition the leached co and fe after reaction were only 2 36 mg l and 0 17 mg l respectively in real applications the composition of actual wastewater is extremely complex therefore huge differences could be obtained between removal efficiencies in a simulated wastewater and an actual polluted wastewater in this work the removal efficiency of smz by co sam scs h2o2 was studied using ultrapure water tap water changsha running water company river water taken from xiangjiang river changsha and municipal wastewater obtained from changsha 1st sewage treatment plant china the results showed that after the fenton like process more than 95 of smz is removed by co sam scs h2o2 for ultrapure water ultrapure water and river water fig s4 while relatively lower removal of smz about 86 was observed in wastewater this is probably due to the competition of ho by the abundant organic matters in municipal wastewater the obtained results greatly suggested that this novel catalyst exhibited good stability and also has a great potential for practical treatment of real wastewater the versatility of this co sam scs h2o2 system is also enhanced by the fact that it can work efficiently in neutral or slightly basic ph condition more importantly the catalyst can be recovered by a simple settling and separation process which enables the reuse of the catalyst 3 9 operating cost efficiency comparison the raw materials and chemicals used in the preparation of co sam scs can be cheaply provided by the industrial supplies the wholesale price of grinded scs salicylic acid methanol co no3 2 6h2o and h2o2 30 is about 0 15 us kg 1 5 us kg 0 4 us l 1 8 us kg and 0 22 us l respectively in this study the cost for the production of co sam scs is about 1 7 us kg according to the preliminary results abstained in this work the chemical cost for the treatment of 50 mg l smz wastewater is about 10 us m3 which is higher than the costs of some reported aops table 1 boczkaj and fernandes 2017 patil and gogate 2015 thanekar et al 2018 weng et al 2013 for example in a recent work thanekar et al 2018 reported the total cost of a hydrodynamic cavitation h2o2 o3 system is 4 55 us m3 the higher chemical cost in our study is mainly because relatively high h2o2 dosage 4 was adopted for the fast degradation of smz at slightly basic ph condition it should be noted that over 80 of smz can be removed in 240 min with 2 of h2o2 fig 7 under this condition the chemical cost can be reduced to 5 6 us m3 furthermore the chemical cost can also be reduced by recycling the catalyst as shown in table 1 the studied process co sam scs h2o2 is more economical than a recently reported sonication fention like process jaafarzadeh et al 2018 if the studied fenton like process can be put into practical application it will provide a feasible way to reuse scs and also achieve excellent environmental benefit 4 conclusions in this study a novel heterogeneous fenton like system with co sam scs as the catalyst was developed for the degradation of antibiotic smz in wastewater the co sam scs h2o2 system can work efficiently in neutral or slightly basic ph conditions furthermore the catalyst showed good stability and reusability co and fe on the surface of co sam scs present synergistic effects on the efficient generation of ho which was mainly responsible for the degradation of smz three main degradation intermediates were detected during the degradation process based on which a possible degradation pathway of smz in the co sam scs h2o2 system was proposed a further study conducted in three kinds of wastewater confirmed the application feasibility of this heterogeneous fenton like process for wastewater treatment meanwhile further research conducted with more complex wastewater is still needed before the full scale implementation our findings provide useful information to develop efficient and cost effective approaches

19589,the presence of antibiotics in aquatic environments has attracted global concern fenton process is an attractive yet challenging method for antibiotics degradation especially when such a reaction can be conducted at neutral ph values in this study a novel composite fe co catalyst was synthesized via the modification of steel converter slag scs by salicylic acid methanol sam and cobalt nitrate co no3 2 the catalysts were characterized by n2 brunauer emmett teller bet x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared ft ir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the results indicated that the co sam scs h2o2 fenton like system was very effective for sulfamethazine smz degradation at a wide ph range at initial ph of 7 0 the degradation rate of smz in co sam scs h2o2 system was 2 48 3 20 6 18 and 16 21 times of that in fe sam scs h2o2 sam scs h2o2 co no3 2 h2o2 and scs h2o2 system respectively the preliminary analysis suggested that high surface area of co sam scs sample and synergistic effect between introduced co and sam scs are responsible for the efficient catalytic activity during the degradation three main intermediates were identified by high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms analysis based on this a possible degradation pathway was proposed the sem images xrd patterns and xps spectra before and after the reactions demonstrate that the crystal and chemical structure of co sam scs after five cycles are almost unchanged besides the co sam scs presented low iron and cobalt leaching 0 17 mg l and 2 36 mg l respectively the studied fenton like process also showed high degradation of smz in river water and municipal wastewater the progress will bring valuable insights to develop high performance heterogeneous fenton like catalysts for environmental remediation graphical abstract image 1 keywords fenton like sulfamethazine steel converter slag cobalt degradation 1 introduction antibiotics have been excessively abused in veterinary and human medicine as emerging contaminants they have drawn increasing attention in recent years owing to their potential adverse effects on human health and aquatic ecology cheng et al 2016c zeng et al 2013a due to their antibacterial and polarity nature conventional waste water treatment plants wwtps can only partially remove antibiotics demonstrating the potential for these compounds to be consistently presented in effluents lai et al 2016 li et al 2017 yang et al 2010 as a result antibiotics have been repeatedly detected in surface water and sediment cheng et al 2018b guo et al 2017 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 thus an effective elimination of these compounds from the environment is important and necessary advanced oxidation processes aops are promising techniques for the disposal of toxic and persistent organic pollutants in wastewaters cheng et al 2017b huang et al 2017a yang et al 2016 2017 among these techniques fenton process based on the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ho has received particular attention cheng et al 2016b the fenton process holds many advantages including high degradation efficiency mild reaction conditions and simple operation cheng et al 2016a however fenton process also suffers from some drawbacks such as 1 it requires strict ph regulation ph 2 4 liu et al 2016 2 it requires the post treatment of the dissolved iron ions and sludge guo et al 2014 and 3 it may cause secondary pollution of acids burbano et al 2005 which make this technique complex and uneconomical in order to overcome these drawbacks fenton like processes using heterogeneous catalysts containing iron materials have been developed navalon et al 2010 in recent years hematite α fe2o3 maghemite γ fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 pyrite fes2 and goethite α feooh have been applied as heterogeneous fenton like catalysts for the degradation of many organic contaminants over a wider ph range steel converter slag scs a final waste material of the steel making process has high potential to be used in the fenton like process as heterogeneous catalyst owing to its abundance of iron oxides feo and fe2o3 yi et al 2012 on the other hand scs also contains calcium minerals which can negatively impact the performance of fenton like process it was reported that after adding scs into the system solution ph could be rapidly increased from 6 4 to 10 due to the dissolution of calcium minerals cheng et al 2017a 2018a under this condition the fenton fenton like reaction would be inefficient in our previous study salicylic acid methanol sam solution was used to dissolve calcium silicate minerals in scs and successfully improved the catalytic property of scs cheng et al 2017a however like other iron based heterogeneous fenton like processes the degradation was preferentially operated at acidic solutions ph 3 fan et al 2009 ozcan et al 2017 shen et al 2017 tang et al 2008 such a requirement of acidic environment however limited the industrial application of the technology because the pollutant solutions always have neutral or slightly basic ph values fan et al 2008 shen et al 2017 zeng et al 2013b previous studies have shown cobalt based fenton fenton like process can be operated in neutral ph condition bokare and choi 2014 on the one hand the homogeneous co2 h2o2 system was found able to completely decompose the dye pollutant without the control of ph ling et al 2010 on the other hand the degradation of organic pollutants by heterogeneous co catalysts was also studied in the presence of h2o2 in one study co2 loaded periodic mesoporous aluminum phosphate was utilized as heterogeneous catalyst for the degradation of phenol mahamallik and pal 2016 in a more recent work co2 adsorbed alumina was applied as heterogeneous catalyst to decompose methylene blue and methyl orange mahamallik and pal 2017 in both cases co based heterogeneous catalysts can effectively degrade the pollutants at neutral or even basic ph inspired by the above idea in this study we used co2 to further improve the catalytic property of scs in order to deal with the real wastewater which always has neutral or slightly basic ph values the sulfamethazine smz one of the most commonly used antibiotics was selected as model antibiotics contaminant because of its adverse effects on living being and frequently occurrence in natural water environment sopaj et al 2016 in recent years chemical oxidation methods especially the aops have been used for degradation of smz including fenton reaction based processes wan et al 2016 wan and wang 2017 wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2013 2014 photo catalysis babić

literature fenton reaction based processes have been most widely used for the degradation of smz mainly due to their low cost and high efficiency the other methods may either suffer from high energy consumption or low efficiency many works have demonstrated the degradation of smz by fenton reaction based processes however most of them were conducted at acidic condition wan and wang 2017 wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2013 2014 besides few studies have considered the degradation pathways of smz in the system the main objectives of this work were to 1 produce a new heterogeneous fenton like catalyst and elucidate its morphology evolution process 2 study the degradation performance of smz at neutral ph values in this fenton like system and investigate affecting experimental parameters 3 clarify the fenton like reaction mechanism and reveal the promotional role of co2 in the fenton like process and 4 examine the degradation intermediates of smz and propose the possible degradation

for certain time intervals 0 5 ml of reaction solution was sampled out for measurement of the concentration of smz in the preliminary experiment on the real wastewater treatment tap water derived from changsha running water company river water xiangjiang river changsha china and municipal wastewater obtained from changsha 1st sewage treatment plant changsha china were used as the solution for the

solution was used in above mentioned measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization of the prepared catalysts the prepared catalysts scs sam scs co sam scs and used co sam scs were characterized via different methods firstly the surface properties of the catalysts were investigated by bet analysis we found that specific surface areas of scs increased from 67 14 to 179 62 m2 g table s2 after sam modification suggesting that sam modification significantly changed the morphology of scs the remarkable increase in specific surface area is because calcium silicate minerals in the surface of scs were selectively removed by sam treatment resulting in forming irregular surfaces cheng et al 2017a compared to sam scs co sam scs showed an even larger specific surface area this could be ascribed to the fact that co formed new structure on the surface of sam scs only a slight decrease was observed in the surface areas of used co sam scs indicated that no significant change occurred in the morphology of sam scs during the fenton like experiments on the other hand the hysteresis of modified scs sam scs co sam scs and used co sam scs was observed fig s1 indicating that the modified scs presented the larger number of mesoporous compared to scs sem was applied to further study the morphologies changes of scs as seen from fig 1 a the surface of scs was relatively flat and smooth after sam modification there was an obvious change in the surface morphology of scs as displayed in fig 1b sam scs presented irregular shapes and sizes fig 1c revealed that after co2 deposition sam scs surface was covered by a rather uniform co layer sem image of used co sam scs is very similar to that of co sam scs fig 1c further demonstrating that no significant change occurred in the morphology of co sam scs during the fenton like degradation experiments additional elemental mappings combined with eds analysis for the prepared catalysts were also performed eds analysis showed that the unmodified scs mainly consists of o ca fe si mg mn and al fig s2a after sam modification these elements are still detected fig s2b but a distinct variation in the signals of them was observed as illustrated in table s3 the content of ca was remarkably decreased while fe content was increased after sam modification in particular the mass ratio of ca to fe was decreased from 2 27 to 1 29 after sam modification the results from element mapping coincided well with the edx analysis for example we can clearly see from fig 2 that the signal intensity of ca gradually reduced after the modifications the co element distributed throughout the film of co sam scs fig 2o and used co sam scs fig 2t suggesting that co had been evenly dispersed on the surface of sam scs and maintained good stability xrd diffraction patterns of scs sam scs co sam scs and used co sam scs were obtained to evaluate the modification of scs with sam and co2 fig 3 as can be seen in fig 3a the intensities of dicalcium silicate peaks 2θ 32 02 and 32 92 jcpds 77 0409 prominently decreased after sam modification on the contrary the intensities of iron oxide peaks 2θ 36 21 42 07 and 61 16 jcpds 74 1880 of sam scs were enhanced as compared to those of unmodified scs xrd analysis indicated that the sam modification removed a portion of calcium silicate minerals from scs as for sam scs and co sam scs the similar xrd patterns were found fig 3 that is to say the introduction of co in the catalyst had no noticeable influence on its crystalline structure the peaks for coo 2θ 36 37 42 26 and 61 38 jcpds 48 1719 were found in co sam scs suggesting that co was successfully introduced onto the surface of sam scs no obvious decline in co peaks after 5 cycles of degradation test revealed that a negligible amount of co on the surface of sam scs was lost during the fenton like processes the decrease in the peak at 2θ values of 29 36 belongs to caco3 jcpds 05 0586 in co sam scs and used co sam scs may attribute to that part of caco3 in sam scs was removed under acidic condition during the preparation of co sam scs the structure of the catalysts was also studied by ft ir spectra as displayed in fig 3b the ft ir spectra of scs and sam modified scs are similar the broad bands in the range of 1400 1500 cm 1 and 800 1000 cm 1 are primarily associated to the stretching vibrations of ca o gadsden 1975 and si o criado et al 2007 respectively the bands of ca o and si o decreased obviously after sam modification which was in agreement with xrd analysis for co sam scs no discernible discrepancy was observed which is likely due to the small amount of co in the catalyst and it also inferred that the introduction of co has no impacts on the initial chemical structure of sam scs fig 4 a displays the comparison of the survey spectra of scs and sam modified scs the elements of si 102 3 ev ca 347 5 ev 351 2 ev fe 711 7ev 724 9 ev o 531 1 ev and mg 1303 7 ev can be clearly observed on the spectra of all the four samples while the elements of co can only be observed on the spectra of co sam scs and used co sam scs fig 4b and c presents the high resolution xps spectra of ca and fe respectively it can be clearly seen from fig 4b that ca 2p peaks with the binding energy of 347 5 ev and 351 2 ev in sam scs are much weaker than that in scs and these peaks in the spectra of co sam scs and used co sam scs further decreased as compared to those in sam scs fig 4c shows the fe 2p spectrum with two individual peaks located at 724 6 ev for fe 2p1 2 and the other one with the binding energy of 711 7 ev is assigned to fe 2p3 2 it was found that fe 2p peaks in the spectra of modified scs sam scs co sam scs and used co sam scs were enhanced as compared with those in the spectra of scs we found there was no discernible change in the xps spectra of co for co sam scs and used co sam scs fig 4d two major peaks with binding energies at 797 6 ev and 781 6 ev are attributed to co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 of co and the satellite peaks were found at 786 4 ev and 803 7 ev li et al 2016 overall the xps results coincided well with the sem eds and xrd analysis 3 2 adsorption of smz by the catalysts the adsorption of organic pollutants onto the surface of catalysts are important for the catalytic degradation since the heterogeneous fenton like degradation mainly occurs at the solid liquid interface xie et al 2014 thus in the first step the adsorption of smz by scs sam scs and co sam scs was studied by using 5 mg l of smz solution as revealed in fig 5 the adsorption of smz increased quickly in 30 min and achieved adsorption equilibrium within 2 h in all three studied systems fig 5 demonstrates that the adsorption performance of co sam scs is similar to that of sam scs whereas scs shows much lower adsorption capability the remarkable adsorption rate can be ascribed to the changes of surface structure and chemical composition of scs as shown in table s2 and fig 1 the surface area total porosity and total pore volume of scs increased largely after sam modification further study showed that the sorption kinetics of smz on scs sam scs and co sam scs can be well fitted by pseudo second order kinetic model r 2 0 9995 0 9994 and 0 9997 respectively suggesting chemisorption is the rate limiting step for sorption brusseau et al 1991 gong et al 2009 xu et al 2012 3 3 comparative degradation behavior of smz in different fenton like systems degradation behaviors of smz were investigated by homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton like processes to evaluate the catalytic activity of co sam scs fig 6 the degradation experiments were conducted at ph 7 0 with 50 mg l of smz solution fig 6a illustrated that the degradation rates of smz were very different to each other in these systems it was found that 4 79 of smz was removed in the scs h2o2 system within the first 1 h and then the concentration of smz did not significantly change during the subsequent 3 h fig 6a the sam modification enhanced the catalytic ability of scs approximately 20 degradation efficiency enhancement which mainly due to the reduction of calcium mineral and the formation of higher surface area what s more the removal rate of smz could reach to 77 62 when co2 was introduced to sam scs for comparison co no3 2 and fe sam scs were also taken into consideration as shown in fig 6a the efficiency of heterogeneous co2 h2o2 fenton like process was relatively low only 12 56 of smz was degraded in 240 min this is because high h2o2 concentration h2o2 co2 6 is required to achieve efficient oxidation in heterogeneous co2 h2o2 system bokare and choi 2014 ling et al 2010 compared with sam scs fe sam scs exhibited higher catalytic activity and smz concentration was reduced by 31 63 however this value is not comparable with that of co sam scs which could be ascribed to the fact that fe based fenton fenton like reactions are more efficient at acidic condition over all the corresponding degradation rates of all the catalysts were in the following order co sam scs fe sam scs sam scs co no3 2 scs besides these results are in good accordance with the results of toc analysis fig 6b demonstrating that co sam scs has high potential in practical applications 3 4 effects of catalyst loading h2o2 dosage and ph on smz degradation the effects of catalyst concentration on the degradation rates of smz were evaluated by performing experiments with the presence of increasing amounts of co sam scs as seen in fig 7 a smz removal in 240 min increased from 29 31 to 82 57 along with the increase of catalyst dosage from 0 1 to 0 7 g l this is probably due to that the number of active sites increased as the increased co sam scs loadings which accelerated the decomposition of h2o2 and the generation of ho on the other hand the decline in smz removal was observed when increasing co sam scs loading up to 1 0 g l the probable reason was that the excessive co sam scs decreased the density of surface adsorbed h2o2 and reduced the concentration of ho on the solid liquid inter surface wang et al 2016 besides there also research suggested that iron surfaces would then cause the undesirable consumption of radicals e g ho and hoo through the following equations cheng et al 2014 hu et al 2011b huang et al 2012 4 fe ii ho fe iii oh 5 fe iii ho2 fe ii ho2 the effect of h2o2 dosage 0 6 on the degradation of smz was then examined the experimental results fig 7b showed the removal of smz was quite limited less than 5 in the absence of h2o2 in fact this part of smz was removed by the adsorption of co sam scs the introduction of h2o2 into the smz solution significantly accelerated the removal of smz the degradation rate of smz increased along with the increase of h2o2 dosage from 1 to 4 indicating that the concentration of h2o2 was directly related to the degradation of smz that makes sense because h2o2 is directly involved in the generation of the reactive radicals however the degradation rate of smz decreased when the h2o2 dosage further increased to 6 which is possibly due to the scavenging of ho by excessive h2o2 through equations 6 and 7 hu et al 2011a huang et al 2008 xia et al 2011 6 h2o2 ho ho2 h2o 7 ho2 ho o2 h2o it has been well established that ph of the solution plays a critical role in the efficiency of the fenton fenton like oxidation in the tested ph range 5 9 at least 60 of smz can be degraded after 240 min suggesting that co sam scs could be used for degradation of organic contaminants over a wide range of ph values as illustrated in fig 7c the degradation efficiency increased gradually as ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 which indicated that the increase of ph favored the catalytic degradation of smz in the co sam scs h2o2 system this result would be ascribed to the fact that co rather than fe played the major role in the catalytic degradation of smz under low ph condition in this regard the co sam scs catalyzed heterogeneous fenton like process showed a remarkable advantage due to the working environment 3 5 identification of the dominant radicals it has been widely accepted that the degradation of pollutants is attributed to the generation of radicals originated from the activation of h2o2 in the fenton fenton like process centi and perathoner 2003 in order to elucidate the reaction mechanism in depth the dominant radical that contributes to the degradation of smz was identified by free radical trapping experiments in this study tert butyl alcohol tba was utilized for hydroxyl radical ho scavenger and 1 4 benzoquinone bq was used for superoxide radical o2 scavenger feng et al 2010 ozcan et al 2017 as seen from fig 8 a addition of bq caused a slight decrease in the degradation rate of smz indicating that o2 played a minor role in smz degradation on the other hand tba caused prominently deactivation of the co sam scs catalyst the degradation rate of smz declined from 96 72 to 37 13 in the presence of 20 mm of tba which demonstrated the crucial role of ho in the catalytic degradation process according to these results it can be concluded that the major active specie in this heterogeneous fenton like reaction should be ho the formation of ho was also verified by epr spin trapping experiment fig 8b reveals that ho were generated in co sam scs h2o2 and sam scs h2o2 systems the intensity of the generated ho was found to be almost 3 times higher for co sam scs than for sam scs these results were consistent with the observed enhancement in smz removal 3 6 possible activation mechanisms of h2o2 it is generally accepted that in iron oxides based fenton oxidation systems ho is believed to be generated by the decomposition of h2o2 on the surface of the heterogeneous catalyst through eqs 8 and 9 zhao et al 2017 in these processes fe ii is produced via reduction of fe iii while ho is continuously generated from the decomposition of h2o2 meanwhile it should be noted that competitive reactions e g eqs 1 and 2 could occur hu et al 2011b huang et al 2012 zhang et al 2007 which negatively influence the fenton process 8 fe ii h2o2 fe iii ho 9 fe iii h2o2 fe ii h ho2 by contrast the generation of ho by co2 mediated activation of h2o2 has been documented only in a few studies based on previous researches bokare and choi 2014 shen et al 2017 and the experimental results obtained in this work a possible ho formation mechanism by co can be proposed as eqs 10 12 very interesting ho2 produced in the competitive reaction eq 5 of iron based fenton processes plays an important role in the reduction of co iii eq 12 what s more ho2 generated from eqs 9 and 12 can react with fe iii to produce ho2 via eq 5 that is to say co and fe on the surface of co sam scs present synergistic effects on the efficient generation of ho fig 9 10 co ii h2o2 co iii ho 11 h2o2 ho ho2 h2o 12 co iii ho2 co ii ho2 as shown in eq 11 ho plays an important role in the co ii co iii circulation which has been varied by our result in section 3 3 that the co sam scs catalyst exhibited better catalytic performance in alkaline solutions ph 9 than acidic solution ph 5 at higher ph a larger number of perhydroxyl anions ho2 were present in the solution eq 11 compared with h2o2 molecules ho2 is more nucleophilic and show higher activity to interact with co iii in the co sam scs catalyst eq 12 nguyen et al 2013 3 7 degradation intermediates and pathway of the smz degradation to fully understand the degradation process of smz by the co sam scs catalyzed fenton like reaction lc ms analyses were further performed to identify the oxidation products of smz the lc patterns showed that intensity of smz peak 3 52 min decreased quickly after h2o2 was added to the system fig 10 a meanwhile two peaks emerged between 0 60 min and 1 10 min and the intensity of them increased gradually with the reaction time in our study three main degradation intermediates of smz were detected by lc ms which included n 4 6 dimethylpyrimidin 2yl benzene 1 4 diamine a m z 215 4 aminophenol b m z 110 and 4 6 dimethylpyrimidin 2 ol c m z 125 fig s3 further we found that a was the dominant product at 60 min but c became the most abundant product after 120 min on the basis of these information and the studies guo et al 2013 li et al 2017 published previously a possible degradation pathway of smz in the co sam scs h2o2 system was proposed in fig 10b first so2 elimination driven by ho led to the formation of a which is a phenomenon frequently observed in the degradation of sulfonamides boreen et al 2005 huang et al 2017b neafsey et al 2010 then c n bond on the benzene ring was cleaved to form the degradation products of b and c finally b and c could be further attacked by ho leading to the formation of harmless inorganic species and small molecule organic acids 3 8 the stability and the degradation of smz in natural samples the stability of the catalyst is an important issue that should be considered before actual application the reusability is commonly used for evaluating the stability of co sam scs as shown in fig 11 the degradation efficiency was nearly maintained at the level of fresh sample after five successive runs furthermore the structural stability of the co sam scs catalyst was examined by sem fig 1 eds fig 2 xrd fig 3 and xps fig 4 as can be seen the crystal structure and morphology of used co sam scs are very similar to those of fresh co sam scs in addition the leached co and fe after reaction were only 2 36 mg l and 0 17 mg l respectively in real applications the composition of actual wastewater is extremely complex therefore huge differences could be obtained between removal efficiencies in a simulated wastewater and an actual polluted wastewater in this work the removal efficiency of smz by co sam scs h2o2 was studied using ultrapure water tap water changsha running water company river water taken from xiangjiang river changsha and municipal wastewater obtained from changsha 1st sewage treatment plant china the results showed that after the fenton like process more than 95 of smz is removed by co sam scs h2o2 for ultrapure water ultrapure water and river water fig s4 while relatively lower removal of smz about 86 was observed in wastewater this is probably due to the competition of ho by the abundant organic matters in municipal wastewater the obtained results greatly suggested that this novel catalyst exhibited good stability and also has a great potential for practical treatment of real wastewater the versatility of this co sam scs h2o2 system is also enhanced by the fact that it can work efficiently in neutral or slightly basic ph condition more importantly the catalyst can be recovered by a simple settling and separation process which enables the reuse of the catalyst 3 9 operating cost efficiency comparison the raw materials and chemicals used in the preparation of co sam scs can be cheaply provided by the industrial supplies the wholesale price of grinded scs salicylic acid methanol co no3 2 6h2o and h2o2 30 is about 0 15 us kg 1 5 us kg 0 4 us l 1 8 us kg and 0 22 us l respectively in this study the cost for the production of co sam scs is about 1 7 us kg according to the preliminary results abstained in this work the chemical cost for the treatment of 50 mg l smz wastewater is about 10 us m3 which is higher than the costs of some reported aops table 1 boczkaj and fernandes 2017 patil and gogate 2015 thanekar et al 2018 weng et al 2013 for example in a recent work thanekar et al 2018 reported the total cost of a hydrodynamic cavitation h2o2 o3 system is 4 55 us m3 the higher chemical cost in our study is mainly because relatively high h2o2 dosage 4 was adopted for the fast degradation of smz at slightly basic ph condition it should be noted that over 80 of smz can be removed in 240 min with 2 of h2o2 fig 7 under this condition the chemical cost can be reduced to 5 6 us m3 furthermore the chemical cost can also be reduced by recycling the catalyst as shown in table 1 the studied process co sam scs h2o2 is more economical than a recently reported sonication fention like process jaafarzadeh et al 2018 if the studied fenton like process can be put into practical application it will provide a feasible way to reuse scs and also achieve excellent environmental benefit 4 conclusions in this study a novel heterogeneous fenton like system with co sam scs as the catalyst was developed for the degradation of antibiotic smz in wastewater the co sam scs h2o2 system can work efficiently in neutral or slightly basic ph conditions furthermore the catalyst showed good stability and reusability co and fe on the surface of co sam scs present synergistic effects on the efficient generation of ho which was mainly responsible for the degradation of smz three main degradation intermediates were detected during the degradation process based on which a possible degradation pathway of smz in the co sam scs h2o2 system was proposed a further study conducted in three kinds of wastewater confirmed the application feasibility of this heterogeneous fenton like process for wastewater treatment meanwhile further research conducted with more complex wastewater is still needed before the full scale implementation our findings provide useful information to develop efficient and cost effective approaches
