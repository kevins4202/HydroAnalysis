9360,clogging is one of the main ageing factors in drip irrigation clogging can be physical chemical or biological the adequate maintenance procedures to be applied differ according to the type of clogging involved it is therefore noteworthy to first determine the nature and amount of clogging in the field before managing maintenance operations laboratory based methods can help to understand the clogging mechanisms however these methods require either the extraction of samples and thus the destruction of drippers or a specific installation such as transparent flow cells to observe clogging in the field several methods based on hydraulic measurements can estimate the presence of clogging however they provide an indirect estimation and do not necessarily reflect the early stages of clogging there is currently no direct method for detecting clogging in the field in the drippers the difficulty arises both from the variety of clogging materials to be detected and from the small section of the dripper channels of the order of 1 mm² this review analyses the pros and cons of several types of sensors electrical mechatronic acoustic and optical that offer potential perspectives to meet this need keywords lab scale measurement in situ measurement in field measurment sensors data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction irrigation systems are structures that ensure the supply of water to a crop many irrigation techniques are employed around the world but drip irrigation is becoming increasing popular for irrigating crops drip irrigation allow for irrigation efficiency up to 90 camp et al 2000 since the amount of water delivered to the plant is optimised it allows for high irrigation uniformity makes water saving practices easier to operate and can encourage fertigation supply of fertilizer in solution to the irrigation water or the use of non conventional water resources e g reclaimed wastewater saline brackish water as it limits contact between the irrigation water and the crop lamm et al 2006 drippers can be subject to a flow pressure law non pressure compensated or npc drippers or can provide a fixed flow rate regardless of the pressure imposed pressure compensated or pc drippers thanks to the addition of an elastomer membrane the drippers can provide flow rates between 0 5 and 4 l h 1 depending on the type of dripper chosen however drip irrigation is prone to clogging in particular the channel inside drippers that regulate the irrigation flow this channel is usually narrow with a water flow cross section of the order of a square millimetre adin and sacks 1991 lequette et al 2020 and forms a labyrinth that causes a turbulent flow regime to develop al muhammad et al 2019 on one hand this allows for the water pressure to be dissipated and the desired flow rate to be achieved at the dripper outlet on the other hand this geometry creates a flow consisting of a high velocity main flow and vortex zones in the corners of the channel the size of the channel and the existence of these vortex zones make the drippers susceptible to clogging ait mouheb et al 2019 lequette et al 2020 clogging can alter the irrigation rate and thus decrease both the efficiency and uniformity of the irrigation system lamm et al 2006 niu et al 2013 thus representing a bottleneck in the durability of drip irrigation system performance adin and sacks 1991 three major types of clogging can be distinguished physical chemical and biological adin and sacks 1991 bucks et al 1979 each major type of clogging may be caused by specific elements and has therefore different mechanisms of formation such as deposit or attachment and potential effects on the flow rate clogging is conditioned by the quality of the irrigation water the different quality parameters of irrigation water that are important for limiting clogging phenomena have been identified and associated thresholds have been determined to assess the risk of induced clogging ayers and westcot 1989 nakayama and bucks 1981 pitts et al 1990 physical clogging is mainly affected by the amount of particles suspended in the water as well as their size niu et al 2013 oliveira et al 2017 and can occur across a wide range of water sources e g surface water groundwater reclaimed water despite the usual presence of upstream filtration particles smaller than 110 µm in diameter can still be found in the drippers these particles can be categorized according to their diameter fine sands diameter between 200 µm and 50 µm silts 50 2 µm and clays 2 µm since the particle size directly influences their behaviour some particles are more likely to clog than others according to the work of oliveira et al 2020 clays can be trapped in the drippers without any effect on the flow rate providing they stay dispersed however the work of bounoua et al 2016 suggested the formation of aggregates including clay but not only could occur with a strong clogging power when the water contained sodium aluminium and calcium salts results provided by niu et al 2013 pointed out that the diameter of particles with the highest clogging potential ranges between 31 and 38 µm in addition the concentration in particles can also affect the risk of clogging niu et al 2013 oliveira et al 2017 chemical clogging results from the precipitation of elements in solution in the irrigation water and therefore depends mainly on the ph and conductivity of the water hills et al 1989 rizk et al 2017 zhangzhong et al 2019 a ph superior to 8 and or a conductivity superior to 3 0 ds cm 1 as well as a temperature above 55 c and a low partial pressure in co2 all tend to raise the risk of chemical clogging bucks et al 1979 rizk et al 2017 several chemical elements can cause this phenomenon including calcium magnesium carbonates phosphates or iron rizk et al 2017 however the most frequent cause for clogging is calcium carbonate precipitate hills et al 1989 rizk et al 2017 the formation of precipitates creates a deposit that evolves and can even modify the water flow area inducing a variation in the dripper discharge rate biological clogging is associated with the development of biofilms inside the drippers the appearance of biofilms is favoured by the presence of bacteria in the irrigation water average risk from 10 000 ppm and the presence of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus which feed the bacteria bucks et al 1979 flemming et al 2007 after attachment of the bacteria to the dripper walls extracellular polymeric substances are secreted and help to form a biofilm matrix flemming et al 2007 lequette et al 2020 qian et al 2017 yan et al 2009 the structure of the biofilms prevents them from breaking off due to water movement horn et al 2003 biofilm development can lead to a decrease in dripper flow by partially or totally obstructing the water flow zhou et al 2013 the bacterial population of biofilms in drip irrigation can depend on many factors such as the nature of the irrigation water or the types of maintenance protocols used lequette et al 2021 since pathogenic bacteria can be present in a biofilm they can therefore be found at the dripper outlet after detachment causing potential health risks lequette et al 2019 although biological clogging is of particular concern when irrigating with reclaimed wastewater that contains a richer bacterial community and often carry suspended organic matter it can still occur with any type of irrigation water several types of clogging may be jointly present in an irrigation system with couplings that may or may not aggravate the condition of the system chen et al 2003 ramachandrula and kasa 2020 rizk et al 2019 tarchitzky et al 2013 yan et al 2009 tarchitzky et al 2013 observed the presence of clay particles in biofilms within drippers rizk et al 2019 demonstrated that the presence of biofilms could favour the trapping of calcium carbonate precipitates thus revealing the coupling of two types of clogging in contrast results from ramachandrula and kasa 2020 highlighted a decorrelation between the presence of clay deposits and calcium carbonate deposits suggesting an opposition between two types of clogging several interactions between clogging types thus seem possible and are currently rather poorly understood knowledge on the type of clogging involved is essential for the proper management of irrigation systems indeed maintenance operations may differ according to the type of clogging in the case of physical clogging hydraulic flushing operations often coupled with acid injections are most often undertaken bucks et al 1979 puig bargués et al 2010 yu et al 2018 this step consists of increasing the water flow speed within the pipes between 0 3 and 0 6 m s 1 to return the deposited particles to suspension in water for chemical clogging acid injections lead to a decrease in ph which hinders the formation of precipitates and may favour their dispersion hills et al 1989 for biofilms chlorination or oxygen peroxide injection operations are usually carried out to clean the drippers and prevent biofilm development lequette et al 2021 song et al 2017 currently these operations are performed either routinely to prevent clogging or in response to specific operating conditions such as irrigation water quality temperature or ph recent work however has pointed out that the effects of these cleaning operations can have limits the work of yu et al 2018 highlighted the limitations of hydraulic flushing for physical clogging control frequent flushing removes particles with diameters greater than 50 µm but particles smaller than 10 µm require flushing at a higher pressure which should be carried out before irrigation this type of operation could therefore benefit by an adaptation to the size of the particles actually present in the system in the case of chlorination song et al 2017 showed that the choice of chlorination concentrations and duration had variable effects on the bacterial activity responsible for biological clogging however their results also demonstrated that biofilms could remain present independently of the selected chlorination method lequette et al 2021 presented similar results on the use of chlorination coupled with hydraulic flushing while maintenance operations when performed routinely improve the long term efficiency and longevity of the irrigation system they do not ensure the total elimination of clogging the adaptation of maintenance operations according to the nature location and quantity of clogging could allow for more effective maintenance thus knowledge on in situ clogging could help improve the management of maintenance operations and enhance the performance and life span of drip irrigation systems fig 1 illustrates the evolution of the number of publications associated with clogging in drip irrigation since 1980 based on the elsevier scopus database several keywords have been added to identify general trends in the evolution of work on the subject the keyword analysis aims to select studies dealing with clogging analysis the keywords detection sensor sensing and quantification point to studies focusing on in situ observations of clogging since the early 2000 s the study of clogging has gained momentum and even accelerated since 2018 most of this work aims at understanding the mechanisms of different types of clogging in drip irrigation however according to the results presented in fig 1 studies focusing on the detection or quantification of clogging only constitute a minor part of the total research conducted despite the boom since 2018 these issues are not the subject of more than 20 research articles per year representing less than 15 of studies on clogging in drip irrigation this may be due to several factors including on the one hand the practical difficulty of in situ detection of drip irrigation clogging and on the other hand the cost of developing new methods however several methods exist at different scales to study clogging and could offer opportunities to detect clogging directly and thus allow a more accurate management of cost effective maintenance operations the objective of this paper is to review the main methods for clogging analysis in drip irrigation this review begins by detailing several methods used at the laboratory scale to study clogging in drip irrigation it then focuses on some methods used on the field to identify and analyse clogging phenomena finally several technologies and methods applied to sensor design are presented in order to assess their potential for detecting and or identifying clogging directly within drippers and to draw out perspectives 2 lab scale methods for clogging evaluation this chapter aims to present a non exhaustive list of methods for analysing clogging in drip irrigation at laboratory scales these methods have been divided into two categories destructive methods which require the extraction and destruction of the clogging sample and non destructive methods which propose to study the samples without extracting them 2 1 destructive methods for clogging analysis in order to study the mechanisms of clogging and assess its composition or quantity the clogging material can be extracted from the dripper for laboratory investigation on one hand this implies a necessary destruction of the clogged dripper but on the other hand offers noteworthy information table 1 summarises the methods presented in this section before extracting the clogging for further analysis it can be interesting to locate it inside of the drippers for that optical microscopy can be used as it provides a closer look to clogging and take images puig bargués et al 2005 taylor et al 1995 yao et al 2021 however for the location of the clogging to be relevant it is necessary to extract the dripper without damaging it in the case of integrated drippers this operation can be difficult and alter the location or even the nature of the observed clogging by mixing it with the materials constituting the drippers and the pipes moreover this type of observation generally only provides qualitative and not quantitative information on the one hand and does not allow the identification of the nature of the clogging on the other usually a primary step for extracted clogging material analysis involves the identification of the organic and inorganic phases of a clogging sample extracted from drippers using mass measurement before and after combustion rizk et al 2019 tarchitzky et al 2013 this step allows for the presence of mineral compounds associated with physical and chemical clogging to be assessed and the proportion of these compounds relative to the total sample mass can thus be evaluated tarchitzky et al 2013 coupled this process with infrared spectroscopy measurements to correlate the amount of organic and inorganic material with absorption spectra that provide information on the composition of the sample following combustion only a spectral absorption peak associated with clays was observed this method therefore highlighted the existence of two types of clogging that had occurred simultaneously thus showing a potential for clogging type discrimination to analyse the nature of clogging on solid samples several studies have employed x ray diffractometry xrd to determine the crystalline structure of the sample benlouali et al 2021 li et al 2019 muhammad et al 2021 oliveira et al 2020 ramachandrula and kasa 2020 rizk et al 2017 yao et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 thanks to this method the presence of crystalline compounds such as calcium carbonate precipitates and can be assessed based on their crystalline structure in order to understand their formation mechanisms like precipitation or deposition in this way rizk 2017 was able to demonstrate the presence of calcium carbonate precipitates within dehydrated biofilm samples developed in a taylor couette reactor using treated wastewater the presence of two types of clogging was observed in conditions of shear stress close to that observed in drip irrigation this work also allowed for the crystallization structure of calcium carbonate precipitates to be identified the other study mentioned used xrd on samples extracted from clogged drippers where the type of clays present in the clogging oliveira et al 2020 could be identified and where the joint presence of clays and calcium carbonate could be observed in the samples ramachandrula and kasa 2020 yao et al 2021 thus indicating a coupling between physical and chemical clogging in addition the use of the rietveld refinement method on the xrd results seems to provide more detailed information on the composition of the sample zhang et al 2020 consequently this method could be employed to determine the composition of solid crystalline samples and to deduce the presence of chemical precipitates and or clays that are responsible for clogging despite its performance for discrimination and its frequent application for irrigation clogging analysis xrd requires a minimum mass of the order of 10 g of extracted and dried samples bunaciu et al 2015 that can limit its application another commonly used method for the analysis of solid compounds is scanning electron microscopy sem sem can allow for the dried sample to be observed directly and for its size and component layout to be assessed thanks to sem ribeiro et al 2018 could observe and quantify biofilms within drippers and correlate their presence with operating conditions several studies have coupled sem with xrd in order to retrieve a global view of the clogging material benlouali et al 2021 ribeiro et al 2018 tarchitzky et al 2013 yao et al 2021 on the one hand this approach allows for the proportion of each solid identified in the sample to be evaluated on another hand information on the clogging mechanisms can be obtained from the arrangement of the sample despite promising sem observations the requirement for dry samples and the heaviness of the equipment make this technology unsuitable for on field measurements for the analysis of biofilms and of bacterial activity in particular essentially two parameters are monitored oliver et al 2014 yan et al 2009 yao and habimana 2019 firstly phospholipidic fatty acids plfas one of the main constituents of bacterial cell membranes are used as indicators to qualify and quantify the presence of biofilms secondly extracellular polymeric substances epss produced by bacteria to form biofilms can also be measured as indicators of biofilm formation these two parameters are most commonly monitored for identifying and quantifying the presence of biofilms however the methodology requires the extraction of biofilm samples thus implying an isolated and destructive measurement oliver et al 2014 yan et al 2009 the study of biofilms and bacterial communities can be further developed indeed oliver et al 2014 and lequette et al 2019 worked on additional sequencing steps allowing for the different types of bacteria and thus for health risks in particular to be assessed these methods are therefore efficient for the analysis of clogging related elements and have been widely used for the study of clogging in drip irrigation the results thus obtained have made it possible to locate clogging inside of the dripper to determine and quantify the composition of certain types of clogging to highlight the coupling between the various clogging materials and to help understanding clogging formation mechanisms however these methods all share the drawback of requiring extracted and often dried samples as mentioned earlier the extraction of drippers and thus clogging samples can be difficult and can lead to incorrect information if the sample is damaged they are therefore unsuitable for direct monitoring of clogging within the drippers in an open field installation 2 2 non destructive methods for clogging analysis several non destructive methods mainly based on optical measurements have been applied in the laboratory to characterize clogging in drip irrigation the methods discussed in this section are summarized in table 2 optical microscopy was employed by ait mouheb et al 2019 and oliveira et al 2020 to locate physical clogging inside dripper shaped flow cells equipped with a transparent glass wall in these studies the areas that were most susceptible to clogging within dripper channels were located these results were obtained with clays and biofilms covering two types of clogging directly inside the flow cell systems ribeiro et al 2018 used optical microscopy on biological samples collected from irrigation water some bacteria could be identified however this required the extraction of the samples optical microscopy can therefore allow for direct observations of clogging under certain conditions the nature of the clogging can also be identified but this remains limited to visual observations clogging within the drippers seems difficult to accurately quantify and discriminate with this method since the provided information consists in images that are subject to interpretation one of the favourite methods for studying and quantifying biofilms in situ is optical coherence tomography oct horn et al 2003 oct provides a three dimensional view of a sample and allows for questions of volume porosity and composition to be addressed on biological samples wagner and horn 2017 this method has therefore been applied in drip irrigation mainly for the characterization of biological clogging lequette et al 2020 qian et al 2017 qian et al 2017 and lequette et al 2020 used oct to characterise biofilm development in drippers equipped with a transparent wall and functioning with treated wastewater they were able to measure the clogging thickness and to visualize its location inside a dripper channel with a transparent wall by coupling these two parameters the percentage of volume covered by biofilm in the dripper channel could be estimated petit et al 2021 used oct in a simplified context representing drippers clogged with clays sand and calcium carbonate the thickness of the clogging layer was measured thus extending the use of oct to non organic materials however due to the opacity of materials such as clays or calcium carbonate at the working wavelength of oct it remains impossible to detect the porosity of the sample or the presence of other elements in this type of clogging recently zhou et al 2021 used 3d industrial computed tomography 3d ict to directly characterize biofilms in a dripper this method uses x ray radiation for viewing the inside and outside of an object in this study a three dimensional representation of the clogging was obtained through the non transparent dripper walls a marking agent was used in order to distinguish the biofilm from the water and the walls of the dripper since it is a new element within the system the presence of a marking agent can alter the composition and growth of biofilms in some cases or even change the clogging mechanisms however biofilm thickness can be measured with this method and the clogged areas can be identified the use of a marking agent for identifying the clogging material works well with biofilms but it is still unclear whether it would work with inorganic materials non destructive imaging methods are of particular interest to assess the localization of clogging in drippers however it is almost always necessary to have a transparent wall to acquire the images oct and 3d ict are methods with a great potential for monitoring biological clogging at laboratory scales oct provides access to fine quantification data while 3d ict does not even require a transparent wall nevertheless these laboratory methods are not adapted to field measurements since they are still too expensive and equipment heavy the methods used at laboratory scales provide a large amount of information on the composition or quantity of clogging destructive methods can be applied to extracted material which may originate from the equipment itself these methods can be used for assessing the amount of clogging extracted and its composition non destructive methods usually allow for the study of clogging in a context where measurements are made easier but where the reality of drip irrigation is not systematically reflected however these methods also allow for the clogging to be located or to be monitored although this information is essential for understanding the mechanisms of clogging in drip irrigation it cannot be generally obtained on real field equipment using these current methods on field measurements would provide concrete information on real installations and thus contribute to the management of maintenance operations the following chapter focusses on the direct assessment of clogging in the field with a description of the potentially interesting methods for this purpose 3 on field methods for clogging evaluation this chapter focuses on several methods used in the field to assess clogging phenomena the first section presents evaluations of clogging in the field based on measurements of dripper output the second section focuses on methods for detecting malfunctions in irrigation equipment that may be due to clogging 3 1 discharge monitoring as explained earlier clogging in drip irrigation becomes an issue when it affects the flow rate of the drippers and the uniformity of the irrigation it is therefore natural that in practice the evaluation of clogging is mainly performed by discharge monitoring oliveira et al 2017 pereira et al 2020 ravina et al 1992 1992 flow measurement is usually carried out by measuring a volume of water leaving one or several drippers during a given time several indicators can be calculated using the flow measurement firstly the flow measurement and the calculation of the relative flow rate dra li et al 2015 reveal the evolution of the flow rate on a given dripper and thus possible problems can be detected secondly the uniformity of irrigation can be evaluated by measuring the flow rate on several drippers and by calculating indicators such as the christiansen uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1942 or the emission uniformity eu keller and karmeli 1974 thanks to these indicators the overall operating status of an irrigation system can be assessed they can also contribute to guide maintenance operations or plan the renewal of equipment however to calculate these indicators the flow rate is usually measured on a certain number of drippers of the order of 15 30 drippers spread over the whole installation as a result clogging may not be detected during the measurement if none of the selected drippers is affected and these indicators may have very low uniformity values if few tested drippers are clogged in addition the flow and uniformity values to be used as a trigger for cleaning operations or equipment replacement have never been clearly defined these indicators are therefore not fully effective in detecting and combating clogging solutions integrating sensors over the entire field such as proposed by klein et al 2018 could offer an interesting alternative to flow measurement standardized laboratory tests are also usually carried out to assess the sensitivity to clogging of different types of drippers and drip irrigation lines bodole et al 2016 koech et al 2015 pereira et al 2020 these tests consist of running drip irrigation lines with water loaded with solid particles different irrigation schedules and different particle sizes and concentrations are usually tested to test the resistance of the system to conditions highly conducive to clogging for more details about the test procedures see koech et al 2015 new protocols are regularly proposed for the monitoring of clogging based on flow monitoring for example camargo et al 2014 proposed a coupling between flow measurement and head loss measurement in pipes to precisely estimate the degree of clogging and its location in one lateral however this specific protocol has never been applied in the field to assess the real operating conditions of the irrigation system mainly because of the cost of pressure transducer used monitoring dripper discharge can be time consuming and cannot always be applied for example in the case of underground drip systems flow measurements can also be provided by automated instrumentation thus limiting the workload in practice flowmeters can be placed in the field to provide this data camargo et al 2014 ravina et al 1992 different types of sensors exist to perform flow measurements e g turbine flowmeters electromagnetic ultrasonic kolmetz et al 2007 however as these sensors are usually installed on the pipes and not on the drippers themselves the influence of clogging within the drippers is more difficult even impossible to detect from the flow within the pipe measurements at a millimetre scale as in drippers are therefore an issue with these sensors moreover because the price of this type of equipment does not allow for it to be used on the entire system it is necessary to carefully place the measurement spots across the overall installation pressure monitoring within the pipes can also help to understand the clogging phenomena in the drippers povoa and hills 1994 and camargo et al 2014 tested the use of pressure transducers but concluded that these sensors are too fragile and too expensive to constitute a feasible solution for clogging monitoring in the field the use of pressure sensors could limit the total cost of the equipment but these low cost sensors have a lower sensitivity than the pressure transducers used in these studies and may not be able to provide sufficiently fine pressure measurements to allow monitoring of clogging low cost pressure sensor also presents the same shortcoming as flow sensors since they can only be installed on the pipes and not directly on the drippers for scale reasons more recently studies have combined direct and automated flow measurements with iot based management protocols in order to provide precise irrigation control abioye et al 2021 menon 2021 singh and saikia 2016 abioye et al 2021 and singh and saikia 2016 proposed to couple an evaluation of evapotranspiration via meteorological parameters like temperature or wind speed with measurements of soil flow and moisture all measurements were centralized in a program dedicated to the control of irrigation according to the water requirements estimated via evapotranspiration and to the detection of irrigation malfunctions via flowrate and soil moisture measurements however the effectiveness of this type of monitoring still needs to be further explored in addition menon 2021 proposed to monitor the malfunctioning of a drip system by only using a flow rate sensor and a pressure sensor located immediately after the pumping system the results are promising and have allowed for maintenance operations to be piloted however for a more thorough analysis further data is still required the advantage of iot based systems is that they offer both irrigation and maintenance control solutions while using low cost equipment flow and pressure monitoring provide significant information for assessing the overall functioning of the irrigation system and for estimating its efficiency however this type of monitoring does not allow for the nature of the flow variation to be identified in practice a variation in flowrate is not only caused by clogging but also by technical issues or ageing of the irrigation system and may not be fully assessed when using standard protocols for irrigation flow and uniformity evaluation in addition several laboratory studies have pointed out that in the first instance clogging usually occurs without any change in flowrate lequette et al 2020 oliveira et al 2020 in such cases cleaning operations would not be initiated due to the undetected presence of clogging flow and pressure monitoring therefore represent an incomplete approach for early clogging detection and evaluation nevertheless the use of flow and pressure monitoring to locate problem areas holds promises for the development and placement of new methods on a field installation 3 2 in situ detection of drip irrigation malfunctions many solutions for automated irrigation scheduling and monitoring exist on the market romero et al 2012 reviewed these methods according to how they work among these methods some involve the measurement of the amount of water in the soil in order to evaluate the quality of the irrigation the use of tensiometres or soil moisture sensors is widespread and allows for over or under irrigation to be avoided by optimal control this type of approach can also be considered to detect variations in the functioning of the irrigation on condition that there are a sufficient number of sensors the detection of an under irrigated area can thus contribute to identify a malfunction in the irrigation system and in particular the clogging of drippers nevertheless such methods require high maintenance costs and are rather reserved for research questions instead of practical use dag et al 2015 highlighted the use of thermal remote sensing to detect drip irrigation malfunctions this study focused on leakage detection but the results presented could also contribute to identify the presence of clogging by detecting an increase in soil temperature wang et al 2021 used ground penetrating radar data to assess the volume of the wet bulb under drip irrigation when the functioning of one or more drippers is altered by the presence of clogging a variation can be observed in the dimensions of this wet zone thanks to these methods it would be possible to assess the variations in the quantity of water supplied to the soil either by using inexpensive sensors e g tensiometres soil moisture sensors installed in large numbers in order to retrieve overall information or by performing a global measurement over a large area temperature measurement radar however due to the nature of the measurements carried out they share the same drawbacks as flow measurement methods for the characterization of clogging in drip irrigation the methods currently used in the field are noteworthy they allow for the efficient detection of problems in the irrigation system and thus prevent their repercussions on the crop however in the specific case of clogged drippers these methods remain insufficient indeed they do not detect the clogging early enough before it can have an influence on the flow rate as mentioned earlier and they do not provide information on the nature of the clogging with these methods the management of maintenance operations can be carried out when a problem is detected but they cannot be directly optimised according to the presence and nature of clogging as a result there is currently no method in the field of irrigation that seems suitable for early in situ detection and analysis of dripper clogging the following section provides examples of methods used in contexts other than irrigation that might fill this gap and offer new perspectives 4 sensor scale detection methods of interest an in situ measurement in the field would allow for the detection and observation of clogging in real time conditions the clogging would therefore be detected before it could affect the flow rate and thus an optimal maintenance of the equipment could be performed this chapter aims to explore the range of in situ methods that can be applied to the detection of clogging in drip irrigation these methods were selected according to three criteria 1 they can be used for the detection and or quantification of materials associated with clogging in drip irrigation cf section i 2 they can offer a non destructive and in situ measurement 3 their detection area can reach a scale small enough to consider their application inside dripper channels the methods in this non exhaustive list are presented as examples they have been sorted into three categories according to the type of measurement performed and are summarized in table 3 table 3 overview of the sensor scale methods of interest retained for drip irrigation clogging in situ and non destructive measurement 4 1 electrochemical detection methods electronic sensors measure the evolution of electrical parameters e g potential impedance relative to the formation of a deposit on a detection surface in particular this type of sensor is used in the detection of biofilms in various contexts such as water or food industry mollica and cristiani 2018 paredes et al 2014 pavanello et al 2011 turolla et al 2019 yang and bashir 2008 pavanello et al 2011 proposed a sensor involving a stainless steel surface where biofilm growth induces a change in the electrical potential the detection zone was a circle with a diameter of about 2 cm on which the biofilm must grow to be detected detection was ensured above 1 coverage of the detection area which represents a deposit of about 3 mm² this sensor was tested by the authors in a seawater tank and in a desalination plant as a result the sensor does effectively detect the presence of a biofilm and acts as an indicator for controlling chlorination cleaning operations the sensor also appeared to be capable of differentiating between biological and inorganic deposits although there was no result to support this assertion in the study for drip irrigation the size of this type of sensor and its sensitivity are not suitable for measurements inside the drippers nevertheless if downscaling of the equipment can be possible the method would become of interest for monitoring biological clogging turolla et al 2019 proposed an impedance sensor that can detect biofilm growth and calcium carbonate deposits on gold electrodes the sensor consists of several pairs of electrodes with a width and spacing of 10 µm the minimum detection area therefore covered a width of 30 µm with a length of 2000 mm and a height of 0 7 mm the presence of biofilm or calcium carbonate deposits on the electrodes resulted in a change in impedance which led to the detection and identification of the nature of the deposit this sensor was tested in a reactor under favourable conditions for the development of a biofilm and deposition of calcium carbonate precipitates the sensor had a detection threshold of the order of 2 µm in thickness of clogging material and could differentiate between the two types of materials tested the measurement scale of the sensor therefore seems relevant for the evaluation of chemical and or biological clogging in drippers furthermore the authors envisage prospects for reducing detection thresholds and equipment size these approaches are noteworthy and could offer solutions for in situ and non destructive clogging detection in drip irrigation however it is not known whether materials associated with physical clogging such as clays or silt could be detected using electronic sensors in addition both methods require the development of fouling on metallic surfaces stainless steel or gold therefore the intrusiveness of this type of material in drippers will still need to be tested to ensure that the presence of the sensor does not alter the normal dripper operation indeed dripper walls are usually composed of polyethylene or pmma the major interest is that the scale at which these methods are applied can be reduced their potential to detect distinguish and quantify clogging materials found in drip irrigation gives them a promising perspective that could be further explored through laboratory and on field trials 4 2 mechanical detection methods mechatronic sensors convert mechanical motion data into an electrical signal by doing so variations in motion can be detected and associated with the parameter to be monitored pereira et al 2008 used a mechatronic sensor to monitor the contamination of a surface by bacterial growth or particle deposition this sensor comprises a pvc plate length 210 mm width 80 mm thickness 1 mm on which the clogging takes place the plate is equipped with two piezoelectric actuators spaced 60 mm apart the first one sends a vibratory movement to the plate while the second one measures the propagation of the vibration the evolution of the vibration between the two actuators makes it possible to determine whether the plate is covered with clogging material or not sensor operation was tested in a flow cell with an internal diameter of 30 mm and a length of 1200 mm fed with water containing bacteria and silica particles the normalized amplitude of the vibration was the parameter indicating the presence of deposits the authors observed an evolution of the amplitude that was proportional to the amount of deposit on the sensor moreover the amplitude evolution coefficient was different for biofilm and silica the two type of clogging studied these results support the capacity of this sensor to discriminate between the two types of clogging and to quantify them however the minimum clogging masses measured in this work were about 20 mg cm 2 and 45 mg cm 2 for biofilms and silica respectively it is therefore impossible to assess the true performance of the sensor on lower masses moreover this approach discriminates materials according to their viscosity and thus may not be capable of discriminating between solid materials clays or precipitates finally the scale of application of this sensor is currently too large for it to be efficient in the detection of clogging in drip irrigation as mentioned for the electrical sensors it would be necessary to investigate the influence of the sensing surface material on the irrigation equipment nevertheless since mechatronic sensors have not been widely used in water environments this type of study might encourage their development and encourage the downscaling of measurements for example 4 3 acoustic detection methods wave sensors are based on the emission of an acoustic wave into the measurement area and the evaluation of its evolution davis and silva 2021 proposed the use of ultrasonic sensors for the detection of biofilms in water pipes these sensors were tested on a 400 mm long 80 mm diameter cylindrical chamber containing water and biofilms or a hydro absorbent polymer the ultrasonic transmitter and receiver sensors were placed on either side of the chamber 400 mm apart according to their results the change in voltage associated with the attenuation of ultrasound by clogging materials allowed for the presence of clogging to be assessed in this way it seemed possible to detect a biofilm from a thickness of 40 µm the voltage variation appears to correlate with the quantity of biofilm and would therefore allow for an assessment of the quantity of biofilm however further results are still required to fully validate this approach and evaluate its relevance for further applications ultrasonic waves have been also used by mizrahi et al 2012 for detecting calcium carbonate precipitates inside reverse osmosis desalination equipment in their approach the ultrasonic sensors would generate a wave that would reflect on a membrane this wave would then be recovered in order to assess the presence of calcium carbonate precipitates on the membrane surface tests were carried out in a 770 mm by 20 mm rectangular reverse osmosis desalination cell supplied with an aqueous solution containing calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate each sensor covered a membrane area of approximately 8 mm² they observed a significant reduction in the amplitude of the reflected wave when calcium carbonate precipitates with a diameter of 20 µm were present these precipitates were detected before they affected the operation of the plant and the use of ultrasonic sensors successfully controlled the cleaning operations in these two studies the use of ultrasonic sensors seems promising for the detection of biological and chemical clogging materials however since each approach focuses on a particular material it is impossible to assess whether these sensors can discriminate the nature of the clogging materials nevertheless despite the fact that the size of the equipment and the measurement areas are too large for drip clogging this method can be installed outside the system and thus offer an in situ and non intrusive measurement to be evaluated this noteworthy aspect would require further testing on installations more similar to drip irrigation 4 4 optical detection methods optical sensors generally use light waves in the ultraviolet uv visible and or infrared ir regions for the quantification or identification of elements these sensors usually function in reflection mode i e a light wave is sent to the measurement area and the reflected wave is measured optical sensors have been widely applied to the study of biofilms fischer et al 2012 philip chandy et al 2000 strathmann et al 2013 zimmerleiter et al 2020 but also to the study of inorganic compounds mendret et al 2007 petit et al 2021 strathmann et al 2013 for the characterization of biofilms several approaches have been discussed philip chandy et al 2000 used a 1 mm diameter plastic optical fibre made of pmma for biofilm detection inside heat exchangers 5 cm of the fibre constituting the sensing extremity was placed inside a flow cell representing an aqueous heat exchanger a light signal at a wavelength of 660 nm was sent into the fibre and its output intensity was measured thus the intensity variation was associated with the evolution of the refractive index of the water surrounding the fibre thus reflecting the development of the biofilm despite the weak difference in refractive indexes between the water and the biofilm the sensor seems to have been capable of detecting the presence of biofilms with a thickness greater than a few nanometres although this data was not quantified by the authors however the sensor saturated when the biofilm thickness was close to 1 mm this type of measurement could be of interest for solid compounds whose presence could alter the refractive index of water however in the present state the need to integrate the optical fibre into the system as well as its dimensions invalidate its application to drippers fischer et al 2012 used a photomultiplier tube with a diameter of 5 cm and a length of 25 cm as the basis of their sensor this type of tube is equipped with detectors to measure the amount of photons inside it the tube was fitted with uv transparent surfaces to support biofilm growth inside it and optical fibres for emitting a signal at 280 nm towards the biofilm after excitation by this light the biofilm emitted light by fluorescence which was measured by the sensor this equipment allowed for the detection and quantification of biofilms as soon as they appeared with 4000 cells per cm² despite the complexity of this equipment the use of spectrofluorimetry for the detection and quantification of biofilms offers promising perspectives for the study of clogging in drip irrigation optical sensors can also be used at low cost and in small sizes in this sense the work of zimmerleiter et al 2020 proposed the use of near ir spectroscopy for biofilm detection in a system for filling beer cans their approach was based on the use of an ultra compact spectrometer with dimensions of about 2500 mm in height width and depth equipped with an optical fibre with a diameter of 0 22 mm this fibre was placed inside the system so that its tip served as a support for biofilm growth the light signal carried by the fibre ranged between 1550 and 1950 nm this method was able to detect the occurrence of a biofilm on the surface of the fibre tip but its sensitivity has not been quantified by the authors the use of equipment with these dimensions could be adapted to drippers however the potential of this method to detect other materials and to discriminate and quantify clogging needs to be further explored optical sensors have also been used for the detection and quantification of inorganic materials mendret et al 2007 used a 635 nm laser source and a charge coupled device ccd camera to quantify clogging in membrane filtration to test this method a transparent plexiglass membrane filtration cell was fed with water containing clays the laser was emitted through the cell wall to reach the surface of the membrane over a 2 mm wide area the camera recorded the reflected signal and the evolution of its intensity was used to determine the thickness of the clogging according to these tests this method could be used to determine the thickness of a clog composed of clay from 10 µm to 80 µm in thickness this method therefore allows for the detection and quantification of physical clogging however it needs to be evaluated in order to assess whether it could allow for the quantification of different natures of clogging or for the discrimination between types of clogging in addition the measurement scale is still too high to be used on drippers petit et al 2021 also used optical measurements for the quantification and discrimination of inorganic materials a light source ranging between 700 and 2200 nm and forming a measuring spot with a diameter of 2 mm was used the authors set up samples successively containing inorganic material two types of clay sand and calcium carbonate precipitate and water with a total thickness of 1 mm these samples represented a clogging deposit in a dripper with dimensions and materials similar to a real one these samples were placed in open glass cups for measurement the tests results pointed out that according to the spectrum reflected by the samples it was possible to identify the material constituting the sample with an accuracy of about 97 and to estimate its thickness with an uncertainty of about 150 µm the uncertainties in the thickness measurement are high compared to the other types of measurements presented but the ability to discriminate the clogging material remains a significant advantage for managing maintenance operations here the size of the measurement area was too large compared to the dimensions of a dripper channel and the approach has not been tested on real drippers furthermore as biological clogging was not addressed in this work further tests on this type of clogging are still required to validate the approach finally strathmann et al 2013 used an optical sensor coupling absorption spectroscopy and fluorimetry to study physical chemical and biological clogging designed to detect all types of clogging in process systems this sensor involves an optical fibre that sends a signal at 290 340 and 810 nm for fluorimetry and scattering measurements the light passes through a transparent window in the pipe passes through the pipe and is reflected by a mirror on one hand the fluorimetric measurement detects the presence of biofilm with more than 105 cells per cm² the evolution of the signal as a function of thickness seems to have encouraged the use of this sensor in quantifying biological clogging on the other hand the scattering measurements allowed for the detection of clays calcium carbonate precipitates or corrosion particles from a thickness of 10 µm also in this case quantification seems possible the differentiation between biological and inorganic materials was ensured in the case where only one type of clogging was present but not if there were mixtures it seems that differentiation between the different inorganic materials can be possible with this sensor but further testing is still required finally the dimensions of the equipment have not been precisely detailed in this work however the sensor appeared to be of the order of 10 cm in diameter and required an adapted installation to carry out these measurements for a more varied use adapted to drip irrigation a reduction and adaptation of the equipment is necessary optical methods therefore represent a particularly promising technology and are the only methods in the sensor format presented in this paper that showed potential to detect quantify and discriminate all clogging materials however they have a major drawback according to the wavelengths used it would be necessary for the system to have a transparent wall or for fibres to be implanted in order to emit and detect light signals in the context of an application to drip irrigation clogging this aspect should be the subject of adaptation work for these methods to be fully relevant with the usual equipment 5 conclusions clogging is a major constraint for the performance of the drip irrigation technique it is a doubly complex problem indeed clogging can be physical chemical and or biological in nature while it occurs inside the dripper channels which have a cross section of the order of 1 mm² the variety of elements to be measured and the scale are significant constraints that have prevented any current method from offering the possibility of detecting quantifying and qualifying the nature of clogging in small scaled drip irrigation emitters this article first provides an overview of the methods used in the laboratory and in the field in order to understand the mechanisms of clogging and to develop means of control most of the articles published on the issue of clogging in drip irrigation focus either on a laboratory approach or on an evaluation of the efficiency of irrigation in the field based on monitoring of discharges or head losses laboratory methods have allowed for better identification of the clogging materials of the predominant clogging zones within the drippers and for the observation of coupling between clogging types however these methods are not adapted to on site measurements mainly due to the complexity and cost of the equipment as for the field methods based on the evaluation of the flow rate of the drippers they constitute excellent means to evaluate the global functioning of an irrigation system but do not allow for a direct measurement of clogging in this case the first stages of clogging development are usually not detected and the management of maintenance operations cannot be optimal secondly this article proposes a few perspectives for the in situ detection of clogging without any necessary destruction of drippers on the field focusing on the parameters of interest related to clogging types and scaling constraints several methods were analysed in this paper electrical sensors although intrusive appear to have a potential for detecting clogging in addition to their very small equipment sizes mechatronic sensors have been relatively unexplored but represent a promising alternative acoustic sensors boast the possibilities of measurement without any intrusion their installation could be adapted to existing equipment already installed in the field finally optical sensors offer a wide range of applications and seem to be able to provide quantitative and qualitative measurements of all materials of interest the use of optical fibres with reduced dimensions could allow them to be adapted for drip irrigation without requiring transparent walls on the equipment many avenues of development therefore exist and could in the long term offer technical and practical solutions for monitoring clogging in drip irrigation declaration

9360,clogging is one of the main ageing factors in drip irrigation clogging can be physical chemical or biological the adequate maintenance procedures to be applied differ according to the type of clogging involved it is therefore noteworthy to first determine the nature and amount of clogging in the field before managing maintenance operations laboratory based methods can help to understand the clogging mechanisms however these methods require either the extraction of samples and thus the destruction of drippers or a specific installation such as transparent flow cells to observe clogging in the field several methods based on hydraulic measurements can estimate the presence of clogging however they provide an indirect estimation and do not necessarily reflect the early stages of clogging there is currently no direct method for detecting clogging in the field in the drippers the difficulty arises both from the variety of clogging materials to be detected and from the small section of the dripper channels of the order of 1 mm² this review analyses the pros and cons of several types of sensors electrical mechatronic acoustic and optical that offer potential perspectives to meet this need keywords lab scale measurement in situ measurement in field measurment sensors data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction irrigation systems are structures that ensure the supply of water to a crop many irrigation techniques are employed around the world but drip irrigation is becoming increasing popular for irrigating crops drip irrigation allow for irrigation efficiency up to 90 camp et al 2000 since the amount of water delivered to the plant is optimised it allows for high irrigation uniformity makes water saving practices easier to operate and can encourage fertigation supply of fertilizer in solution to the irrigation water or the use of non conventional water resources e g reclaimed wastewater saline brackish water as it limits contact between the irrigation water and the crop lamm et al 2006 drippers can be subject to a flow pressure law non pressure compensated or npc drippers or can provide a fixed flow rate regardless of the pressure imposed pressure compensated or pc drippers thanks to the addition of an elastomer membrane the drippers can provide flow rates between 0 5 and 4 l h 1 depending on the type of dripper chosen however drip irrigation is prone to clogging in particular the channel inside drippers that regulate the irrigation flow this channel is usually narrow with a water flow cross section of the order of a square millimetre adin and sacks 1991 lequette et al 2020 and forms a labyrinth that causes a turbulent flow regime to develop al muhammad et al 2019 on one hand this allows for the water pressure to be dissipated and the desired flow rate to be achieved at the dripper outlet on the other hand this geometry creates a flow consisting of a high velocity main flow and vortex zones in the corners of the channel the size of the channel and the existence of these vortex zones make the drippers susceptible to clogging ait mouheb et al 2019 lequette et al 2020 clogging can alter the irrigation rate and thus decrease both the efficiency and uniformity of the irrigation system lamm et al 2006 niu et al 2013 thus representing a bottleneck in the durability of drip irrigation system performance adin and sacks 1991 three major types of clogging can be distinguished physical chemical and biological adin and sacks 1991 bucks et al 1979 each major type of clogging may be caused by specific elements and has therefore different mechanisms of formation such as deposit or attachment and potential effects on the flow rate clogging is conditioned by the quality of the irrigation water the different quality parameters of irrigation water that are important for limiting clogging phenomena have been identified and associated thresholds have been determined to assess the risk of induced clogging ayers and westcot 1989 nakayama and bucks 1981 pitts et al 1990 physical clogging is mainly affected by the amount of particles suspended in the water as well as their size niu et al 2013 oliveira et al 2017 and can occur across a wide range of water sources e g surface water groundwater reclaimed water despite the usual presence of upstream filtration particles smaller than 110 µm in diameter can still be found in the drippers these particles can be categorized according to their diameter fine sands diameter between 200 µm and 50 µm silts 50 2 µm and clays 2 µm since the particle size directly influences their behaviour some particles are more likely to clog than others according to the work of oliveira et al 2020 clays can be trapped in the drippers without any effect on the flow rate providing they stay dispersed however the work of bounoua et al 2016 suggested the formation of aggregates including clay but not only could occur with a strong clogging power when the water contained sodium aluminium and calcium salts results provided by niu et al 2013 pointed out that the diameter of particles with the highest clogging potential ranges between 31 and 38 µm in addition the concentration in particles can also affect the risk of clogging niu et al 2013 oliveira et al 2017 chemical clogging results from the precipitation of elements in solution in the irrigation water and therefore depends mainly on the ph and conductivity of the water hills et al 1989 rizk et al 2017 zhangzhong et al 2019 a ph superior to 8 and or a conductivity superior to 3 0 ds cm 1 as well as a temperature above 55 c and a low partial pressure in co2 all tend to raise the risk of chemical clogging bucks et al 1979 rizk et al 2017 several chemical elements can cause this phenomenon including calcium magnesium carbonates phosphates or iron rizk et al 2017 however the most frequent cause for clogging is calcium carbonate precipitate hills et al 1989 rizk et al 2017 the formation of precipitates creates a deposit that evolves and can even modify the water flow area inducing a variation in the dripper discharge rate biological clogging is associated with the development of biofilms inside the drippers the appearance of biofilms is favoured by the presence of bacteria in the irrigation water average risk from 10 000 ppm and the presence of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus which feed the bacteria bucks et al 1979 flemming et al 2007 after attachment of the bacteria to the dripper walls extracellular polymeric substances are secreted and help to form a biofilm matrix flemming et al 2007 lequette et al 2020 qian et al 2017 yan et al 2009 the structure of the biofilms prevents them from breaking off due to water movement horn et al 2003 biofilm development can lead to a decrease in dripper flow by partially or totally obstructing the water flow zhou et al 2013 the bacterial population of biofilms in drip irrigation can depend on many factors such as the nature of the irrigation water or the types of maintenance protocols used lequette et al 2021 since pathogenic bacteria can be present in a biofilm they can therefore be found at the dripper outlet after detachment causing potential health risks lequette et al 2019 although biological clogging is of particular concern when irrigating with reclaimed wastewater that contains a richer bacterial community and often carry suspended organic matter it can still occur with any type of irrigation water several types of clogging may be jointly present in an irrigation system with couplings that may or may not aggravate the condition of the system chen et al 2003 ramachandrula and kasa 2020 rizk et al 2019 tarchitzky et al 2013 yan et al 2009 tarchitzky et al 2013 observed the presence of clay particles in biofilms within drippers rizk et al 2019 demonstrated that the presence of biofilms could favour the trapping of calcium carbonate precipitates thus revealing the coupling of two types of clogging in contrast results from ramachandrula and kasa 2020 highlighted a decorrelation between the presence of clay deposits and calcium carbonate deposits suggesting an opposition between two types of clogging several interactions between clogging types thus seem possible and are currently rather poorly understood knowledge on the type of clogging involved is essential for the proper management of irrigation systems indeed maintenance operations may differ according to the type of clogging in the case of physical clogging hydraulic flushing operations often coupled with acid injections are most often undertaken bucks et al 1979 puig bargués et al 2010 yu et al 2018 this step consists of increasing the water flow speed within the pipes between 0 3 and 0 6 m s 1 to return the deposited particles to suspension in water for chemical clogging acid injections lead to a decrease in ph which hinders the formation of precipitates and may favour their dispersion hills et al 1989 for biofilms chlorination or oxygen peroxide injection operations are usually carried out to clean the drippers and prevent biofilm development lequette et al 2021 song et al 2017 currently these operations are performed either routinely to prevent clogging or in response to specific operating conditions such as irrigation water quality temperature or ph recent work however has pointed out that the effects of these cleaning operations can have limits the work of yu et al 2018 highlighted the limitations of hydraulic flushing for physical clogging control frequent flushing removes particles with diameters greater than 50 µm but particles smaller than 10 µm require flushing at a higher pressure which should be carried out before irrigation this type of operation could therefore benefit by an adaptation to the size of the particles actually present in the system in the case of chlorination song et al 2017 showed that the choice of chlorination concentrations and duration had variable effects on the bacterial activity responsible for biological clogging however their results also demonstrated that biofilms could remain present independently of the selected chlorination method lequette et al 2021 presented similar results on the use of chlorination coupled with hydraulic flushing while maintenance operations when performed routinely improve the long term efficiency and longevity of the irrigation system they do not ensure the total elimination of clogging the adaptation of maintenance operations according to the nature location and quantity of clogging could allow for more effective maintenance thus knowledge on in situ clogging could help improve the management of maintenance operations and enhance the performance and life span of drip irrigation systems fig 1 illustrates the evolution of the number of publications associated with clogging in drip irrigation since 1980 based on the elsevier scopus database several keywords have been added to identify general trends in the evolution of work on the subject the keyword analysis aims to select studies dealing with clogging analysis the keywords detection sensor sensing and quantification point to studies focusing on in situ observations of clogging since the early 2000 s the study of clogging has gained momentum and even accelerated since 2018 most of this work aims at understanding the mechanisms of different types of clogging in drip irrigation however according to the results presented in fig 1 studies focusing on the detection or quantification of clogging only constitute a minor part of the total research conducted despite the boom since 2018 these issues are not the subject of more than 20 research articles per year representing less than 15 of studies on clogging in drip irrigation this may be due to several factors including on the one hand the practical difficulty of in situ detection of drip irrigation clogging and on the other hand the cost of developing new methods however several methods exist at different scales to study clogging and could offer opportunities to detect clogging directly and thus allow a more accurate management of cost effective maintenance operations the objective of this paper is to review the main methods for clogging analysis in drip irrigation this review begins by detailing several methods used at the laboratory scale to study clogging in drip irrigation it then focuses on some methods used on the field to identify and analyse clogging phenomena finally several technologies and methods applied to sensor design are presented in order to assess their potential for detecting and or identifying clogging directly within drippers and to draw out perspectives 2 lab scale methods for clogging evaluation this chapter aims to present a non exhaustive list of methods for analysing clogging in drip irrigation at laboratory scales these methods have been divided into two categories destructive methods which require the extraction and destruction of the clogging sample and non destructive methods which propose to study the samples without extracting them 2 1 destructive methods for clogging analysis in order to study the mechanisms of clogging and assess its composition or quantity the clogging material can be extracted from the dripper for laboratory investigation on one hand this implies a necessary destruction of the clogged dripper but on the other hand offers noteworthy information table 1 summarises the methods presented in this section before extracting the clogging for further analysis it can be interesting to locate it inside of the drippers for that optical microscopy can be used as it provides a closer look to clogging and take images puig bargués et al 2005 taylor et al 1995 yao et al 2021 however for the location of the clogging to be relevant it is necessary to extract the dripper without damaging it in the case of integrated drippers this operation can be difficult and alter the location or even the nature of the observed clogging by mixing it with the materials constituting the drippers and the pipes moreover this type of observation generally only provides qualitative and not quantitative information on the one hand and does not allow the identification of the nature of the clogging on the other usually a primary step for extracted clogging material analysis involves the identification of the organic and inorganic phases of a clogging sample extracted from drippers using mass measurement before and after combustion rizk et al 2019 tarchitzky et al 2013 this step allows for the presence of mineral compounds associated with physical and chemical clogging to be assessed and the proportion of these compounds relative to the total sample mass can thus be evaluated tarchitzky et al 2013 coupled this process with infrared spectroscopy measurements to correlate the amount of organic and inorganic material with absorption spectra that provide information on the composition of the sample following combustion only a spectral absorption peak associated with clays was observed this method therefore highlighted the existence of two types of clogging that had occurred simultaneously thus showing a potential for clogging type discrimination to analyse the nature of clogging on solid samples several studies have employed x ray diffractometry xrd to determine the crystalline structure of the sample benlouali et al 2021 li et al 2019 muhammad et al 2021 oliveira et al 2020 ramachandrula and kasa 2020 rizk et al 2017 yao et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 thanks to this method the presence of crystalline compounds such as calcium carbonate precipitates and can be assessed based on their crystalline structure in order to understand their formation mechanisms like precipitation or deposition in this way rizk 2017 was able to demonstrate the presence of calcium carbonate precipitates within dehydrated biofilm samples developed in a taylor couette reactor using treated wastewater the presence of two types of clogging was observed in conditions of shear stress close to that observed in drip irrigation this work also allowed for the crystallization structure of calcium carbonate precipitates to be identified the other study mentioned used xrd on samples extracted from clogged drippers where the type of clays present in the clogging oliveira et al 2020 could be identified and where the joint presence of clays and calcium carbonate could be observed in the samples ramachandrula and kasa 2020 yao et al 2021 thus indicating a coupling between physical and chemical clogging in addition the use of the rietveld refinement method on the xrd results seems to provide more detailed information on the composition of the sample zhang et al 2020 consequently this method could be employed to determine the composition of solid crystalline samples and to deduce the presence of chemical precipitates and or clays that are responsible for clogging despite its performance for discrimination and its frequent application for irrigation clogging analysis xrd requires a minimum mass of the order of 10 g of extracted and dried samples bunaciu et al 2015 that can limit its application another commonly used method for the analysis of solid compounds is scanning electron microscopy sem sem can allow for the dried sample to be observed directly and for its size and component layout to be assessed thanks to sem ribeiro et al 2018 could observe and quantify biofilms within drippers and correlate their presence with operating conditions several studies have coupled sem with xrd in order to retrieve a global view of the clogging material benlouali et al 2021 ribeiro et al 2018 tarchitzky et al 2013 yao et al 2021 on the one hand this approach allows for the proportion of each solid identified in the sample to be evaluated on another hand information on the clogging mechanisms can be obtained from the arrangement of the sample despite promising sem observations the requirement for dry samples and the heaviness of the equipment make this technology unsuitable for on field measurements for the analysis of biofilms and of bacterial activity in particular essentially two parameters are monitored oliver et al 2014 yan et al 2009 yao and habimana 2019 firstly phospholipidic fatty acids plfas one of the main constituents of bacterial cell membranes are used as indicators to qualify and quantify the presence of biofilms secondly extracellular polymeric substances epss produced by bacteria to form biofilms can also be measured as indicators of biofilm formation these two parameters are most commonly monitored for identifying and quantifying the presence of biofilms however the methodology requires the extraction of biofilm samples thus implying an isolated and destructive measurement oliver et al 2014 yan et al 2009 the study of biofilms and bacterial communities can be further developed indeed oliver et al 2014 and lequette et al 2019 worked on additional sequencing steps allowing for the different types of bacteria and thus for health risks in particular to be assessed these methods are therefore efficient for the analysis of clogging related elements and have been widely used for the study of clogging in drip irrigation the results thus obtained have made it possible to locate clogging inside of the dripper to determine and quantify the composition of certain types of clogging to highlight the coupling between the various clogging materials and to help understanding clogging formation mechanisms however these methods all share the drawback of requiring extracted and often dried samples as mentioned earlier the extraction of drippers and thus clogging samples can be difficult and can lead to incorrect information if the sample is damaged they are therefore unsuitable for direct monitoring of clogging within the drippers in an open field installation 2 2 non destructive methods for clogging analysis several non destructive methods mainly based on optical measurements have been applied in the laboratory to characterize clogging in drip irrigation the methods discussed in this section are summarized in table 2 optical microscopy was employed by ait mouheb et al 2019 and oliveira et al 2020 to locate physical clogging inside dripper shaped flow cells equipped with a transparent glass wall in these studies the areas that were most susceptible to clogging within dripper channels were located these results were obtained with clays and biofilms covering two types of clogging directly inside the flow cell systems ribeiro et al 2018 used optical microscopy on biological samples collected from irrigation water some bacteria could be identified however this required the extraction of the samples optical microscopy can therefore allow for direct observations of clogging under certain conditions the nature of the clogging can also be identified but this remains limited to visual observations clogging within the drippers seems difficult to accurately quantify and discriminate with this method since the provided information consists in images that are subject to interpretation one of the favourite methods for studying and quantifying biofilms in situ is optical coherence tomography oct horn et al 2003 oct provides a three dimensional view of a sample and allows for questions of volume porosity and composition to be addressed on biological samples wagner and horn 2017 this method has therefore been applied in drip irrigation mainly for the characterization of biological clogging lequette et al 2020 qian et al 2017 qian et al 2017 and lequette et al 2020 used oct to characterise biofilm development in drippers equipped with a transparent wall and functioning with treated wastewater they were able to measure the clogging thickness and to visualize its location inside a dripper channel with a transparent wall by coupling these two parameters the percentage of volume covered by biofilm in the dripper channel could be estimated petit et al 2021 used oct in a simplified context representing drippers clogged with clays sand and calcium carbonate the thickness of the clogging layer was measured thus extending the use of oct to non organic materials however due to the opacity of materials such as clays or calcium carbonate at the working wavelength of oct it remains impossible to detect the porosity of the sample or the presence of other elements in this type of clogging recently zhou et al 2021 used 3d industrial computed tomography 3d ict to directly characterize biofilms in a dripper this method uses x ray radiation for viewing the inside and outside of an object in this study a three dimensional representation of the clogging was obtained through the non transparent dripper walls a marking agent was used in order to distinguish the biofilm from the water and the walls of the dripper since it is a new element within the system the presence of a marking agent can alter the composition and growth of biofilms in some cases or even change the clogging mechanisms however biofilm thickness can be measured with this method and the clogged areas can be identified the use of a marking agent for identifying the clogging material works well with biofilms but it is still unclear whether it would work with inorganic materials non destructive imaging methods are of particular interest to assess the localization of clogging in drippers however it is almost always necessary to have a transparent wall to acquire the images oct and 3d ict are methods with a great potential for monitoring biological clogging at laboratory scales oct provides access to fine quantification data while 3d ict does not even require a transparent wall nevertheless these laboratory methods are not adapted to field measurements since they are still too expensive and equipment heavy the methods used at laboratory scales provide a large amount of information on the composition or quantity of clogging destructive methods can be applied to extracted material which may originate from the equipment itself these methods can be used for assessing the amount of clogging extracted and its composition non destructive methods usually allow for the study of clogging in a context where measurements are made easier but where the reality of drip irrigation is not systematically reflected however these methods also allow for the clogging to be located or to be monitored although this information is essential for understanding the mechanisms of clogging in drip irrigation it cannot be generally obtained on real field equipment using these current methods on field measurements would provide concrete information on real installations and thus contribute to the management of maintenance operations the following chapter focusses on the direct assessment of clogging in the field with a description of the potentially interesting methods for this purpose 3 on field methods for clogging evaluation this chapter focuses on several methods used in the field to assess clogging phenomena the first section presents evaluations of clogging in the field based on measurements of dripper output the second section focuses on methods for detecting malfunctions in irrigation equipment that may be due to clogging 3 1 discharge monitoring as explained earlier clogging in drip irrigation becomes an issue when it affects the flow rate of the drippers and the uniformity of the irrigation it is therefore natural that in practice the evaluation of clogging is mainly performed by discharge monitoring oliveira et al 2017 pereira et al 2020 ravina et al 1992 1992 flow measurement is usually carried out by measuring a volume of water leaving one or several drippers during a given time several indicators can be calculated using the flow measurement firstly the flow measurement and the calculation of the relative flow rate dra li et al 2015 reveal the evolution of the flow rate on a given dripper and thus possible problems can be detected secondly the uniformity of irrigation can be evaluated by measuring the flow rate on several drippers and by calculating indicators such as the christiansen uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1942 or the emission uniformity eu keller and karmeli 1974 thanks to these indicators the overall operating status of an irrigation system can be assessed they can also contribute to guide maintenance operations or plan the renewal of equipment however to calculate these indicators the flow rate is usually measured on a certain number of drippers of the order of 15 30 drippers spread over the whole installation as a result clogging may not be detected during the measurement if none of the selected drippers is affected and these indicators may have very low uniformity values if few tested drippers are clogged in addition the flow and uniformity values to be used as a trigger for cleaning operations or equipment replacement have never been clearly defined these indicators are therefore not fully effective in detecting and combating clogging solutions integrating sensors over the entire field such as proposed by klein et al 2018 could offer an interesting alternative to flow measurement standardized laboratory tests are also usually carried out to assess the sensitivity to clogging of different types of drippers and drip irrigation lines bodole et al 2016 koech et al 2015 pereira et al 2020 these tests consist of running drip irrigation lines with water loaded with solid particles different irrigation schedules and different particle sizes and concentrations are usually tested to test the resistance of the system to conditions highly conducive to clogging for more details about the test procedures see koech et al 2015 new protocols are regularly proposed for the monitoring of clogging based on flow monitoring for example camargo et al 2014 proposed a coupling between flow measurement and head loss measurement in pipes to precisely estimate the degree of clogging and its location in one lateral however this specific protocol has never been applied in the field to assess the real operating conditions of the irrigation system mainly because of the cost of pressure transducer used monitoring dripper discharge can be time consuming and cannot always be applied for example in the case of underground drip systems flow measurements can also be provided by automated instrumentation thus limiting the workload in practice flowmeters can be placed in the field to provide this data camargo et al 2014 ravina et al 1992 different types of sensors exist to perform flow measurements e g turbine flowmeters electromagnetic ultrasonic kolmetz et al 2007 however as these sensors are usually installed on the pipes and not on the drippers themselves the influence of clogging within the drippers is more difficult even impossible to detect from the flow within the pipe measurements at a millimetre scale as in drippers are therefore an issue with these sensors moreover because the price of this type of equipment does not allow for it to be used on the entire system it is necessary to carefully place the measurement spots across the overall installation pressure monitoring within the pipes can also help to understand the clogging phenomena in the drippers povoa and hills 1994 and camargo et al 2014 tested the use of pressure transducers but concluded that these sensors are too fragile and too expensive to constitute a feasible solution for clogging monitoring in the field the use of pressure sensors could limit the total cost of the equipment but these low cost sensors have a lower sensitivity than the pressure transducers used in these studies and may not be able to provide sufficiently fine pressure measurements to allow monitoring of clogging low cost pressure sensor also presents the same shortcoming as flow sensors since they can only be installed on the pipes and not directly on the drippers for scale reasons more recently studies have combined direct and automated flow measurements with iot based management protocols in order to provide precise irrigation control abioye et al 2021 menon 2021 singh and saikia 2016 abioye et al 2021 and singh and saikia 2016 proposed to couple an evaluation of evapotranspiration via meteorological parameters like temperature or wind speed with measurements of soil flow and moisture all measurements were centralized in a program dedicated to the control of irrigation according to the water requirements estimated via evapotranspiration and to the detection of irrigation malfunctions via flowrate and soil moisture measurements however the effectiveness of this type of monitoring still needs to be further explored in addition menon 2021 proposed to monitor the malfunctioning of a drip system by only using a flow rate sensor and a pressure sensor located immediately after the pumping system the results are promising and have allowed for maintenance operations to be piloted however for a more thorough analysis further data is still required the advantage of iot based systems is that they offer both irrigation and maintenance control solutions while using low cost equipment flow and pressure monitoring provide significant information for assessing the overall functioning of the irrigation system and for estimating its efficiency however this type of monitoring does not allow for the nature of the flow variation to be identified in practice a variation in flowrate is not only caused by clogging but also by technical issues or ageing of the irrigation system and may not be fully assessed when using standard protocols for irrigation flow and uniformity evaluation in addition several laboratory studies have pointed out that in the first instance clogging usually occurs without any change in flowrate lequette et al 2020 oliveira et al 2020 in such cases cleaning operations would not be initiated due to the undetected presence of clogging flow and pressure monitoring therefore represent an incomplete approach for early clogging detection and evaluation nevertheless the use of flow and pressure monitoring to locate problem areas holds promises for the development and placement of new methods on a field installation 3 2 in situ detection of drip irrigation malfunctions many solutions for automated irrigation scheduling and monitoring exist on the market romero et al 2012 reviewed these methods according to how they work among these methods some involve the measurement of the amount of water in the soil in order to evaluate the quality of the irrigation the use of tensiometres or soil moisture sensors is widespread and allows for over or under irrigation to be avoided by optimal control this type of approach can also be considered to detect variations in the functioning of the irrigation on condition that there are a sufficient number of sensors the detection of an under irrigated area can thus contribute to identify a malfunction in the irrigation system and in particular the clogging of drippers nevertheless such methods require high maintenance costs and are rather reserved for research questions instead of practical use dag et al 2015 highlighted the use of thermal remote sensing to detect drip irrigation malfunctions this study focused on leakage detection but the results presented could also contribute to identify the presence of clogging by detecting an increase in soil temperature wang et al 2021 used ground penetrating radar data to assess the volume of the wet bulb under drip irrigation when the functioning of one or more drippers is altered by the presence of clogging a variation can be observed in the dimensions of this wet zone thanks to these methods it would be possible to assess the variations in the quantity of water supplied to the soil either by using inexpensive sensors e g tensiometres soil moisture sensors installed in large numbers in order to retrieve overall information or by performing a global measurement over a large area temperature measurement radar however due to the nature of the measurements carried out they share the same drawbacks as flow measurement methods for the characterization of clogging in drip irrigation the methods currently used in the field are noteworthy they allow for the efficient detection of problems in the irrigation system and thus prevent their repercussions on the crop however in the specific case of clogged drippers these methods remain insufficient indeed they do not detect the clogging early enough before it can have an influence on the flow rate as mentioned earlier and they do not provide information on the nature of the clogging with these methods the management of maintenance operations can be carried out when a problem is detected but they cannot be directly optimised according to the presence and nature of clogging as a result there is currently no method in the field of irrigation that seems suitable for early in situ detection and analysis of dripper clogging the following section provides examples of methods used in contexts other than irrigation that might fill this gap and offer new perspectives 4 sensor scale detection methods of interest an in situ measurement in the field would allow for the detection and observation of clogging in real time conditions the clogging would therefore be detected before it could affect the flow rate and thus an optimal maintenance of the equipment could be performed this chapter aims to explore the range of in situ methods that can be applied to the detection of clogging in drip irrigation these methods were selected according to three criteria 1 they can be used for the detection and or quantification of materials associated with clogging in drip irrigation cf section i 2 they can offer a non destructive and in situ measurement 3 their detection area can reach a scale small enough to consider their application inside dripper channels the methods in this non exhaustive list are presented as examples they have been sorted into three categories according to the type of measurement performed and are summarized in table 3 table 3 overview of the sensor scale methods of interest retained for drip irrigation clogging in situ and non destructive measurement 4 1 electrochemical detection methods electronic sensors measure the evolution of electrical parameters e g potential impedance relative to the formation of a deposit on a detection surface in particular this type of sensor is used in the detection of biofilms in various contexts such as water or food industry mollica and cristiani 2018 paredes et al 2014 pavanello et al 2011 turolla et al 2019 yang and bashir 2008 pavanello et al 2011 proposed a sensor involving a stainless steel surface where biofilm growth induces a change in the electrical potential the detection zone was a circle with a diameter of about 2 cm on which the biofilm must grow to be detected detection was ensured above 1 coverage of the detection area which represents a deposit of about 3 mm² this sensor was tested by the authors in a seawater tank and in a desalination plant as a result the sensor does effectively detect the presence of a biofilm and acts as an indicator for controlling chlorination cleaning operations the sensor also appeared to be capable of differentiating between biological and inorganic deposits although there was no result to support this assertion in the study for drip irrigation the size of this type of sensor and its sensitivity are not suitable for measurements inside the drippers nevertheless if downscaling of the equipment can be possible the method would become of interest for monitoring biological clogging turolla et al 2019 proposed an impedance sensor that can detect biofilm growth and calcium carbonate deposits on gold electrodes the sensor consists of several pairs of electrodes with a width and spacing of 10 µm the minimum detection area therefore covered a width of 30 µm with a length of 2000 mm and a height of 0 7 mm the presence of biofilm or calcium carbonate deposits on the electrodes resulted in a change in impedance which led to the detection and identification of the nature of the deposit this sensor was tested in a reactor under favourable conditions for the development of a biofilm and deposition of calcium carbonate precipitates the sensor had a detection threshold of the order of 2 µm in thickness of clogging material and could differentiate between the two types of materials tested the measurement scale of the sensor therefore seems relevant for the evaluation of chemical and or biological clogging in drippers furthermore the authors envisage prospects for reducing detection thresholds and equipment size these approaches are noteworthy and could offer solutions for in situ and non destructive clogging detection in drip irrigation however it is not known whether materials associated with physical clogging such as clays or silt could be detected using electronic sensors in addition both methods require the development of fouling on metallic surfaces stainless steel or gold therefore the intrusiveness of this type of material in drippers will still need to be tested to ensure that the presence of the sensor does not alter the normal dripper operation indeed dripper walls are usually composed of polyethylene or pmma the major interest is that the scale at which these methods are applied can be reduced their potential to detect distinguish and quantify clogging materials found in drip irrigation gives them a promising perspective that could be further explored through laboratory and on field trials 4 2 mechanical detection methods mechatronic sensors convert mechanical motion data into an electrical signal by doing so variations in motion can be detected and associated with the parameter to be monitored pereira et al 2008 used a mechatronic sensor to monitor the contamination of a surface by bacterial growth or particle deposition this sensor comprises a pvc plate length 210 mm width 80 mm thickness 1 mm on which the clogging takes place the plate is equipped with two piezoelectric actuators spaced 60 mm apart the first one sends a vibratory movement to the plate while the second one measures the propagation of the vibration the evolution of the vibration between the two actuators makes it possible to determine whether the plate is covered with clogging material or not sensor operation was tested in a flow cell with an internal diameter of 30 mm and a length of 1200 mm fed with water containing bacteria and silica particles the normalized amplitude of the vibration was the parameter indicating the presence of deposits the authors observed an evolution of the amplitude that was proportional to the amount of deposit on the sensor moreover the amplitude evolution coefficient was different for biofilm and silica the two type of clogging studied these results support the capacity of this sensor to discriminate between the two types of clogging and to quantify them however the minimum clogging masses measured in this work were about 20 mg cm 2 and 45 mg cm 2 for biofilms and silica respectively it is therefore impossible to assess the true performance of the sensor on lower masses moreover this approach discriminates materials according to their viscosity and thus may not be capable of discriminating between solid materials clays or precipitates finally the scale of application of this sensor is currently too large for it to be efficient in the detection of clogging in drip irrigation as mentioned for the electrical sensors it would be necessary to investigate the influence of the sensing surface material on the irrigation equipment nevertheless since mechatronic sensors have not been widely used in water environments this type of study might encourage their development and encourage the downscaling of measurements for example 4 3 acoustic detection methods wave sensors are based on the emission of an acoustic wave into the measurement area and the evaluation of its evolution davis and silva 2021 proposed the use of ultrasonic sensors for the detection of biofilms in water pipes these sensors were tested on a 400 mm long 80 mm diameter cylindrical chamber containing water and biofilms or a hydro absorbent polymer the ultrasonic transmitter and receiver sensors were placed on either side of the chamber 400 mm apart according to their results the change in voltage associated with the attenuation of ultrasound by clogging materials allowed for the presence of clogging to be assessed in this way it seemed possible to detect a biofilm from a thickness of 40 µm the voltage variation appears to correlate with the quantity of biofilm and would therefore allow for an assessment of the quantity of biofilm however further results are still required to fully validate this approach and evaluate its relevance for further applications ultrasonic waves have been also used by mizrahi et al 2012 for detecting calcium carbonate precipitates inside reverse osmosis desalination equipment in their approach the ultrasonic sensors would generate a wave that would reflect on a membrane this wave would then be recovered in order to assess the presence of calcium carbonate precipitates on the membrane surface tests were carried out in a 770 mm by 20 mm rectangular reverse osmosis desalination cell supplied with an aqueous solution containing calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate each sensor covered a membrane area of approximately 8 mm² they observed a significant reduction in the amplitude of the reflected wave when calcium carbonate precipitates with a diameter of 20 µm were present these precipitates were detected before they affected the operation of the plant and the use of ultrasonic sensors successfully controlled the cleaning operations in these two studies the use of ultrasonic sensors seems promising for the detection of biological and chemical clogging materials however since each approach focuses on a particular material it is impossible to assess whether these sensors can discriminate the nature of the clogging materials nevertheless despite the fact that the size of the equipment and the measurement areas are too large for drip clogging this method can be installed outside the system and thus offer an in situ and non intrusive measurement to be evaluated this noteworthy aspect would require further testing on installations more similar to drip irrigation 4 4 optical detection methods optical sensors generally use light waves in the ultraviolet uv visible and or infrared ir regions for the quantification or identification of elements these sensors usually function in reflection mode i e a light wave is sent to the measurement area and the reflected wave is measured optical sensors have been widely applied to the study of biofilms fischer et al 2012 philip chandy et al 2000 strathmann et al 2013 zimmerleiter et al 2020 but also to the study of inorganic compounds mendret et al 2007 petit et al 2021 strathmann et al 2013 for the characterization of biofilms several approaches have been discussed philip chandy et al 2000 used a 1 mm diameter plastic optical fibre made of pmma for biofilm detection inside heat exchangers 5 cm of the fibre constituting the sensing extremity was placed inside a flow cell representing an aqueous heat exchanger a light signal at a wavelength of 660 nm was sent into the fibre and its output intensity was measured thus the intensity variation was associated with the evolution of the refractive index of the water surrounding the fibre thus reflecting the development of the biofilm despite the weak difference in refractive indexes between the water and the biofilm the sensor seems to have been capable of detecting the presence of biofilms with a thickness greater than a few nanometres although this data was not quantified by the authors however the sensor saturated when the biofilm thickness was close to 1 mm this type of measurement could be of interest for solid compounds whose presence could alter the refractive index of water however in the present state the need to integrate the optical fibre into the system as well as its dimensions invalidate its application to drippers fischer et al 2012 used a photomultiplier tube with a diameter of 5 cm and a length of 25 cm as the basis of their sensor this type of tube is equipped with detectors to measure the amount of photons inside it the tube was fitted with uv transparent surfaces to support biofilm growth inside it and optical fibres for emitting a signal at 280 nm towards the biofilm after excitation by this light the biofilm emitted light by fluorescence which was measured by the sensor this equipment allowed for the detection and quantification of biofilms as soon as they appeared with 4000 cells per cm² despite the complexity of this equipment the use of spectrofluorimetry for the detection and quantification of biofilms offers promising perspectives for the study of clogging in drip irrigation optical sensors can also be used at low cost and in small sizes in this sense the work of zimmerleiter et al 2020 proposed the use of near ir spectroscopy for biofilm detection in a system for filling beer cans their approach was based on the use of an ultra compact spectrometer with dimensions of about 2500 mm in height width and depth equipped with an optical fibre with a diameter of 0 22 mm this fibre was placed inside the system so that its tip served as a support for biofilm growth the light signal carried by the fibre ranged between 1550 and 1950 nm this method was able to detect the occurrence of a biofilm on the surface of the fibre tip but its sensitivity has not been quantified by the authors the use of equipment with these dimensions could be adapted to drippers however the potential of this method to detect other materials and to discriminate and quantify clogging needs to be further explored optical sensors have also been used for the detection and quantification of inorganic materials mendret et al 2007 used a 635 nm laser source and a charge coupled device ccd camera to quantify clogging in membrane filtration to test this method a transparent plexiglass membrane filtration cell was fed with water containing clays the laser was emitted through the cell wall to reach the surface of the membrane over a 2 mm wide area the camera recorded the reflected signal and the evolution of its intensity was used to determine the thickness of the clogging according to these tests this method could be used to determine the thickness of a clog composed of clay from 10 µm to 80 µm in thickness this method therefore allows for the detection and quantification of physical clogging however it needs to be evaluated in order to assess whether it could allow for the quantification of different natures of clogging or for the discrimination between types of clogging in addition the measurement scale is still too high to be used on drippers petit et al 2021 also used optical measurements for the quantification and discrimination of inorganic materials a light source ranging between 700 and 2200 nm and forming a measuring spot with a diameter of 2 mm was used the authors set up samples successively containing inorganic material two types of clay sand and calcium carbonate precipitate and water with a total thickness of 1 mm these samples represented a clogging deposit in a dripper with dimensions and materials similar to a real one these samples were placed in open glass cups for measurement the tests results pointed out that according to the spectrum reflected by the samples it was possible to identify the material constituting the sample with an accuracy of about 97 and to estimate its thickness with an uncertainty of about 150 µm the uncertainties in the thickness measurement are high compared to the other types of measurements presented but the ability to discriminate the clogging material remains a significant advantage for managing maintenance operations here the size of the measurement area was too large compared to the dimensions of a dripper channel and the approach has not been tested on real drippers furthermore as biological clogging was not addressed in this work further tests on this type of clogging are still required to validate the approach finally strathmann et al 2013 used an optical sensor coupling absorption spectroscopy and fluorimetry to study physical chemical and biological clogging designed to detect all types of clogging in process systems this sensor involves an optical fibre that sends a signal at 290 340 and 810 nm for fluorimetry and scattering measurements the light passes through a transparent window in the pipe passes through the pipe and is reflected by a mirror on one hand the fluorimetric measurement detects the presence of biofilm with more than 105 cells per cm² the evolution of the signal as a function of thickness seems to have encouraged the use of this sensor in quantifying biological clogging on the other hand the scattering measurements allowed for the detection of clays calcium carbonate precipitates or corrosion particles from a thickness of 10 µm also in this case quantification seems possible the differentiation between biological and inorganic materials was ensured in the case where only one type of clogging was present but not if there were mixtures it seems that differentiation between the different inorganic materials can be possible with this sensor but further testing is still required finally the dimensions of the equipment have not been precisely detailed in this work however the sensor appeared to be of the order of 10 cm in diameter and required an adapted installation to carry out these measurements for a more varied use adapted to drip irrigation a reduction and adaptation of the equipment is necessary optical methods therefore represent a particularly promising technology and are the only methods in the sensor format presented in this paper that showed potential to detect quantify and discriminate all clogging materials however they have a major drawback according to the wavelengths used it would be necessary for the system to have a transparent wall or for fibres to be implanted in order to emit and detect light signals in the context of an application to drip irrigation clogging this aspect should be the subject of adaptation work for these methods to be fully relevant with the usual equipment 5 conclusions clogging is a major constraint for the performance of the drip irrigation technique it is a doubly complex problem indeed clogging can be physical chemical and or biological in nature while it occurs inside the dripper channels which have a cross section of the order of 1 mm² the variety of elements to be measured and the scale are significant constraints that have prevented any current method from offering the possibility of detecting quantifying and qualifying the nature of clogging in small scaled drip irrigation emitters this article first provides an overview of the methods used in the laboratory and in the field in order to understand the mechanisms of clogging and to develop means of control most of the articles published on the issue of clogging in drip irrigation focus either on a laboratory approach or on an evaluation of the efficiency of irrigation in the field based on monitoring of discharges or head losses laboratory methods have allowed for better identification of the clogging materials of the predominant clogging zones within the drippers and for the observation of coupling between clogging types however these methods are not adapted to on site measurements mainly due to the complexity and cost of the equipment as for the field methods based on the evaluation of the flow rate of the drippers they constitute excellent means to evaluate the global functioning of an irrigation system but do not allow for a direct measurement of clogging in this case the first stages of clogging development are usually not detected and the management of maintenance operations cannot be optimal secondly this article proposes a few perspectives for the in situ detection of clogging without any necessary destruction of drippers on the field focusing on the parameters of interest related to clogging types and scaling constraints several methods were analysed in this paper electrical sensors although intrusive appear to have a potential for detecting clogging in addition to their very small equipment sizes mechatronic sensors have been relatively unexplored but represent a promising alternative acoustic sensors boast the possibilities of measurement without any intrusion their installation could be adapted to existing equipment already installed in the field finally optical sensors offer a wide range of applications and seem to be able to provide quantitative and qualitative measurements of all materials of interest the use of optical fibres with reduced dimensions could allow them to be adapted for drip irrigation without requiring transparent walls on the equipment many avenues of development therefore exist and could in the long term offer technical and practical solutions for monitoring clogging in drip irrigation declaration

drip irrigated field skaggs et al 2004 bufon et al 2012 the soil wetted percentage and drip discharge flux are important for the drip irrigation design and management to our knowledge previous studies mainly concentrated on the effects of drip discharge flux or soil wetted percentage on soil water content and crop growth the mechanism of how the soil wetted percentage and drip discharge flux jointly affect soil water distribution and potato growth under drip irrigation with plastic film mulch needs to be explored the purpose of this study was to clarify 1 effects of soil wetted percentage

was caused by the rf of 78 mm on 7 july two days before potato harvest the irrigation amount and number of irrigation mainly depended on the soil wetted percentage table 1 the irrigation amount increased and the irrigation frequency decreased with the soil wetted percentage increasing in 2016 p3 and p4 had 62 and 95 more irrigation amount than p2 and had 2 and 4 less irrigation applications than p2 respectively in 2017 p2 and p3 had 21 and 78 more irrigation amount than p1 and had 6 and 11 less irrigation applications than p1 respectively 3 2 variations of soil matric potential for different drip discharge fluxes with the same soil wetted percentage the soil matric potential in q1p3 was smaller than that in q2p3 and q3p3 at shallow soil depth while it was higher at deep soil depth at the top and the base of the bed in 2016 figs 3 and 5 for example the average daily soil matric potential in q1p3 was 14 89 59 in average and 10 80 32 in average smaller than that in q2p3 and q3p3 at the top of the bed at 10 40 cm soil depth respectively while it was 56 and 20 higher than that in q2p3 and q3p3 at 70 cm soil depth respectively there were 10 5 and 3 days with daily soil matric potential smaller than 25 kpa at the top of the bed at 10 20 and 30 cm soil depths for q1p3 respectively and 2 0 0 days for q2p3 and 10 3 0 days for q3p3 at the same soil depths with q1p3 the ranges of soil matric potential in q1p3 86 to 0 kpa were greater than that in q2p3 27 to 0 kpa and q3p3 47 to 0 kpa especially at 10 and 20 cm soil depths fig 5 the soil matric potential variations at the side of the bed were different with the top and the base of the bed it might was caused by different roughness of the side which affected soil water transport at the side of bed the average daily soil matric potential in q2p3 was 36 and 16 higher than that in q3p3 at 10 cm and 20 cm soil depth respectively while it was 88 smaller than that in q3p3 at 70 cm soil depth it meant that the q1p3 had the driest soil at shallow soil depth and wettest soil at deep soil depth among the tree treatments while the q2p3 had wettest soil at shallow soil depth and driest at deep soil depth for different soil wetted percentages with the same discharge the average daily soil matric potential decreased with the soil wetted percentage increasing except at some points such as 10 and 20 cm soil depths at the base of bed figs 4 and 5 for example the average daily soil matric potential in q1p3 was 11 81 41 in average and 9 59 20 in average smaller than that in q1p1 and q1p2 at the top of the bed at 10 50 cm soil depths respectively the soil matric potential ranges in q1p2 and q1p3 were greater than that in q1p1 except at some points such as 20 cm soil depth at the side and 10 20 cm soil depths at the base of bed moreover the soil matric potential differences between different treatments were smaller at the early and later growth stage and greater in the middle growth stage 3 3 plant height the drip discharge flux significantly affected potato plant height in 2017 except at the early growth stage while no significant differences were found in 2016 p 0 05 in 2017 the potato plant heights in q2 and q3 were 6 9 and 10 7 significantly greater than that in q1 on 26 may respectively p 0 01 fig 6 in both years the soil wetted percentage significantly affected potato plant heights except at the early growth stage the potato plant heights first increased and then decreased as the soil wetted percentage increased from p1 to p4 in 2016 the potato heights in p3 and p4 were 8 7 and 8 1 significantly greater than that in p2 on 30 may respectively p 0 01 in 2017 the potato heights in p2 and p3 were 4 4 and 9 0 significantly greater than that in p1 on 26 may respectively p 0 05 the interaction effects of soil wetted percentage and drip discharge were significant on plant heights in 2016 except at the early growth stage while no significant interaction effects were found in 2017 p 0 05 3 4 potato tuber grade significant differences of potato tuber grade were found in number and mass in 2017 while no significant differences were found in 2016 p 0 05 the reason could be that only 5 plants were sampled for potato tuber grade in 2016 while 30 plants were sampled in 2017 tables 2 and 3 in 2017 q2 and q3 had 21 7 and 15 2 significantly more jumbo tubers than q1 respectively p 0 05 p2 and p3 had 7 6 and 9 3 significantly more marketable tubers m 75 g and 8 0 and 14 9 more large plus jumbo tubers m 150 than p1 in number respectively p 0 05 p3 had 18 9 and 14 0 significantly more jumbo tubers m 250 g than p1 and p2 respectively p 0 05 generally p3 also had more marketable and jumbo tubers than p2 and p4 in 2016 although there were no significant differences p 0 05 in 2017 q2 and q3 had significantly 11 1 and 13 0 more large plus jumbo tubers than q1 respectively p 0 05 p3 had significantly 15 9 and 8 6 more marketable tubers 19 1 and 11 2 more large plus jumbo tubers p 0 01 and 22 2 and 16 5 more jumbo tubers p 0 05 than p1 and p2 in mass respectively p2 and p3 had significantly 7 1 and 15 3 total tubers than p1 respectively p 0 01 in 2016 p3 had more potato tubers at any grade than p2 and p4 except medium tubers 150 g m 100 g although no significant differences were found in mass p 0 05 p3 had 15 8 and 15 6 more total tubers than p2 and p4 in 2016 respectively the interaction effects of soil wetted percentage and drip discharge flux were not significant on potato tuber grade in number and mass p 0 05 3 5 potato tuber yield and iwue the drip discharge flux did not significantly affect potato tuber yield in both years p 0 05 table 4 there were no significant effects on iwue between different drip discharge fluxes in 2016 p 0 05 while q2 and q3 had 10 4 and 13 6 significantly greater iwue than q1 in 2017 p 0 05 the potato tuber yield in p3 was 17 4 and 14 7 significantly greater than that in p2 and p4 in 2016 p 0 05 and it was 15 1 and 7 6 significantly greater than that in p1 and p2 in 2017 respectively p 0 01 table 4 potato tuber yield increased first and then decreased with soil wetted percentage increasing and the potato tuber yield peaked at the soil wetted percentage p3 50 the soil wetted percentage had significant effects on iwue in both years p 0 001 the iwue decreased with the soil wetted percentage increasing 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different treatments on soil matric potential many factors could affect the soil water distribution such as the drip discharge flux irrigation amount and interval and so on el hafedh et al 2001 wang et al 2006 elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2010 ma et al 2021 in 2016 the q1p3 q2p3 and q3p3 had the same irrigation amount and interval table 1 and the main factor that affected the soil water distribution was drip discharge the smaller drip discharge flux had greater vertical depth of soil wetted zone than the higher drip discharge flux elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2010 explaining why the q1p3 had 59 and 32 smaller soil matric potential than q2p3 and q3p3 at shallow soil depth 10 40 cm and 56 and 20 higher than q2p3 and q3p3 at deep soil depth 70 cm respectively figs 3 and 5 with the same irrigation amount the smaller drip discharge flux might cause soil water stress at shallow soil depth which was not favorable for crop growth and decreased water use efficiency shock et al 2007 della sala et al 2021 however the larger drip discharge flux might result in a wide and shallow wetted zone and even lead to surface runoff especially for potato grown with raised bed li et al 2006 in the present study q2 provide suitable soil water distribution for potato growth in the present study although the q1p3 had greater irrigation amount than q1p1 and q1p2 in 2017 table 1 the soil matric potential in q1p3 was smaller than that in q1p1 and q1p2 at most soil depths figs 4 and 5 it was because that high soil wetted percentage lead to larger irrigation interval yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a in 2017 the order of irrigation interval was p3 p2 p1 with the same irrigation amount the longer irrigation interval caused excessively higher soil water content after irrigation and lower soil water content before the next irrigation either was favorable for potato growth wang et al 2006 ma et al 2021 in the present study the greater irrigation interval induced the smaller soil matric potential in q1p3 in 2017 in addition the more vigorous potato growth can accelerate soil water consumption zhang et al 2017b yao et al 2022 especially at the middle growth stage ma et al 2020 the q1p3 had greater 10 and 4 plant height and 19 and 10 yield than q1p1 and q1p2 respectively which caused more water consumption that was why the soil matric potential was smaller in q1p3 and the differences between different treatments got larger at the middle growth stage 4 2 effects of different treatments on potato growth drip discharge flux did not affect crop yield significantly such as potato grown with drip discharge flux of 0 6 l h and 1 6 l h trifonov et al 2017 tomato grown with drip discharge flux of 0 9 l h and 1 2 l h yohannes and tadesse 1998 cucumber grown with drip discharge flux 1 4 l h and 2 7 l h wang et al 2005 and so on in the present research drip discharge flux did not significantly affect potato tuber yield consistent with previous research however the drip discharge flux had significant effects on plant heights marketable tubers large plus jumbo tubers and iwue consistent with ma et al 2021 who found large drip discharge flux was beneficial for plant biomass accumulation in this study q2 and q3 could provide more favorable soil water conditions than q1 probably because the smaller drip discharge flux could lead to bigger vertical wetting range which might cause deep percolation elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2010 considering the effects of drip discharge flux on soil matric potential and potato growth q2 could be chosen for potato production in this area with the same irrigation amount the higher irrigation frequency enhances potato growth and increases potato tuber yield under drip irrigation with or without plastic film mulch wang et al 2006 2011 increasing drip irrigation frequency also improves maize plant height leaf area index dry weight per plant growth rate net assimilation rate yield yield components and iwue with the same irrigation quantity el hendawy et al 2008 hokam et al 2011 in this study the potato growth firstly enhanced and then decreased with soil wetted percentage increasing from p1 to p4 the p3 had greatest plant height marketable tubers large and jumbo tubers and potato tuber yield although the irrigation frequency in p3 was smaller than p1 and p2 this result was inconsistent with previous study the reason was that the crop growth could be affected not only by irrigation frequency but also irrigation amount zou et al 2020 hou et al 2021 wang et al 2021a 2021b with great irrigation amount the small irrigation frequency long irrigation interval accelerates pepper growth padrón et al 2018 in the present study increasing soil wetted percentage had greater irrigation interval and total irrigation amount consistent with yang et al 2017 moreover the soil aeration also has important effect on potato growth carter et al 1998 li et al 2004a 2004b the short irrigation interval leads to high soil water content and poor soil aeration in the shallow soil layer li et al 2004a 2004b montoro et al 2016 the p1 and p2 might be in lack of oxygen for root growth because of short irrigation intervals that was why p3 had significantly more marketable and large potato tubers in number and mass and 15 1 and 7 6 greater yield than p1 and p2 in 2017 however long irrigation interval will cause soil water stress sensoy et al 2007 and p4 might surfer soil water stress because of the long irrigation interval therefore p3 had 14 7 significantly greater potato tuber yield than p4 in 2016 the soil wetted percentage 40 50 showed promise for potato growth with black film mulch in northwest china yang et al 2017 in this study the most favorable soil wetted percentage for potato growth was 50 with black plastic film mulch in this area potato plants are sensitive to drought stress because of the shallow roots shock et al 2007 zarzyńska et al 2017 although potato can adapt to drought stress from molecular biochemical and physiological levels drought stress still causes tuber yield decrease which mainly associated with the photosynthesis inhibition al mahmud et al 2021 brestic et al 2021 gervais et al 2021 köhl et al 2021 drought stress especially during stolon and tuber initiation stage leads to tuber yield loss aliche et al 2020 in this study p4 had significantly lower tuber yield than p3 because of drought stress caused by longer irrigation interval how to provide suitable water condition to avoid drought stress is important for potato cultivation under drip irrigation with film mulch and the drip discharge flux and soil wetted percentage choosing are the main parameters that affect soil water distribution in the current study the drip discharge flux q2 and soil wetted percentage p3 were suggested based on soil water potential distribution and potato physiological growth future research needs to be focused on how to avoid heat and oxygen stress to achieve high potato tuber yield under drip irrigation with film mulch 5 summary and conclusion the irrigation amount and interval increased with soil wetted percentage increasing with the same soil wetted percentage q1 provided drier soil at shallow soil layer and wetter soil at deep soil layer than q2 and q3 with the same drip discharge flux the average daily soil matric potential decreased and the range of soil matric potential increased with the soil wetted percentage increasing because of increased irrigation interval and soil water consumption in 2017 the average daily soil matric potential in q1p3 was 41 and 20 smaller than that in q1p1 and q1p2 at the top of the bed at 10 50 cm soil depth respectively the significant effects of drip discharge flux on plant height potato tuber grade and iwue were found in 2017 q2 and q3 had 10 4 and 13 6 significantly greater iwue than q1 in 2017 the soil wetted percentage had significant effect on potato plant height in both years p3 had the greatest plant heights generally p3 had the greatest values than other treatments at each potato grade in number and mass in both years in 2017 p3 had significantly 15 9 and 8 6 more marketable tubers and 19 1 and 11 2 more large plus jumbo tubers than p1 and p2 in mass respectively the soil wetted percentage had significant effects on potato tuber yield and iwue in both years p3 had 17 4 and 14 7 significantly greater yield than p2 and p4 in 2016 p 0 05 and 15 1 and 7 6 significantly greater than p1 and p2 in 2017 respectively the iwue decreased with the soil wetted percentage increasing

soil hydrothermal status is greatly dependent on the drip irrigation design and management which not only determines the efficiency of drip irrigation system but also the crop productivity li 2018 the objective of drip irrigation design and management is to minimize deep percolation and evaporation and provide the coordination of soil water soil aeration and soil temperature to meet the crop growth requirements elmaloglou and malamos 2007 drip discharge flux emitter spacing and irrigation amount are mostly considered parameters in the system design and management el hafedh et al 2001 elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2010 and the optimization of these parameters can significantly affect the irrigation efficiency especially for coarse textured soil elmaloglou and malamos 2007 with the same soil same emitter spacing and same irrigation amount the smaller drip discharge flux results in greater vertical soil water transport elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2010 the drip discharge flux has greater effect on the width than the depth of the wetted zone li et al 2006 or has small influence on the wetting size when the drip discharge flux is larger than 1 l h naglič et al 2014 long irrigation duration irrigation depth with small drip discharge flux can cause deep percolation el hafedh et al 2001 elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2010 the irrigation duration should be different for different growth stages huang et al 2015 the determined parameters in drip irrigation design and management may or may not impact crop growth large drip discharge flux promotes maize growth ma et al 2021 higher tomato yield can be achieved with larger drip discharge flux or the drip discharge flux does not significantly affect tomato yield yohannes and tadesse 1998 the drip discharge flux and emitter spacing do not significantly affect the cucumber yield and quality wang et al 2005 and potato tuber yield and water productivity yield divided by irrigation water amount trifonov et al 2017 the low irrigation amount can increase potato water productivity with low drip discharge flux 0 6 and 1 6 l h trifonov et al 2017 the soil wetted percentage is an important parameter used in drip irrigation design keller and karmeli 1974 yang et al 2017 different soil wetted percentages can result in different irrigation amounts zhang et al 2017a moreover the drip tape can be considered as line source in the drip irrigated field skaggs et al 2004 bufon et al 2012 the soil wetted percentage and drip discharge flux are important for the drip irrigation design and management to our knowledge previous studies mainly concentrated on the effects of drip discharge flux or soil wetted percentage on soil water content and crop growth the mechanism of how the soil wetted percentage and drip discharge flux jointly affect soil water distribution and potato growth under drip irrigation with plastic film mulch needs to be explored the purpose of this study was to clarify 1 effects of soil wetted percentage and drip discharge flux on soil water distribution in raised bed of drip irrigated potato with plastic film mulch 2 how the soil wetted percentage and drip discharge flux impact potato growth 3 which is the best combination of soil wetted percentage and drip discharge flux for drip irrigated potato growth with plastic film mulch 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental area field experiments were conducted at the special potato experimental station n 35 25 e 118 59 altitude 131 m china agricultural university rizhao shandong province in 2016 and 2017 the station is in a temperate monsoon climate zone with mean annual sunshine duration 2533 h mean annual air temperature 13 c mean annual precipitation 897 mm and mean annual frost free days 213 d the soil texture is sandy loam with mean bulk density of 1 46 g cm3 0 0 9 m depth 2 2 experimental design and irrigation the experimental treatments were comprised of different drip discharge fluxes and soil wetted percentages three drip discharge fluxes including 1 38 l h 2 0 l h and 3 0 l h denoted as q1 q2 and q3 respectively were studied in 2016 and 2017 three soil wetted percentages including 25 50 and 75 denoted as p2 p3 and p4 respectively were designed in 2016 the smaller soil wetted percentage was considered and the soil wetted percentages including 15 25 and 50 denoted as p1 p2 and p3 respectively were evaluated in 2017 the treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications the crop was irrigated with drip irrigation system each plot had a sluice valve a pressure gauge and a water meter which could control the irrigation each bed had a drip tape 0 4 mm thick on the surface of the middle of each bed and the emitter distance was 20 cm when the drip irrigation system was installed the black plastic film 0 008 mm thick was laid tightly on the bed the soil matric potentials under the drip tape at 20 cm depth in one bed of each plot were monitored with tensiometers connected with vacuum manometers the irrigation began when the average soil matric potential read from the vacuum manometer reached 25 kpa the irrigation amount in mm was calculated with the following equation 1 m h θ 1 θ 2 p η where h is the planned wetted depth mm 400 mm in this study θ 1 is the volumetric soil water content after each irrigation m3 m3 0 30 m3 m3 in 2016 and 0 26 m3 m3 in 2017 θ 2 is the volumetric water content before each irrigation m3 m3 0 21 m3 m3 in 2016 and 0 18 m3 m3 in 2017 p is the soil wetted percentage and η is the drip irrigation application efficiency 0 96 2 3 cultivation practices in 2016 potato seed tubers cv favorita were planted on 20 march and the crop was harvested on 17 june each plot 9 6 m long and 5 m wide had 8 beds 1 2 m wide and 0 2 m high the tubers about 30 g were planted manually on the beds in double rows with plant spacing 0 2 m and row spacing 0 4 m in 2017 potato seed tubers cv favorita were planted on 14 march and the crop was harvested on 9 july each plot 7 2 m long and 6 4 m wide had 8 beds 0 9 m wide and 0 2 m high the tubers were planted manually on the beds in double rows with plant spacing 0 4 m and row spacing 0 3 m 2 4 measurements the weather data was obtained with automatic weather station soil moistures were monitored from the top side and base of the beds at 10 20 30 40 50 60 and 70 cm soil depths using watermark soil moisture sensors model 200ss irrometer co inc riverside ca usa fig 1 the sensors were connected to watermark monitor model 900 m irrometer co inc riverside ca usa the 10 min averages of soil matric potentials were automatically calculated and recorded the sensors were installed after the potato planting using a soil auger ten plants were marked for plant height measure in each plot during potato growth period at the end of potato growth 5 plants in 2016 and 30 plants in 2017 were sampled for tuber grade measure in each plot plants in the middle three rows of each plot were harvested to determine yield 2 5 data analysis the significant differences of plant height tuber grade and yield among treatments were determined by f test and the differences between treatments were determined by duncan s multiple range test using the statistical product and service solutions software spss version 20 for windows spss inc chicago illinois usa 3 results 3 1 weather and irrigation the daily maximum air temperature tmax average air temperature ta minimum air temperature tmin and rainfall rf during the whole potato growth stage are shown in fig 2 the air temperatures were similar in the two growing seasons with the tmax ta and tmin 24 18 and 13 c in 2016 and 25 19 14 c in 2017 respectively during the growing season the rf in 2017 196 mm was more than that in 2017 101 mm which was caused by the rf of 78 mm on 7 july two days before potato harvest the irrigation amount and number of irrigation mainly depended on the soil wetted percentage table 1 the irrigation amount increased and the irrigation frequency decreased with the soil wetted percentage increasing in 2016 p3 and p4 had 62 and 95 more irrigation amount than p2 and had 2 and 4 less irrigation applications than p2 respectively in 2017 p2 and p3 had 21 and 78 more irrigation amount than p1 and had 6 and 11 less irrigation applications than p1 respectively 3 2 variations of soil matric potential for different drip discharge fluxes with the same soil wetted percentage the soil matric potential in q1p3 was smaller than that in q2p3 and q3p3 at shallow soil depth while it was higher at deep soil depth at the top and the base of the bed in 2016 figs 3 and 5 for example the average daily soil matric potential in q1p3 was 14 89 59 in average and 10 80 32 in average smaller than that in q2p3 and q3p3 at the top of the bed at 10 40 cm soil depth respectively while it was 56 and 20 higher than that in q2p3 and q3p3 at 70 cm soil depth respectively there were 10 5 and 3 days with daily soil matric potential smaller than 25 kpa at the top of the bed at 10 20 and 30 cm soil depths for q1p3 respectively and 2 0 0 days for q2p3 and 10 3 0 days for q3p3 at the same soil depths with q1p3 the ranges of soil matric potential in q1p3 86 to 0 kpa were greater than that in q2p3 27 to 0 kpa and q3p3 47 to 0 kpa especially at 10 and 20 cm soil depths fig 5 the soil matric potential variations at the side of the bed were different with the top and the base of the bed it might was caused by different roughness of the side which affected soil water transport at the side of bed the average daily soil matric potential in q2p3 was 36 and 16 higher than that in q3p3 at 10 cm and 20 cm soil depth respectively while it was 88 smaller than that in q3p3 at 70 cm soil depth it meant that the q1p3 had the driest soil at shallow soil depth and wettest soil at deep soil depth among the tree treatments while the q2p3 had wettest soil at shallow soil depth and driest at deep soil depth for different soil wetted percentages with the same discharge the average daily soil matric potential decreased with the soil wetted percentage increasing except at some points such as 10 and 20 cm soil depths at the base of bed figs 4 and 5 for example the average daily soil matric potential in q1p3 was 11 81 41 in average and 9 59 20 in average smaller than that in q1p1 and q1p2 at the top of the bed at 10 50 cm soil depths respectively the soil matric potential ranges in q1p2 and q1p3 were greater than that in q1p1 except at some points such as 20 cm soil depth at the side and 10 20 cm soil depths at the base of bed moreover the soil matric potential differences between different treatments were smaller at the early and later growth stage and greater in the middle growth stage 3 3 plant height the drip discharge flux significantly affected potato plant height in 2017 except at the early growth stage while no significant differences were found in 2016 p 0 05 in 2017 the potato plant heights in q2 and q3 were 6 9 and 10 7 significantly greater than that in q1 on 26 may respectively p 0 01 fig 6 in both years the soil wetted percentage significantly affected potato plant heights except at the early growth stage the potato plant heights first increased and then decreased as the soil wetted percentage increased from p1 to p4 in 2016 the potato heights in p3 and p4 were 8 7 and 8 1 significantly greater than that in p2 on 30 may respectively p 0 01 in 2017 the potato heights in p2 and p3 were 4 4 and 9 0 significantly greater than that in p1 on 26 may respectively p 0 05 the interaction effects of soil wetted percentage and drip discharge were significant on plant heights in 2016 except at the early growth stage while no significant interaction effects were found in 2017 p 0 05 3 4 potato tuber grade significant differences of potato tuber grade were found in number and mass in 2017 while no significant differences were found in 2016 p 0 05 the reason could be that only 5 plants were sampled for potato tuber grade in 2016 while 30 plants were sampled in 2017 tables 2 and 3 in 2017 q2 and q3 had 21 7 and 15 2 significantly more jumbo tubers than q1 respectively p 0 05 p2 and p3 had 7 6 and 9 3 significantly more marketable tubers m 75 g and 8 0 and 14 9 more large plus jumbo tubers m 150 than p1 in number respectively p 0 05 p3 had 18 9 and 14 0 significantly more jumbo tubers m 250 g than p1 and p2 respectively p 0 05 generally p3 also had more marketable and jumbo tubers than p2 and p4 in 2016 although there were no significant differences p 0 05 in 2017 q2 and q3 had significantly 11 1 and 13 0 more large plus jumbo tubers than q1 respectively p 0 05 p3 had significantly 15 9 and 8 6 more marketable tubers 19 1 and 11 2 more large plus jumbo tubers p 0 01 and 22 2 and 16 5 more jumbo tubers p 0 05 than p1 and p2 in mass respectively p2 and p3 had significantly 7 1 and 15 3 total tubers than p1 respectively p 0 01 in 2016 p3 had more potato tubers at any grade than p2 and p4 except medium tubers 150 g m 100 g although no significant differences were found in mass p 0 05 p3 had 15 8 and 15 6 more total tubers than p2 and p4 in 2016 respectively the interaction effects of soil wetted percentage and drip discharge flux were not significant on potato tuber grade in number and mass p 0 05 3 5 potato tuber yield and iwue the drip discharge flux did not significantly affect potato tuber yield in both years p 0 05 table 4 there were no significant effects on iwue between different drip discharge fluxes in 2016 p 0 05 while q2 and q3 had 10 4 and 13 6 significantly greater iwue than q1 in 2017 p 0 05 the potato tuber yield in p3 was 17 4 and 14 7 significantly greater than that in p2 and p4 in 2016 p 0 05 and it was 15 1 and 7 6 significantly greater than that in p1 and p2 in 2017 respectively p 0 01 table 4 potato tuber yield increased first and then decreased with soil wetted percentage increasing and the potato tuber yield peaked at the soil wetted percentage p3 50 the soil wetted percentage had significant effects on iwue in both years p 0 001 the iwue decreased with the soil wetted percentage increasing 4 discussion 4 1 effects of different treatments on soil matric potential many factors could affect the soil water distribution such as the drip discharge flux irrigation amount and interval and so on el hafedh et al 2001 wang et al 2006 elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2010 ma et al 2021 in 2016 the q1p3 q2p3 and q3p3 had the same irrigation amount and interval table 1 and the main factor that affected the soil water distribution was drip discharge the smaller drip discharge flux had greater vertical depth of soil wetted zone than the higher drip discharge flux elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2010 explaining why the q1p3 had 59 and 32 smaller soil matric potential than q2p3 and q3p3 at shallow soil depth 10 40 cm and 56 and 20 higher than q2p3 and q3p3 at deep soil depth 70 cm respectively figs 3 and 5 with the same irrigation amount the smaller drip discharge flux might cause soil water stress at shallow soil depth which was not favorable for crop growth and decreased water use efficiency shock et al 2007 della sala et al 2021 however the larger drip discharge flux might result in a wide and shallow wetted zone and even lead to surface runoff especially for potato grown with raised bed li et al 2006 in the present study q2 provide suitable soil water distribution for potato growth in the present study although the q1p3 had greater irrigation amount than q1p1 and q1p2 in 2017 table 1 the soil matric potential in q1p3 was smaller than that in q1p1 and q1p2 at most soil depths figs 4 and 5 it was because that high soil wetted percentage lead to larger irrigation interval yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a in 2017 the order of irrigation interval was p3 p2 p1 with the same irrigation amount the longer irrigation interval caused excessively higher soil water content after irrigation and lower soil water content before the next irrigation either was favorable for potato growth wang et al 2006 ma et al 2021 in the present study the greater irrigation interval induced the smaller soil matric potential in q1p3 in 2017 in addition the more vigorous potato growth can accelerate soil water consumption zhang et al 2017b yao et al 2022 especially at the middle growth stage ma et al 2020 the q1p3 had greater 10 and 4 plant height and 19 and 10 yield than q1p1 and q1p2 respectively which caused more water consumption that was why the soil matric potential was smaller in q1p3 and the differences between different treatments got larger at the middle growth stage 4 2 effects of different treatments on potato growth drip discharge flux did not affect crop yield significantly such as potato grown with drip discharge flux of 0 6 l h and 1 6 l h trifonov et al 2017 tomato grown with drip discharge flux of 0 9 l h and 1 2 l h yohannes and tadesse 1998 cucumber grown with drip discharge flux 1 4 l h and 2 7 l h wang et al 2005 and so on in the present research drip discharge flux did not significantly affect potato tuber yield consistent with previous research however the drip discharge flux had significant effects on plant heights marketable tubers large plus jumbo tubers and iwue consistent with ma et al 2021 who found large drip discharge flux was beneficial for plant biomass accumulation in this study q2 and q3 could provide more favorable soil water conditions than q1 probably because the smaller drip discharge flux could lead to bigger vertical wetting range which might cause deep percolation elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2010 considering the effects of drip discharge flux on soil matric potential and potato growth q2 could be chosen for potato production in this area with the same irrigation amount the higher irrigation frequency enhances potato growth and increases potato tuber yield under drip irrigation with or without plastic film mulch wang et al 2006 2011 increasing drip irrigation frequency also improves maize plant height leaf area index dry weight per plant growth rate net assimilation rate yield yield components and iwue with the same irrigation quantity el hendawy et al 2008 hokam et al 2011 in this study the potato growth firstly enhanced and then decreased with soil wetted percentage increasing from p1 to p4 the p3 had greatest plant height marketable tubers large and jumbo tubers and potato tuber yield although the irrigation frequency in p3 was smaller than p1 and p2 this result was inconsistent with previous study the reason was that the crop growth could be affected not only by irrigation frequency but also irrigation amount zou et al 2020 hou et al 2021 wang et al 2021a 2021b with great irrigation amount the small irrigation frequency long irrigation interval accelerates pepper growth padrón et al 2018 in the present study increasing soil wetted percentage had greater irrigation interval and total irrigation amount consistent with yang et al 2017 moreover the soil aeration also has important effect on potato growth carter et al 1998 li et al 2004a 2004b the short irrigation interval leads to high soil water content and poor soil aeration in the shallow soil layer li et al 2004a 2004b montoro et al 2016 the p1 and p2 might be in lack of oxygen for root growth because of short irrigation intervals that was why p3 had significantly more marketable and large potato tubers in number and mass and 15 1 and 7 6 greater yield than p1 and p2 in 2017 however long irrigation interval will cause soil water stress sensoy et al 2007 and p4 might surfer soil water stress because of the long irrigation interval therefore p3 had 14 7 significantly greater potato tuber yield than p4 in 2016 the soil wetted percentage 40 50 showed promise for potato growth with black film mulch in northwest china yang et al 2017 in this study the most favorable soil wetted percentage for potato growth was 50 with black plastic film mulch in this area potato plants are sensitive to drought stress because of the shallow roots shock et al 2007 zarzyńska et al 2017 although potato can adapt to drought stress from molecular biochemical and physiological levels drought stress still causes tuber yield decrease which mainly associated with the photosynthesis inhibition al mahmud et al 2021 brestic et al 2021 gervais et al 2021 köhl et al 2021 drought stress especially during stolon and tuber initiation stage leads to tuber yield loss aliche et al 2020 in this study p4 had significantly lower tuber yield than p3 because of drought stress caused by longer irrigation interval how to provide suitable water condition to avoid drought stress is important for potato cultivation under drip irrigation with film mulch and the drip discharge flux and soil wetted percentage choosing are the main parameters that affect soil water distribution in the current study the drip discharge flux q2 and soil wetted percentage p3 were suggested based on soil water potential distribution and potato physiological growth future research needs to be focused on how to avoid heat and oxygen stress to achieve high potato tuber yield under drip irrigation with film mulch 5 summary and conclusion the irrigation amount and interval increased with soil wetted percentage increasing with the same soil wetted percentage q1 provided drier soil at shallow soil layer and wetter soil at deep soil layer than q2 and q3 with the same drip discharge flux the average daily soil matric potential decreased and the range of soil matric potential increased with the soil wetted percentage increasing because of increased irrigation interval and soil water consumption in 2017 the average daily soil matric potential in q1p3 was 41 and 20 smaller than that in q1p1 and q1p2 at the top of the bed at 10 50 cm soil depth respectively the significant effects of drip discharge flux on plant height potato tuber grade and iwue were found in 2017 q2 and q3 had 10 4 and 13 6 significantly greater iwue than q1 in 2017 the soil wetted percentage had significant effect on potato plant height in both years p3 had the greatest plant heights generally p3 had the greatest values than other treatments at each potato grade in number and mass in both years in 2017 p3 had significantly 15 9 and 8 6 more marketable tubers and 19 1 and 11 2 more large plus jumbo tubers than p1 and p2 in mass respectively the soil wetted percentage had significant effects on potato tuber yield and iwue in both years p3 had 17 4 and 14 7 significantly greater yield than p2 and p4 in 2016 p 0 05 and 15 1 and 7 6 significantly greater than p1 and p2 in 2017 respectively the iwue decreased with the soil wetted percentage increasing considering yield and iwue drip discharge flux q2 and soil wetted percentage p3 was a more favorable combination for potato growth in this area declaration of competing interest the authors declare

9362,higher than average fertilization rates as applied to mineral soils are often recommended for cultivated organic soils 20 organic matter which over time have led to phosphorus p pollution into receiving water bodies via subsurface tile drainage limited studies have documented the p pools within organic soils or their link to tile drainage water quality this study quantified the different soil p pools found in organic soils under two water management practices controlled drainage cd and pump drainage pd systems phosphorus availability in these soils was assessed by measuring inorganic p pi and organic p po via sequential fractionation available p via bray 1 p testing and microbial p along with crop root total p uptake drainage water samples were also analyzed for total p tp and dissolved reactive p drp the results identified calcium ca bound p as the largest p pool in these organic soils its correlation with other p pools suggests that it acts as a p sink in these soils the correlation analysis further suggests that aluminum al and iron fe bound p is a driving force for p movement in the soil as it had the most significant relationship with the p parameters in both the soil and drainage water the regression analysis of tp found that the fertilizer and root p content were significantly related to the changes in drainage water quality at both sites a p balance indicated that more fertilizer was being applied each year than was being used by the crops or released into the water causing an accumulation of legacy p in the soil overall the soil p pools affect the fluctuations of p concentration in the tile drainage water quality featuring the complex relationship of the soil water p dynamic keywords water quality organic soil agriculture inorganic phosphorus dissolved reactive phosphorus soil water nutrient dynamics drainage water management data availability all relevant data was included in the paper or its supplementary material please contact the authors for more information 1 introduction excess phosphorus p in rivers and lakes is a substantial threat to aquatic ecosystems excess dissolved reactive p drp found in water bodies is immediately available to aquatic plants like algae tan and zhang 2011 thereby creating rapid algal growth daroub et al 2011 following fertilization any p not taken up by crops is at risk of export from the field either via runoff or leaching into the agricultural drainage system the holland marsh organic soil agricultural area contributes approximately 1 5 of the p loads to lake simcoe in southern ontario canada intensifying the eutrophic state of the lake winter et al 2007 originally the holland marsh was a peatland that has been cleared and drained for agricultural purposes in the early 1900s classens 2018 this was a common land use change keller and medvedeff 2016 natural peat soils consist mainly of organic matter with only low quantities of mineral nutrients such as p this deficiency in p requires high p fertilization rates for the intensive cultivation of these soils parent and khiari 2002 guérin et al 2007 furthermore organic soils have a high water holding capacity and the naturally high water table necessitates installation of subsurface tile drains to lower the water table to support crop production hallema et al 2015 grenon et al 2021 the use of water management systems such as controlled drainage structures pumps ditches and canals helps with the removal of excess soil water in organic soil areas gambolati et al 2006 the outlets of subsurface drainage systems are often a conduit for excess p discharging from the organic soils into surrounding water bodies king et al 2015 therefore strategies for the mitigation of p pollution from drainage discharge cannot be implemented without an understanding of the p dynamics in the soil water continuum in soils p can be found in two major forms inorganic p pi and organic p po these two forms of p vary in function and fate within the soil matrix hansen et al 2004 the sequential p fractionation method hedley et al 1982 separates the biological p found in the organic fractions from the geochemical p found in the inorganic fractions and assesses the availability of p within the soil in its available moderately available and less available forms of p tiessen and moir 2007 this method has been used extensively in mineral soils but there are only a few p fractionation studies on organic soils negassa and leinweber 2009 gonzález jiménez et al 2019 this classification system for p pools is sufficiently common to document relationships in organic soils although the accuracy of the method has been questioned barrow et al 2021 it is still considered a useful method for understanding p fractions within the soil gu and margenot 2020 phosphorus can become unavailable for plant growth when inorganic phosphate compounds bind with soil metals such as iron fe and aluminum al at ph 7 or precipitate with ca at ph 7 frossard et al 2000 hinsinger 2001 for these reasons intensive cropping systems rely on the application of p fertilizers to maintain the supply of bioavailable p for crop uptake however excess p from fertilizers can accumulate in soils and eventually be lost from agricultural fields via erosion runoff and drainage discharge leading to the water quality problems hitherto mentioned mbonimpa et al 2014 within organic soils it has been found that the high levels of organic matter can impede the soil s ability to sorb and retain p which accelerates the transfer of p into drainage discharge gonzález jiménez et al 2019 the majority of agricultural organic soil studies in the past have dealt with p losses from agricultural fields via erosion and runoff and much less attention has been given to losses via subsurface tile drainage drainage water management dwm is a necessity within organic soils due to the high water tables and high water holding capacity of the soils gambolati et al 2006 within the holland marsh a pump drainage pd system is the conventional dwm practice used where the lateral tile line drains into a collector well and the water is then pumped to an open main drain miller 1979 another dwm practice that has been extensively studied on minerals soils is the application of a controlled drainage cd structure which allows for the management of the water table within an agricultural field studies on mineral soils have found that cd can reduce water discharge and nutrient loads with proper management williams et al 2015a youssef et al 2018 however there are limited studies on the benefits of cd on organic soils directly linking changes in p water quality to p pools within the soil is a difficult task because the transfer of p through the soil water continuum is slow which delays and blurs the signal assessing the effects of fertilization and drainage practices on p transfer to freshwater bodies therefore requires both a detailed assessment of the biogeochemistry of p in soils and the continuous monitoring of the drainage water quality to date no study has combined a comprehensive analysis of the different biogeochemical soil p pools with continuous monitoring of drainage water quality in subsurface drained organic soils the objective of our study was to assess how soil p pools are linked to the p water quality from an organic soil agricultural field and how this linkage is controlled by different water management practices we hypothesized that i the dynamics of water p concentrations are closely linked to the dynamics of redox sensitive soil p pools such as fe bound p and ii that cd can help to mitigate excessive p losses to water bodies from this pool we tested our hypothesis by integrating the analysis of different soil p pools to changes in the chemistry of drainage water over time in two field sites in the intensively cropped organic soils of the holland marsh of ontario the water level in one of these sites is managed using pd while in the other site it is managed using cd 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and soil sampling this study was conducted in 2016 using two commercial carrot daucus carota bergen fields on organic soils in the holland marsh ontario canada the temperature during the growing season may to october in 2016 averaged at 20 4 c with the 30 year climate average being 18 4 c the precipitation for the 2016 growing season 274 mm was 36 4 less than the 30 year average 431 mm the precipitation from may to july ranged from 26 to 40 mm which was less than the 30 year average 75 80 mm overall 2016 was a warmer and drier year compared to the average government of canada 2018 the two selected fields differed in their water management practices site 1 was a 4 2 ha field 44 03 54 0 n 79 35 16 8 w equipped with cd the structure was installed on the collector tile line near the edge of the field to control the water table level within the field this structure was installed 2 m deep with stackable gates allowing for the manual control of the water table height and in turn the volume of drain discharge from the field a pressure transducer installed within the cd structure measured water height a compound weir consisting of a v notch section at an 11 degree angle for discharge up to 1 l s 1 while the rectangular weir was used to measure discharge over 1 l s 1 the pressure transducer measured water height within the cd structure at one minute intervals which were converted to 15 minute intervals and used for discharge calculations site 2 was a 5 6 ha field 44 02 49 2 n 79 35 20 4 w with a conventional pd system consisting of subsurface tile lines that drain water into a collection well before being pumped into a ditch an h flume was installed between the well and the ditch so that the discharge could be measured before the water reached the ditch a sonic sensor was installed above the h flume to measure the amount of water passing through the flume all instrumentation was calibrated before installation in the field for measurement accuracy the pump was activated during periods of intense rainfall and spring thaw based on the growers intuition of drainage needs the water table was set to 30 40 cm below the soil surface from january to mid april 2016 and was lowered to 75 80 cm below the soil surface to accommodate the drying of the field at the time of spring thaw and the increased rainfall in march 2016 80 mm government of canada 2018 the water table was raised again in july to 30 40 cm below the soil surface at the request of the crop grower because of lack of precipitation the initial soil properties taken from 0 to 20 cm depth including physical and chemical properties as well as fertilizer application rates can be found in table s1 an initial soil sampling was done post harvest 2015 through a random composite sampling scheme to acquire the chemical soil properties ph and organic matter content and were analyzed by agridirect longueuil quebec soil bulk density samples were taken at the same time and depth and analyzed at mcgill university fertilizer rates were decided by the crop growers based on soil test recommendations table s1 fertilizer was applied as monoammonium phosphate to the surface of the fields and tilled into the soil before seeding the p fertilizer was applied at a rate of 20 kg ha 1 under cd and 35 kg ha 1 under pd using a random composite sampling scheme at both sites 30 soil samples were taken at 0 20 cm depth and then mixed to create a composite sample multiple samples from the composite were analyzed to reduce sampling error the composite sampling was deemed appropriate as the objective was to gain an understanding of the field to drainage water relationship the soil samples were analyzed for phosphorus fractionation while a nine sample plot design representative of the fields was used for available p and microbial p analyses soil sampling took place three times throughout the growing season pre fertilization pf mid growing season gs and post harvest ph the first sampling event pf took place in early may preceding both the fertilization table s1 and seeding of the fields the second sampling event gs occurred in early july to represent the field conditions after fertilization during the crop growing cycle the crop is already fully sprouted and foliage is growing during gs this is about 6 8 weeks after planting the final sampling event ph occurred mid october after the harvest at both sites harvest starts in september and continues into the beginning of october the soil samples were immediately transported in coolers to the mcgill university laboratory samples were either stored in a dry location or a 4 degree refrigerator for up to one week before analysis harvest yield table s1 was measured at each site by measuring the marketable crop yield in a 1 m2 area the marketable yield was obtained by removing the dirt and all diseased carrots before weighing the crop samples six 1 m2 samples were taken per field counted weighed and yield calculated before being averaged to create yield results for each field the average carrot yield for the holland marsh area in 2016 was approximately 50 8 kg ha 1 mailvaganam 2018 2 2 soil phosphorus analyses 2 2 1 phosphorus fractionation a modified hedley et al 1982 sequential fractionation procedure was followed zhu et al 2013 with changes to the extraction procedure following o halloran and cade menun 2008 the fractionation method used successive chemical extracts to quantify operationally defined soil p pools phosphorus fractionation was conducted stepwise with deionized water dh2o 0 5 m sodium bicarbonate nahco3 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh and 1 m hydrochloric acid hcl targeting available p moderately available p less available p bound to fe and al and less available p bound to ca respectively tiessen and moir 2007 soil samples were air dried for 72 h then ground and sieved with a 2 mm mesh before being oven dried for 48 h at 60 c a 2 0 g oven dried soil sample was then extracted with 40 ml of dh2o for 30 min in an end to end shaker followed by centrifuging the samples at 1500 g for 15 min before vacuum filtration to separate the filtrate and the residue for analysis o halloran and cade menun 2008 the soil residues were extracted sequentially and the process was repeated for the other solvents for each extract an aliquot was removed for digestion according to ebina et al 1983 to determine the amount of total p tp a dilution by a factor of four was part of the p determination procedure o halloran and cade menun 2008 to remove the interference of color from organic matter in the soil furthermore the results were read at 712 nm wavelength which is more suited to soils with high organic matter o halloran and cade menun 2008 po was calculated as the difference between tp and pi each analysis was done in triplicate to reduce bias a 1 m hcl extract was used to analyze for the total soil aluminum al iron fe magnesium mg and calcium ca content with flame spectrometry varian 220fs studies have shown that p is reactive with al fe and ca in soils forming a pool of ca bound p and adsorbing to al fe components in the soil cross and schlesinger 1995 therefore the analysis of metal concentrations was included in our study total p of the bulk soil was measured using the hot acid digestion method of tiessen and moir 2007 the analysis of total p in the bulk soil was done with the same soil samples as the fractionation to maintain consistency except for the pf site 1 sample which was unavailable therefore the pf soil sample used for analysis was also the sample used for the analysis of microbial p we refrained from determining the residual p pools from hedley sequential fractionation e g by using concentrated hcl because the focus of this study was on those p pools which are likely to become mobilized in organic soils under varying hydrological conditions as residual p accounts for stable p and not a form of soluble p nguyen and sukias 2002 it was assumed unnecessary to form a link between this p fraction and drainage water quality 2 2 2 soil available p soil available p was analyzed according to the bray 1 p test bray and kurtz 1945 sims 2000 the soil samples were sieved 2 mm and air dried for several days a soil sample of 2 g was placed in a 250 ml flask with 100 ml of acid ammonium fluoride extraction solution and was shaken for five minutes once shaken the solution was filtered and the extracts were analyzed by colorimetry using the molybdate blue ascorbic acid method murphy and riley 1962 20 of samples were analyzed twice to calibrate the results along with standards and blanks 2 2 3 microbial p microbial biomass p pi fraction only was estimated by the fumigation extraction method brookes et al 1985 the soil was sieved 2 mm and incubated at 25 c for three days the samples for fumigation were placed in large vacuum desiccators with chloroform chcl3 and sealed for 24 h before the vacuum was released the fumigated and non fumigated samples were extracted using the olsen p test 0 5 m nahco3 ph 8 5 and shaken for 30 min filtered and then analyzed for pi using the molybdate blue ascorbic acid method watanabe and olsen 1965 2 2 4 root p content harvested carrots were dried at 105 c for 48 h and ground to pass through an 850 μ m sieve samples 0 16 g were digested with h2so4 h2o2 and 4 4 ml of a lithium sulphate selenium solution parkinson and allen 1975 schneider et al 2016 the solution was left to react overnight before being heated to 340 c then diluted to 100 ml using dh2o and analyzed using molybdate blue colorimetric analysis murphy and riley 1962 only the root was analyzed as the cultivation of carrots removes only the root portion from the field allowing the leaves to be tilled below the ground surface studies have found that the majority of the p content remains in the root with the leaves accounting for only 24 of p content cole 1984 which remains in the soil within the holland marsh 2 3 water quality analysis water samples were taken by an isco 6712 portable auto sampler teledyne isco lincoln nebraska at both sites throughout the year under cd during periods of water discharge water samples were taken at 4 hour intervals at the pd site the submersible pump was controlled by the farmer and was activated according to their intuitive need for drainage usually during periods of rain discharge events occurred each time the pump was active approximately one minute between activation and sampling frequency occurred at a similar rate to cd additionally discrete grab samples were taken weekly at both sites to allow for p concentration measurements during periods of no discharge except during periods where the temperature fell below 10 c or where the low water table elevation made it impossible to obtain samples the water samples were stored in a 4 c refrigerator at the guelph university muck crops research station mcrs samples were collected monthly form the mcrs and transported in coolers with ice to mcgill university for analysis within a week of transport water samples were analyzed for dissolved reactive phosphorus drp total dissolved p tdp and total p tp using the lachat xyz sampler hach company loveland colorado drp was determined by first filtering 0 45 µm 30 50 ml of each water sample and then doing a colorimetric analysis with the molybdate blue ascorbic acid method murphy and riley 1962 tdp and tp were determined by digesting aliquots of the filtered and unfiltered water samples respectively with the potassium persulfate digestion method dayton et al 2017 ebina et al 1983 2 4 soil water p balance a soil water p balance was calculated using the bray 1 p content during pf as the baseline of available p in the soil along with the fertilizer application rate and the residual p content of the crop leaves left from the previous year as the inputs the outputs consisted of the root p uptake and the tp water quality load the tp loads were calculated using continuous discharge one minute intervals and the measured water quality concentrations with interpolation between two points in time as p concentrations are highly temporal and nonlinear during storm events williams et al 2015b a nonlinear interpolation has been found to have greater accuracy minaudo et al 2017 the annual rate of discharge under cd was 2 3 mm day 1 and under pd was 0 62 mm day 1 the tp values were converted to kg ha 1 for consistency of analysis 2 5 statistical analysis all data analyses were conducted using matlab mathworks 2019 and jmp sas institute 2019 the soil p fractions were evaluated with a non parametric mann whitney test to assess the significant differences between the three periods of analysis pf gs ph the significant differences were determined at p value 0 05 the over or under calculation of soil tp was assessed multiple statistical methods were used to assess the relationship between the soil p fractions and the p drainage water concentration including correlation stepwise regression and a neighborhood component analysis nca the measured p pools i e soil available p microbial biomass p root p and all abiotic p pools were assessed using the pearson correlation analysis r to determine the relationship between the soil parameters at each site the r analysis was also used to determine which p pools had a higher statistical significance to the water quality from the subsurface tile drainage at each site combining the different sampling periods pf gs ph to increase the data point availability all forms of p were evaluated for relationships and then compared a stepwise regression model was then used to find the parameter s with a statistically significant effect on drainage water quality the input parameters consisted of all measured p parameters while the output parameter was the p water concentrations found on the day of soil analysis all scenarios were run for drp and tp to assess the different responses of the soil p pools to the water quality all models used a significance of p 0 05 additionally the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse were obtained to assess the effect of each statistical model the nca analysis classifies the multivariate data into distinct classes to find the metric distance or weight between components to clarify the relationship the weights obtained from the nca analysis suggest the components with the greatest influencing factors on the drainage p concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil chemistry the total soil cation concentrations fig s1 were different at the two sites and across the different time periods pf gs ph the results indicate that the concentration of ca is highest with al being the least present furthermore at the cd site significant differences were found in the ca concentration between the various periods at the pd field both al and mg were highest during gs with ca and fe being higher during pf variation in soil minerals can also be caused by the accumulation of minerals within the soil from historic fertilizer application the surplus of ca in these organic soils likely originates from the dissolution of ca from the limestone bedrock into the groundwater underlying these soils gerber et al 2004 capillary rise of this ground water 110 mg caco3 l 1 gerber et al 2004 town of bradford west gwillimbury 2018 combined with evapotranspiration can move dissolved ca2 ions towards the topsoil agricultural practices further promote this weathering of limestone underlying organic soils since tillage increases organic matter decomposition and subsidence castillo and wright 2008 while the farmers did not apply ca containing soil amendments e g triple superphosphate ca h2po4 2 lime caco3 we cannot discount the probable application of such amendments in the past as these fields have been cultivated since the 1930s thus the substantial soil ca stocks are likely a result of both edaphic and agricultural factors as the dominant metal of this soil ca played an important role in p interactions the greatest pi concentrations were determined in the hcl p fraction 715 1633 mg p kg 1 representing ca p minerals other studies on cultivated organic soils have similarly found the greatest pi concentrations in this pool ranging from 450 to 653 mg p kg 1 castillo and wright 2008 schlichting et al 2002 additionally concentration of the hcl pi fraction were more than two times higher in the gs and ph periods compared to the pf period this behavior suggests that the ca p pool functions as a sink for mineral p fertilizer in these soils with greater growth under pd than cd likely due to the higher p fertilization rate at the former site table s1 this is consistent with castillo and wright 2008 which found up to a 40 increase in the ca bound p pool after fertilization with as much as 150 kg p ha 1 these results suggest that the dominance of the hcl pi fraction is a function of the elevated ca concentrations of these soils combined with their substantial p fertilization rates fig 1 identifies the concentration of pi and po in the different pools from sequential fractionation along with microbial p root p and available bray 1 p in all extracts the amount of pi was larger than the amount of po large amounts of pi found in arable soils indicate a historical accumulation of p legacy p through the long term application of inorganic mineral fertilizers withers et al 2014 although the use of the hedley fractionation only identifies operationally defined pools and not specific p pools bound to the minerals as seen in recent literature gu and margenot 2020 the over or underestimation of the p pools allows for comparison to past research the naoh pi fraction 617 mg kg 1 recorded the highest concentration during the pf period under cd with a constant decrease over the growing season studies have found that the naoh p fraction in the soil was highly correlated to the al fe and manganese mn mineral concentrations in the soil litaor et al 2004 gu et al 2020 this fraction is therefore likely related to the high fe concentration found in our soils fig s1 and table s1 riddle et al 2018 suggested that fe and al bound p is strongly influenced by drainage management while nguyen and sukias 2002 identified increased drainage p association with fe compounds compared to al increased periods of water saturated soil conditions under cd caused by the raising of the water table allows for the reductive dissolution of fe bound p this explains the decrease of the naoh p pool from pf to ph fig 1 supporting our first hypothesis in contrast to cd under pd no significant difference in the naoh pi fraction of the soil was observed fig 1c which we attribute to unchanged soil water conditions as there was limited drainage discharge this finding contrasts with our second hypothesis however the substantially higher p fertilization rate at pd during the growing season table s2 could have resupplied the naoh p pool and supplement its p loss thereby limiting the observed biogeochemical effects on p discharge the dh2o p fig 1 represented the smallest pool and hcl p the largest pool in the soils mccray et al 2012 found similar results when quantifying different soil p pools in organic soils in the everglades agricultural area of florida eaa microbial p was higher under cd than under pd throughout the sampling periods phosphorus fertilizer added to the soil can be a factor that decreases the microbial p clarholm 1993 grierson et al 1998 oberson and joner 2005 therefore the lower microbial p under pd could be linked to the higher fertilizer application table s1 in addition soil moisture conditions can affect how the microbial p functions within a soil the nahco3 p fraction was found to be constant at both sites this pool has been suggested to represent a transitory pool for applied fertilizer p between labile and nonlabile pools in contrast to other studies that have seen a peak in this pool during the growing season tiessen et al 1984 zheng et al 2002 2004 our sampling time for the growing season may have missed this transitory period as evidenced by the growth of the nonlabile hcl p fraction between pf and gs for both sites more frequent sampling times after fertilization and the use of isotope tracers e g 32p or 33p radioisotope tracers or the stable oxygen isotope composition of phosphate would help to elucidate whether such dynamics occur in cultivated organic soils frossard et al 2011 tamburini et al 2014 3 2 soil total phosphorus soil total phosphorus concentrations were determined to increase from pf to gs and then decreased again in ph at both sites table s2 the changes in total p between agricultural periods for two different methods of quantification sum of hedley pools vs hot acid digestion likely reflect the effects of agricultural practices and edaphic processes there was an increase in total p during the gs at both sites which was likely caused by fertilizer application the relatively large standard deviation of the total p concentrations is likely due to the spatial variability of the soils caused by subsidence freeze thaw cycles surface runoff and water movement through the vertical profile which can increase soil heterogeneity nicolsky et al 2008 beer 2016 shu et al 2020 within the holland marsh mirza and irwin 1964 found that on average 3 3 cm of organic soil was lost annually research has found that organic soils take a longer time to accumulate nutrients into the soil even when modified by fertilizer caron and rivière 2002 the decomposition rate in organic soils is affected by the tillage soil moisture crop type and decomposed organic materials ilnicki and zeitz 2003 3 3 relationship between the soil p pools and soil chemical properties the correlation between the soil chemical properties table 1 shows that under cd mineral concentrations had a positive correlation with fertilizer p while hcl p had negative relationship with nahco3 p and naoh p fractions hcl p further had a negative relationship with the microbial biomass under pd these relationships are indications that the ca bound p is a sink within the soil system which is in line with past studies jarosch et al 2015 gu and margenot 2020 the negative correlation between microbial p and other p parameters at the sites was also observed in a study by amador and jones 1993 where the increase in p fertilizer and other p pools correlated with a decrease of microbial p present in the soil noe et al 2001 suggested that microbial p relationship to soil tp is more important when there is a lack of nutrients in the soil the p fertilizer applied each year both present and past have contributed to an increase in fertility levels on these organic soils however this has also caused large fractions to become unavailable due to over application schröder et al 2011 as shown by the negative correlation between fertilizer rates and p pools table 1 the naoh p pool was correlated with most soil chemical properties at both sites demonstrating the dynamic nature of this pool furthermore a correlation was found between the al and fe minerals and the naoh p pool which corroborates the known relationship of al fe with naoh p porter and sanchez 1992 villapando and graetz 2001 janardhanan and daroub 2010 the relationship between al fe compounds and p within the soil could be affected by the increased amount of drainage discharge and therefore water within the soil during the pf and gs sampling periods fig 2 we expected a weaker relationship between fe and the naoh p pool for cd because of the reducing conditions brought on from greater soil moisture by a higher water table but this site was the only one to have a significant correlation between the two variables this observation may suggest that other soil components may be playing a greater role in the dynamics of this pool than fe e g al organic matter although p sorption was not measured the measurement of p pools via sequential fractionation ca and fe metals and their relationships provide evidence for the ability of these soils to fix p zheng et al 2015 found that the increase in drp concentration in the water is linked to weaker p sorption capacity in organic soils 3 4 concentrations of drp and tp in drainage water the results showed that most of the drainage tp concentrations fig 3 were above the provincial water quality objectives of 0 03 mg l 1 chambers et al 2012 moe 1994 the highest concentration of tp under cd was more than 50 times above this value with 1 89 mg l 1 in july and more than 40 times for pd with 1 21 mg l 1 in early august fig 3 the drp concentrations across both sites ranged from 0 023 to 0 1 mg l 1 a lower range compared to the findings of nicholls and maccrimmon 1974 who measured concentrations from 0 03 to 0 59 mg l 1 only 10 of the tp concentration values are equal or below the tp water quality objective across both sites under cd fig 3a no samples were taken from early september to late october as there was not enough water in the cd structure due to the low levels of precipitation occurring from may to july the reduced water levels were not a factor for the pd system as subsurface drainage continues by gravity within the collector well regardless of whether the grower pumps water from the collector well or not an increase in tp concentrations was found beginning in june at both sites this rise reflects the increase of available p in the soil following the application of fertilizer the drp concentrations under pd increased in july increasing the amount of p released that was bioavailable for algal growth tan and zhang 2011 however under cd because the continuous drainage discharge fig 2 from february to july the drp concentrations fig 3a were diluted reducing the bioavailable p leaving this field 3 5 relationship between soil and water p parameters the correlation between the soil parameters and the water quality table 2 identifies the high correlation under cd for tp with the hcl p pool r 0 76 and drp with the dh2o p pool r 0 81 the naoh p was the correlating fraction under pd for both tp r 0 76 and drp r 0 89 other studies have found similar results with the naoh p fraction correlating to the tp found in water within organic soils riddle et al 2018 negative correlations identify the specific p pool as sinks while the positive correlations indicate that it is more readily a source of p to be transferred to adjacent water bodies the relationship of the soil p chemical properties to the outflow of p from the subsurface tile drainage indicate that soil p dynamics are drainage and site specific differences in water management and soil chemical properties can strongly affect the relationship between the soil p fractions and the drainage water concentration increases in p concentration within the drainage water quality fig 3 results in a negative correlation to the dh2o p pool in the soil while there is no increase in drp under cd fig 3a a negative correlation between dh2o p pool and tp could be caused by the sediments within the water concentration as a positive relationship is found with drp under cd as this pool is supposed to reflect soluble p its negative relationship with p in drainage is unusual and contrasts with multiple agricultural water quality studies on p sims et al 1998 our analysis also infers that nonlabile p pools are the main source of p in drainage these novel findings may stem from the nature of organic soils which possess unique geochemical properties largely organic matter 68 these soils form less stable metal complexes e g noncrystalline organically bound than their mineral counterparts zheng et al 2014 as these complexes are less secure in the soil matrix the p they contain is vulnerable to export from the field the exported p can include phosphate minerals i e p bound to al ca and fe jiang et al 2021 which may explain the contribution of nonlabile p pools to p within the drainage rather than the available dh2o p pool additionally as the naoh p and hcl p fractions are the sequential extracts with the greatest ionic strength their solubilized p may not only reflect p occluded in specific metal complexes al fe and ca respectively but other forms of strong interactions for example p extracted with naoh p also releases p occluded in organic matter bowman and moir 1993 de sena et al 2022 as organic matter is susceptible to subsidence under oxidizing conditions p contained in organic matter complexes i e nonlabile pool can be released therefore at risk of entering agricultural effluent lang et al 2010 these proposed mechanisms require further study in these soils to establish their occurrence the variability in the correlated results table 2 can be linked to the difference in water management systems the higher water table under cd allows for water to interact within the soil profile while under pd the water is continuously draining to the collector well allowing the water table to be lower throughout the year studies have found that the analysis of soil p can be both temporally and spatially site specific baum et al 2003 the soil properties between each study location differed chemically through soil and drainage management practices which can affect the rate and reaction between the p bioavailability and soil nutrient content sharpley 1995 the legacy p found at each site can also impact the correlation between soil p fractions and drainage p concentrations the difference in agronomic practices including fertilizer application irrigation application crop rotation site 1 carrot onion celery vs site 2 carrot onion differences in drainage management cd vs pd and differences in herbicide pesticide use are all factors that can influence the formation of p pools and availability of mineral content within the soil and therefore affect the drainage p concentrations the nca analysis fig s2 suggests that under cd the nahco3 pi naoh pi and hcl pi and the naoh po were the most influential pools for drainage p water concentration both the naoh p and hcl p corroborated results from the pearson correlation table 2 while the nahco3 p fig 1 could indicate that like other studies this pool is transitory within organic soils tiessen et al 1984 zheng et al 2002 2004 the nca analysis under pd fig s2 found hcl p as the influencing factor for both pi and po as ca bound p was found to be the largest p pool within the soil fig 1 the nca analysis reinforced expected results 3 6 stepwise regression models a stepwise regression table 3 for cd highlighted the importance of root p content the nahco3 p fraction and the fertilizer application on tp water concentrations the analysis confirmed a strong relationship between the p and the nahco3 p fraction previously found under pd the drp outflow under pd identified a positive correlation only with the hcl p which was also found in the nca and the correlation analyses studies in the past on organic soils also reported that hcl p was the largest fraction schlichting et al 2002 litaor et al 2004 the fertilizer application and root p content representing the p input and p output from the agricultural system were the constant variables in the tp regression models at both sites these relationships signify that the concentrations of tp in drainage water from the fields are partially dependent on the amount of p fertilizer applied and the soil p pools correlated to the root p 3 6 1 stepwise regression models for different sampling periods the time period regression analysis table 4 found no difference between the linear and the quadratic regressions the naoh p pool correlated with the tp model during the gs period the continuous water discharge between pf and gs fig 2 allowed for the increased reductive dissolution of fe bound p and therefore the naoh p pool affected the drainage p concentration castillo and wright 2008 furthermore the relationship between naoh p pool and tp concentration identifies this fraction as a predictor of p loss from the fields negassa and leinweber 2009 found that fertilizer application leads to greater available p which shows a clear link from fertilizer to soil available p for the drp ph models both the naoh p and the hcl p p 0 01 r2 1 were significant he et al 2008 found an eight fold increase in the hcl p pool which represents the p retained by the soil through historical fertilizer application vu et al 2010 the naoh p was lower compared to the other sampling periods during post harvest which can be caused by the replenishment of the available pools this is confirmed by past laboratory experiments oberson et al 2001 he et al 2008 3 7 phosphorus balance along the soil water continuum the soil water p balance table s3 indicates that the fertilizer p input was substantially greater than the p output at both sites the drainage discharge for 2016 under cd was 23 760 m3 resulting in an annual tp load of 0 58 kg ha 1 while for pd the discharge was 2797 m3 with an annual tp load of 0 18 kg ha 1 carrot root uptake from organic soil in quebec was found to be between 25 8 kg p ha 1 hamilton et al 1975 and 34 kg p ha 1 parent and khiari 2002 the p concentration was found to range between 375 and 1960 mg kg 1 within organic quebec soils parent and khiari 2002 our results table s3 identified a p carrot root uptake lower than found in quebec studies overall under cd with current fertilizer application the net p added to the soil in 2016 was 9 04 kg ha 1 while under pd it was 23 67 kg ha 1 while some of this p will be taken up by the crop or leach through the system most of the applied p will fix to the soil matrix supplementing the legacy p or the historical accumulation of p in the soil kleinman et al 2011 sharpley et al 2013 though fixation initially stabilizes the fertilizer p in the soil this legacy p is unavailable to the crop as it is not in a soluble form while legacy p is not a soluble form this p is still at risk of becoming mobilized and entering agricultural drainage from cultivated organic soils due to their specific geochemical properties e g formation of weak phosphate mineral structures and unique edaphic processes e g subsidence under oxic conditions that degrade the soil structure and release nonlabile p from organic complexes this ongoing risk requires mechanistic studies in the future to elucidate the pathways the hot spots and hot moments of p transfer from agricultural organic soils to adjacent water bodies 4 conclusions this study assessed the impact of soil phosphorus p pools on the tile drainage discharge p water concentration from two organic soil sites in the holland marsh of ontario canada the drainage discharge at one site was controlled by pump discharge pd and the other site by a controlled drainage structure on the tile drain outlet cd at both sites discharge occurred mainly between the pre fertilization period and the growing season with a higher discharge rate under cd the drainage p water concentrations at both fields increased following fertilizer application throughout the sampling period drainage total p concentrations were consistently above the provincial water quality objectives of ontario exceeding the threshold value at times by more than one order of magnitude the largest soil p pool was the ca bound p which acted as a sink of p within these fields due to p having a reactive response to ca followed by fe bound p which was influenced by drainage management and causes a decreased dissolution of fe bound p the different drainage water management practices at each site affected the soil chemical dynamics through differences in water table fluctuations and soil water content the cd raised the water table within the field creating wetter soils allowing for increased fluctuations within the soil fe bound p as a result drainage water p concentrations under cd correlated strongest with the hcl p and dh2o p fractions while under pd they correlated strongest with the naoh p fraction a calculated p balance revealed that the amount of p in the soils increased under cd and pd by approximately 9 kg ha 1 yr 1 and 23 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively this suggests the continuous build up of legacy p under current fertilization practices future research should include an analysis of the dynamics of the residual p fractions and assessment of soil water p dynamics through long term water quality study furthermore including the application of isotopes radioisotopes of p and oxygen isotopes associated to phosphates into a soil water dynamic study might help to shed new light on the loss pathways in organic soils and an assessment of p sorption dynamics on these sites would help to calculate a more accurate p balance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9362,higher than average fertilization rates as applied to mineral soils are often recommended for cultivated organic soils 20 organic matter which over time have led to phosphorus p pollution into receiving water bodies via subsurface tile drainage limited studies have documented the p pools within organic soils or their link to tile drainage water quality this study quantified the different soil p pools found in organic soils under two water management practices controlled drainage cd and pump drainage pd systems phosphorus availability in these soils was assessed by measuring inorganic p pi and organic p po via sequential fractionation available p via bray 1 p testing and microbial p along with crop root total p uptake drainage water samples were also analyzed for total p tp and dissolved reactive p drp the results identified calcium ca bound p as the largest p pool in these organic soils its correlation with other p pools suggests that it acts as a p sink in these soils the correlation analysis further suggests that aluminum al and iron fe bound p is a driving force for p movement in the soil as it had the most significant relationship with the p parameters in both the soil and drainage water the regression analysis of tp found that the fertilizer and root p content were significantly related to the changes in drainage water quality at both sites a p balance indicated that more fertilizer was being applied each year than was being used by the crops or released into the water causing an accumulation of legacy p in the soil overall the soil p pools affect the fluctuations of p concentration in the tile drainage water quality featuring the complex relationship of the soil water p dynamic keywords water quality organic soil agriculture inorganic phosphorus dissolved reactive phosphorus soil water nutrient dynamics drainage water management data availability all relevant data was included in the paper or its supplementary material please contact the authors for more information 1 introduction excess phosphorus p in rivers and lakes is a substantial threat to aquatic ecosystems excess dissolved reactive p drp found in water bodies is immediately available to aquatic plants like algae tan and zhang 2011 thereby creating rapid algal growth daroub et al 2011 following fertilization any p not taken up by crops is at risk of export from the field either via runoff or leaching into the agricultural drainage system the holland marsh organic soil agricultural area contributes approximately 1 5 of the p loads to lake simcoe in southern ontario canada intensifying the eutrophic state of the lake winter et al 2007 originally the holland marsh was a peatland that has been cleared and drained for agricultural purposes in the early 1900s classens 2018 this was a common land use change keller and medvedeff 2016 natural peat soils consist mainly of organic matter with only low quantities of mineral nutrients such as p this deficiency in p requires high p fertilization rates for the intensive cultivation of these soils parent and khiari 2002 guérin et al 2007 furthermore organic soils have a high water holding capacity and the naturally high water table necessitates installation of subsurface tile drains to lower the water table to support crop production hallema et al 2015 grenon et al 2021 the use of water management systems such as controlled drainage structures pumps ditches and canals helps with the removal of excess soil water in organic soil areas gambolati et al 2006 the outlets of subsurface drainage systems are often a conduit for excess p discharging from the organic soils into surrounding water bodies king et al 2015 therefore strategies for the mitigation of p pollution from drainage discharge cannot be implemented without an understanding of the p dynamics in the soil water continuum in soils p can be found in two major forms inorganic p pi and organic p po these two forms of p vary in function and fate within the soil matrix hansen et al 2004 the sequential p fractionation method hedley et al 1982 separates the biological p found in the organic fractions from the geochemical p found in the inorganic fractions and assesses the availability of p within the soil in its available moderately available and less available forms of p tiessen and moir 2007 this method has been used extensively in mineral soils but there are only a few p fractionation studies on organic soils negassa and leinweber 2009 gonzález jiménez et al 2019 this classification system for p pools is sufficiently common to document relationships in organic soils although the accuracy of the method has been questioned barrow et al 2021 it is still considered a useful method for understanding p fractions within the soil gu and margenot 2020 phosphorus can become unavailable for plant growth when inorganic phosphate compounds bind with soil metals such as iron fe and aluminum al at ph 7 or precipitate with ca at ph 7 frossard et al 2000 hinsinger 2001 for these reasons intensive cropping systems rely on the application of p fertilizers to maintain the supply of bioavailable p for crop uptake however excess p from fertilizers can accumulate in soils and eventually be lost from agricultural fields via erosion runoff and drainage discharge leading to the water quality problems hitherto mentioned mbonimpa et al 2014 within organic soils it has been found that the high levels of organic matter can impede the soil s ability to sorb and retain p which accelerates the transfer of p into drainage discharge gonzález jiménez et al 2019 the majority of agricultural organic soil studies in the past have dealt with p losses from agricultural fields via erosion and runoff and much less attention has been given to losses via subsurface tile drainage drainage water management dwm is a necessity within organic soils due to the high water tables and high water holding capacity of the soils gambolati et al 2006 within the holland marsh a pump drainage pd system is the conventional dwm practice used where the lateral tile line drains into a collector well and the water is then pumped to an open main drain miller 1979 another dwm practice that has been extensively studied on minerals soils is the application of a controlled drainage cd structure which allows for the management of the water table within an agricultural field studies on mineral soils have found that cd can reduce water discharge and nutrient loads with proper management williams et al 2015a youssef et al 2018 however there are limited studies on the benefits of cd on organic soils directly linking changes in p water quality to p pools within the soil is a difficult task because the transfer of p through the soil water continuum is slow which delays and blurs the signal assessing the effects of fertilization and drainage practices on p transfer to freshwater bodies therefore requires both a detailed assessment of the biogeochemistry of p in soils and the continuous monitoring of the drainage water quality to date no study has combined a comprehensive analysis of the different biogeochemical soil p pools with continuous monitoring of drainage water quality in subsurface drained organic soils the objective of our study was to assess how soil p pools are linked to the p water quality from an organic soil agricultural field and how this linkage is controlled by different water management practices we hypothesized that i the dynamics of water p concentrations are closely linked to the dynamics of redox sensitive soil p pools such as fe bound p and ii that cd can help to mitigate excessive p losses to water bodies from this pool we tested our hypothesis by integrating the analysis of different soil p pools to changes in the chemistry of drainage water over time in two field sites in the intensively cropped organic soils of the holland marsh of ontario the water level in one of these sites is managed using pd while in the other site it is managed using cd 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and soil sampling this study was conducted in 2016 using two commercial carrot daucus carota bergen fields on organic soils in the holland marsh ontario canada the temperature during the growing season may to october in 2016 averaged at 20 4 c with the 30 year climate average being 18 4 c the precipitation for the 2016 growing season 274 mm was 36 4 less than the 30 year average 431 mm the precipitation from may to july ranged from 26 to 40 mm which was less than the 30 year average 75 80 mm overall 2016 was a warmer and drier year compared to the average government of canada 2018 the two selected fields differed in their water management practices site 1 was a 4 2 ha field 44 03 54 0 n 79 35 16 8 w equipped with cd the structure was installed on the collector tile line near the edge of the field to control the water table level within the field this structure was installed 2 m deep with stackable gates allowing for the manual control of the water table height and in turn the volume of drain discharge from the field a pressure transducer installed within the cd structure measured water height a compound weir consisting of a v notch section at an 11 degree angle for discharge up to 1 l s 1 while the rectangular weir was used to measure discharge over 1 l s 1 the pressure transducer measured water height within the cd structure at one minute intervals which were converted to 15 minute intervals and used for discharge calculations site 2 was a 5 6 ha field 44 02 49 2 n 79 35 20 4 w with a conventional pd system consisting of subsurface tile lines that drain water into a collection well before being pumped into a ditch an h flume was installed between the well and the ditch so that the discharge could be measured before the water reached the ditch a sonic sensor was installed above the h flume to measure the amount of water passing through the flume all instrumentation was calibrated before installation in the field for measurement accuracy the pump was activated during periods of intense rainfall and spring thaw based on the growers intuition of drainage needs the water table was set to 30 40 cm below the soil surface from january to mid april 2016 and was lowered to 75 80 cm below the soil surface to accommodate the drying of the field at the time of spring thaw and the increased rainfall in march 2016 80 mm government of canada 2018 the water table was raised again in july to 30 40 cm below the soil surface at the request of the crop grower because of lack of precipitation the initial soil properties taken from 0 to 20 cm depth including physical and chemical properties as well as fertilizer application rates can be found in table s1 an initial soil sampling was done post harvest 2015 through a random composite sampling scheme to acquire the chemical soil properties ph and organic matter content and were analyzed by agridirect longueuil quebec soil bulk density samples were taken at the same time and depth and analyzed at mcgill university fertilizer rates were decided by the crop growers based on soil test recommendations table s1 fertilizer was applied as monoammonium phosphate to the surface of the fields and tilled into the soil before seeding the p fertilizer was applied at a rate of 20 kg ha 1 under cd and 35 kg ha 1 under pd using a random composite sampling scheme at both sites 30 soil samples were taken at 0 20 cm depth and then mixed to create a composite sample multiple samples from the composite were analyzed to reduce sampling error the composite sampling was deemed appropriate as the objective was to gain an understanding of the field to drainage water relationship the soil samples were analyzed for phosphorus fractionation while a nine sample plot design representative of the fields was used for available p and microbial p analyses soil sampling took place three times throughout the growing season pre fertilization pf mid growing season gs and post harvest ph the first sampling event pf took place in early may preceding both the fertilization table s1 and seeding of the fields the second sampling event gs occurred in early july to represent the field conditions after fertilization during the crop growing cycle the crop is already fully sprouted and foliage is growing during gs this is about 6 8 weeks after planting the final sampling event ph occurred mid october after the harvest at both sites harvest starts in september and continues into the beginning of october the soil samples were immediately transported in coolers to the mcgill university laboratory samples were either stored in a dry location or a 4 degree refrigerator for up to one week before analysis harvest yield table s1 was measured at each site by measuring the marketable crop yield in a 1 m2 area the marketable yield was obtained by removing the dirt and all diseased carrots before weighing the crop samples six 1 m2 samples were taken per field counted weighed and yield calculated before being averaged to create yield results for each field the average carrot yield for the holland marsh area in 2016 was approximately 50 8 kg ha 1 mailvaganam 2018 2 2 soil phosphorus analyses 2 2 1 phosphorus fractionation a modified hedley et al 1982 sequential fractionation procedure was followed zhu et al 2013 with changes to the extraction procedure following o halloran and cade menun 2008 the fractionation method used successive chemical extracts to quantify operationally defined soil p pools phosphorus fractionation was conducted stepwise with deionized water dh2o 0 5 m sodium bicarbonate nahco3 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh and 1 m hydrochloric acid hcl targeting available p moderately available p less available p bound to fe and al and less available p bound to ca respectively tiessen and moir 2007 soil samples were air dried for 72 h then ground and sieved with a 2 mm mesh before being oven dried for 48 h at 60 c a 2 0 g oven dried soil sample was then extracted with 40 ml of dh2o for 30 min in an end to end shaker followed by centrifuging the samples at 1500 g for 15 min before vacuum filtration to separate the filtrate and the residue for analysis o halloran and cade menun 2008 the soil residues were extracted sequentially and the process was repeated for the other solvents for each extract an aliquot was removed for digestion according to ebina et al 1983 to determine the amount of total p tp a dilution by a factor of four was part of the p determination procedure o halloran and cade menun 2008 to remove the interference of color from organic matter in the soil furthermore the results were read at 712 nm wavelength which is more suited to soils with high organic matter o halloran and cade menun 2008 po was calculated as the difference between tp and pi each analysis was done in triplicate to reduce bias a 1 m hcl extract was used to analyze for the total soil aluminum al iron fe magnesium mg and calcium ca content with flame spectrometry varian 220fs studies have shown that p is reactive with al fe and ca in soils forming a pool of ca bound p and adsorbing to al fe components in the soil cross and schlesinger 1995 therefore the analysis of metal concentrations was included in our study total p of the bulk soil was measured using the hot acid digestion method of tiessen and moir 2007 the analysis of total p in the bulk soil was done with the same soil samples as the fractionation to maintain consistency except for the pf site 1 sample which was unavailable therefore the pf soil sample used for analysis was also the sample used for the analysis of microbial p we refrained from determining the residual p pools from hedley sequential fractionation e g by using concentrated hcl because the focus of this study was on those p pools which are likely to become mobilized in organic soils under varying hydrological conditions as residual p accounts for stable p and not a form of soluble p nguyen and sukias 2002 it was assumed unnecessary to form a link between this p fraction and drainage water quality 2 2 2 soil available p soil available p was analyzed according to the bray 1 p test bray and kurtz 1945 sims 2000 the soil samples were sieved 2 mm and air dried for several days a soil sample of 2 g was placed in a 250 ml flask with 100 ml of acid ammonium fluoride extraction solution and was shaken for five minutes once shaken the solution was filtered and the extracts were analyzed by colorimetry using the molybdate blue ascorbic acid method murphy and riley 1962 20 of samples were analyzed twice to calibrate the results along with standards and blanks 2 2 3 microbial p microbial biomass p pi fraction only was estimated by the fumigation extraction method brookes et al 1985 the soil was sieved 2 mm and incubated at 25 c for three days the samples for fumigation were placed in large vacuum desiccators with chloroform chcl3 and sealed for 24 h before the vacuum was released the fumigated and non fumigated samples were extracted using the olsen p test 0 5 m nahco3 ph 8 5 and shaken for 30 min filtered and then analyzed for pi using the molybdate blue ascorbic acid method watanabe and olsen 1965 2 2 4 root p content harvested carrots were dried at 105 c for 48 h and ground to pass through an 850 μ m sieve samples 0 16 g were digested with h2so4 h2o2 and 4 4 ml of a lithium sulphate selenium solution parkinson and allen 1975 schneider et al 2016 the solution was left to react overnight before being heated to 340 c then diluted to 100 ml using dh2o and analyzed using molybdate blue colorimetric analysis murphy and riley 1962 only the root was analyzed as the cultivation of carrots removes only the root portion from the field allowing the leaves to be tilled below the ground surface studies have found that the majority of the p content remains in the root with the leaves accounting for only 24 of p content cole 1984 which remains in the soil within the holland marsh 2 3 water quality analysis water samples were taken by an isco 6712 portable auto sampler teledyne isco lincoln nebraska at both sites throughout the year under cd during periods of water discharge water samples were taken at 4 hour intervals at the pd site the submersible pump was controlled by the farmer and was activated according to their intuitive need for drainage usually during periods of rain discharge events occurred each time the pump was active approximately one minute between activation and sampling frequency occurred at a similar rate to cd additionally discrete grab samples were taken weekly at both sites to allow for p concentration measurements during periods of no discharge except during periods where the temperature fell below 10 c or where the low water table elevation made it impossible to obtain samples the water samples were stored in a 4 c refrigerator at the guelph university muck crops research station mcrs samples were collected monthly form the mcrs and transported in coolers with ice to mcgill university for analysis within a week of transport water samples were analyzed for dissolved reactive phosphorus drp total dissolved p tdp and total p tp using the lachat xyz sampler hach company loveland colorado drp was determined by first filtering 0 45 µm 30 50 ml of each water sample and then doing a colorimetric analysis with the molybdate blue ascorbic acid method murphy and riley 1962 tdp and tp were determined by digesting aliquots of the filtered and unfiltered water samples respectively with the potassium persulfate digestion method dayton et al 2017 ebina et al 1983 2 4 soil water p balance a soil water p balance was calculated using the bray 1 p content during pf as the baseline of available p in the soil along with the fertilizer application rate and the residual p content of the crop leaves left from the previous year as the inputs the outputs consisted of the root p uptake and the tp water quality load the tp loads were calculated using continuous discharge one minute intervals and the measured water quality concentrations with interpolation between two points in time as p concentrations are highly temporal and nonlinear during storm events williams et al 2015b a nonlinear interpolation has been found to have greater accuracy minaudo et al 2017 the annual rate of discharge under cd was 2 3 mm day 1 and under pd was 0 62 mm day 1 the tp values were converted to kg ha 1 for consistency of analysis 2 5 statistical analysis all data analyses were conducted using matlab mathworks 2019 and jmp sas institute 2019 the soil p fractions were evaluated with a non parametric mann whitney test to assess the significant differences between the three periods of analysis pf gs ph the significant differences were determined at p value 0 05 the over or under calculation of soil tp was assessed multiple statistical methods were used to assess the relationship between the soil p fractions and the p drainage water concentration including correlation stepwise regression and a neighborhood component analysis nca the measured p pools i e soil available p microbial biomass p root p and all abiotic p pools were assessed using the pearson correlation analysis r to determine the relationship between the soil parameters at each site the r analysis was also used to determine which p pools had a higher statistical significance to the water quality from the subsurface tile drainage at each site combining the different sampling periods pf gs ph to increase the data point availability all forms of p were evaluated for relationships and then compared a stepwise regression model was then used to find the parameter s with a statistically significant effect on drainage water quality the input parameters consisted of all measured p parameters while the output parameter was the p water concentrations found on the day of soil analysis all scenarios were run for drp and tp to assess the different responses of the soil p pools to the water quality all models used a significance of p 0 05 additionally the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse were obtained to assess the effect of each statistical model the nca analysis classifies the multivariate data into distinct classes to find the metric distance or weight between components to clarify the relationship the weights obtained from the nca analysis suggest the components with the greatest influencing factors on the drainage p concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil chemistry the total soil cation concentrations fig s1 were different at the two sites and across the different time periods pf gs ph the results indicate that the concentration of ca is highest with al being the least present furthermore at the cd site significant differences were found in the ca concentration between the various periods at the pd field both al and mg were highest during gs with ca and fe being higher during pf variation in soil minerals can also be caused by the accumulation of minerals within the soil from historic fertilizer application the surplus of ca in these organic soils likely originates from the dissolution of ca from the limestone bedrock into the groundwater underlying these soils gerber et al 2004 capillary rise of this ground water 110 mg caco3 l 1 gerber et al 2004 town of bradford west gwillimbury 2018 combined with evapotranspiration can move dissolved ca2 ions towards the topsoil agricultural practices further promote this weathering of limestone underlying organic soils since tillage increases organic matter decomposition and subsidence castillo and wright 2008 while the farmers did not apply ca containing soil amendments e g triple superphosphate ca h2po4 2 lime caco3 we cannot discount the probable application of such amendments in the past as these fields have been cultivated since the 1930s thus the substantial soil ca stocks are likely a result of both edaphic and agricultural factors as the dominant metal of this soil ca played an important role in p interactions the greatest pi concentrations were determined in the hcl p fraction 715 1633 mg p kg 1 representing ca p minerals other studies on cultivated organic soils have similarly found the greatest pi concentrations in this pool ranging from 450 to 653 mg p kg 1 castillo and wright 2008 schlichting et al 2002 additionally concentration of the hcl pi fraction were more than two times higher in the gs and ph periods compared to the pf period this behavior suggests that the ca p pool functions as a sink for mineral p fertilizer in these soils with greater growth under pd than cd likely due to the higher p fertilization rate at the former site table s1 this is consistent with castillo and wright 2008 which found up to a 40 increase in the ca bound p pool after fertilization with as much as 150 kg p ha 1 these results suggest that the dominance of the hcl pi fraction is a function of the elevated ca concentrations of these soils combined with their substantial p fertilization rates fig 1 identifies the concentration of pi and po in the different pools from sequential fractionation along with microbial p root p and available bray 1 p in all extracts the amount of pi was larger than the amount of po large amounts of pi found in arable soils indicate a historical accumulation of p legacy p through the long term application of inorganic mineral fertilizers withers et al 2014 although the use of the hedley fractionation only identifies operationally defined pools and not specific p pools bound to the minerals as seen in recent literature gu and margenot 2020 the over or underestimation of the p pools allows for comparison to past research the naoh pi fraction 617 mg kg 1 recorded the highest concentration during the pf period under cd with a constant decrease over the growing season studies have found that the naoh p fraction in the soil was highly correlated to the al fe and manganese mn mineral concentrations in the soil litaor et al 2004 gu et al 2020 this fraction is therefore likely related to the high fe concentration found in our soils fig s1 and table s1 riddle et al 2018 suggested that fe and al bound p is strongly influenced by drainage management while nguyen and sukias 2002 identified increased drainage p association with fe compounds compared to al increased periods of water saturated soil conditions under cd caused by the raising of the water table allows for the reductive dissolution of fe bound p this explains the decrease of the naoh p pool from pf to ph fig 1 supporting our first hypothesis in contrast to cd under pd no significant difference in the naoh pi fraction of the soil was observed fig 1c which we attribute to unchanged soil water conditions as there was limited drainage discharge this finding contrasts with our second hypothesis however the substantially higher p fertilization rate at pd during the growing season table s2 could have resupplied the naoh p pool and supplement its p loss thereby limiting the observed biogeochemical effects on p discharge the dh2o p fig 1 represented the smallest pool and hcl p the largest pool in the soils mccray et al 2012 found similar results when quantifying different soil p pools in organic soils in the everglades agricultural area of florida eaa microbial p was higher under cd than under pd throughout the sampling periods phosphorus fertilizer added to the soil can be a factor that decreases the microbial p clarholm 1993 grierson et al 1998 oberson and joner 2005 therefore the lower microbial p under pd could be linked to the higher fertilizer application table s1 in addition soil moisture conditions can affect how the microbial p functions within a soil the nahco3 p fraction was found to be constant at both sites this pool has been suggested to represent a transitory pool for applied fertilizer p between labile and nonlabile pools in contrast to other studies that have seen a peak in this pool during the growing season tiessen et al 1984 zheng et al 2002 2004 our sampling time for the growing season may have missed this transitory period as evidenced by the growth of the nonlabile hcl p fraction between pf and gs for both sites more frequent sampling times after fertilization and the use of isotope tracers e g 32p or 33p radioisotope tracers or the stable oxygen isotope composition of phosphate would help to elucidate whether such dynamics occur in cultivated organic soils frossard et al 2011 tamburini et al 2014 3 2 soil total phosphorus soil total phosphorus concentrations were determined to increase from pf to gs and then decreased again in ph at both sites table s2 the changes in total p between agricultural periods for two different methods of quantification sum of hedley pools vs hot acid digestion likely reflect the effects of agricultural practices and edaphic processes there was an increase in total p during the gs at both sites which was likely caused by fertilizer application the relatively large standard deviation of the total p concentrations is likely due to the spatial variability of the soils caused by subsidence freeze thaw cycles surface runoff and water movement through the vertical profile which can increase soil heterogeneity nicolsky et al 2008 beer 2016 shu et al 2020 within the holland marsh mirza and irwin 1964 found that on average 3 3 cm of organic soil was lost annually research has found that organic soils take a longer time to accumulate nutrients into the soil even when modified by fertilizer caron and rivière 2002 the decomposition rate in organic soils is affected by the tillage soil moisture crop type and decomposed organic materials ilnicki and zeitz 2003 3 3 relationship between the soil p pools and soil chemical properties the correlation between the soil chemical properties table 1 shows that under cd mineral concentrations had a positive correlation with fertilizer p while hcl p had negative relationship with nahco3 p and naoh p fractions hcl p further had a negative relationship with the microbial biomass under pd these relationships are indications that the ca bound p is a sink within the soil system which is in line with past studies jarosch et al 2015 gu and margenot 2020 the negative correlation between microbial p and other p parameters at the sites was also observed in a study by amador and jones 1993 where the increase in p fertilizer and other p pools correlated with a decrease of microbial p present in the soil noe et al 2001 suggested that microbial p relationship to soil tp is more important when there is a lack of nutrients in the soil the p fertilizer applied each year both present and past have contributed to an increase in fertility levels on these organic soils however this has also caused large fractions to become unavailable due to over application schröder et al 2011 as shown by the negative correlation between fertilizer rates and p pools table 1 the naoh p pool was correlated with most soil chemical properties at both sites demonstrating the dynamic nature of this pool furthermore a correlation was found between the al and fe minerals and the naoh p pool which corroborates the known relationship of al fe with naoh p porter and sanchez 1992 villapando and graetz 2001 janardhanan and daroub 2010 the relationship between al fe compounds and p within the soil could be affected by the increased amount of drainage discharge and therefore water within the soil during the pf and gs sampling periods fig 2 we expected a weaker relationship between fe and the naoh p pool for cd because of the reducing conditions brought on from greater soil moisture by a higher water table but this site was the only one to have a significant correlation between the two variables this observation may suggest that other soil components may be playing a greater role in the dynamics of this pool than fe e g al organic matter although p sorption was not measured the measurement of p pools via sequential fractionation ca and fe metals and their relationships provide evidence for the ability of these soils to fix p zheng et al 2015 found that the increase in drp concentration in the water is linked to weaker p sorption capacity in organic soils 3 4 concentrations of drp and tp in drainage water the results showed that most of the drainage tp concentrations fig 3 were above the provincial water quality objectives of 0 03 mg l 1 chambers et al 2012 moe 1994 the highest concentration of tp under cd was more than 50 times above this value with 1 89 mg l 1 in july and more than 40 times for pd with 1 21 mg l 1 in early august fig 3 the drp concentrations across both sites ranged from 0 023 to 0 1 mg l 1 a lower range compared to the findings of nicholls and maccrimmon 1974 who measured concentrations from 0 03 to 0 59 mg l 1 only 10 of the tp concentration values are equal or below the tp water quality objective across both sites under cd fig 3a no samples were taken from early september to late october as there was not enough water in the cd structure due to the low levels of precipitation occurring from may to july the reduced water levels were not a factor for the pd system as subsurface drainage continues by gravity within the collector well regardless of whether the grower pumps water from the collector well or not an increase in tp concentrations was found beginning in june at both sites this rise reflects the increase of available p in the soil following the application of fertilizer the drp concentrations under pd increased in july increasing the amount of p released that was bioavailable for algal growth tan and zhang 2011 however under cd because the continuous drainage discharge fig 2 from february to july the drp concentrations fig 3a were diluted reducing the bioavailable p leaving this field 3 5 relationship between soil and water p parameters the correlation between the soil parameters and the water quality table 2 identifies the high correlation under cd for tp with the hcl p pool r 0 76 and drp with the dh2o p pool r 0 81 the naoh p was the correlating fraction under pd for both tp r 0 76 and drp r 0 89 other studies have found similar results with the naoh p fraction correlating to the tp found in water within organic soils riddle et al 2018 negative correlations identify the specific p pool as sinks while the positive correlations indicate that it is more readily a source of p to be transferred to adjacent water bodies the relationship of the soil p chemical properties to the outflow of p from the subsurface tile drainage indicate that soil p dynamics are drainage and site specific differences in water management and soil chemical properties can strongly affect the relationship between the soil p fractions and the drainage water concentration increases in p concentration within the drainage water quality fig 3 results in a negative correlation to the dh2o p pool in the soil while there is no increase in drp under cd fig 3a a negative correlation between dh2o p pool and tp could be caused by the sediments within the water concentration as a positive relationship is found with drp under cd as this pool is supposed to reflect soluble p its negative relationship with p in drainage is unusual and contrasts with multiple agricultural water quality studies on p sims et al 1998 our analysis also infers that nonlabile p pools are the main source of p in drainage these novel findings may stem from the nature of organic soils which possess unique geochemical properties largely organic matter 68 these soils form less stable metal complexes e g noncrystalline organically bound than their mineral counterparts zheng et al 2014 as these complexes are less secure in the soil matrix the p they contain is vulnerable to export from the field the exported p can include phosphate minerals i e p bound to al ca and fe jiang et al 2021 which may explain the contribution of nonlabile p pools to p within the drainage rather than the available dh2o p pool additionally as the naoh p and hcl p fractions are the sequential extracts with the greatest ionic strength their solubilized p may not only reflect p occluded in specific metal complexes al fe and ca respectively but other forms of strong interactions for example p extracted with naoh p also releases p occluded in organic matter bowman and moir 1993 de sena et al 2022 as organic matter is susceptible to subsidence under oxidizing conditions p contained in organic matter complexes i e nonlabile pool can be released therefore at risk of entering agricultural effluent lang et al 2010 these proposed mechanisms require further study in these soils to establish their occurrence the variability in the correlated results table 2 can be linked to the difference in water management systems the higher water table under cd allows for water to interact within the soil profile while under pd the water is continuously draining to the collector well allowing the water table to be lower throughout the year studies have found that the analysis of soil p can be both temporally and spatially site specific baum et al 2003 the soil properties between each study location differed chemically through soil and drainage management practices which can affect the rate and reaction between the p bioavailability and soil nutrient content sharpley 1995 the legacy p found at each site can also impact the correlation between soil p fractions and drainage p concentrations the difference in agronomic practices including fertilizer application irrigation application crop rotation site 1 carrot onion celery vs site 2 carrot onion differences in drainage management cd vs pd and differences in herbicide pesticide use are all factors that can influence the formation of p pools and availability of mineral content within the soil and therefore affect the drainage p concentrations the nca analysis fig s2 suggests that under cd the nahco3 pi naoh pi and hcl pi and the naoh po were the most influential pools for drainage p water concentration both the naoh p and hcl p corroborated results from the pearson correlation table 2 while the nahco3 p fig 1 could indicate that like other studies this pool is transitory within organic soils tiessen et al 1984 zheng et al 2002 2004 the nca analysis under pd fig s2 found hcl p as the influencing factor for both pi and po as ca bound p was found to be the largest p pool within the soil fig 1 the nca analysis reinforced expected results 3 6 stepwise regression models a stepwise regression table 3 for cd highlighted the importance of root p content the nahco3 p fraction and the fertilizer application on tp water concentrations the analysis confirmed a strong relationship between the p and the nahco3 p fraction previously found under pd the drp outflow under pd identified a positive correlation only with the hcl p which was also found in the nca and the correlation analyses studies in the past on organic soils also reported that hcl p was the largest fraction schlichting et al 2002 litaor et al 2004 the fertilizer application and root p content representing the p input and p output from the agricultural system were the constant variables in the tp regression models at both sites these relationships signify that the concentrations of tp in drainage water from the fields are partially dependent on the amount of p fertilizer applied and the soil p pools correlated to the root p 3 6 1 stepwise regression models for different sampling periods the time period regression analysis table 4 found no difference between the linear and the quadratic regressions the naoh p pool correlated with the tp model during the gs period the continuous water discharge between pf and gs fig 2 allowed for the increased reductive dissolution of fe bound p and therefore the naoh p pool affected the drainage p concentration castillo and wright 2008 furthermore the relationship between naoh p pool and tp concentration identifies this fraction as a predictor of p loss from the fields negassa and leinweber 2009 found that fertilizer application leads to greater available p which shows a clear link from fertilizer to soil available p for the drp ph models both the naoh p and the hcl p p 0 01 r2 1 were significant he et al 2008 found an eight fold increase in the hcl p pool which represents the p retained by the soil through historical fertilizer application vu et al 2010 the naoh p was lower compared to the other sampling periods during post harvest which can be caused by the replenishment of the available pools this is confirmed by past laboratory experiments oberson et al 2001 he et al 2008 3 7 phosphorus balance along the soil water continuum the soil water p balance table s3 indicates that the fertilizer p input was substantially greater than the p output at both sites the drainage discharge for 2016 under cd was 23 760 m3 resulting in an annual tp load of 0 58 kg ha 1 while for pd the discharge was 2797 m3 with an annual tp load of 0 18 kg ha 1 carrot root uptake from organic soil in quebec was found to be between 25 8 kg p ha 1 hamilton et al 1975 and 34 kg p ha 1 parent and khiari 2002 the p concentration was found to range between 375 and 1960 mg kg 1 within organic quebec soils parent and khiari 2002 our results table s3 identified a p carrot root uptake lower than found in quebec studies overall under cd with current fertilizer application the net p added to the soil in 2016 was 9 04 kg ha 1 while under pd it was 23 67 kg ha 1 while some of this p will be taken up by the crop or leach through the system most of the applied p will fix to the soil matrix supplementing the legacy p or the historical accumulation of p in the soil kleinman et al 2011 sharpley et al 2013 though fixation initially stabilizes the fertilizer p in the soil this legacy p is unavailable to the crop as it is not in a soluble form while legacy p is not a soluble form this p is still at risk of becoming mobilized and entering agricultural drainage from cultivated organic soils due to their specific geochemical properties e g formation of weak phosphate mineral structures and unique edaphic processes e g subsidence under oxic conditions that degrade the soil structure and release nonlabile p from organic complexes this ongoing risk requires mechanistic studies in the future to elucidate the pathways the hot spots and hot moments of p transfer from agricultural organic soils to adjacent water bodies 4 conclusions this study assessed the impact of soil phosphorus p pools on the tile drainage discharge p water concentration from two organic soil sites in the holland marsh of ontario canada the drainage discharge at one site was controlled by pump discharge pd and the other site by a controlled drainage structure on the tile drain outlet cd at both sites discharge occurred mainly between the pre fertilization period and the growing season with a higher discharge rate under cd the drainage p water concentrations at both fields increased following fertilizer application throughout the sampling period drainage total p concentrations were consistently above the provincial water quality objectives of ontario exceeding the threshold value at times by more than one order of magnitude the largest soil p pool was the ca bound p which acted as a sink of p within these fields due to p having a reactive response to ca followed by fe bound p which was influenced by drainage management and causes a decreased dissolution of fe bound p the different drainage water management practices at each site affected the soil chemical dynamics through differences in water table fluctuations and soil water content the cd raised the water table within the field creating wetter soils allowing for increased fluctuations within the soil fe bound p as a result drainage water p concentrations under cd correlated strongest with the hcl p and dh2o p fractions while under pd they correlated strongest with the naoh p fraction a calculated p balance revealed that the amount of p in the soils increased under cd and pd by approximately 9 kg ha 1 yr 1 and 23 kg ha 1 yr 1 respectively this suggests the continuous build up of legacy p under current fertilization practices future research should include an analysis of the dynamics of the residual p fractions and assessment of soil water p dynamics through long term water quality study furthermore including the application of isotopes radioisotopes of p and oxygen isotopes associated to phosphates into a soil water dynamic study might help to shed new light on the loss pathways in organic soils and an assessment of p sorption dynamics on these sites would help to calculate a more accurate p balance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9363,the ecosystem water use efficiency wuee is the critical link between water and carbon cycling in the terrestrial ecosystem the evaluations of the biophysical factors influencing wuee could reveal mechanisms of controlling wuee in order to save water in agriculture drip irrigation di has been promoted to replace border irrigation bi in northwest china different irrigation methods will cause differences in evapotranspiration eta gross primary productivity gpp and wuee further research is needed to quantify the contribution of each factor to the differences in eta gpp and wuee to separate the different factors controlling eta gpp and wuee variability between di and border bi the 4 year data under di and bi measured by eddy covariance systems were collected and analyzed to explore the differences in eta gpp and wuee under different irrigation methods penman monteith p m model and stomatal conductance photosynthetic transpiration coupling smpt sb model complemented by perturbation analysis were employed the results showed that the 4 year mean evapotranspiration eta decreased by 8 under di compared with the value under bi and the mean gross primary productivity gpp under di was 5 higher than the bi the wuee under di was 14 higher than that under bi the p m model and the smpt sb model agreed well with eta and gpp measured on daily time scales providing confidence in their ability to separate the biological and physical controls of eta gpp and wuee based on the two models the first order taylor series expansions of the total eta gpp and wuee derivatives were applied to the p m model and smpt sb model and compared with measured differences in eta gpp and wuee more than 60 of the difference in eta caused by the two irrigation methods was attributed to variations in the coupled surface resistance and drip irrigation mainly achieves water saving by reducing soil evaporation the difference in maize growth due to irrigation methods was the main reason for the differences in gpp the differences in vapor pressure deficit and the coupled surface resistance caused by irrigation methods were the main factors causing the difference in wuee it could be surmised that drip irrigation increased wuee in maize fields by changing surface resistance which mainly reduced soil evaporation keywords evapotranspiration gross primary productivity water use efficiency irrigation methods perturbation analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water use efficiency as an important index to evaluate water carbon coupling in terrestrial ecosystems is an important link between the ecological and hydrological processes of the ecosystem the ecosystem water use efficiency wuee can be defined as the ratio of gross primary production gpp to the actual evapotranspiration eta law et al 2002 hu et al 2008 zhou et al 2014 during the growth of crops wuee is one of the important indicators to evaluate agricultural production and water consumption tong et al 2009 currently climatic variables and agronomic managements have significantly altered wuee by influencing photosynthesis and transpiration thus exploring the wuee is critical in revealing the response of ecological and hydrological processes to global climatic changes and agronomic management and optimizing water and carbon management the eddy covariance technique can simultaneously measure the water carbon flux of the ecosystem which has promoted and facilitated the research of water use efficiency at different time scales and among different vegetation types niu et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 li et al 2022 this method is used to study the variability and the response of water use efficiency to climatic and soil variables at the ecosystem level yu et al 2001 zhou et al 2014 xie et al 2016 wang et al 2018 it was found that wuee decreased with increasing saturated vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation tong et al 2009 a study showed that net radiation rn air temperature ta and the rate of change in trunk diameter were the most significant factors influencing wuee lin et al 2018 the factors affecting wuee tend to differ on different time scales on a daily scale the main factor influencing wuee was the leaf area index lai wang et al 2018 on a monthly scale wuee and lai rn and ta have shown strong positive correlations xie et al 2016 and on an interannual scale ta was found to be the main factor influencing wuee wang et al 2018 although these studies have analyzed the controlling factors for ecosystem water use efficiency most of them analyzed the controlling factors for their seasonal and interannual variability in contrast there are few analyses especially contribution analysis on the factors influenced by the shift in irrigation method the arid region of northwest china is located between asia and europe where water resources are severely scarce and the ecological environment is extremely fragile in recent years the chinese government has widely promoted drip irrigation under film mulch technology in northwest china this technology not only improved the soil temperature and reduced water evaporation but also effectively reduced deep leakage and thus provided a feasible method to alleviate water shortages liu et al 2017 2017 qin et al 2019 different irrigation methods directly lead to differences in micro climates of farmland ecosystems and crop growth the eta and gpp of crops are affected by the irrigation methods which in turn affect wuee however the main factors controlling wuee under different irrigation methods need to be further clarified to explore how the irrigation methods separately and jointly impact variability in eta gpp and wuee a 4 year record of half hourly water and carbon flux under drip irrigation and border irrigation measured by the eddy covariance method is analyzed and a perturbation analysis was conducted on the penman monteith model e g wilson and baldocchi 2000 stoy et al 2006 and stomatal conductance photosynthetic transpiration coupling model yu et al 2003 zhang et al 2013 the primary objective of this study is to isolate the contributions of biophysical factors controlling eta gpp and wuee under two irrigation systems in the arid region of northwest china it is envisaged that such analysis can pinpoint some of the physical and biological variables that impact eta gpp and wuee under different irrigation systems thereby assisting an improvement of the farmland management practices as well as adaption to future climatic change 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description measurements were conducted over maize zea mays fields located at the shiyanghe experiment station in wuwei gansu province china 37 52 n 102 50 e this region is characterized by a temperate continental arid climate the annual mean temperature is 8 c and the annual rainfall in the study area is 164 mm the annual average sunshine hours exceed 3000 h and the annual average cumulative temperature is more than 3550 c li et al 2013 two eddy covariance systems were installed in the centers of two experiment fields two irrigation methods were used in the two experimental areas one was drip irrigation under film mulching di and the other was border irrigation with film mulching bi and the mulching ratio was 0 75 the spacing of the drip irrigation belt was 0 8 m the experimental area for di was 400 m long and 200 m wide while the test area for bi was 500 m long and 250 m wide to make the irrigation more uniform it was divided into small plots of 15 m 30 m the two experimental areas were separated by a road the specific instrument layout and field schematic diagram was shown in fig 1 in this study the widely used fsam model was used to calculate the extent of the flux contribution schmid 1994 90 of the flux information came from within 125 m of the windward direction the local prevailing wind direction was northwest and the zone of flux contribution from the prevailing wind direction fell in the maize farmland in the test area therefore the area of our observation zone met the wind surge zone requirement the soil texture at the two experimental sites

2018 with an average annual decrease of 20 kg n ha 1 2 2 micrometeorological measurements two scaffold towers were constructed in the two study areas for conducting micrometeorological and eddy covariance measurements the same type of eddy covariance system including all probes was used in the two experimental sites upward short wave radiation downward short wave radiation upwards long wave

height hc were manually measured during the growing seasons the lai and hc were measured at intervals of 7 or 10 days from seedling to crop harvest and the intervals were the same for the drip irrigation and border irrigation systems in the field six different locations were randomly selected and representative plants were chosen at each site to manually measure the length and width of each leaf as well as the height of maize according to the empirical formula guo et al 2019 the lai of maize leaves was calculated from 4 l a i 0 74 i 1 n l i w i d s where l i is the length of the leaf w i is the width of the leaf d and s are the distance in m between two rows and the space between two plants respectively and 0 74 is an empirical constant when maize was harvested five representative sample plots with an area of 2 m2 were randomly selected for both drip irrigation and border irrigation the organs stems leaves roots and seeds were split the seeds were baked to a constant weight at 70 and then 100 seeds were randomly weighed to measure the 100 kernel weight and the total weight of the seeds and the natural yield was calculated according to the moisture content of 13 by volume 2 5 data processing the water and carbon data measured by eddy covariance systems were collected at a frequency of 10 hz to facilitate the analysis the flux data were collected with a sampling frequency of 30 min and were corrected by using eddy pro 4 2 1 li cor inc lincoln ne usa software data processing mainly included quadratic coordinate rotation latent heat flux air density correction wpl correction random uncertainty analysis mann and lenschow and spectral correction the software evaluated the quality of ec data and the unreliable data could be deleted based on the assessment of the software as for the missing data when the latent heat le and the sensible heat h flux were missing at 0 2 h a linear interpolation method was used when the missing period was between 2 and 24 h the diurnal mean method falge et al 2001 was used to interpolate the latent heat flux and sensible heat flux data of the corresponding missing period when the continuous missing period is greater than 24 h the missing data of the corresponding period is interpolated by shuttleworth wallance shuttleworth and wallace 1985 energy balance closure ebr was a standard method to evaluate the quality of flux data the energy balance closure ratio used a linear regression between the turbulent fluxes le h and available energy rn g according to the regression analysis of half hour data the energy balance closure ratios of maize fields under drip irrigation from 2015 to 2018 were 0 68 0 69 0 67 and 0 68 the values under border irrigation were 0 70 0 71 0 69 and 0 73 respectively the values were the common range of results from previous studies mahrt 1998 twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2001 in order to solve the problem of energy non closure the bowen ratio forced closure method was used to correct the measured latent heat and sensible heat energy in the daytime the bowen ratio forced energy closure method was adopted to distribute the energy non closing difference to the latent and sensible heat flux according to the bowen ratio at night it was assumed that the observed value of sensible heat flux is reliable so the latent heat flux was calculated according to the energy balance formula qiu et al 2021 the carbon flux data processed by eddy pro software still need further screening since the stability of atmospheric conditions at night reduced the quality of the data we used the frictional wind speed u to process the data according to the average test method the strength of atmospheric turbulence can be expressed in terms of frictional wind speed and co2 flux data measured during this period can be considered credible only if the frictional wind speed is greater than a certain threshold this threshold is called the critical frictional wind speed we eliminated the night data when the frictional wind speed was less than the critical frictional wind speed from 2015 2018 the critical friction wind speeds were 0 15 m s 1 0 20 m s 1 0 18 m s 1 and 0 12 m s 1 respectively in order to achieve the continuity and integrity of the data interpolation was carried out data gaps caused by turbulent flux or instrument failure were divided into the short gap 2 h and the long gap 2 h gao et al 2017 the former was filled by linear interpolation while the latter was filled by statistical and empirical models baldocchi 2003 according to the calculation principle of the eddy covariance technique the net ecosystem exchange nee was directly observed by the instrument the observed value of gpp used in this paper was calculated by nee and ecosystem respiration er by comparing the applicability of different respiration models in arid areas of northwest china it was found that vant hoff model could better simulate maize nighttime respiration guo et al 2019

the p m model and smpt sb model compared favorably with the eddy covariance measured evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity at daily time scales gassmann et al 2019 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 are now used to analytically link evapotranspiration and gross primary variations to variations in physical and biological factors because of the analytical tractability of the two models it is ideal for conducting perturbation analyses intended to isolate the relative contributions of biophysical factors that give rise to differences in evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity between drip irrigation and border irrigation the perturbation analyses can be used to separate the factors affecting the variability of observations igarashi et al 2015 the biophysical impact of the irrigation method on eta was quantified as the eta difference δeta between drip irrigation and border irrigation fields using the following equation 24 δ eta et a di et a bi where etadi and etabi represent the observed eta for drip irrigation and border irrigation similarly the biophysical impact of the irrigation method on gpp and wuee was quantified as the gpp and wuee difference δgpp δwuee

evapotranspiration showed a clear seasonal pattern fig 2 a under the different irrigation conditions eta showed similar variations daily water consumption was small at the early stage of crop growth then increased with the growth of maize and gradually decreased with the maturity of maize senescence of maize leaves and decline of atmospheric evaporation capacity at the late growth stage the peak value of eta was generally measured in the middle of july the range of eta under the drip irrigation system was 0 3 8 2 mm d 1 and the range under the border irrigation system was 0 3 9 7 mm d 1 a comparison of daily evapotranspiration rates showed that drip irrigation reduced daily evapotranspiration rates by 1 14 compared to border irrigation except in 2018 fig 3 in terms of the total amount of evapotranspiration in 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 the seasonal average eta under the drip irrigation system were 517 511 490 and 543 mm respectively and the corresponding border irrigation values were 616 521 581 and 525 mm respectively table 2 the four year average eta under di and bi were 515 and 561 mm and the average annual eta decreased by 46 mm under the drip irrigation system compared with that under the border irrigation system during the measurement period the 4 year average evapotranspiration eta was reduced by 8 for di compared to bi the 4 year average of total plant transpiration was 422 mm and 431 mm under drip irrigation and border irrigation respectively and soil evaporation was 93 mm and 129 mm under the two irrigation methods compared with border irrigation drip irrigation reduced plant transpiration and soil evaporation by 2 and 28 respectively the variation of gpp was consistent with that in eta the crop s ability to photosynthesize was weak in the early stages of growth gradually increasing as the crop develops and then slowly decreasing as the crop aged the values in the early and late measurement stages were small and reached peak values in mid july fig 2b the gpp under di was greater than that under bi in the early stage of maize growth and development which was due to the crop growth promoted by the adoption of drip irrigation and was consistent with the trend of lai by comparing the average rate of gpp during the growth period it can be seen that the average daily rate of gpp under di increased by 12 7 and 5 respectively compared to bi in all three years except 2017 fig 4 in 2017 drip irrigation maize was infected with red rust disease resulting in poor growth of maize plants thus the pattern of 2017 differs from that of the other three years the values of gpp under di were 1705 1427 1069 and 1252 g c m 2 from 2015 to 2018 the corresponding values under bi were 1285 1273 1446 and 1209 g c m 2 the average gpps over the 4 years under di and bi were 1363 and 1303 g c m 2 and the gpp under di was 60 g c m 2 higher than that under bi the gpp under the two irrigation methods fluctuated significantly during the entire observation period which was mainly caused by the variations in soil moisture and radiation that occurred during the measurement period fig s2 our previous study on the variation of carbon flux of maize under drip irrigation in northwest china confirmed that gpp was significantly positively correlated with net radiation lai soil moisture and air temperature guo et al 2021 4 2 seasonal and interannual variations of wuee under drip and border irrigation systems compared with eta and gpp the seasonal variation of wuee was rather drastic fig 5 except for 2017 the annual averages of the other three years were higher for the drip irrigation system than for the border irrigation system the wuee values in 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 were 3 30 2 79 2 18 and 2 31 g c kg 1 h2o under di the corresponding wuee values were 2 09 2 44 2 49 and 2 30 g c kg 1 h2o under bi the difference in wuee between the two irrigation methods was significant p 0 05 the four year average wuee values for the drip irrigation and border irrigation systems were 2 65 0 44 and 2 33 0 16 g c kg 1 h2o respectively table 2 by comparing the wuee of the two irrigation methods it was not difficult to find that the wuee of the drip irrigation system was higher than that of the border irrigation system in the three years excluding 2017 the wuee values in the drip irrigation system were 58 14 and 1 higher than those in the border irrigation system in 2015 2016 and 2018 respectively as explained in the previous section in 2017 drip irrigated maize was infected with red rust disease which resulted in poor plant growth as a result drip irrigated maize showed an obvious reduction in water use efficiency from the perspective of different growth stages the wuee values at each growing stage did not differ obviously except in the seeding stage during this stage the wuee values were low fig 6 c in 2015 the wuee values under drip irrigation were higher than those under border irrigation at each growth stage of maize in 2016 and 2018 the water use efficiency values at different growing stages were not consistent between the two irrigation methods the wuee values under bi were higher than those under di at the heading stage in 2016 while those under bi were higher than those under di at the seeding and filling stage in 2018 the wuee under di was greater than that under bi at the shooting stage in all three years except 2017 at the maturity stage in maize the wuee showed a similar variation according to the definition of water use efficiency it is clear that the value of water use efficiency was closely related to gpp and eta drip irrigation promoted maize growth and increased lai fig s3 making gpp greater than border irrigation at the same time drip irrigation reduced soil evaporation this made the percentage of t from et slightly higher than bi therefore the wuee showed inconsistent variation at different fertility stages under both irrigation methods 4 3 performance of the p m model and the smpt sb model we assessed the performance of the p m model and smpt sm model in capturing the observed eta and gpp the relationship between the observed eta and the calculated eta based on the p m model was shown in fig 7 the calculated and observed eta followed the 1 1 line with regression slopes ranging from 0 85 to 1 02 fig 7 the results under di in the growing season showed that the r2 values were higher than 0 82 the results under bi also followed the 1 1 line but have more scatter fig 7 e f g h the performance of the smpt sb model was shown in fig 8 the slopes of the regression between the calculated and observed gpp ranged from 0 81 to 1 00 the results under di yield r2 values ranging from 0 91 to 0 97 the results under bi were slightly worse than those under di with regression slopes ranging from 0 81 to 0 88 fig 8 e f g h the results under bi in the growing season showed that the r2 values were higher than 0 88 the rmses between the observed eta and the calculated eta based on the p m model were shown in fig 7 generally the rmses under di were close to those under bi there was no obvious difference in rmse between the two irrigation methods in 2015 the calculated value was closest to the observed values under the two irrigation methods the simulation error in 2016 and 2018 was larger than those in 2015 the rmses between the observed gpp and the calculated gpp based on the smpt sb model were shown in fig 8 the rmse under di in 2018 was the smallest among the four years followed by 2015 and the largest in 2016 the results for rmse under bi were similar to those under di with the smallest rmse in 2018 and the largest in 2017 in general the p m model and the smpt sb model could simulate the variation patterns of eta and gpp well therefore further analysis of their control factors could be performed 4 4 analysis of the influencing factors of δeta δgpp and δwuee by perturbation analysis to analyze the reasons for the differences in eta δeta gpp δgpp and wuee δwuee between drip and border irrigation methods we analyzed the contributions of the factors affecting δeta δgpp and δwuee by using the p m model and smpt sb model among the factors affecting the δeta the difference in vpd and coupled surface resistance rco accounted for a large proportion fig 9 a the available energy rn g played a positive role in δeta in 2015 2016 and 2018 while the effect was not obvious in 2017 the difference in vpd between 2016 2017and 2018 weakened the observed eta differences which was particularly evident in 2016 the effect of coupled surface resistance on δeta was most pronounced in 2015 2018 more than 60 difference in eta was caused by rco the smpt sb model was used to analyze the influences of the atmospheric co2 concentration cr atmospheric temperature ta atmospheric relative humidity rh air resistance ra canopy boundary layer resistance rbw and canopy internal resistance ric on gpp among all the influencing factors the rbw and ric accounted for a relatively high proportion at 94 96 102 and 87 in 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 9 b the canopy boundary layer resistance and canopy internal resistance were closely related to crops such as leaf area index and the width of leaves among these factors affecting wuee the contributions of rco and vpd to explaining differences in wuee were relatively large fig 10 the vpd of the maize field under di was greater than that of the bi fig s2 while the wuee of the maize field under di was greater than that of the bi so the difference in vpd caused by the two irrigation methods showed a positive effect on δwuee rn g had a negative effect on the difference in wuee and rbw also made a large contribution to the difference in wuee in 2017 as the available energy increases the evapotranspiration capacity of the farmland increases which in turn could lead to a decrease in water use efficiency the results showed that the influences of rco and rbw caused by the irrigation method on wuee were greater than the influences of other environmental factors and over 47 of the differences were caused by rco the increase in coupled surface resistance meant that it became more difficult for water in the farmland to enter the atmosphere and the evapotranspiration capacity of the whole farmland decreased reducing the water consumption of the farmland and thus increasing the wuee 5 discussion 5 1 effect of different irrigation methods on eta gpp and wuee the irrigation method could alter the amount and distribution of soil water and has a certain effect on crop growth xu et al 2016 drip irrigation as one of the water saving irrigation methods has been proven in reducing crop water consumption evett et al 2019 e compared the eta of sprinkler irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation and the results showed that compared with sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation reduced the eta of maize by 13 15 compared with furrow irrigation drip irrigation could reduce eta by more than half qiu et al 2011 qin et al 2016 also confirmed the effectiveness of drip irrigation in reducing eta by comparing the variations of soil evaporation and plant transpiration observed under the two irrigation methods it can be seen that drip irrigation mainly achieves water savings by reducing soil evaporation the transpiration of maize under the two irrigation methods did not differ much while the soil evaporation under di was significantly less than that under bi table 2 the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration showed that with drip irrigation the transpiration capacity of the entire farmland rose and more irrigation water entered the atmosphere through plant transpiration fig s4 plant photosynthesis is influenced by a combination of environmental factors irrigation systems often vary somewhat from one irrigation method to another patnaik and biswal 2020 found that irrigation was one of the important influencing factors when they studied the variations of gpp in a long time series in india the effect of irrigation amount on photosynthesis was that too much or too little irrigation amount would affect the maximum photosynthetic rate of plants li et al 2021 c j wang et al 2020 y h wang et al 2020 j w wang et al 2020 showed that the maximum photosynthetic rate was increased by 21 1 in drip irrigated maize fields compared to rainfed fields reddy et al 1982 found that when the irrigation interval is longer it may cause soil water stress which may lead to a decrease in the photosynthetic rate of maize because the irrigation frequency of drip irrigation was higher than that of border irrigation surface soil moisture was suitable for maize growth in the long term fig s2 except for the poor growth of drip irrigation maize in 2017 due to red rust disease the lai of maize under di was greater than bi which was consistent with the total gpp value fig s3 therefore the photosynthetic rate of the maize canopy under di was greater than that under bi the analysis of the factors affecting gpp also showed that the differences in crop growth due to irrigation methods were the main reason for the differences in gpp fig 9b our results showed that switching from conventional irrigation to drip irrigation improved the wuee by 14 the gross primary productivity and yield are closely related regarding the effect of irrigation methods on water use efficiency most studies have used the index of yield to water consumption ratio wue y yield et for comparison with other studies we also analyzed the differences in wuey under the two irrigation methods in our study wuey was 1 65 and 1 49 kg m 3 for drip and border irrigation respectively with drip irrigation improving by 11 fig 11 the drip irrigated maize yield from 2015 to 2018 was only 2 65 higher than the border irrigation on average while the total water consumption was 8 less thus drip irrigation played a major contribution in enhancing water use efficiency in terms of water savings guo et al 2022 found that the yield and water use efficiency of the crop increased by 9 7 and 30 2 respectively with drip irrigation compared to conventional irrigation the increase in water use efficiency was significantly greater than the yield indicating that drip irrigation was more significant in reducing water consumption this is consistent with the results of our research however c wang et al 2021 showed that drip irrigation promoted maize yield and water use efficiency by improving the photosynthetic characteristics of maize in our study both irrigation methods were adequate irrigation therefore maize was not subjected to water stress throughout the growing season and thus did not affect the photosynthetic characteristics of maize in contrast with drip irrigation soil evaporation was reduced by 28 and total gpp was increased by only 5 therefore it assumed that drip irrigation increased the wuee by reducing soil evaporation from this study it found that based on the actual management practices of local farmers the ecosystem water use efficiency increased by 14 on average on a large farmland scale with drip irrigation unable to always be more than a 20 improvement as concluded by many other field experiments the evapotranspiration was reduced by only 7 and the total amount of irrigation water under drip irrigation is reduced by 25 mainly due to the reduction of soil evaporation and deep leakage y wang et al 2021 however according to the experimental results for many years the irrigation system of drip irrigation in northwest china needs to be further optimized it has been found that deficit irrigation can not only reduce water consumption but also increase crop yield some studies have found that an appropriate reduction of irrigation amount can change the proportion of photosynthate distribution thus increasing crop yield wang et al 2020 2020 2020 ali et al 2021 therefore while actively promoting drip irrigation technology the government should guide farmers to adopt a reasonable irrigation system such as deficit irrigation to further achieve the goal of water saving and yield increase in the arid areas of northwest china 5 2 controlling factors of water use efficiency in agro ecosystems from the results shown in table 2 the average wuee under the drip irrigation system was higher than that under the border irrigation system over the four studied years our results confirmed the important role of biophysical factors in controlling the difference of wuee under drip irrigation and border irrigation methods fig 10 which is also the primary reason for the consistent differences between eta and gpp crop growth and water use efficiency are closely related some experts and scholars have also carried out related studies in a study of maize fields in northeast china they concluded that on a daily scale lai was the only factor controlling wuee hu et al 2008 reported that lai had an important impact on the water carbon cycles of the ecosystems thus affecting the variation in wuee when lai was small wuee rose rapidly with increasing lai while when lai tended to be stable stomatal factors were the dominant factors affecting wuee tong et al 2009 in our research it was found that the biological factors were the main reason for the difference in gpp between the two irrigation methods fig 9 and the effect on wuee was mainly reflected in the coupled surface resistance the canopy boundary layer resistance and the internal canopy resistance our results showed that the proportion of vpd was positive indicating that the higher δvpd increased δwuee fig 10 vpd is considered to be one of the main environmental factors affecting wuee and this was confirmed by many studies ponton et al 2006 tong et al 2014 x h j liu et al 2017 x d liu et al 2017 jia et al 2016 in addition to vpd the effects of solar radiation and temperature on wuee are obvious solar radiation affects wue mainly by influencing the photosynthesis of plants jiang et al 2022 guo et al 2010 found that the high temperature was helpful to improve the wuee while li et al 2015 reported that higher temperature had a limiting effect on the wuee since the difference in air temperature in the maize field between the two irrigation methods was not significant fig s2 therefore the contribution of ta and to δwuee was small soil moisture is thought to be the important factor that controls the exchange of water and carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere kurc and small 2007 therefore the impact on wuee cannot be ignored x h j liu et al 2017 x d liu et al 2017 concluded that the wuee decreased significantly as the soil moisture content increased and similar results have been concluded in many studies jia et al 2016 tong et al 2014 however the impact of soil moisture on wuee is often also influenced by vpd when vpd is low there is a negative correlation between soil moisture and wuee when vpd is high the increase in soil moisture can promote the increase of wuee li et al 2021 in our study we found that soil moisture directly influenced the values of coupled surface resistance as can be seen from fig 10 the difference in rco due to the two irrigation methods was the main factor contributing to δwuee soil moisture under di was higher than that under bi throughout the growing stages of maize however drip irrigation promotes crop growth making lai under di greater than bi fig s3 therefore less energy reaches the surface under drip irrigation conditions thus suppressing soil evaporation thus drip irrigation increased wuee in maize fields by changing surface resistance 6 conclusions in this study through analyzing the 4 year water carbon flux data of drip irrigation and border irrigation the evapotranspiration gross primary productivity and ecosystem water use efficiency under different irrigation methods were compared based on first order taylor series expansions of the p m model and smpt sb model the perturbation analysis was employed to analyze the influencing factors of eta gpp and wuee drip irrigation reduced the average annual eta by 8 compared with the value under border irrigation the gpp under drip irrigation was 5 higher than that under border irrigation the wuee under drip irrigation was 14 higher than that under border irrigation through simulations of eta gpp and wuee under drip irrigation and border irrigation methods the contribution ratio of biophysical factors to the eta gpp and wuee difference was analyzed more than 60 of the difference in eta caused by the two irrigation methods was attributed to variations in the coupled surface resistance and drip irrigation mainly achieves water saving by reducing soil evaporation the difference in maize growth due to irrigation methods was the main reason for the differences in gpp drip irrigation technology not only altered the water consumption of farmland but also promoted crop growth and improved the carbon sequestration capacity of maize it also had an impact on the ecosystem water use efficiency through perturbation analysis it was found that the difference in wuee caused by the irrigation methods was mainly attributed to differences in the coupled surface resistance and vpd which mainly reduced soil evaporation declaration of

9363,the ecosystem water use efficiency wuee is the critical link between water and carbon cycling in the terrestrial ecosystem the evaluations of the biophysical factors influencing wuee could reveal mechanisms of controlling wuee in order to save water in agriculture drip irrigation di has been promoted to replace border irrigation bi in northwest china different irrigation methods will cause differences in evapotranspiration eta gross primary productivity gpp and wuee further research is needed to quantify the contribution of each factor to the differences in eta gpp and wuee to separate the different factors controlling eta gpp and wuee variability between di and border bi the 4 year data under di and bi measured by eddy covariance systems were collected and analyzed to explore the differences in eta gpp and wuee under different irrigation methods penman monteith p m model and stomatal conductance photosynthetic transpiration coupling smpt sb model complemented by perturbation analysis were employed the results showed that the 4 year mean evapotranspiration eta decreased by 8 under di compared with the value under bi and the mean gross primary productivity gpp under di was 5 higher than the bi the wuee under di was 14 higher than that under bi the p m model and the smpt sb model agreed well with eta and gpp measured on daily time scales providing confidence in their ability to separate the biological and physical controls of eta gpp and wuee based on the two models the first order taylor series expansions of the total eta gpp and wuee derivatives were applied to the p m model and smpt sb model and compared with measured differences in eta gpp and wuee more than 60 of the difference in eta caused by the two irrigation methods was attributed to variations in the coupled surface resistance and drip irrigation mainly achieves water saving by reducing soil evaporation the difference in maize growth due to irrigation methods was the main reason for the differences in gpp the differences in vapor pressure deficit and the coupled surface resistance caused by irrigation methods were the main factors causing the difference in wuee it could be surmised that drip irrigation increased wuee in maize fields by changing surface resistance which mainly reduced soil evaporation keywords evapotranspiration gross primary productivity water use efficiency irrigation methods perturbation analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water use efficiency as an important index to evaluate water carbon coupling in terrestrial ecosystems is an important link between the ecological and hydrological processes of the ecosystem the ecosystem water use efficiency wuee can be defined as the ratio of gross primary production gpp to the actual evapotranspiration eta law et al 2002 hu et al 2008 zhou et al 2014 during the growth of crops wuee is one of the important indicators to evaluate agricultural production and water consumption tong et al 2009 currently climatic variables and agronomic managements have significantly altered wuee by influencing photosynthesis and transpiration thus exploring the wuee is critical in revealing the response of ecological and hydrological processes to global climatic changes and agronomic management and optimizing water and carbon management the eddy covariance technique can simultaneously measure the water carbon flux of the ecosystem which has promoted and facilitated the research of water use efficiency at different time scales and among different vegetation types niu et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 li et al 2022 this method is used to study the variability and the response of water use efficiency to climatic and soil variables at the ecosystem level yu et al 2001 zhou et al 2014 xie et al 2016 wang et al 2018 it was found that wuee decreased with increasing saturated vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation tong et al 2009 a study showed that net radiation rn air temperature ta and the rate of change in trunk diameter were the most significant factors influencing wuee lin et al 2018 the factors affecting wuee tend to differ on different time scales on a daily scale the main factor influencing wuee was the leaf area index lai wang et al 2018 on a monthly scale wuee and lai rn and ta have shown strong positive correlations xie et al 2016 and on an interannual scale ta was found to be the main factor influencing wuee wang et al 2018 although these studies have analyzed the controlling factors for ecosystem water use efficiency most of them analyzed the controlling factors for their seasonal and interannual variability in contrast there are few analyses especially contribution analysis on the factors influenced by the shift in irrigation method the arid region of northwest china is located between asia and europe where water resources are severely scarce and the ecological environment is extremely fragile in recent years the chinese government has widely promoted drip irrigation under film mulch technology in northwest china this technology not only improved the soil temperature and reduced water evaporation but also effectively reduced deep leakage and thus provided a feasible method to alleviate water shortages liu et al 2017 2017 qin et al 2019 different irrigation methods directly lead to differences in micro climates of farmland ecosystems and crop growth the eta and gpp of crops are affected by the irrigation methods which in turn affect wuee however the main factors controlling wuee under different irrigation methods need to be further clarified to explore how the irrigation methods separately and jointly impact variability in eta gpp and wuee a 4 year record of half hourly water and carbon flux under drip irrigation and border irrigation measured by the eddy covariance method is analyzed and a perturbation analysis was conducted on the penman monteith model e g wilson and baldocchi 2000 stoy et al 2006 and stomatal conductance photosynthetic transpiration coupling model yu et al 2003 zhang et al 2013 the primary objective of this study is to isolate the contributions of biophysical factors controlling eta gpp and wuee under two irrigation systems in the arid region of northwest china it is envisaged that such analysis can pinpoint some of the physical and biological variables that impact eta gpp and wuee under different irrigation systems thereby assisting an improvement of the farmland management practices as well as adaption to future climatic change 2 materials and methods 2

temperate continental arid climate the annual mean temperature is 8 c and the annual rainfall in the study area is 164 mm the annual average sunshine hours exceed 3000 h and the annual average cumulative temperature is more than 3550 c li et al 2013 two eddy covariance systems were installed in the centers of two experiment fields two irrigation methods were used in the two experimental areas one was drip irrigation under film mulching di and the other was border irrigation with film mulching bi and the mulching ratio was 0 75 the spacing of the drip irrigation belt was 0 8 m the experimental area for di was 400 m long and 200 m wide while the test area for bi was 500 m long and 250 m wide to make the irrigation more uniform it was divided into small plots of 15 m 30 m the two experimental areas were separated by a road the specific instrument layout and field schematic diagram was shown in fig 1 in this study the widely used fsam model was used to calculate the extent of the flux contribution schmid 1994 90 of the flux information came from within 125 m of the windward direction the local prevailing wind direction was northwest and the zone of flux contribution from the prevailing wind direction fell in the maize farmland in the test area therefore the area of our observation zone met the wind surge zone requirement the soil texture at the two experimental sites

height hc were manually measured during the growing seasons the lai and hc were measured at intervals of 7 or 10 days from seedling to crop harvest and the intervals were the same for the drip irrigation and border irrigation systems in the field six different locations were randomly selected and representative plants were chosen at each site to manually measure the length and width of each leaf as well as the height of maize according to the empirical formula guo et al 2019 the lai of maize leaves was calculated from 4 l a i 0 74 i 1 n l i w i d s where l i is the length of the leaf w i is the width of the leaf d and s are the distance in m between two rows and the space between two plants respectively and 0 74 is an empirical constant when maize was harvested five representative sample plots with an area of 2 m2 were randomly selected for both drip irrigation and border irrigation the organs stems leaves roots and seeds were split the seeds were baked to a constant weight at 70 and then 100 seeds were randomly weighed to measure the 100 kernel weight and the total weight of the seeds and the natural yield was calculated according to the moisture content of 13 by volume 2 5 data processing the water and carbon data measured by eddy covariance systems were collected at a frequency of 10 hz to facilitate the analysis the flux data were collected with a sampling frequency of 30 min and were corrected by using eddy pro 4 2 1 li cor inc lincoln ne usa software data processing mainly included quadratic coordinate rotation latent heat flux air density correction wpl correction random uncertainty analysis mann and lenschow and spectral correction the software evaluated the quality of ec data and the unreliable data could be deleted based on the assessment of the software as for the missing data when the latent heat le and the sensible heat h flux were missing at 0 2 h a linear interpolation method was used when the missing period was between 2 and 24 h the diurnal mean method falge et al 2001 was used to interpolate the latent heat flux and sensible heat flux data of the corresponding missing period when the continuous missing period is greater than 24 h the missing data of the corresponding period is interpolated by shuttleworth wallance shuttleworth and wallace 1985 energy balance closure ebr was a standard method to evaluate the quality of flux data the energy balance closure ratio used a linear regression between the turbulent fluxes le h and available energy rn g according to the regression analysis of half hour data the energy balance closure ratios of maize fields under drip irrigation from 2015 to 2018 were 0 68 0 69 0 67 and 0 68 the values under border irrigation were 0 70 0 71 0 69 and 0 73 respectively the values were the common range of results from previous studies mahrt 1998 twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2001 in order to solve the problem of energy non closure the bowen ratio forced closure method was used to correct the measured latent heat and sensible heat energy in the daytime the bowen ratio forced energy closure method was adopted to distribute the energy non closing difference to the latent and sensible heat flux according to the bowen ratio at night it was assumed that the observed value of sensible heat flux is reliable so the latent heat flux was calculated according to the energy balance formula qiu et al 2021 the carbon flux data processed by eddy pro software still need further screening since the stability of atmospheric conditions at night reduced the quality of the data we used the frictional wind speed u to process the data according to the average test method the strength of atmospheric turbulence can be expressed in terms of frictional wind speed and co2 flux data measured during this period can be considered credible only if the frictional wind speed is greater than a certain threshold this threshold is called the critical frictional wind speed we eliminated the night data when the frictional wind speed was less than the critical frictional wind speed from 2015 2018 the critical friction wind speeds were 0 15 m s 1 0 20 m s 1 0 18 m s 1 and 0 12 m s 1 respectively in order to achieve the continuity and integrity of the data interpolation was carried out data gaps caused by turbulent flux or instrument failure were divided into the short gap 2 h and the long gap 2 h gao et al 2017 the former was filled by linear interpolation while the latter was filled by statistical and empirical models baldocchi 2003 according to the calculation principle of the eddy covariance technique the net ecosystem exchange nee was directly observed by the instrument the observed value of gpp used in this paper was calculated by nee and ecosystem respiration er by comparing the applicability of different respiration models in arid areas of northwest china it was found that vant hoff model could better simulate maize nighttime respiration guo et al 2019

the p m model and smpt sb model compared favorably with the eddy covariance measured evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity at daily time scales gassmann et al 2019 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 are now used to analytically link evapotranspiration and gross primary variations to variations in physical and biological factors because of the analytical tractability of the two models it is ideal for conducting perturbation analyses intended to isolate the relative contributions of biophysical factors that give rise to differences in evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity between drip irrigation and border irrigation the perturbation analyses can be used to separate the factors affecting the variability of observations igarashi et al 2015 the biophysical impact of the irrigation method on eta was quantified as the eta difference δeta between drip irrigation and border irrigation fields using the following equation 24 δ eta et a di et a bi where etadi and etabi

evapotranspiration showed a clear seasonal pattern fig 2 a under the different irrigation conditions eta showed similar variations daily water consumption was small at the early stage of crop growth then increased with the growth of maize and gradually decreased with the maturity of maize senescence of maize leaves and decline of atmospheric evaporation capacity at the late growth stage the peak value of eta was generally measured in the middle of july the range of eta under the drip irrigation system was 0 3 8 2 mm d 1 and the range under the border irrigation system was 0 3 9 7 mm d 1 a comparison of daily evapotranspiration rates showed that drip irrigation reduced daily evapotranspiration rates by 1 14 compared to border irrigation except in 2018 fig 3 in terms of the total amount of evapotranspiration in 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 the seasonal average eta under the drip irrigation system were 517 511 490 and 543 mm respectively and the corresponding border irrigation values were 616 521 581 and 525 mm respectively table 2 the four year average eta under di and bi were 515 and 561 mm and the average annual eta decreased by 46 mm under the drip irrigation system compared with that under the border irrigation system during the measurement period the 4 year average evapotranspiration eta was reduced by 8 for di compared to bi the 4 year average of total plant transpiration was 422 mm and 431 mm under drip irrigation and border irrigation respectively and soil evaporation was 93 mm and 129 mm under the two irrigation methods compared with border irrigation drip irrigation reduced plant transpiration and soil evaporation by 2 and 28 respectively the variation of gpp was consistent with that in eta the crop s ability to photosynthesize was weak in the early stages of growth gradually increasing as the crop develops and then slowly decreasing as the crop aged the values in the early and late measurement stages were small and reached peak values in mid july fig 2b the gpp under di was greater than that under bi in the early stage of maize growth and development which was due to the crop growth promoted by the adoption of drip irrigation and was consistent with the trend of lai by comparing the average rate of gpp during the growth period it can be seen that the average daily rate of gpp under di increased by 12 7 and 5 respectively compared to bi in all three years except 2017 fig 4 in 2017 drip irrigation maize was infected with red rust disease resulting in poor growth of maize plants thus the pattern of 2017 differs from that of the other three years the values of gpp under di were 1705 1427 1069 and 1252 g c m 2 from 2015 to 2018 the corresponding values under bi were 1285 1273 1446 and 1209 g c m 2 the average gpps over the 4 years under di and bi were 1363 and 1303 g c m 2 and the gpp under di was 60 g c m 2 higher than that under bi the gpp under the two irrigation methods fluctuated significantly during the entire observation period which was mainly caused by the variations in soil moisture and radiation that occurred during the measurement period fig s2 our previous study on the variation of carbon flux of maize under drip irrigation in northwest china confirmed that gpp was significantly positively correlated with net radiation lai soil moisture and air temperature guo et al 2021 4 2 seasonal and interannual variations of wuee under drip and border irrigation systems compared with eta and gpp the seasonal variation of wuee was rather drastic fig 5 except for 2017 the annual averages of the other three years were higher for the drip irrigation system than for the border irrigation system the wuee values in 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 were 3 30 2 79 2 18 and 2 31 g c kg 1 h2o under di the corresponding wuee values were 2 09 2 44 2 49 and 2 30 g c kg 1 h2o under bi the difference in wuee between the two irrigation methods was significant p 0 05 the four year average wuee values for the drip irrigation and border irrigation systems were 2 65 0 44 and 2 33 0 16 g c kg 1 h2o respectively table 2 by comparing the wuee of the two irrigation methods it was not difficult to find that the wuee of the drip irrigation system was higher than that of the border irrigation system in the three years excluding 2017 the wuee values in the drip irrigation system were 58 14 and 1 higher than those in the border irrigation system in 2015 2016 and 2018 respectively as explained in the previous section in 2017 drip irrigated maize was infected with red rust disease which resulted in poor plant growth as a result drip irrigated maize showed an obvious reduction in water use efficiency from the perspective of different growth stages the wuee values at each growing stage did not differ obviously except in the seeding stage during this stage the wuee values were low fig 6 c in 2015 the wuee values under drip irrigation were higher than those under border irrigation at each growth stage of maize in 2016 and 2018 the water use efficiency values at different growing stages were not consistent between the two irrigation methods the wuee values under bi were higher than those under di at the heading stage in 2016 while those under bi were higher than those under di at the seeding and filling stage in 2018 the wuee under di was greater than that under bi at the shooting stage in all three years except 2017 at the maturity stage in maize the wuee showed a similar variation according to the definition of water use efficiency it is clear that the value of water use efficiency was closely related to gpp and eta drip irrigation promoted maize growth and increased lai fig s3 making gpp greater than border irrigation at the same time drip irrigation reduced soil evaporation this made the percentage of t from et slightly higher than bi therefore the wuee showed inconsistent variation at different fertility stages under both irrigation methods 4 3 performance of the p m model and the smpt sb model we assessed the performance of the p m model and smpt sm model in capturing the observed eta and gpp the relationship between the observed eta and the calculated eta based on the p m model was shown in fig 7 the calculated and observed eta followed the 1 1 line with regression slopes ranging from 0 85 to 1 02 fig 7 the results under di in the growing season showed that the r2 values were higher than 0 82 the results under bi also followed the 1 1 line but have more scatter fig 7 e f g h the performance of the smpt sb model was shown in fig 8 the slopes of the regression between the calculated and observed gpp ranged from 0 81 to 1 00 the results under di yield r2 values ranging from 0 91 to 0 97 the results under bi were slightly worse than those under di with regression slopes ranging from 0 81 to 0 88 fig 8 e f g h the results under bi in the growing season showed that the r2 values were higher than 0 88 the rmses between the observed eta and the calculated eta based on the p m model were shown in fig 7 generally the rmses under di were close to those under bi there was no obvious difference in rmse between the two irrigation methods in 2015 the calculated value was closest to the observed values under the two irrigation methods the simulation error in 2016 and 2018 was larger than those in 2015 the rmses between the observed gpp and the calculated gpp based on the smpt sb model were shown in fig 8 the rmse under di in 2018 was the smallest among the four years followed by 2015 and the largest in 2016 the results for rmse under bi were similar to those under di with the smallest rmse in 2018 and the largest in 2017 in general the p m model and the smpt sb model could simulate the variation patterns of eta and gpp well therefore further analysis of their control factors could be performed 4 4 analysis of the influencing factors of δeta δgpp and δwuee by perturbation analysis to analyze the reasons for the differences in eta δeta gpp δgpp and wuee δwuee between drip and border irrigation methods we analyzed the contributions of the factors affecting δeta δgpp and δwuee by using the p m model and smpt sb model among the factors affecting the δeta the difference in vpd and coupled surface resistance rco accounted for a large proportion fig 9 a the available energy rn g played a positive role in δeta in 2015 2016 and 2018 while the effect was not obvious in 2017 the difference in vpd between 2016 2017and 2018 weakened the observed eta differences which was particularly evident in 2016 the effect of coupled surface resistance on δeta was most pronounced in 2015 2018 more than 60 difference in eta was caused by rco the smpt sb model was used to analyze the influences of the atmospheric co2 concentration cr atmospheric temperature ta atmospheric relative humidity rh air resistance ra canopy boundary layer resistance rbw and canopy internal resistance ric on gpp among all the influencing factors the rbw and ric accounted for a relatively high proportion at 94 96 102 and 87 in 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 9 b the canopy boundary layer resistance and canopy internal resistance were closely related to crops such as leaf area index and the width of leaves among these factors affecting wuee the contributions of rco and vpd to explaining differences in wuee were relatively large fig 10 the vpd of the maize field under di was greater than that of the bi fig s2 while the wuee of the maize field under di was greater than that of the bi so the difference in vpd caused by the two irrigation methods showed a positive effect on δwuee rn g had a negative effect on the difference in wuee and rbw also made a large contribution to the difference in wuee in 2017 as the available energy increases the evapotranspiration capacity of the farmland increases which in turn could lead to a decrease in water use efficiency the results showed that the influences of rco and rbw caused by the irrigation method on wuee were greater than the influences of other environmental factors and over 47 of the differences were caused by rco the increase in coupled surface resistance meant that it became more difficult for water in the farmland to enter the atmosphere and the evapotranspiration capacity of the whole farmland decreased reducing the water consumption of the farmland and thus increasing the wuee 5 discussion 5 1 effect of different irrigation methods on eta gpp and wuee the irrigation method could alter the amount and distribution of soil water and has a certain effect on crop growth xu et al 2016 drip irrigation as one of the water saving irrigation methods has been proven in reducing crop water consumption evett et al 2019 e compared the eta of sprinkler irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation and the results showed that compared with sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation reduced the eta of maize by 13 15 compared with furrow irrigation drip irrigation could reduce eta by more than half qiu et al 2011 qin et al 2016 also confirmed the effectiveness of drip irrigation in reducing eta by comparing the variations of soil evaporation and plant transpiration observed under the two irrigation methods it can be seen that drip irrigation mainly achieves water savings by reducing soil evaporation the transpiration of maize under the two irrigation methods did not differ much while the soil evaporation under di was significantly less than that under bi table 2 the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration showed that with drip irrigation the transpiration capacity of the entire farmland rose and more irrigation water entered the atmosphere through plant transpiration fig s4 plant photosynthesis is influenced by a combination of environmental factors irrigation systems often vary somewhat from one irrigation method to another patnaik and biswal 2020 found that irrigation was one of the important influencing factors when they studied the variations of gpp in a long time series in india the effect of irrigation amount on photosynthesis was that too much or too little irrigation amount would affect the maximum photosynthetic rate of plants li et al 2021 c j wang et al 2020 y h wang et al 2020 j w wang et al 2020 showed that the maximum photosynthetic rate was increased by 21 1 in drip irrigated maize fields compared to rainfed fields reddy et al 1982 found that when the irrigation interval is longer it may cause soil water stress which may lead to a decrease in the photosynthetic rate of maize because the irrigation frequency of drip irrigation was higher than that of border irrigation surface soil moisture was suitable for maize growth in the long term fig s2 except for the poor growth of drip irrigation maize in 2017 due to red rust disease the lai of maize under di was greater than bi which was consistent with the total gpp value fig s3 therefore the photosynthetic rate of the maize canopy under di was greater than that under bi the analysis of the factors affecting gpp also showed that the differences in crop growth due to irrigation methods were the main reason for the differences in gpp fig 9b our results showed that switching from conventional irrigation to drip irrigation improved the wuee by 14 the gross primary productivity and yield are closely related regarding the effect of irrigation methods on water use efficiency most studies have used the index of yield to water consumption ratio wue y yield et for comparison with other studies we also analyzed the differences in wuey under the two irrigation methods in our study wuey was 1 65 and 1 49 kg m 3 for drip and border irrigation respectively with drip irrigation improving by 11 fig 11 the drip irrigated maize yield from 2015 to 2018 was only 2 65 higher than the border irrigation on average while the total water consumption was 8 less thus drip irrigation played a major contribution in enhancing water use efficiency in terms of water savings guo et al 2022 found that the yield and water use efficiency of the crop increased by 9 7 and 30 2 respectively with drip irrigation compared to conventional irrigation the increase in water use efficiency was significantly greater than the yield indicating that drip irrigation was more significant in reducing water consumption this is consistent with the results of our research however c wang et al 2021 showed that drip irrigation promoted maize yield and water use efficiency by improving the photosynthetic characteristics of maize in our study both irrigation methods were adequate irrigation therefore maize was not subjected to water stress throughout the growing season and thus did not affect the photosynthetic characteristics of maize in contrast with drip irrigation soil evaporation was reduced by 28 and total gpp was increased by only 5 therefore it assumed that drip irrigation increased the wuee by reducing soil evaporation from this study it found that based on the actual management practices of local farmers the ecosystem water use efficiency increased by 14 on average on a large farmland scale with drip irrigation unable to always be more than a 20 improvement as concluded by many other field experiments the evapotranspiration was reduced by only 7 and the total amount of irrigation water under drip irrigation is reduced by 25 mainly due to the reduction of soil evaporation and deep leakage y wang et al 2021 however according to the experimental results for many years the irrigation system of drip irrigation in northwest china needs to be further optimized it has been found that deficit irrigation can not only reduce water consumption but also increase crop yield some studies have found that an appropriate reduction of irrigation amount can change the proportion of photosynthate distribution thus increasing crop yield wang et al 2020 2020 2020 ali et al 2021 therefore while actively promoting drip irrigation technology the government should guide farmers to adopt a reasonable irrigation system such as deficit irrigation to further achieve the goal of water saving and yield increase in the arid areas of northwest china 5 2 controlling factors of water use efficiency in agro ecosystems from the results shown in table 2 the average wuee under the drip irrigation system was higher than that under the border irrigation system over the four studied years our results confirmed the important role of biophysical factors in controlling the difference of wuee under drip irrigation and border irrigation methods fig 10 which is also the primary reason for the consistent differences between eta and gpp crop growth and water use efficiency are closely related some experts and scholars have also carried out related studies in a study of maize fields in northeast china they concluded that on a daily scale lai was the only factor controlling wuee hu et al 2008 reported that lai had an important impact on the water carbon cycles of the ecosystems thus affecting the variation in wuee when lai was small wuee rose rapidly with increasing lai while when lai tended to be stable stomatal factors were the dominant factors affecting wuee tong et al 2009 in our research it was found that the biological factors were the main reason for the difference in gpp between the two irrigation methods fig 9 and the effect on wuee was mainly reflected in the coupled surface resistance the canopy boundary layer resistance and the internal canopy resistance our results showed that the proportion of vpd was positive indicating that the higher δvpd increased δwuee fig 10 vpd is considered to be one of the main environmental factors affecting wuee and this was confirmed by many studies ponton et al 2006 tong et al 2014 x h j liu et al 2017 x d liu et al 2017 jia et al 2016 in addition to vpd the effects of solar radiation and temperature on wuee are obvious solar radiation affects wue mainly by influencing the photosynthesis of plants jiang et al 2022 guo et al 2010 found that the high temperature was helpful to improve the wuee while li et al 2015 reported that higher temperature had a limiting effect on the wuee since the difference in air temperature in the maize field between the two irrigation methods was not significant fig s2 therefore the contribution of ta and to δwuee was small soil moisture is thought to be the important factor that controls the exchange of water and carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere kurc and small 2007 therefore the impact on wuee cannot be ignored x h j liu et al 2017 x d liu et al 2017 concluded that the wuee decreased significantly as the soil moisture content increased and similar results have been concluded in many studies jia et al 2016 tong et al 2014 however the impact of soil moisture on wuee is often also influenced by vpd when vpd is low there is a negative correlation between soil moisture and wuee when vpd is high the increase in soil moisture can promote the increase of wuee li et al 2021 in our study we found that soil moisture directly influenced the values of coupled surface resistance as can be seen from fig 10 the difference in rco due to the two irrigation methods was the main factor contributing to δwuee soil moisture under di was higher than that under bi throughout the growing stages of maize however drip irrigation promotes crop growth making lai under di greater than bi fig s3 therefore less energy reaches the surface under drip irrigation conditions thus suppressing soil evaporation thus drip irrigation increased wuee in maize fields by changing surface resistance 6 conclusions in this study through analyzing the 4 year water carbon flux data of drip irrigation and border irrigation the evapotranspiration gross primary productivity and ecosystem water use efficiency under different irrigation methods were compared based on first order taylor series expansions of the p m model and smpt sb model the perturbation analysis was employed to analyze the influencing factors of eta gpp and wuee drip irrigation reduced the average annual eta by 8 compared with the value under border irrigation the gpp under drip irrigation was 5 higher than that under border irrigation the wuee under drip irrigation was 14 higher than that under border irrigation through simulations of eta gpp and wuee under drip irrigation and border irrigation methods the contribution ratio of biophysical factors to the eta gpp and wuee difference was analyzed more than 60 of the difference in eta caused by the two irrigation methods was attributed to variations in the coupled surface resistance and drip irrigation mainly achieves water saving by reducing soil evaporation the difference in maize growth due to irrigation methods was the main reason for the differences in gpp drip irrigation technology not only altered the water consumption of farmland but also promoted crop growth and improved the carbon sequestration capacity of maize it also had an impact on the ecosystem water use efficiency through perturbation analysis it was found that the difference in wuee caused by the irrigation methods was mainly attributed to differences in the coupled surface resistance and vpd which mainly reduced soil evaporation declaration of

9364,biochar application improves soil environment and thus enhances crop yields however its optimum application rate is site and crop specific our aim is to determine the optimum biochar application rate obar in sugar beet by investigating its influences on economic profit a 3 year field biochar application test for sugar beet was conducted in xinjiang china plastic film mulch and drip irrigation were applied five treatments of biochar application rates were made for each treatment same biochar rates i e 0 10 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 were applied in each year from 2018 to 2020 with a few exceptions where biochar rates were manipulated according to the results of the first two years the physiological ecology indicators irrigation water and fertilizer productivities and economic profit were analyzed the n p and k uptake during growth stages of sugar beet the physiological ecology indicators e g aboveground and underground biomass leaf area index and sugar content increased with increase in biochar application rate the irrigation water and partial fertilizer productivities and economic benefits were the greatest at the biochar application of 10 t ha 1 for each year which was recommended as the best dose for sugar beet planting for sugar beet planting in arid and semi arid zone continuous application with obar of 10 t ha 1 had the maximal economical profit the net profit increase was 6 94 billion dollars compared with no biochar application therefore considering the comprehensive responses of the nutrient uptake salt absorption yield and the economic benefit of various biochar application rate the biochar application rate of 10 t ha 1 year 1 was recommended as the optimum dose there were complicated interactions of soil biochar and crops further studies

crop but also an energy crop the sugar beet planting area accounts for 48 of sugar crops next to sugarcane compared to sugarcane sugar beet contains 30 more sugar and requires lower fertilizer than sugarcane ahmad et al 2015 in addition to direct consumption beet sugar is also a raw material for the food and medical industry alcohol glycerol acetaldehyde and acetone can be extracted from

solid carbon rich material it is produced by putting biomass in an oxygen limited environment during a pyrolysis procedure under temperature of 350 800 alves et al 2021 joseph and lehmann 2009 biochar has been applied to agricultural systems as a soil conditioner for the purpose of increasing soil water retention and water nutrient availability hammer et al 2014 decreasing soil bulk density and increase soil porosity liang et al 2021 increasing soil organic content soil fertility and nutrient uptake abou hussien et al 2020 and enhancing crop growth yields and productivities akhtar et al 2014 jeffery et al 2011 li et al 2022 biochar has great potential for the successful improvement of crop productivity especially in poor soils such as salinized land in addition biochar has been also considered as a good choice for soil carbon sequestration and it may contribute much to the moderation of global climate change oni et al 2019 smith 2016 biochar has been applied to low yield farmlands to enhance productivity for different kinds of crops or vegetables such as wheat maize rice cotton sugar beet and tomato akhtar et al 2015 arif et al 2016 liang 2021 major et al 2010 numerous researches showed that proper application of biochar improved crop growth yields and productivities aguirre et al 2021 andreev et al 2016 gonzález pernas et al 2022 gu et al 2021 rafael et al 2019 reibe et al 2015 however only a few studies have investigated biochar application influences on sugar beet productivity for example abou hussien et al 2020 added biochar into the contaminated soil at rates of 0 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 in menoufia governorate egypt different applications of biochar significantly increased the fresh and dry matter yields of sugar beet roots and shoots and the highest weights g pot 1 were observed at the rate of 2 bouqbis et al 2021 conducted comparative analysis of the effects of biochar on the growth of different plants with various biochar dose they observed a significant improvement of the biomass of plants when applying a mixture of biochar and compost at 6 for quinoa and sugar beet and at 4 for alfalfa koga et al 2017 applied wood residue derived biochar at rates of 0 10 20 and 40 t ha 1 for potatoes winter wheat sugar beet and soybeans cultivated in rotation and measured yield and quality of the harvested materials however the results showed that biochar application did not significantly affect the yield and quality of potatoes wheat sugar beet and soybean except for soybean grain yield ahmad et al 2015 applied nitrogen at the rate of 140 kg ha 1 mixed with biochar at the rate of 25 and 50 t ha 1 in pakistan they found that 50 t ha 1 biochar application resulted in maximum leaf area leaf area index root length root weight plant 1 kg and sugar sucrose and hence recommended for maximum production of yield and yield related parameters of sugar beet alves et al 2021 investigated effects of two types of biochar produced from sewage sludge and from a 1 1 mixture of sewage sludge and sugarcane bagasse on soil properties and sugar beet production using a sandy loam soil under treatments of mixture biochar applications at 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 sewage sludge biochar application at 5 0 and a conventional fertilization opposite to the above mentioned results they found that in the biochar treatments even at higher application rates sugar beet production was significantly lower than that in the conventional fertilization treatment sugar beet yields at 10 0 of sugarcane bagasse biochar application and 5 0 of sewage sludge biochar application corresponded to 55 and 29 of the yield in conventional fertilization treatment respectively lebrun et al 2022b evaluated 2 and 5 w w biochar addition manure and their blend to soil moisture nutrients and physiological parameters of sugar beet their results showed that leaf and tuber yields increased furthest when applying combined biochar manure blends 2 times compared to the control previous researches indicated much useful information about biochar effects on crop growth yield and production however the influences of biochar on crops were complicated because of the differences of the biochar diverse field management irrigation fertilization rotation and cultivation methods regional soil conditions climate and crop varieties the limited number of biochar sugar beet related researches and inconsistent results of biochar effects on sugar beet revealed that the optimum biochar application rate obar of sugar beet planting and production should be carefully determined based on carefully observation and rational economic analysis in this study field planting experiments were conducted in an arid and semi arid region in south xinjiang china over sugar beet growth seasons of 2018 2020 with an objective to identify the obar for sugar beet biochar was continuously applied at the rate ranges of 0 10 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 the plastic film mulched drip irrigation and fertilization schedules were the same for all treatments the nutrient phosphorus potassium and nitrogen uptake leaf chlorophyll content growth yield and quality irrigation fertilization utilization efficiency and economic benefits were comprehensively compared and analyzed finally the obar was determined to help improving biochar application strategy in the salt affected lands 2

through a 1 mm in diameter sieve the specific measurement methods of initial soil physical chemical properties saw liang et al 2021 for details detailed soil physical and chemical properties are presented in table s1 following staff 2006 the soil texture at the 0 50 and 50 100 cm depths were classified as silt clay loam and sand respectively the soil salt content ss was estimated using the calibrated relationship of ss 3 4238 ec1 5 1 0513 r2 0 95 n 150 ss at the 0 60 cm depth ranged between 0 1 0 2 and ratio of chloride to sulfate ion ranged from 20 to 100 therefore the saline soils were classified chloride sulfate at light salinized level xu 1980 2 3 field tests 2 3 1 biochar application treatments the biochar was produced by pyrolysis of fruit branch of palmetto trachycarpus fortunei hook h wendl at 500 600 under anoxia condition zhengzhou yongbang new energy equipment technology co ltd china the basic properties of the biochar used in the experiments was shown in table 1 the experiment was established as random complete block design with three replicated the size of each plot was 6 m 6 m a 1 5 m wide road was set between the adjacent plots the 2 0 m wide protect rows were designed and planted with sugar beet around the side plots biochar was continuously applied from 2018 to 2020 before sowing the biochar was uniformly spread on soil surface of plots thoroughly mixed with the soils and then plowed from the surface to 30 cm depth for each plot five treatments were made for each treatment same biochar rates i e 0 10 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 were applied in each year from 2018 to 2020 with a few exceptions where biochar rates were manipulated according to the results of the first two years i e 30 t ha 1 was applied for the treatment of 50 t ha 1 in 2020 treatments of 25 in year 2018 and 100 t ha 1 in 2020 were not designed namely in 2018 four biochar treatments with rates of 0 10 50 and 100 t ha 1 named as b0 b10 b50 and b100 in turn were designed from the general results of 2018 biochar application amounts of 10 and 50 t ha 1 showed big differences in crop growth characteristics liang et al 2021 therefore from 2019 a biochar application rate of 25 t ha 1 named as b25 was added the biochar application amounts of 100 t ha 1 were found to be very uneconomic therefore in 2020 b100 treatment was stopped and the treatments b0 b10 b25 and b30 were designed and application rate of 30 t ha 1 were continuously added to b50 table s2 2 3 2 crop cultivation and planting patterns the field plot design and experimental layout were shown in fig 1 the sugar beet variety was detian 7 the sugar beet sowing dates were 12 11 and 15 in april and the harvesting dates were 14 13 and 17 in september for year 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the sugar beet was sown at a seed density of 20 m 2 the field arrangement was the same as the local pattern of one plastic film two drip lines and three rows fig 1a the width of the plastic film was 106 cm the sugar beet rows were 35 cm vertical to drip lines the main growth stages of sugar beet are seedling leaf cluster rapid growth sugar growth and sugar accumulation the corresponding growth periods of seedling leaf cluster rapid growth sugar growth and sugar accumulation in 2018 2019 and 2020 stars from june 4 6 and 8 june 20 22 and 26 july 11 13 and 16 as well as august 25 27 and 31 respectively the irrigation water was partitioned from the tarim river with 0 57 ec 2 51 ms cm 1 the irrigation and fertilization were conducted from june to august in 2018 2020 the detailed irrigation and fertilization schedules are presented in table s3 during the sugar beet growth seasons of 2018 2019 and 2020 the total amounts of irrigation urea diammonium phosphate and potassium sulphate were 260 mm 450 kg ha 1 265 kg ha 1 and 99 kg ha 1 respectively a 300 mm flood irrigation was applied around november to leach the accumulated soil salts 2 3 3 measurement of dry matter and nutrient uptake during the main growth stages three pillars of representative sugar beet plants for each treatment were selected and the sugar beet taproots stems leaves were separated with a strong shear then all plant parts were taken back to the laboratory the soils on the surface of the plant were cleaned with deionized water the partitioned plant parts were put into the oven at 105 for 2 h and then oven dried to constant weight at 75 an electronic balance with a precision of 0 01 g was used to measure the dry matter weight the dry matters were ground with a grinder and passed through a 0 5 mm sieve then disboiled with h2so4 h2o2 and heating digested the contents of phosphorus potassium and nitrogen were measured by a vanadium molybdenum yellow spectrophotometry an atomic absorption spectrophotometer hitachi z 2000 series and an aa3 continuous flow analyzer germany bran luebbe respectively 2 3 4 observation of physiological ecology indicators of sugar beet twenty days after sowing germinated seeds were counted and the germination rate was calculated using the following formula saxena et al 2013 1 germination rate number of seeds germinated number of seeds sown every 10 15 days during growth seasons six plants within the plots were randomly selected to measure sugar beet growth indicators including aboveground biomass tuber biomass height and leaf area index lai the plant height and leaf area were measured using a tape and the stem diameter was measured by a vernier caliper the lai is estimated by garcía vila et al 2009 2 lai 0 84 ε i m j n l ij w ij m 10 4 where

plant and 0 84 is the conversion coefficient zong et al 2021 a 6 67 m2 area in each plot of sugar beet was pre labeled for yield measurement and manually harvesting the aboveground and underground biomass of sugar beet were collected and taken to the laboratory for air drying and mass weighing sugar content of beet was measured by a saccharometer the ash content of aboveground branches and tubers of sugar beet were extracted by muffle furnace high temperature combustion method to determine the salt absorption of different prats for sugar beet 2 4 assessment of the efficiency and benefit 2 4 1 irrigation water and partial fertilizer productivities the irrigation water productivity iwp is the ratio of sugar beet yield t ha 1 and irrigation amount mm the partial fertilizer productivity pfp of phosphorus potassium and nitrogen are calculated for each treatment using the ratio of sugar beet yield to fertilizer amount kg kg 1 the equations are written as li et al 2018 3 iwp yield irrigation amount 4 pfp yield fertilizer amount 2 4 2 economic analysis the total monetary cost of materials water and labor was calculated for each plot the material costs are fees of biochar fertilizers including urea potassium dihydrogen phosphate and potassium sulfate sugar beet seeds plastic film drip irrigation pipes agricultural machinery and pesticides the economic benefit net

the differences in the soil physicochemical properties between different treatments by the least significant differences lsd at the p 0 05 level 3 results 3 1 nutrient uptake salt content and sugar content of sugar beet affected by biochar 3 1 1 nutrient uptake the nutrient n p and k uptake for aboverground shoot and underground tuber of sugar beet during three growth stages of 2018 and 2019 is shown in fig 2 under most circumstances biochar addition increased the nutrient n p and k uptake when compared to no biochar treatment both for aboverground shoot and underground tuber of sugarbeet the nutrient uptake in aboverground shoot were higher than in underground tuber especially for n uptake in 2018 as to n uptake of underground tuber the maximal values occurred for b10 treatment in 2018 and b25 treatment in 2019 however the maximal n uptake values of aboverground shoot occurred in b10 b50 or b100 treatments at the three growth stages in 2018 and in b10 or b25 treatments in 2019 the p uptake patterns were generally similar to the n uptake pattern although its actual values were much lower the maximal k uptake values of aboverground shoot and underground tuber at different growth stages occurred in b10 treatment in 2018 but varied from b10 b25 b50 or b100 treatments in 2019 the peak values of nutrient uptake occurred in different biochar application treatments the high surface area and porous nature and capacity to act as a medium for microorganisms of biochar are the main reasons for the increased nutrient uptake by plants in biochar treated soils nigussie et al 2012 3 1 2 salt absorption of sugar beet sugar beet is a salt tolerant crop without any biochar application b0 the aboveground and underground tissues of sugar beet absorbed salt 0 343 0 587 and 0 714 t ha 1 from saline alkali soils in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 3 the biochar application increased the salt absorption rate of sugar beet the sugar beet salt absorption rate of b10 treatment exhibited significant higher salt absorption ability than that of b0 b25 b30 b50 and b100 treatments salt absorption values in 2018 2019 and 2020 were 0 81 0 88 and 1 02 t ha 1 for aboveground shoot and 0 78 1 27 and 0 18 t ha 1 for underground tuber totaling 1 58 2 15 and 1 81 t ha 1 for the entire plant respectively results from fig 3 implied that proper application amount of biochar to sugar beet can reduce soil salinity however too high biochar application rate not only increased soil salinity but also inhibited the salt absorption of sugar beet 3 1 3 sugar content the observed quality indices of sugar beet in 2018 2019 and 2020 table 2 showed that tuber sugar content of sugar beet increased with the biochar application rates therefore in the 2 years biochar application rate of 100 t ha 1 b100 significantly increased sugar content 14 8 15 8 compared to the 3 years of no biochar treatment b0 12 8 13 1 for continuous application of biochar e g 10 10 10 25 25 50 50 30 and 100 100 t ha 1 sugar content increased from the first year compared to b0 treatment sugar content increase percentage was not proportional to the biochar application rate the largest increment percentage was 20 6 3 2 physiological ecology indicators of sugar beet affected by biochar 3 2 1 germination rate the germination rates of sugar beet varied with different biochar application rates fig 4 in 2018 2019 and 2020 sugar beet germination rate ranged between 0 56 and 0 79 0 63 0 74 and 0 59 0 75 the reasons for the generally low germination rate may be two fold i there was clomazone residual in soils and ii sugar beet germination is sensitive to soil environment e g water content temperature salt and nutrient the largest values occurred at 10 t ha 1 of biochar application rate significant differences were found between b10 and other treatments the germination rates varied in the three years biochar application rate greater than 25 t ha 1 has not improved sugar beet germination rates when compared to b0 treatment 3 2 2 physiological ecology indicators the variations of aboveground biomass tuber biomass height and lai of sugar beet during growth stages of 2018 2019 and 2020 are shown in fig 5 except the biochar application treatment of b100 biochar treatments with no greater than 50 t ha 1 per year increased the sugar beet growth in all three years the treatment b10 obtained the best growth increase of sugar beet from the first to the third year when comparing same amount of biochar application rate namely b100 in the first year and b50 in the second year continuous application with smaller dose showed advantages in sugar beet growth in addition sugar beet growth was still slightly improved by biochar application rate of 30 t ha 1 b50 b50 b30 in the third year there was a general increase of sugar beet growth indices before 95 105 days after sowing das for all treatments in all three years although the increase pattern for tuber biomass was different to that of aboveground biomass plant height and lai after 95 105 das the above ground biomass height and lai decreased with the increase of das the underground tuber biomass economic parts of sugar beet continuously increased during the growth seasons the differences of sugar beet growth indices were larger in 2019 than in 2018 especially for b10 treatment the tuber biomass increased the largest among different treatments in 2019 there was generally a decreasing rank of continuous application rate for increasing sugar beet growth namely 10 10 10 t ha 1 b10 25 25 t ha 1 b25 50 50 30 t ha 1 b50 b30 0 0 0 t ha 1 b0 and 100 100 t ha 1 b100 in turn the increasing patterns of underground tuber length tuber middle diameter and tap tuber diameter during growth stages of 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 6 the efficient biochar application of less than 50 t ha 1 consistently improved underground tuber biomass of sugar beet being consistent with the growth indices in fig 6 biochar application rate of 10 t ha 1 and 100 t ha 1 was the best and worst in improving tuber growth indicators of sugar beet especially in 2019 this was a very indicative information for determining an appropriate biochar application amount in sugar beet planting practice 3 3 productivities and economic benefits 3 3 1 water and fertilizer productivities of sugar beet affected by biochar the sugar beet yields irrigation water productivity iwp and partial fertilizer productivity pfp for n p and k in 2018 2019 and 2020 are presented in table 3 although there were differences among the three years the yields iwp and pfp for n p and k consistently had peak values for b10 treatment in 2018 2019 and 2020 and significant differences were found among different treatments of the same year the pfp of k was larger than pfps of n and p for the same treatment in certain year the b10 treatment followed by b25 and b50 treatments had greater yield and productivity than other treatments values of yields iwp and pfp of b100 treatment were significantly lower than that of b0 indicating less efficiency of water and fertilizer utilization in the three years in the third year b30 slightly increased the irrigation and fertilizer productivity of sugar beet compared to b0 3 3 2 economic benefit of biochar application on sugar beet the income cost and economic benefit of sugar beet at various biochar application rates are presented for different treatments and planting years table 4 the b0 and b10 treatments had significant higher economic benefits than b25 b50 and b100 of which b10 had the highest economic benefit in 2019 and 2020 b50 b50 and b100 b100 for the first two years had negative economic benefits the economic benefit ranked with biochar application rates of 10 0 25 50 100 t ha 1 b10 treatment has indicated its benefit increasing effects on sugar beet compared to b0 treatment from the first years continuous biochar application rates of 25 25 50 50 30 and 100 100 t ha 1 displayed negative and lower economic benefits especially in the first two years 4 discussion corp growth yield and productivity increment benefited from biochar application this can be attributed to the accompany nutrients n k ca mg input into the soils which was slowly released to plants over time bouqbis et al 2021 karer et al 2015 biochar has been proved to be beneficial on agricultural soil fertility and plant growth major et al 2010 saxena et al 2013 biochar application to soils also decreased soil bulk density and thus increased soil water content soil water storage and crop water availability which potentially contributed to enhanced crop productivity and water use efficiency li et al 2022 liang et al 2021 in addition although biochar brings some chemicals nutrition into soil it eventually decreased salt content of salt affected soils because i the plenty soluble cations in biochar exchanged with the na absorbed by soil colloid and ii the organics contained in biochar improved soil physicochemical properties and made salts leached out of root zone more easily li et al 2014 nigussie et al 2012 the improved soil physicochemical environment led to better growth and yields of crops saxena et al 2013 arif et al 2016 most researchers found that biochar application increased soil nutrients organic content ion and salt content arif et al 2016 bouqbis et al 2021 liang et al 2021 this was also shown from our tested results fig 7 especially for top soil layer figs 7a to 7c however crop growth did not increase linearly with the increase of biochar application rate the obar ranged from 5 to 50 t ha 1 for different crops abou hussien et al 2020 ahmad et al 2015 alves et al 2021 bouqbis et al 2021 koga et al 2017 lai et al 2013 lebrun et al 2022a major et al 2010 saxena et al 2013 the negative effect of large application rate on crop growth was reported for example rondon et al 2007 found that 165 t ha 1 of biochar application in a poor soil low organic content or salinized soils decreased crop yield this research also observed decreased growth yield productivities and economic benefit under 100 t ha 1 of biochar application rate from the responses of sugar beet nutrient uptake salt and sugar content physiological ecology indicators productivities and ecological benefits the obar for sugar beet was found to be 10 t ha 1 lebrun et al 2022b found that the application of 2 w w biochar manure blend achieved increased sugar beet yield under experimentally induced water stress drought conditions wu et al 2018 evaluated 1 3 and 5 w w biochar addition to growth endogenous hormone content yield and quality of sugar beet they found that the 3 treatment had the highest sugar yield this is different from our results which may be caused by different types and basic properties of biochar and different experimental conditions sugar beet plating area has been extended from 99 000 ha in 2014 213 000 ha in 2020 in china and the yields increased from 5 099 000 to 11 984 000 t correspondingly https caifuhao eastmoney com news 20211208091449189732330 if the sugar beet fields were applied biochar at the rate of 10 t ha 1 the net profit increase compared with no biochar application b0 are 6 94 billion dollars for china note that this is only a crude excise this is because the determination of obar is context specific it not only relates to the source material of biochar and application pattern dose way but also to the complicated soil environment and crop varieties anyway this study showed that biochar application has obvious economic profit potential when rationally applied however some studies have reported limited or no efficacy of biochar addition in temperate regions where soil fertility is sufficiently high güereña et al 2013 in addition some negative impacts on crop growth because of biochar application to soils have also been noted such as decreased nutrient availability due to biochars high sorption capacity brtnicky et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 for example reed et al 2017 found that biochar did not improve the growth and nutrient uptake of ryegrass one year after soil application therefore the effects of biochar on soil fertility and crop yield under different conditions need to be further studied sugar beet is salt tolerant with the increase of growth period the underground tuber of sugar beet not only absorbs more nutrient from soils but also absorbs more salts from soils especially at obar fig 4 which contributed to reducing soil salinity meanwhile the sugar content also increased with biochar application table 2 there were few studies investigating the de salinization effects of biochar application in sugar beet abou hussien et al 2020 found that biochar application increased the uptake of the determined heavy metals by sugar beet although this research did not reveal the mechanics of desalinization for sugar beet the interesting desalination phenomena of sugar beet brought some new insights for further investigation since the mechanism of biochar application on sugar beet yields were still not revealed further study will focus on these scientific questions and supply more useful information from technical respect in addition as a carbon sink biochar is a promising material for reducing ghg emissions in the present and future the part of the cost of biochar maybe covered by the carbon sink effect gonzález pernas et al 2022 however it is not involved in this study which will be further analyzed in future research 5 conclusions the biochar applications generally increased the n p and k uptake during different growth stages of sugar beet in 2018 2019 and 2020 the growth and yield related indicators were significant increased under biochar application conditions and the biochar application of 10 t ha 1 showed advantages in enhancing sugar beet growth and yields sugar content was increased with the increasing biochar application rate however the largest increase percentage was 20 6 which was not much beneficial compared to the biochar investment the irrigation water and partial fertilizer productivities also achieved peak values at the biochar application of 10 t ha 1 the economic analysis indicated the largest economic benefits at biochar application rate of 10 t ha 1 for all three years compared to no biochar application and biochar application rates of 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 overall considering the comprehensive responses of the nutrient uptake content the salt absorption rate the growth and yield related indices length height and lai for aboveground shoot and diameter of underground tuber and the economic benefit of changing biochar application rate obar namely 10 t ha 1 continuously applied for 3 years was recommended for sugar beet planting since there were complicated interactions of soil biochar and crops further studies involving multi discipline overlap are needed to reveal the yield quality and productivity increase mechanics of

9364,biochar application improves soil environment and thus enhances crop yields however its optimum application rate is site and crop specific our aim is to determine the optimum biochar application rate obar in sugar beet by investigating its influences on economic profit a 3 year field biochar application test for sugar beet was conducted in xinjiang china plastic film mulch and drip irrigation were applied five treatments of biochar application rates were made for each treatment same biochar rates i e 0 10 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 were applied in each year from 2018 to 2020 with a few exceptions where biochar rates were manipulated according to the results of the first two years the physiological ecology indicators irrigation water and fertilizer productivities and economic profit were analyzed the n p and k uptake during growth stages of sugar beet the physiological ecology indicators e g aboveground and underground biomass leaf area index and sugar content increased with increase in biochar application rate the irrigation water and partial fertilizer productivities and economic benefits were the greatest at the biochar application of 10 t ha 1 for each year which was recommended as the best dose for sugar beet planting for sugar beet planting in arid and semi arid zone continuous application with obar of 10 t ha 1 had the maximal economical profit the net profit increase was 6 94 billion dollars compared with no biochar application therefore considering the comprehensive responses of the nutrient uptake salt absorption yield and the economic benefit of various biochar application rate the biochar application rate of 10 t ha 1 year 1 was recommended as the optimum dose there were complicated interactions of soil biochar and crops further studies

live standard human requirements for quality and quantity of sugar are also increasing which challenges sugar industrial production sugar beet beta vulgaris l is not only an important sugar economic crop but also an energy crop the sugar beet planting area accounts for 48 of sugar crops next to sugarcane compared to sugarcane sugar beet contains 30 more sugar and requires lower fertilizer than sugarcane ahmad et al 2015 in addition to direct consumption beet sugar is also a raw material for the food and medical industry alcohol glycerol acetaldehyde and acetone can be extracted from molasses beet meal can be directly fed to livestock and mud can be used as fertilizer beet stem leaves green head root tail and residual old root after seed harvesting can be used as brewing raw materials or juicy feed sugar beet can germinate and grow under low saline alkali drought and cold conditions which allows it planted and grown with high economic benefit yang 2019 biochar is the solid carbon rich material it is produced by putting biomass in an oxygen limited environment during a pyrolysis procedure under temperature of 350 800 alves et al 2021 joseph and lehmann 2009 biochar has been applied to agricultural systems as a soil conditioner for the purpose of increasing soil water retention and water nutrient availability hammer et al 2014 decreasing soil bulk density and increase soil porosity liang et al 2021 increasing soil organic content soil fertility and nutrient uptake abou hussien et al 2020 and enhancing crop growth yields and productivities akhtar et al 2014 jeffery et al 2011 li et al 2022 biochar has great potential for the successful improvement of crop productivity especially in poor soils such as salinized land in addition biochar has been also considered as a good choice for soil carbon sequestration and it may contribute much to the moderation of global climate change oni et al 2019 smith 2016 biochar has been applied to low yield farmlands to enhance productivity for different kinds of crops or vegetables such as wheat maize rice cotton sugar beet and tomato akhtar et al 2015 arif et al 2016 liang 2021 major et al 2010 numerous researches showed that proper application of biochar improved crop growth yields and productivities aguirre et al 2021 andreev et al 2016 gonzález pernas et al 2022 gu et al 2021 rafael et al 2019 reibe et al 2015 however only a few studies have investigated biochar application influences on sugar beet productivity for example abou hussien et al 2020 added biochar into the contaminated soil at rates of 0 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 in menoufia governorate egypt different applications of biochar significantly increased the fresh and dry matter yields of sugar beet roots and shoots and the highest weights g pot 1 were observed at the rate of 2 bouqbis et al 2021 conducted comparative analysis of the effects of biochar on the growth of different plants with various biochar dose they observed a significant improvement of the biomass of plants when applying a mixture of biochar and compost at 6 for quinoa and sugar beet and at 4 for alfalfa koga et al 2017 applied wood residue derived biochar at rates of 0 10 20 and 40 t ha 1 for potatoes winter wheat sugar beet and soybeans cultivated in rotation and measured yield and quality of the harvested materials however the results showed that biochar application did not significantly affect the yield and quality of potatoes wheat sugar beet and soybean except for soybean grain yield ahmad et al 2015 applied nitrogen at the rate of 140 kg ha 1 mixed with biochar at the rate of 25 and 50 t ha 1 in pakistan they found that 50 t ha 1 biochar application resulted in maximum leaf area leaf area index root length root weight plant 1 kg and sugar sucrose and hence recommended for maximum production of yield and yield related parameters of sugar beet alves et al 2021 investigated effects of two types of biochar produced from sewage sludge and from a 1 1 mixture of sewage sludge and sugarcane bagasse on soil properties and sugar beet production using a sandy loam soil under treatments of mixture biochar applications at 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 sewage sludge biochar application at 5 0 and a conventional fertilization opposite to the above mentioned results they found that in the biochar treatments even at higher application rates sugar beet production was significantly lower than that in the conventional fertilization treatment sugar beet yields at 10 0 of sugarcane bagasse biochar application and 5 0 of sewage sludge biochar application corresponded to 55 and 29 of the yield in conventional fertilization treatment respectively lebrun et al 2022b evaluated 2 and 5 w w biochar addition manure and their blend to soil moisture nutrients and physiological parameters of sugar beet their results showed that leaf and tuber yields increased furthest when applying combined biochar manure blends 2 times compared to the control previous researches indicated much useful information about biochar effects on crop growth yield and production however the influences of biochar on crops were complicated because of the differences of the biochar diverse field management irrigation fertilization rotation and cultivation methods regional soil conditions climate and crop varieties the limited number of biochar sugar beet related researches and inconsistent results of biochar effects on sugar beet revealed that the optimum biochar application rate obar of sugar beet planting and production should be carefully determined based on carefully observation and rational economic analysis in this study field planting experiments were conducted in an arid and semi arid region in south xinjiang china over sugar beet growth seasons of 2018 2020 with an objective to identify the obar for sugar beet biochar was continuously applied at the rate ranges of 0 10 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 the plastic film mulched drip irrigation and fertilization schedules were the same for all treatments the nutrient phosphorus potassium and nitrogen uptake leaf chlorophyll content growth yield and quality irrigation fertilization utilization efficiency and economic benefits were comprehensively compared and analyzed finally the obar was determined to help improving biochar application strategy in the salt affected lands 2

variations of the daily weather elements in the three year crop growing seasons are shown in fig s1 2 2 measurement of initial soil physical chemical properties before sowing in 2018 soil samples in 0 100 cm depth were collected at a 10 cm for 40 50 and 50 60 cm depths or 20 cm interval other depths to measure the initial soil physicochemical properties soil samples were air dried ground and passed through a 1 mm in diameter sieve the specific measurement methods of initial soil physical chemical properties saw liang et al 2021 for details detailed soil physical and chemical properties are presented in table s1 following staff 2006 the soil texture at the 0 50 and 50 100 cm depths were classified as silt clay loam and sand respectively the soil salt content ss was estimated using the calibrated relationship of ss 3 4238 ec1 5 1 0513 r2 0 95 n 150 ss at the 0 60 cm depth ranged between 0 1 0 2 and ratio of chloride to sulfate ion ranged from 20 to 100 therefore the saline soils were classified chloride sulfate at light salinized level xu 1980 2 3 field tests 2 3 1 biochar application treatments the biochar was produced by pyrolysis of fruit branch of palmetto trachycarpus fortunei hook h wendl at 500 600 under anoxia condition zhengzhou yongbang new energy equipment technology co ltd china the basic properties of the biochar used in the experiments was shown in table 1 the experiment was established as random complete block design with three replicated the size of each plot was 6 m 6 m a 1 5 m wide road was set between the adjacent plots the 2 0 m wide protect rows were designed and planted with sugar beet around the side plots biochar was continuously applied from 2018 to 2020 before sowing the biochar was uniformly spread on soil surface of plots thoroughly mixed with the soils and then plowed from the surface to 30 cm depth for each plot five treatments were made for each treatment same biochar rates i e 0 10 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 were applied in each year from 2018 to 2020 with a few exceptions where biochar rates were manipulated according to the results of the first two years i e 30 t ha 1 was applied for the treatment of 50 t ha 1 in 2020 treatments of 25 in year 2018 and 100 t ha 1 in 2020 were not designed namely in 2018 four biochar treatments with rates of 0 10 50 and 100 t ha 1 named as b0 b10 b50 and b100 in turn were designed from the general results of 2018 biochar application amounts of 10 and 50 t ha 1 showed big differences in crop growth characteristics liang et al 2021 therefore from 2019 a biochar application rate of 25 t ha 1 named as b25 was added the biochar application amounts of 100 t ha 1 were found to be very uneconomic therefore in 2020 b100 treatment was stopped and the treatments b0 b10 b25 and b30 were designed and application rate of 30 t ha 1 were continuously added to b50 table s2 2 3 2 crop cultivation and planting patterns the field plot design and experimental layout were shown in fig 1 the sugar beet variety was detian 7 the sugar beet sowing dates were 12 11 and 15 in april and the harvesting dates were 14 13 and 17 in september for year 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the sugar

mm 450 kg ha 1 265 kg ha 1 and 99 kg ha 1 respectively a 300 mm flood irrigation was applied around november to leach the accumulated soil salts 2 3 3 measurement of dry matter and nutrient uptake during the main growth stages three pillars of representative sugar beet plants for each treatment were selected and the sugar beet taproots stems leaves were separated with a strong shear then all plant parts were taken back to the laboratory the soils on the surface of the plant were cleaned with deionized water the partitioned plant parts were put into the oven at 105 for 2 h and then oven dried to constant weight at 75 an electronic balance with a precision of 0 01 g was used to measure the dry matter weight the dry matters were ground with a grinder and passed through a 0 5 mm sieve then disboiled with h2so4 h2o2 and heating digested the contents of phosphorus potassium and nitrogen were measured by a vanadium molybdenum yellow spectrophotometry an atomic absorption spectrophotometer hitachi z 2000 series and an aa3 continuous flow analyzer germany bran luebbe respectively 2 3 4 observation of physiological ecology indicators of sugar beet twenty days after sowing germinated seeds were counted and the germination rate was calculated using the following formula saxena et al 2013 1 germination rate number of seeds germinated number of seeds sown every 10 15 days during growth seasons six plants within the plots were randomly selected to measure sugar beet growth indicators including aboveground biomass tuber biomass height and leaf area index lai the plant height and leaf area were measured using a tape and the stem diameter was measured by a vernier caliper the lai is estimated by garcía vila et al 2009 2 lai 0 84 ε i m j n l ij w ij m 10 4 where ε is actual sugar beet planting density plant m2 m is total number of measured plants n is total leaf number for single plant l is leaf length cm w is leaf width cm i and j are the jth leaf on the ith plant and 0 84 is the conversion coefficient zong et al 2021 a 6 67 m2 area in each plot of sugar beet was pre labeled for yield measurement and manually harvesting the aboveground and underground biomass of sugar beet were collected and taken to the laboratory for air drying and mass weighing sugar content of beet was measured by a saccharometer the ash content of aboveground branches and tubers of sugar beet were extracted by muffle furnace high temperature combustion method to determine the salt absorption of different prats for sugar beet 2 4 assessment of the efficiency and benefit 2 4 1 irrigation water and partial fertilizer productivities the irrigation water productivity iwp is the ratio of sugar beet yield t ha 1 and irrigation amount mm the partial fertilizer productivity pfp of phosphorus potassium and nitrogen are calculated for each treatment using the ratio of sugar beet yield to fertilizer amount kg kg 1 the equations are written as li et al 2018 3 iwp yield irrigation amount 4 pfp yield fertilizer amount 2 4 2 economic analysis the total monetary cost of materials water and labor was calculated for each plot the material costs are fees of biochar fertilizers including urea potassium dihydrogen phosphate and potassium sulfate sugar beet seeds plastic film drip irrigation pipes agricultural machinery and pesticides the economic benefit net profit was calculated by the difference between revenue and cost 5 economic benefit revenue cost 6 r e v e n u e y p 7 cos t c b c f c i c g where y is the sugar beet yield mg ha 1 p is the sugar

the differences in the soil physicochemical properties between different treatments by the least significant differences lsd at the p 0 05 level 3 results 3 1 nutrient uptake salt content and sugar content of sugar beet affected by biochar 3 1 1 nutrient uptake the nutrient n p and k uptake for aboverground shoot and underground tuber of sugar beet during three growth stages of 2018 and 2019 is shown in fig 2 under most circumstances biochar addition increased the nutrient n p and k uptake when compared to no biochar treatment both for aboverground shoot and underground tuber of sugarbeet the nutrient uptake in aboverground shoot were higher than in underground tuber especially for n uptake in 2018 as to n uptake of underground tuber the maximal values occurred for b10 treatment in 2018 and b25 treatment in 2019 however the maximal n uptake values of aboverground shoot occurred in b10 b50 or b100 treatments at the three growth stages in 2018 and in b10 or b25 treatments in 2019 the p uptake patterns were generally similar to the n uptake pattern although its actual values were much lower the maximal k uptake values of aboverground shoot and underground tuber at different growth stages occurred in b10 treatment in 2018 but varied from b10 b25 b50 or b100 treatments in 2019 the peak values of nutrient uptake occurred in different biochar application treatments the high surface area and porous nature and capacity to act as a medium for microorganisms of biochar are the main reasons for the increased nutrient uptake by plants in biochar treated soils nigussie et al 2012 3 1 2 salt absorption of sugar beet sugar beet is a salt tolerant crop without any biochar application b0 the aboveground and underground tissues of sugar beet absorbed salt 0 343 0 587 and 0 714 t ha 1 from saline alkali soils in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 3 the biochar application increased the salt absorption rate of sugar beet the sugar beet salt absorption rate of b10 treatment exhibited significant higher salt absorption ability than that of b0 b25 b30 b50 and b100 treatments salt absorption values in 2018 2019 and 2020 were 0 81 0 88 and 1 02 t ha 1 for aboveground shoot and 0 78 1 27 and 0 18 t ha 1 for underground tuber totaling 1 58 2 15 and 1 81 t ha 1 for the entire plant respectively results from fig 3 implied that proper application amount of biochar to sugar beet can reduce soil salinity however too high biochar application rate not only increased soil salinity but also inhibited the salt absorption of sugar beet 3 1 3 sugar content the observed quality indices of sugar beet in 2018 2019 and 2020 table 2 showed that tuber sugar content of sugar beet increased with the biochar application rates therefore in the 2 years biochar application rate of 100 t ha 1 b100 significantly increased sugar content 14 8 15 8 compared to the 3 years of no biochar treatment b0 12 8 13 1 for continuous application of biochar e g 10 10 10 25 25 50 50 30 and 100 100 t ha 1 sugar content increased from the first year compared to b0 treatment sugar content increase percentage was not proportional to the biochar application rate the largest increment percentage was 20 6 3 2 physiological ecology indicators of sugar beet affected by biochar 3 2 1 germination rate the germination rates of sugar beet varied with different biochar application rates fig 4 in 2018 2019 and 2020 sugar beet germination rate ranged between 0 56 and 0 79 0 63 0 74 and 0 59 0 75 the reasons for the generally low germination rate may be two fold i there was clomazone residual in soils and ii sugar beet germination is sensitive to soil environment e g water content temperature salt and nutrient the largest values occurred at 10 t ha 1 of biochar application rate significant differences were found between b10 and other treatments the germination rates varied in the three years biochar application rate greater than 25 t ha 1 has not improved sugar beet germination rates when compared to b0 treatment 3 2 2 physiological ecology indicators the variations of aboveground biomass tuber biomass height and lai of sugar beet during growth stages of 2018 2019 and 2020 are shown in fig 5 except the biochar application treatment of b100 biochar treatments with no greater than 50 t ha 1 per year increased the sugar beet growth in all three years the treatment b10 obtained the best growth increase of sugar beet from the first to the third year when comparing same amount of biochar application rate namely b100 in the first year and b50 in the second year continuous application with smaller dose showed advantages in sugar beet growth in addition sugar beet growth was still slightly improved by biochar application rate of 30 t ha 1 b50 b50 b30 in the third year there was a general increase of sugar beet growth indices before 95 105 days after sowing das for all treatments in all three years although the increase pattern for tuber biomass was different to that of aboveground biomass plant height and lai after 95 105 das the above ground biomass height and lai decreased with the increase of das the underground tuber biomass economic parts of sugar beet continuously increased during the growth seasons the differences of sugar beet growth indices were larger in 2019 than in 2018 especially for b10 treatment the tuber biomass increased the largest among different treatments in 2019 there was generally a decreasing rank of continuous application rate for increasing sugar beet growth namely 10 10 10 t ha 1 b10 25 25 t ha 1 b25 50 50 30 t ha 1 b50 b30 0 0 0 t ha 1 b0 and 100 100 t ha 1 b100 in turn the increasing patterns of underground tuber length tuber middle diameter and tap tuber diameter during growth stages of 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 6 the efficient biochar application of less than 50 t ha 1 consistently improved underground tuber biomass of sugar beet being consistent with the growth indices in fig 6 biochar application rate of 10 t ha 1 and 100 t ha 1 was the best and worst in improving tuber growth indicators of sugar beet especially in 2019 this was a very indicative information for determining an appropriate biochar application amount in sugar beet planting practice 3 3 productivities and economic benefits 3 3 1 water and fertilizer productivities of sugar beet affected by biochar the sugar beet yields irrigation water productivity iwp and partial fertilizer productivity pfp for n p and k in 2018 2019 and 2020 are presented in table 3 although there were differences among the three years the yields iwp and pfp for n p and k consistently had peak values for b10 treatment in 2018 2019 and 2020 and significant differences were found among different treatments of the same year the pfp of k was larger than pfps of n and p for the same treatment in certain year the b10 treatment followed by b25 and b50 treatments had greater yield and productivity than other treatments values of yields iwp and pfp of b100 treatment were significantly lower than that of b0 indicating less efficiency of water and fertilizer utilization in the three years in the third year b30 slightly increased the irrigation and fertilizer productivity of sugar beet compared to b0 3 3 2 economic benefit of biochar application on sugar beet the income cost and economic benefit of sugar beet at various biochar application rates are presented for different treatments and planting years table 4 the b0 and b10 treatments had significant higher economic benefits than b25 b50 and b100 of which b10 had the highest economic benefit in 2019 and 2020 b50 b50 and b100 b100 for the first two years had negative economic benefits the economic benefit ranked with biochar application rates of 10 0 25 50 100 t ha 1 b10 treatment has indicated its benefit increasing effects on sugar beet compared to b0 treatment from the first years continuous biochar application rates of 25 25 50 50 30 and 100 100 t ha 1 displayed negative and lower economic benefits especially in the first two years 4 discussion corp growth yield and productivity increment benefited from biochar application this can be attributed to the accompany nutrients n k ca mg input into the soils which was slowly released to plants over time bouqbis et al 2021 karer et al 2015 biochar has been proved to be beneficial on agricultural soil fertility and plant growth major et al 2010 saxena et al 2013 biochar application to soils also decreased soil bulk density and thus increased soil water content soil water storage and crop water availability which potentially contributed to enhanced crop productivity and water use efficiency li et al 2022 liang et al 2021 in addition although biochar brings some chemicals nutrition into soil it eventually decreased salt content of salt affected soils because i the plenty soluble cations in biochar exchanged with the na absorbed by soil colloid and ii the organics contained in biochar improved soil physicochemical properties and made salts leached out of root zone more easily li et al 2014 nigussie et al 2012 the improved soil physicochemical environment led to better growth and yields of crops saxena et al 2013 arif et al 2016 most researchers found that biochar application increased soil nutrients organic content ion and salt content arif et al 2016 bouqbis et al 2021 liang et al 2021 this was also shown from our tested results fig 7 especially for top soil layer figs 7a to 7c however crop growth did not increase linearly with the increase of biochar application rate the obar ranged from 5 to 50 t ha 1 for different crops abou hussien et al 2020 ahmad et al 2015 alves et al 2021 bouqbis et al 2021 koga et al 2017 lai et al 2013 lebrun et al 2022a major et al 2010 saxena et al 2013 the negative effect of large application rate on crop growth was reported for example rondon et al 2007 found that 165 t ha 1 of biochar application in a poor soil low organic content or salinized soils decreased crop yield this research also observed decreased growth yield productivities and economic benefit under 100 t ha 1 of biochar application rate from the responses of sugar beet nutrient uptake salt and sugar content physiological ecology indicators productivities and ecological benefits the obar for sugar beet was found to be 10 t ha 1 lebrun et al 2022b found that the application of 2 w w biochar manure blend achieved increased sugar beet yield under experimentally induced water stress drought conditions wu et al 2018 evaluated 1 3 and 5 w w biochar addition to growth endogenous hormone content yield and quality of sugar beet they found that the 3 treatment had the highest sugar yield this is different from our results which may be caused by different types and basic properties of biochar and different experimental conditions sugar beet plating area has been extended from 99 000 ha in 2014 213 000 ha in 2020 in china and the yields increased from 5 099 000 to 11 984 000 t correspondingly https caifuhao eastmoney com news 20211208091449189732330 if the sugar beet fields were applied biochar at the rate of 10 t ha 1 the net profit increase compared with no biochar application b0 are 6 94 billion dollars for china note that this is only a crude excise this is because the determination of obar is context specific it not only relates to the source material of biochar and application pattern dose way but also to the complicated soil environment and crop varieties anyway this study showed that biochar application has obvious economic profit potential when rationally applied however some studies have reported limited or no efficacy of biochar addition in temperate regions where soil fertility is sufficiently high güereña et al 2013 in addition some negative impacts on crop growth because of biochar application to soils have also been noted such as decreased nutrient availability due to biochars high sorption capacity brtnicky et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 for example reed et al 2017 found that biochar did not improve the growth and nutrient uptake of ryegrass one year after soil application therefore the effects of biochar on soil fertility and crop yield under different conditions need to be further studied sugar beet is salt tolerant with the increase of growth period the underground tuber of sugar beet not only absorbs more nutrient from soils but also absorbs more salts from soils especially at obar fig 4 which contributed to reducing soil salinity meanwhile the sugar content also increased with biochar application table 2 there were few studies investigating the de salinization effects of biochar application in sugar beet abou hussien et al 2020 found that biochar application increased the uptake of the determined heavy metals by sugar beet although this research did not reveal the mechanics of desalinization for sugar beet the interesting desalination phenomena of sugar beet brought some new insights for further investigation since the mechanism of biochar application on sugar beet yields were still not revealed further study will focus on these scientific questions and supply more useful information from technical respect in addition as a carbon sink biochar is a promising material for reducing ghg emissions in the present and future the part of the cost of biochar maybe covered by the carbon sink effect gonzález pernas et al 2022 however it is not involved in this study which will be further analyzed in future research 5 conclusions the biochar applications generally increased the n p and k uptake during different growth stages of sugar beet in 2018 2019 and 2020 the growth and yield related indicators were significant increased under biochar application conditions and the biochar application of 10 t ha 1 showed advantages in enhancing sugar beet growth and yields sugar content was increased with the increasing biochar application rate however the largest increase percentage was 20 6 which was not much beneficial compared to the biochar investment the irrigation water and partial fertilizer productivities also achieved peak values at the biochar application of 10 t ha 1 the economic analysis indicated the largest economic benefits at biochar application rate of 10 t ha 1 for all three years compared to no biochar application and biochar application rates of 25 50 and 100 t ha 1 overall considering the comprehensive responses of the nutrient uptake content the salt absorption rate the growth and yield related indices length height and lai for aboveground shoot and diameter of underground tuber and the economic benefit of changing biochar application rate obar namely 10 t ha 1 continuously applied for 3 years was recommended for sugar beet planting since there were complicated interactions of soil biochar and crops further studies involving multi discipline overlap are needed to reveal the yield quality and productivity increase mechanics of
