19570,the co ii peroxymonosulfate co ii pms process producing sulfate radicals so4 effectively removes organic pollutants in water while producing a significant amount of bromate bro3 in the presence of bromide br this paper investigates the ammonia nh3 addition chlorine ammonia cl2 nh3 and ammonia chlorine nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies in controlling bro3 formation in 20 min in the co ii pms process at ph 4 0 the addition of nh3 retarded the bro3 formation but only at a reduction level of about 9 5 for nh3 concentration of 50 μm and was mainly attributed to the protonation of nh3 at ph 4 99 99 as nh4 did not react with hobr both the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies at hocl and nh3 dosages of 15 and 50 μm respectively reduced 95 or more of the overall bro3 formation and retarded the bro3 formation with the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy outperforming cl2 nh3 the reduction of the bro3 formation was mainly attributed to the formation of monochloramine nh2cl in both pretreatment strategies nh2cl effectively outcompetes so4 to react with hobr and forms nhbrcl with the apparent reaction rate constant between nh2cl and hobr more than 100 times faster than that between so4 and hobr however the oxidation degradation of nhbrcl in the co ii pms process reforms hobr and although less in quantity is oxidized to bro3 at higher co ii and br concentrations thus the nh3 cl2 and cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategies inhibit the bro3 formation more significantly at lower co ii and br concentrations in all cases the generation of so4 in 20 min was not affected by the implementation of the three bro3 pretreatment strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords co ii pms acidic ph bromate ammonia monochloramine 1 introduction in recent years sulfate radical so4 based

yields significant amounts of bromate bro3 a 2b human carcinogen with a drinking water guideline value of 10 μg l li et al 2015 who 2005 the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process counteracts the high pollutant removal efficiency of the co ii pms process for the micropollutant degradation in drinking water and reclaimed water unlike the bro3 formation pathways in ozonation through either the oxidation of hobr or the direct formation of bro from br by o3 bypassing hobr buffle et al 2004 bro3 formation in the co ii pms process consists of two steps and hobr is the only important intermediate eqs 2 4 in table 1 li et al 2015 in the first step br is oxidized to hobr by both co iii eq 2 in table 1 and so4 eq 3 in table 1 generated in the co ii pms process fang and shang 2012 li et al 2015 due to the fact that hobr forms rapidly due to the dominating co iii driven br oxidation in the co ii pms process more hobr is accumulated and is available for bro3 formation than that in the uv persulfate process by further oxidation of so4 in the second step eq 4 in table 1 fang and shang 2012 yang et al 2014 co iii however does not participate in this step li et al 2015 in the co ii pms process the bro3 formation increases with increasing pms co ii and br concentrations li et al 2015 controlling the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process is thus important the ammonia nh3 addition chlorine ammonia cl2 nh3 and ammonia chlorine nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies are common strategies to inhibit bro3 formation in ozonation at near neutral ph buffle et al 2004 hofmann and andrews 2001 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 in the nh3 addition nh3 reacts with hobr to form nh2br which prevents the oxidation of hobr to obr by o3 at near neutral ph eq 5 in table 1 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 the addition of 200 μg l nh3 in the presence of 5 mg l o3 and 80 μg l br can prevent 50 of the total bro3 formation in ozonation by inhibiting the bro3 formation through the hobr oxidation pathways pinkernell and von gunten 2001 it cannot inhibit the oxidation of br by o3 and thus oxidizes 50 of br to bro3 buffle et al 2004 the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies are used to mask br to monobromamine nh2br or bromochloramine nhbrcl prior to ozonation buffle et al 2004 which prevents the oxidation of br to br hobr and then to bro3 by o3 and ho during ozonation in the cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategy chlorine hocl is firstly added to water containing br oxidizing br to hobr eq 6 in table 1 an excessive amount of nh3 is then added to react mainly with hobr and the remaining hocl to form nh2br and nh2cl respectively eqs 5 9 in table 1 heeb et al 2017 luh and mariñas 2014 in the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy nh3 is present in or added to water containing br hocl is added and reacts with nh3 in excess to form nh2cl eq 7 in table 1 nh2cl serves both as an ho scavenger to prevent the formation of br by ho and as a quencher for hobr eq 10 in table 1 during ozonation buffle et al 2004 we hypothesize that all three strategies may be able to control the bro3 formation from br oxidation by quenching the hobr intermediate in the co ii pms process however the co ii pms process is more favorable at acidic ph chan and chu 2009 and as aforementioned the process transforms all br to hobr in less than 1 min and produces relatively high steady state so4 concentrations li et al 2015 these unique conditions bring challenges in controlling the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process by the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies the objectives of this study are thus 1 to investigate the performance and determine the mechanisms of the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies in controlling the bro3 formation in the co ii pms processes at different concentrations of nh3 and in the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies hocl and 2 to investigate the performance of the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies in controlling the bro3 formation in the co ii pms processes at different co ii and br concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions solutions were prepared from reagent grade chemicals and double deionized water ddi water 18 2 mω cm purified by the barnstead nanopure diamond water system co ii in the form of co no3 2 6h2o 99 and ammonium sulfate

chloride nacl and a sodium hypochlorite naocl solution available chlorine 4 00 4 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 experimental procedures experiments for evaluating the performance of the three controlling strategies including the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies were conducted in a 300 ml cylindrical glass reactor at ambient temperature 22 2 c with rapid mixing provided by a magnetic stirring plate a designated concentration of br x0 μm was firstly spiked to 250 ml ddi water in the reactor the three pretreatment strategies were then simulated in a similar manner to buffle et al 2004 s procedures as shown in fig s1 with ph controlled at 7 0 by naoh hno3 in the pretreatment strategy with the nh3 addition a designated concentration of nh3 0 20 50 or 200 μm was spiked in the cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategy a designated concentration of hocl 0 6 10 or 15 μm was firstly added and mixed for 5 min followed by the addition of nh3 0 20 30 50 or 60 μm and mixing for another 1 min in the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy a designated concentration of nh3 0 20 30 50 or 60 μm was firstly added and mixed for 1 min and then hocl 0 6 10 or 15 μm was added and mixed for another 5 min after the pretreatment strategies ph of the solution was adjusted and controlled at around 4 0 by naoh hno3 pms 200 μm and co ii 20 μm were then added in sequence to initiate the co ii pms process the 20 min experiments in evaluating the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process with three pretreatment strategies were designed based on the 90 99 removal of 20 μm benzoic acid in 15 20 min in the co ii pms process under the experimental conditions in the current manuscript as shown in fig s2 samples were taken at predetermined times quenched with excessive nano2 3 times the concentration of pms and then subjected to bro3 concentration analysis experiments evaluating the influence of the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies on the micropollutant degradation in the co ii pms process for controlling the bromate formation were conducted in the same manner except that benzoic acid was selected and added 20 μm as a model compound in the presence of bromide the experimental procedures were similar to those in all the three pretreatment strategies except benzoic acid was added to the solutions samples were taken at predetermined times quenched with excessive sodium nitrite 3 times the concentration of pms and then subjected to benzoic acid concentration analysis all experiments have been duplicated 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of br and bro3 were determined by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 3000 connected to a conductivity detector with method detection limits of 2 45 and 2 69 μg l respectively a high capacity hydroxide selective analytical column as19 4 250 mm dionex and its guard column ag19 4 50 mm dionex were used for separation the concentrations of the hobr and hocl solutions were standardized by fas dpd titration apha et al 1995 concentrations of benzoic acid were determined using a reverse phase liquid chromatograph vp series shimadzu equipped with a waters symmetry c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 μm particle size waters and a uv detector set at 227 nm an eluent of water ph 3 adjusted by phosphoric acid and methanol 55 45 v v was used to separate benzoic acid at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the total organic carbon toc concentrations of the solution were measured by a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu ph was monitored using a thermo scientific orion 3 star bench top ph meter 2 4 model simulation the models described in the paper were built using the kintecus 4 55 chemical kinetic modeling software suite ianni 2012 the model equations simulating the inhibition of the bro3 formation by the nh3 addition were listed in text s3 the model equations simulating the pretreatment steps of the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies and the inhibition of the bro3 formation by the two pretreatment strategies were listed in texts s5 and s7 respectively ph was set constant in the models the bro3 formation in the process was simulated by eqs 15 and 16 15 b r c o i i p m s h o b r k 15 5 3 10 2 s 1 16 h o b r s o 4 b r o 3 k 16 3 44 10 2 s 1 while the quenching of hobr bro by nh3 and nh2cl was simulated by eqs 5 and 10 in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 nh3 addition fig 1 shows the effect of nh3 concentrations on the bro3 formation when the nh3 addition strategy is used for bro3 control in the co ii pms process the addition of nh3 retarded the bro3 formation and the inhibition was more obvious at the beginning of the reaction the bro3 formation at 20 min decreased from 4 22 μm no bro3 control to 4 12 3 83 and 1 11 μm respectively in the presence of 20 50 and 200 μm nh3 while that at 3 min decreased from 3 96 μm to 2 19 0 92 and 0 27 μm respectively however the bro3 formation could not be completely inhibited by the nh3 addition the nh3 addition at 200 μm at a nh3 to br molar ratio of 40 1 reduced the bro3 formation at 20 min by 74 however the nh3 addition at 20 and 50 μm only reduced the bro3 formation at 20 min by 2 6 and 9 5 respectively although they reduced the bro3 formation at 3 min by 44 and 77 respectively the incomplete inhibition of the bro3 formation by the nh3 addition was attributed to the protonation of nh3 pk a 9 25 qiang and adams 2004 in the co ii pms process the key intermediate that leads to the bro3 formation is hobr the second order reaction rate constants of hobr toward nh3 is 7 5 107 m 1 s 1 luh and mariñas 2014 while that towards so4 was estimated to be 3 25 109 m 1 s 1 as calculated from text s1 meanwhile the concentrations of nh3 and so4 under the test conditions were in the order of 10 4 and 10 12 m obtained from text s2 respectively under the experimental conditions and in theory nh3 should greatly out compete so4 to react with hobr however at ph 4 0 in the co ii pms process the majority of added nh3 was protonated in the form of nh4 leaving only 10 10 2 5 10 10 and 10 9 m nh3 in the solution at nh3 concentrations of 20 50 and 200 μm respectively eq 11 in table 1 heeb et al 2014 therefore the apparent first order reaction rate constants between nh3 and hobr at nh3 concentrations of 20 50 and 200 μm were 7 5 10 3 1 88 10 2 and 7 5 10 2 s 1 which were only 1 09 2 73 and 10 88 times to that between so4 and hobr 6 89 10 3 s 1 as calculated from text s2 making both competition reactions still significant the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process at different initial nh3 concentrations dashed lines in fig 1 was simulated by a kinetic model details shown in text s3 in the model the consumption of hobr by both nh3 and so4 was calculated using eq 17 17 d h o b r d t k 15 h o b r k 15 k n h 3 i h o b r k s o 4 h o b r where k 15 is the total hobr consumption rate at particular nh3 concentrations e g 20 50 or 200 μm k n h 3 i h o b r is the apparent reaction rate constant between nh3 and hobr and k s o 4 h o b r is the apparent reaction rate constant between so4 and hobr as estimated 95 of hobr will be oxidized within 3 2 and 1 min at nh3 concentrations of 20 50 and 200 μm respectively detailed calculation shown in text s4 among the oxidized hobr 48 27 and 8 4 of the consumed hobr were oxidized to bro3 at nh3 concentrations of 20 50 and 200 μm respectively while the remaining was quenched by nh3 to nhbr2 lei et al 2004 the modeling results fit reasonably well with the experimental data in the first 3 min as shown in fig 1 after 3 min the further bro3 formation was due to the oxidation of hobr reproduced from the oxidation decomposition of nhbr2 in the co ii pms process eq 12 in table 1 li and blatchley 2009 whose rate constant was obtained by data fitting of the kinetic model as indicated in eq 12 br and hobr are formed and the former can be further oxidized to hobr hobr is either quenched by reacting with nh3 to form nhbr2 or oxidized by so4 to form bro3 the recycling of hobr from nhbr2 in the co ii pms process enables the continuous generation of bro3 in the co ii pms process suggesting that the quenching of hobr by nh3 only temporarily controls the oxidation of hobr to bro3 note that the nh3 addition strategy did not compromise the benzoic acid degradation rate constants in the co ii pms process at different nh3 concentrations fig s2 nh3 is stable in the co ii pms process because the reaction rate constant between nh3 and so4 is low 3 0 105 m 1 s 1 comparing with benzoic acid deng and ezyske 2011 neta et al 1988 however the nh3 addition strategy reduced the mineralization efficiency of the co ii pms process mainly due to the competitive consumption of so4 between nh3 and some small molecular weight intermediates formed in the process fig s4 neta et al 1988 3 2 chlorine ammonia cl2 nh3 and ammonia chlorine nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies fig 2 a and b shows the effect of hocl dosages in inhibiting the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process by the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies respectively and fig 2c and d displays the effect of nh3 dosages in the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies respectively the bro3 formation was significantly inhibited by the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies at all hocl and nh3 testing dosages in the cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategy a 61 inhibition of the bro3 formation the worst case occurred at hocl and nh3 dosages of 6 and 50 μm respectively increasing the hocl and nh3 concentrations further inhibited the bro3 formation and a maximum inhibition of 96 was observed at hocl and nh3 concentrations of 15 and 60 μm respectively in addition increasing the hocl concentrations also retarded the bro3 formation in the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy the inhibition of the bro3 formation followed the same trend except that the inhibitions in the worst and the best cases were 75 and 98 respectively when comparing the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies at the same pair of hocl and nh3 concentrations the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy inhibits the bro3 formation more and gives a longer retardation period than the cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategy the better inhibition of the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process by the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy is different from wert and benotti 2010 s finding that the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies are equally effective in controlling the bro3 formation the reason underlying the better performance of the nh3 cl2 over the cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategy inhibiting the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process was assessed by a kinetic model the model is described in text s5 and can be explained by the compounds formed and their concentrations during the pre treatment step luh and mariñas 2014 yang et al 2014 the final concentrations of hocl br nh3 nh2cl nh2br nhbr2 and nhbrcl after the pre treatment step are listed in table 2 at different hocl concentrations and table 3 at different nh3 concentrations as shown in tables 2 and 3 for each dosage pair the remaining nh3 concentrations after the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies are almost the same however the nh2cl concentrations after the nh3 cl2 pretreatment are always higher than those after the cl2 nh3 pretreatment mainly due to the faster reaction rate constant between hocl and nh3 comparing with that between hocl and br buffle et al 2004 wert et al 2007 wert and benotti 2010 such trends are always associated with better inhibition of the bro3 formation by the cl2 nh3 pretreatment compared to that by the cl2 nh3 treatment more interestingly similar inhibition performances were observed under conditions that had similar amounts of nh2cl for example an inhibition of about 80 was observed at initial hocl concentrations of 10 and 6 μm in the co ii pms process with cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies respectively both of which yielded a nh2cl concentration of about 11 8 μm after the pretreatment the association between the nh2cl concentration and the inhibition of the bro3 formation suggests that nh2cl is the key species contributing to the better performance of the nh3 cl2 over the cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategy nh2cl is known to react with hobr to form nhbrcl at a reaction rate constant of 2 86 105 m 1 s 1 eq 10 in table 1 luh and mariñas 2014 in the co ii pms process the nh2cl formed during the nh3 cl2 and cl2 nh3 pretreatment stage stays as nh2cl rather than nh3cl at ph 4 0 due to its low pka of 2 0 isaac and morris 1983 mitch et al 2005 in addition nh2cl has a similar reaction rate constant towards so4 comparing with nh3 nh4 neta et al 1988 suggesting that it will not significantly quench so4 as it does by quenching ho formed in ozonation buffle et al 2004 ikehata et al 2013 considering the preformed nh2cl concentrations ranging from 2 1 to 14 2 μm the apparent reaction rate constants between nh2cl and hobr are at least 0 60 s 1 detailed calculations are in text s6 which are more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than that between so4 and hobr at 6 89 10 3 s 1 therefore hobr once formed is immediately quenched by nh2cl to form nhbrcl if the amount of nh2cl is sufficient a kinetic model was built to simulate the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process pretreated with the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 strategies at different initial hocl and nh3 concentrations the model is described in text s7 the simulated bro3 formation is plotted in fig 2 in dashed lines showing similar trends to the experimental data in the cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategy at an hocl concentration of 6 μm the nh2cl concentration was only 2 1 μm and nh2cl was consumed by over 90 in 2 min by the 5 μm hobr formed initially in the co ii pms process as calculated by the model then the oxidation of hobr to bro3 in the subsequent co ii pms process can only be inhibited by nh3 which was not effective as discussed in section 3 1 at hocl concentrations of 10 and 15 μm the nh2cl concentrations 5 26 and 10 μm respectively were sufficient to react with the 5 μm hobr formed initially in the co ii pms process nhbrcl produced from the reaction between nh2cl and hobr was oxidized in the co ii pms process to form no3 hobr br and hocl eq 13 in table 1 li and blatchley 2009 li et al 2015 lutze et al 2015 the released hocl reacts with either nh3 from 1 8 10 10 to 2 2 10 10 m or so4 about 2 12 10 12 m as indicated in eq 7 and eq 14 in table 1 yang et al 2014 the apparent reaction rates between nh3 and hocl are from 7 56 10 4 s 1 to 9 24 10 4 s 1 while that between so4 and hocl is about 1 91 10 3 s 1 the reaction between hocl and so4 is thus 2 to 2 5 times faster than that between hocl and nh3 leading to the gradual decay of nh2cl luh and mariñas 2014 and the formation of clo3 lutze et al 2015 nh2cl is thus the critical species inhibiting the bro3 formation the model can then be used to explain the more significant inhibition and longer retardation period of the bro3 formation by the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy in the co ii pms process and the trends of the bro3 formation by the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies in the co ii pms process at different nh3 concentrations as shown in the dashed lines in fig 2 it should be noted that neither the cl2 nh3 nor nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies compromise the so4 generation in the co ii pms process as the benzoic acid degradation rate constants are similar at different conditions fig s3 however the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies reduced the mineralization efficiency of the co ii pms process mainly due to the competitive consumption of so4 between nh2cl and some small molecular weight intermediates formed in the process fig s4 neta et al 1988 wert et al 2007 3 3 effects of co ii and br concentrations on the inhibition of bro3 formation by the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment in the co ii pms process at a fixed pms dosage increasing the co ii and br dosages increased the bro3 formation li et al 2015 therefore their effects on the inhibition of bro3 formation by the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies were studied fig 3 shows the effects of a co ii and b br concentrations on the inhibition of the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process by a 50 μm nh3 addition the nh3 addition at 50 μm inhibited the bro3 formation at low co ii and high br concentrations in the co ii pms process as shown in fig 3a the addition of 50 μm nh3 reduced 87 3 and 9 24 of bro3 formed at co ii concentrations of 5 and 20 μm respectively at 20 min and significantly retarded the bro3 formation however it cannot reduce or retard the bro3 formation at a co ii concentration of 100 μm due to the much higher oxidation potential by the addition of high co ii concentrations in the solution as reported by li et al 2015 increasing the co ii dosage from 20 to 100 μm increased the formation rates of bro3 and hobr by about 5 times in the co ii pms process which beyond the quenching capacity of 50 μm nh3 and thus cannot inhibit the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process for the bro3 formation at different br dosages the addition of 50 μm nh3 retarded the bro3 formation at br dosages of 2 5 and 10 μm but only inhibited the overall bro3 formation at the br dosage of 10 μm by about 70 as shown in fig 3b suggesting that the nh3 addition performs better at higher br dosages fig 4 shows the effects of a co ii and b br concentrations on inhibiting the bro3 formation during the co ii pms process by the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies as shown in fig 4a the bro3 formation at all co ii concentrations by both pretreatment strategies was inhibited by more than 70 and the inhibition was more significant at lower co ii concentrations at a co ii concentration of 5 μm no bro3 was formed in either process whereas at co ii concentrations of 20 and 100 μm the bro3 formation was inhibited by about 90 and 70 respectively after the nh3 cl2 and cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategies but it was much retarded after the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy at co ii concentrations of both 20 and 100 μm as shown in fig 4b the bro3 formation at all br concentrations in both pretreatment strategies was inhibited by more than 90 and the inhibition was more significant at lower br concentrations at a br concentration of 2 μm no bro3 was formed in either strategy whereas at the br concentrations of 5 and 10 μm the bro3 formation was inhibited by about 95 and 90 respectively after the nh3 cl2 and cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategies but it was much retarded after the nh3 cl2 pretreatment at the br concentrations of both 5 and 10 μm from fig 4a and b we conclude that both the nh3 cl2 and cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategies inhibit the bro3 formation well at low co ii and br dosages but nh3 cl2 pretreatment provides a longer retardation period for the bro3 formation 4 conclusions this paper describes the effectiveness of the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies on inhibiting the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process at the most effective ph of 4 0 and proposes inhibition mechanisms for the pretreatment strategies the nh3 addition in the co ii pms process at ph 4 and br co ii and pms dosages of 5 20 and 200 μm respectively reduces 2 6 9 5 and 75 of the bro3 formation after 20 min at nh3 dosages of 20 50 and 200 μm respectively however we do not recommend adding 200 μm of nh3 equivalent to 2 8 mg l as n to control the bro3 formation in the process since the amount of nitrogen in water might cause problems the mechanism of the nh3 addition is to quench hobr the key intermediate in the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process by nh3 the incomplete control of the bro3 formation is mainly attributed to the protonation of nh3 at ph 4 for both the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies the addition of 15 μm hocl and 50 μm nh3 reduced the overall bro3 formation by more than 95 and retarded the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process at co ii pms br dosages of 20 200 and 5 μm respectively in 20 min the inhibition of the bro3 formation in both pretreatment strategies was mainly attributed to the quenching of hobr by nh2cl formed in the pretreatment stages nh2cl effectively outcompeted so4 to react with hobr to form nhbrcl with the apparent rate constant of the former more than 100 times faster than the latter the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy in forming more nh2cl therefore outperformed cl2 nh3 the nh3 cl2 and cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategies inhibit the bro3 formation more at lower co ii and br concentrations since the degradation of nhbrcl in the co ii pms process reforms hobr which although less in quantity is oxidized to bro3 at higher co ii and br concentrations it should be noticed that the controlling capacity of the nh3 addition nh3 cl2 and cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategies will not be compromised and might even be enhanced at higher phs with increasing ph the equilibrium will shift from nh4 towards nh3 and thus increase the nh3 concentrations in water qiang and adams 2004 while nh2cl remains stable at all phs under similar experimental conditions mitch et al 2005 in addition in some cases in fig 2a b and 2c the modeled bro3 formation is delayed comparing to the experimental data hollow points especially in the nh3 cl2 process in fig 2c the mismatch during the reaction may be caused by a underestimation of the decomposition of the bromamines and chloramines in the co ii pms process which stay in the solution to quench hobr or b direct oxidation of bromine in nhbr2 to bro3 without reducing it to br more investigation is needed to further explain the mismatch during the reaction good and van briesen 2017 showed the median br concentrations in one river in the us downstream some power plants are in the ranges of 180 410 μg l equivalent to 2 25 5 125 μm the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy at nh3 and hocl concentrations of 60 and 15 μm respectively can successfully inhibit the bro3 formation exceeding its maximum level of the drinking water quality standard 6 752 μg l bro3 formed after 20 min up to an initial br concentration of 5 μm in addition the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies may further reduce the amount of tribromomethane and dibromoacetic acid formed in the co ii pms process liu et al 2015 xie et al 2016 due to the inhibition of the reaction between bromine radical species and organic matters by cl xie et al 2016 in 20 min about 90 99 of 20 μm benzoic acid in the co ii pms process under the experimental conditions in the current manuscript can be removed in real water the apparent degradation rate constants of other micropollutants in the co ii pms process should be in similar orders li et al 2015 xiao et al 2015 and thus would not require a longer reaction time therefore the delay of the bromate formation for 15 20 min rather than to pursue the total inhibition of the bromate formation in the co ii pms process with the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies can effectively degrade micropollutants and simultaneously control the bro3 formation acknowledgement this work

19570,the co ii peroxymonosulfate co ii pms process producing sulfate radicals so4 effectively removes organic pollutants in water while producing a significant amount of bromate bro3 in the presence of bromide br this paper investigates the ammonia nh3 addition chlorine ammonia cl2 nh3 and ammonia chlorine nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies in controlling bro3 formation in 20 min in the co ii pms process at ph 4 0 the addition of nh3 retarded the bro3 formation but only at a reduction level of about 9 5 for nh3 concentration of 50 μm and was mainly attributed to the protonation of nh3 at ph 4 99 99 as nh4 did not react with hobr both the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies at hocl and nh3 dosages of 15 and 50 μm respectively reduced 95 or more of the overall bro3 formation and retarded the bro3 formation with the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy outperforming cl2 nh3 the reduction of the bro3 formation was mainly attributed to the formation of monochloramine nh2cl in both pretreatment strategies nh2cl effectively outcompetes so4 to react with hobr and forms nhbrcl with the apparent reaction rate constant between nh2cl and hobr more than 100 times faster than that between so4 and hobr however the oxidation degradation of nhbrcl in the co ii pms process reforms hobr and although less in quantity is oxidized to bro3 at higher co ii and br concentrations thus the nh3 cl2 and cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategies inhibit the bro3 formation more significantly at lower co ii and br concentrations in all cases the generation of so4 in 20 min was not affected by the implementation of the three bro3 pretreatment strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords co ii pms acidic ph bromate ammonia monochloramine 1 introduction in recent years sulfate radical so4 based

yields significant amounts of bromate bro3 a 2b human carcinogen with a drinking water guideline value of 10 μg l li et al 2015 who 2005 the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process counteracts the high pollutant removal efficiency of the co ii pms process for the micropollutant degradation in drinking water and reclaimed water unlike the bro3 formation pathways in ozonation through either the oxidation of hobr or the direct formation of bro from br by o3 bypassing hobr buffle et al 2004 bro3 formation in the co ii pms process consists of two steps and hobr is the only important intermediate eqs 2 4 in table 1 li et al 2015 in the first step br is oxidized to hobr by both co iii eq 2 in table 1 and so4 eq 3 in table 1 generated in the co ii pms process fang and shang 2012 li et al 2015 due to the fact that hobr forms rapidly due to the dominating co iii driven br oxidation in the co ii pms process more hobr is accumulated and is available for bro3 formation than that in the uv persulfate process by further oxidation of so4 in the second step eq 4 in table 1 fang and shang 2012 yang et al 2014 co iii however does not participate in this step li et al 2015 in the co ii pms process the bro3 formation increases with increasing pms co ii and br concentrations li et al 2015 controlling the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process is thus important the ammonia nh3 addition chlorine ammonia cl2 nh3 and ammonia chlorine nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies are common strategies to inhibit bro3 formation in ozonation at near neutral ph buffle et al 2004 hofmann and andrews 2001 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 in the nh3 addition nh3 reacts with hobr to form nh2br which prevents the oxidation of hobr to obr by o3 at near neutral ph eq 5 in table 1 pinkernell and von gunten 2001 the addition of 200 μg l nh3 in the presence of 5 mg l o3 and 80 μg l br can prevent 50 of the total bro3 formation in ozonation by inhibiting the bro3 formation through the hobr oxidation pathways pinkernell and von gunten 2001 it cannot inhibit the oxidation of br by o3 and thus oxidizes 50 of br to bro3 buffle et al 2004 the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies are used to mask br to monobromamine nh2br or bromochloramine nhbrcl prior to ozonation buffle et al 2004 which prevents the oxidation of br to br hobr and then to bro3 by o3 and ho during ozonation in the cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategy chlorine hocl is firstly added to water containing br oxidizing br to hobr eq 6 in table 1 an excessive amount of nh3 is then added to react mainly with hobr and the remaining hocl to form nh2br and nh2cl respectively eqs 5 9 in table 1 heeb et al 2017 luh and mariñas 2014 in the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy nh3 is present in or added to water containing br hocl is added and reacts with nh3 in excess to form nh2cl eq 7 in table 1 nh2cl serves both as an ho scavenger to prevent the formation of br by ho and as a quencher for hobr eq 10 in table 1 during ozonation buffle et al 2004 we hypothesize that all three strategies may be able to control the bro3 formation from br oxidation by quenching the hobr intermediate in the co ii pms process however the co ii pms process is more favorable at acidic ph chan and chu 2009 and as aforementioned the process transforms all br to hobr in less than 1 min and produces relatively high steady state so4 concentrations li et al 2015 these unique conditions bring challenges in controlling the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process by the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies the objectives of this study are thus 1 to investigate the performance and determine the mechanisms of the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies in controlling the bro3 formation in the co ii pms processes at different concentrations of nh3 and in the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies hocl and 2 to investigate the performance of the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies in controlling the bro3 formation in the co ii pms processes at different co ii and br concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and solutions solutions were

three controlling strategies including the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies were conducted in a 300 ml cylindrical glass reactor at ambient temperature 22 2 c with rapid mixing provided by a magnetic stirring plate a designated concentration of br x0 μm was firstly spiked to 250 ml ddi water in the reactor the three pretreatment strategies were then simulated in a similar manner to buffle et al 2004 s procedures as shown in fig s1 with ph controlled at 7 0 by naoh hno3 in the pretreatment strategy with the nh3 addition a designated concentration of nh3 0 20 50 or 200 μm was spiked in the cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategy a designated concentration of hocl 0 6 10 or 15 μm was firstly added and mixed for 5 min followed by the addition of nh3 0 20 30 50 or 60 μm and mixing for another 1 min in the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy a designated concentration of nh3 0 20 30 50 or 60 μm was firstly added and mixed for 1 min and then hocl 0 6 10 or 15 μm was added and mixed for another 5 min after the pretreatment strategies ph of the solution was adjusted and controlled at around 4 0 by naoh hno3 pms 200 μm and co ii 20 μm were then added in sequence to initiate the co ii pms process the 20 min experiments in evaluating the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process with three pretreatment strategies were designed based on the 90 99 removal of 20 μm benzoic acid in 15 20 min in the co ii pms process under the experimental conditions in the current manuscript as shown in fig s2 samples were taken at predetermined times quenched with excessive nano2 3 times the concentration of pms and then subjected to bro3 concentration analysis experiments evaluating the influence of the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies on the micropollutant degradation in the co ii pms process for controlling the bromate formation were conducted in the same manner except that benzoic acid was selected and added 20 μm as a model compound in the presence of bromide the experimental procedures were similar to those in all the three pretreatment strategies except benzoic acid was added to the solutions samples were taken at predetermined times quenched with excessive sodium nitrite 3 times the concentration of pms and then subjected to benzoic acid concentration analysis all experiments have been duplicated 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of br and bro3 were determined by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 3000 connected to a conductivity detector with method detection limits of 2 45 and 2 69 μg l respectively a high capacity hydroxide selective analytical column as19 4 250 mm dionex and its guard column ag19 4 50 mm dionex were used for separation the concentrations of the hobr and hocl solutions were standardized by fas dpd titration apha et al 1995 concentrations of benzoic acid were determined using a reverse phase liquid chromatograph vp series shimadzu equipped with a waters symmetry c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 μm particle size waters and a uv detector set at 227 nm an eluent of water ph 3 adjusted by phosphoric acid and methanol 55 45 v v was used to separate benzoic acid at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the total organic carbon toc concentrations of the solution were measured by a toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu ph was monitored using a thermo scientific orion 3 star bench top ph meter 2 4 model simulation the models described in the paper were built using the kintecus 4 55 chemical kinetic modeling software suite ianni 2012 the model equations simulating the inhibition of the bro3 formation by the nh3 addition were listed in text s3 the model equations simulating the pretreatment steps of the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies and the inhibition of the bro3 formation by the two pretreatment strategies were listed in texts s5 and s7 respectively ph was set constant in the models the bro3 formation in the process was simulated by eqs 15 and 16 15 b r c o i i p m s h o b r k 15 5 3 10 2 s 1 16 h o b r s o 4 b r o 3 k 16 3 44 10 2 s 1 while the quenching of hobr bro by nh3 and nh2cl was simulated by eqs 5 and 10 in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 nh3 addition fig 1 shows the effect of nh3 concentrations on the bro3 formation when the nh3 addition strategy is used for bro3 control in the co ii pms process the addition of nh3 retarded the bro3 formation and the inhibition was more obvious at the beginning of the reaction the bro3 formation at 20 min decreased from 4 22 μm no bro3 control to 4 12 3 83 and 1 11 μm respectively in the presence of 20 50 and 200 μm nh3 while that at 3 min decreased from 3 96 μm to 2 19 0 92 and 0 27 μm respectively however the bro3 formation could not be completely inhibited by the nh3 addition the nh3 addition at 200 μm at a nh3 to br molar ratio of 40 1 reduced the bro3 formation at 20 min by 74 however the nh3 addition at 20 and 50 μm only reduced the bro3 formation at 20 min by 2 6 and 9 5 respectively although they reduced the bro3 formation at 3 min by 44 and 77 respectively the incomplete inhibition of the bro3 formation by the nh3 addition was attributed to the protonation of nh3 pk a 9 25 qiang and adams 2004 in the co ii pms process the key intermediate that leads to the bro3 formation is hobr the second order reaction rate constants of hobr toward nh3 is 7 5 107 m 1 s 1 luh and mariñas 2014 while that towards so4 was estimated to be 3 25 109 m 1 s 1 as calculated from text s1 meanwhile the concentrations of nh3 and so4 under the test conditions were in the order of 10 4 and 10 12 m obtained from text s2 respectively under the experimental conditions and in theory nh3 should greatly out compete so4 to react with hobr however at ph 4 0 in the co ii pms process the majority of added nh3 was protonated in the form of nh4 leaving only 10 10 2 5 10 10 and 10 9 m nh3 in the solution at nh3 concentrations of 20 50 and 200 μm respectively eq 11 in table 1 heeb et al 2014 therefore the apparent first order reaction rate constants between nh3 and hobr at nh3 concentrations of 20 50 and 200 μm were 7 5 10 3 1 88 10 2 and 7 5 10 2 s 1 which were only 1 09 2 73 and 10 88 times to that between so4 and hobr 6 89 10 3 s 1 as calculated from text s2 making both competition reactions still significant the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process at different initial nh3 concentrations dashed lines in fig 1 was simulated by a kinetic model details shown in text s3 in the model the consumption of hobr by both nh3 and so4 was calculated using eq 17 17 d h o b r d t k 15 h o b r k 15 k n h 3 i h o b r k s o 4 h o b r where k 15 is the total hobr consumption rate at particular nh3 concentrations e g 20 50 or 200 μm k n h 3 i h o b r is the apparent reaction rate constant between nh3 and hobr and k s o 4 h o b r is the apparent reaction rate constant between so4 and hobr as estimated 95 of hobr will be oxidized within 3 2 and 1 min at nh3 concentrations of 20 50 and 200 μm respectively detailed calculation shown in text s4 among the oxidized hobr 48 27 and 8 4 of the consumed hobr were oxidized to bro3 at nh3 concentrations of 20 50 and 200 μm respectively while the remaining was quenched by nh3 to nhbr2 lei et al 2004 the modeling results fit reasonably well with the experimental data in the first 3 min as shown in fig 1 after 3 min the further bro3 formation was due to the oxidation of hobr reproduced from the oxidation decomposition of nhbr2 in the co ii pms process eq 12 in table 1 li and blatchley 2009 whose rate constant was obtained by data fitting of the kinetic model as indicated in eq 12 br and hobr are formed and the former can be further oxidized to hobr hobr is either quenched by reacting with nh3 to form nhbr2 or oxidized by so4 to form bro3 the recycling of hobr from nhbr2 in the co ii pms process enables the continuous generation of bro3 in the co ii pms process suggesting that the quenching of hobr by nh3 only temporarily controls the oxidation of hobr to bro3 note that the nh3 addition strategy did not compromise the benzoic acid degradation rate constants in the co ii pms process at different nh3 concentrations fig s2 nh3 is stable in the co ii pms process because the reaction rate constant between nh3 and so4 is low 3 0 105 m 1 s 1 comparing with benzoic acid deng and ezyske 2011 neta et al 1988 however the nh3 addition strategy reduced the mineralization efficiency of the co ii pms process mainly due to the competitive consumption of so4 between nh3 and some small molecular weight intermediates formed in the process fig s4 neta et al 1988 3 2 chlorine ammonia cl2 nh3 and ammonia chlorine nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies fig 2 a and b shows the effect of hocl dosages in inhibiting the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process by the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies respectively and fig 2c and d displays the effect of nh3 dosages in the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies respectively the bro3 formation was significantly inhibited by the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies at all hocl and nh3 testing dosages in the cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategy a 61 inhibition of the bro3 formation the worst case occurred at hocl and nh3 dosages of 6 and 50 μm respectively increasing the hocl and nh3 concentrations further inhibited the bro3 formation and a maximum inhibition of 96 was observed at hocl and nh3 concentrations of 15 and 60 μm respectively in addition increasing the hocl concentrations also retarded the bro3 formation in the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy the inhibition of the bro3 formation followed the same trend except that the inhibitions in the worst and the best cases were 75 and 98 respectively when comparing the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies at the same pair of hocl and nh3 concentrations the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy inhibits the bro3 formation more and gives a longer retardation period than the cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategy the better inhibition of the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process by the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy is different from wert and benotti 2010 s finding that the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies are equally effective in controlling the bro3 formation the reason underlying the better performance of the nh3 cl2 over the cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategy inhibiting the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process was assessed by a kinetic model the model is described in text s5 and can be explained by the compounds formed and their concentrations during the pre treatment step luh and mariñas 2014 yang et al 2014 the final concentrations of hocl br nh3 nh2cl nh2br nhbr2 and nhbrcl after the pre treatment step are listed in table 2 at different hocl concentrations and table 3 at different nh3 concentrations as shown in tables 2 and 3 for each dosage pair the remaining nh3 concentrations after the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies are almost the same however the nh2cl concentrations after the nh3 cl2 pretreatment are always higher than those after the cl2 nh3 pretreatment mainly due to the faster reaction rate constant between hocl and nh3 comparing with that between hocl and br buffle et al 2004 wert et al 2007 wert and benotti 2010 such trends are always associated with better inhibition of the bro3 formation by the cl2 nh3 pretreatment compared to that by the cl2 nh3 treatment more interestingly similar inhibition performances were observed under conditions that had similar amounts of nh2cl for example an inhibition of about 80 was observed at initial hocl concentrations of 10 and 6 μm in the co ii pms process with cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies respectively both of which yielded a nh2cl concentration of about 11 8 μm after the pretreatment the association between the nh2cl concentration and the inhibition of the bro3 formation suggests that nh2cl is the key species contributing to the better performance of the nh3 cl2 over the cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategy nh2cl is known to react with hobr to form nhbrcl at a reaction rate constant of 2 86 105 m 1 s 1 eq 10 in table 1 luh and mariñas 2014 in the co ii pms process the nh2cl formed during the nh3 cl2 and cl2 nh3 pretreatment stage stays as nh2cl rather than nh3cl at ph 4 0 due to its low pka of 2 0 isaac and morris 1983 mitch et al 2005 in addition nh2cl has a similar reaction rate constant towards so4 comparing with nh3 nh4 neta et al 1988 suggesting that it will not significantly quench so4 as it does by quenching ho formed in ozonation buffle et al 2004 ikehata et al 2013 considering the preformed nh2cl concentrations ranging from 2 1 to 14 2 μm the apparent reaction rate constants between nh2cl and hobr are at least 0 60 s 1 detailed calculations are in text s6 which are more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than that between so4 and hobr at 6 89 10 3 s 1 therefore hobr once formed is immediately quenched by nh2cl to form nhbrcl if the amount of nh2cl is sufficient a kinetic model was built to simulate the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process pretreated with the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 strategies at different initial hocl and nh3 concentrations the model is described in text s7 the simulated bro3 formation is plotted in fig 2 in dashed lines showing similar trends to the experimental data in the cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategy at an hocl concentration of 6 μm the nh2cl concentration was only 2 1 μm and nh2cl was consumed by over 90 in 2 min by the 5 μm hobr formed initially in the co ii pms process as calculated by the model then the oxidation of hobr to bro3 in the subsequent co ii pms process can only be inhibited by nh3 which was not effective as discussed in section 3 1 at hocl concentrations of 10 and 15 μm the nh2cl concentrations 5 26 and 10 μm respectively were sufficient to react with the 5 μm hobr formed initially in the co ii pms process nhbrcl produced from the reaction between nh2cl and hobr was oxidized in the co ii pms process to form no3 hobr br and hocl eq 13 in table 1 li and blatchley 2009 li et al 2015 lutze et al 2015 the released hocl reacts with either nh3 from 1 8 10 10 to 2 2 10 10 m or so4 about 2 12 10 12 m as indicated in eq 7 and eq 14 in table 1 yang et al 2014 the apparent reaction rates between nh3 and hocl are from 7 56 10 4 s 1 to 9 24 10 4 s 1 while that between so4 and hocl is about 1 91 10 3 s 1 the reaction between hocl and so4 is thus 2 to 2 5 times faster than that between hocl and nh3 leading to the gradual decay of nh2cl luh and mariñas 2014 and the formation of clo3 lutze et al 2015 nh2cl is thus the critical species inhibiting the bro3 formation the model can then be used to explain the more significant inhibition and longer retardation period of the bro3 formation by the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy in the co ii pms process and the trends of the bro3 formation by the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies in the co ii pms process at different nh3 concentrations as shown in the dashed lines in fig 2 it should be noted that neither the cl2 nh3 nor nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies compromise the so4 generation in the co ii pms process as the benzoic acid degradation rate constants are similar at different conditions fig s3 however the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies reduced the mineralization efficiency of the co ii pms process mainly due to the competitive consumption of so4 between nh2cl and some small molecular weight intermediates formed in the process fig s4 neta et al 1988 wert et al 2007 3 3 effects of co ii and br concentrations on the inhibition of bro3 formation by the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment in the co ii pms process at a fixed pms dosage increasing the co ii and br dosages increased the bro3 formation li et al 2015 therefore their effects on the inhibition of bro3 formation by the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies were studied fig 3 shows the effects of a co ii and b br concentrations on the inhibition of the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process by a 50 μm nh3 addition the nh3 addition at 50 μm inhibited the bro3 formation at low co ii and high br concentrations in the co ii pms process as shown in fig 3a the addition of 50 μm nh3 reduced 87 3 and 9 24 of bro3 formed at co ii concentrations of 5 and 20 μm respectively at 20 min and significantly retarded the bro3 formation however it cannot reduce or retard the bro3 formation at a co ii concentration of 100 μm due to the much higher oxidation potential by the addition of high co ii concentrations in the solution as reported by li et al 2015 increasing the co ii dosage from 20 to 100 μm increased the formation rates of bro3 and hobr by about 5 times in the co ii pms process which beyond the quenching capacity of 50 μm nh3 and thus cannot inhibit the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process for the bro3 formation at different br dosages the addition of 50 μm nh3 retarded the bro3 formation at br dosages of 2 5 and 10 μm but only inhibited the overall bro3 formation at the br dosage of 10 μm by about 70 as shown in fig 3b suggesting that the nh3 addition performs better at higher br dosages fig 4 shows the effects of a co ii and b br concentrations on inhibiting the bro3 formation during the co ii pms process by the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies as shown in fig 4a the bro3 formation at all co ii concentrations by both pretreatment strategies was inhibited by more than 70 and the inhibition was more significant at lower co ii concentrations at a co ii concentration of 5 μm no bro3 was formed in either process whereas at co ii concentrations of 20 and 100 μm the bro3 formation was inhibited by about 90 and 70 respectively after the nh3 cl2 and cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategies but it was much retarded after the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy at co ii concentrations of both 20 and 100 μm as shown in fig 4b the bro3 formation at all br concentrations in both pretreatment strategies was inhibited by more than 90 and the inhibition was more significant at lower br concentrations at a br concentration of 2 μm no bro3 was formed in either strategy whereas at the br concentrations of 5 and 10 μm the bro3 formation was inhibited by about 95 and 90 respectively after the nh3 cl2 and cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategies but it was much retarded after the nh3 cl2 pretreatment at the br concentrations of both 5 and 10 μm from fig 4a and b we conclude that both the nh3 cl2 and cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategies inhibit the bro3 formation well at low co ii and br dosages but nh3 cl2 pretreatment provides a longer retardation period for the bro3 formation 4 conclusions this paper describes the effectiveness of the nh3 addition cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies on inhibiting the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process at the most effective ph of 4 0 and proposes inhibition mechanisms for the pretreatment strategies the nh3 addition in the co ii pms process at ph 4 and br co ii and pms dosages of 5 20 and 200 μm respectively reduces 2 6 9 5 and 75 of the bro3 formation after 20 min at nh3 dosages of 20 50 and 200 μm respectively however we do not recommend adding 200 μm of nh3 equivalent to 2 8 mg l as n to control the bro3 formation in the process since the amount of nitrogen in water might cause problems the mechanism of the nh3 addition is to quench hobr the key intermediate in the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process by nh3 the incomplete control of the bro3 formation is mainly attributed to the protonation of nh3 at ph 4 for both the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies the addition of 15 μm hocl and 50 μm nh3 reduced the overall bro3 formation by more than 95 and retarded the bro3 formation in the co ii pms process at co ii pms br dosages of 20 200 and 5 μm respectively in 20 min the inhibition of the bro3 formation in both pretreatment strategies was mainly attributed to the quenching of hobr by nh2cl formed in the pretreatment stages nh2cl effectively outcompeted so4 to react with hobr to form nhbrcl with the apparent rate constant of the former more than 100 times faster than the latter the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy in forming more nh2cl therefore outperformed cl2 nh3 the nh3 cl2 and cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategies inhibit the bro3 formation more at lower co ii and br concentrations since the degradation of nhbrcl in the co ii pms process reforms hobr which although less in quantity is oxidized to bro3 at higher co ii and br concentrations it should be noticed that the controlling capacity of the nh3 addition nh3 cl2 and cl2 nh3 pretreatment strategies will not be compromised and might even be enhanced at higher phs with increasing ph the equilibrium will shift from nh4 towards nh3 and thus increase the nh3 concentrations in water qiang and adams 2004 while nh2cl remains stable at all phs under similar experimental conditions mitch et al 2005 in addition in some cases in fig 2a b and 2c the modeled bro3 formation is delayed comparing to the experimental data hollow points especially in the nh3 cl2 process in fig 2c the mismatch during the reaction may be caused by a underestimation of the decomposition of the bromamines and chloramines in the co ii pms process which stay in the solution to quench hobr or b direct oxidation of bromine in nhbr2 to bro3 without reducing it to br more investigation is needed to further explain the mismatch during the reaction good and van briesen 2017 showed the median br concentrations in one river in the us downstream some power plants are in the ranges of 180 410 μg l equivalent to 2 25 5 125 μm the nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategy at nh3 and hocl concentrations of 60 and 15 μm respectively can successfully inhibit the bro3 formation exceeding its maximum level of the drinking water quality standard 6 752 μg l bro3 formed after 20 min up to an initial br concentration of 5 μm in addition the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies may further reduce the amount of tribromomethane and dibromoacetic acid formed in the co ii pms process liu et al 2015 xie et al 2016 due to the inhibition of the reaction between bromine radical species and organic matters by cl xie et al 2016 in 20 min about 90 99 of 20 μm benzoic acid in the co ii pms process under the experimental conditions in the current manuscript can be removed in real water the apparent degradation rate constants of other micropollutants in the co ii pms process should be in similar orders li et al 2015 xiao et al 2015 and thus would not require a longer reaction time therefore the delay of the bromate formation for 15 20 min rather than to pursue the total inhibition of the bromate formation in the co ii pms process with the cl2 nh3 and nh3 cl2 pretreatment strategies can effectively degrade micropollutants and simultaneously control the bro3 formation acknowledgement this work

19571,the complete methanogenic degradation of n n dimethylformamide dmf was achieved in this study initially dmf was found to be feebly degradable by a lab scale submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor sanmbr using normal anaerobic digestion sludge ads even after 120 day s culturing however aerobic dmf degrading activated sludge as was rapidly cultivated in a continuous aeration reactor car a specially designed anaerobic co cultured sludge acs made by artificially mixing as with ads was successfully domesticated by a long term repeated batch experiment the results demonstrated that acs could effectively degrade over 5000 mg l 1 dmf for methane recovery the metabolic pathway and stoichiometric equation of dmf methanogenic degradation were also revealed and verified in detail it was confirmed that under the anaerobic condition with the help of enzyme dmf converts into dimethylamine and formic acid and the intermediates are effectively fermented through methylotrophic hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis analysis of the microbial community suggested that some facultatively anaerobic bacteria played the key roles in methanogenic degradation due to their dmf hydrolyzing ability by co culturing two sources of inoculum under the anaerobic condition the symbiosis of facultatively anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing bacteria and methylotrophic hydrogenotrophic methanogens makes methanogenic degradation of dmf available this study also provides a novel sludge cultivation method for anaerobic treatment of degradation resistant organics graphical abstract image 1 keywords n n dimethylformamide methanogenic degradation hydrolysis enzyme facultative anaerobes co culture 1 introduction as a versatile organic polar solvent n n dimethylformamide dmf ch3 2ncho has been widely employed in a variety of chemical and manufacturing industries due to its excellent water miscibility bromley challenor et al 2000a sanjeev kumar et al 2013 swaroop et al 2009 consequently a massive amount of industrial wastewater which usually contains high concentration of dmf was produced from chemical processing according to statistics from the ministry of the environment in japan dmf ranks 9th on the pollutant release and transfer register with approximately 5 36 103 tons of dmf either discharged or transferred in 2015 jmoe 2015 moreover it has been estimated that the global consumption of dmf will increase at an average annual rate of about 3 5 during 2013 2018 ceh 2014 dmf is poisonous and presents a human health hazard it is both hepatotoxic and carcinogenic twiner et al 1998 also because of its thermal stability and low degradability it remains obstinate in natural environment sanjeev kumar et al 2012 as a result the effective treatment of dmf containing wastewater has become a challenge which has garnered the attention of researchers worldwide most of the physical and chemical methods proposed for dmf removal das et al 2006 kamimoto et al 2009 sun et al 2008 ye et al 2013

dmfase have been identified and the feasibility of using dmf as the sole substrate has been shown dziewit et al 2010 sanjeev kumar et al 2013 schär et al 1986 siddavattam et al 2011 urakami et al 1990 veeranagouda et al 2006 in pathway ii dmf loses methyl groups and converts into n methylformamide nmf formaldehyde hcho and formamide f by repeated oxidative demethylation considering the toxicity and the inhibition effect of dmf on sludge previous researchers have either not considered the possibility of dmf methanogenic degradation chen et al 2015 rahmaninezhad et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 yang et al 2014 or have regarded dmf as a degradation resistant compound under anaerobic conditions bromley challenor et al 2000a vidhya and thatheyus 2013 compared with aerobic process anaerobic digestion ad has been considered as one of the most suitable processes to treat wastewater containing high concentration of organic waste owing to its merits of less biomass yield and energy production de vrieze et al 2015 jang et al 2014 le and stuckey 2017 an effective process for the degradation of toxic and obstinate dmf containing wastewater for large scale operations using methanogenic degradation for bioenergy recovery would be a significant step forward however the mechanisms have yet to be determined and the concept of methanogenic degradation has not been applied to the treatment of dmf containing wastewater on the other hand dma and mma the intermediate products of dmf produced in pathway i which serve as substrates in methylotrophic methanogenesis have been well documented ferguson et al 2000 naumann et al 1984 yeliseev et al 1993 by assuming that dmf can be degraded anaerobically conforming to pathway i the following methanogenesis phases of dma and mma are theoretically

the sequence number of each sample to 40 000 3 results and discussion 3 1 toxicity influence of dmf on methane fermentation the toxicity inhibition of dmf on methanogenesis was performed by a group of sma tests the influence of different dmf dosage concentrations on smas of acetic acid hac methanol meoh and h2 co2 or hcooh were investigated respectively although it has been reported that dmf had a toxic effect on activated sludge yang et al 2014 the results of this study shown in fig 1 suggested that sma remained even after high doses of concentrated dmf ic50 and ic10 were 28 32 g cod l 1 and 39 91 g cod l 1 respectively the high inhibition concentrations of dmf suggested that the inhibition effect of dmf on methanogenesis was indistinctive therefore the attempt on methanogenic degradation of dmf was considerable in this study 3 2 biodegradability of dmf and anaerobic sludge cultivation by sanmbr as illustrated in fig 2 during the batch cultivation period of sanmbr the dmf concentration slightly decreased from 328 64 mg l 1 to 269 63 mg l 1 indicating weak dmf removal even though an increase in the nh4 concentration was observed it was likely that the decay and lysis of sludge released nh4 during the continuous operation period synthetic wastewater containing 500 1000 mg dmf l 1 was pumped into the sanmbr and effluent was permeated by a flat membrane both the influent 7 31 0 22 and effluent ph 7 42 0 32 remained stable however there was barely no dmf degradation being observed dmf removal efficiency was consistently below 6 besides low nh4 concentration also indicated that little substrate had decomposed a small amount of biogas was produced during the entire period with a ch4 content of less than 40 however the low concentrations of possible intermediate products dma mma and hcooh detected since day 23 demonstrated that a small quantity of dmf was indeed degraded under anaerobic condition yet this biodegradability of dmf was weak and unreliable even after 120 days of cultivation it should be noted that while it has been reported that dmf anaerobic digestion was observed in a previous study no detailed information of the seed sludge or evidence of intermediates was provided stronach et al 1987 but another study suggested that the seed inoculum contains wasted activated sludge lausund 2014 which perhaps helps to degrade dmf however we could not repeat the results of previous studies by using the normal ads from a local wastewater treatment plant because the ads in this study seemed to lack dmf degrading microorganisms the results of our experiment suggested that the biodegradability of dmf may depend on the type of seed sludge therefore an effective cultivation method for dmf degrading sludge was clearly required 3 3 cultivation of dmf degrading activated sludge by car since the aerobic degradation of dmf has been widely reported rahmaninezhad et al 2016 sanjeev kumar et al 2012 xiao et al 2016 yang et al 2014 the cultivation of dmf degrading activated sludge as by car was considered a feasible option as shown in fig 3 a rapid decrease in the dmf concentration was observed within one week and high concentrations of dma and mma were detected during the continuous operation period both the influent 7 28 0 12 and effluent ph 8 34 0 37 remained stable although the dmf concentration in synthetic wastewater was elevated to 2000 mg l 1 the effluent dmf was consistently below 20 mg l 1 and the concentrations of the intermediate products were also low indicating a remarkable removal efficiency of almost 100 the results demonstrated that dmf can be effectively degraded under the aerobic condition and that dmf degrading activated sludge was successfully cultured by continuous aeration nevertheless according to the metabolic pathway of dmf mentioned above if anaerobic hydrolysis of dmf can be achieved methane producing archaea were able to directly utilize intermediates some previous studies enhanced the performance of anaerobic digestion or pre treatment by combining as with ads bromley challenor et al 2000b peces et al 2016 similarly we also made an attempt on co culturing a mixed sludge therefore we supposed that there might be facultatively anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing microorganisms in the as as normal ads from a wastewater treatment plant always contains abundant methane producing archaea the mixture of as with ads under anaerobic condition suggests those facultatively anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing microorganisms can effectively hydrolyze dmf this provides a thorough methanogenic degradation process for dmf 3 4 methanogenic degradation of dmf by a co culture of dmf degrading as and ads the entire batch test was conducted for 62 days and the concentrations of dmf nh4 and the intermediate products dma mma and hcooh are given in fig 4 with the biogas accumulation for the acs group a rapid decrease in the dmf was observed with a high amount of biogas production during the adaptive phase the increase in nh4 and observation of high intermediate products concentrations demonstrated that dmf was successfully and effectively degraded by the acs anaerobically however because the acs consisted of as and ads it was possible that the aerobic microorganisms may only temporarily remain activated and not survive under anaerobic condition during the adaptive phase consequently in order to eliminate that risk the acs should be tested and qualified repeatedly hence when the production of biogas was low a new phase was begun by centrifuging acs at 10000 rpm for 10 min and abandoning the old supernatant and refilling with a new substrate containing the same dmf concentration and nutrients as well as sparging with pure nitrogen gas for 30 min from day 23 to day 63 repeated batch tests were conducted under the same condition 4 times apparently steeper slopes of dmf concentrations demonstrated the degradation of dmf was more rapid in phase 2 with 5000 mg l 1 dmf consumed thoroughly within 10 days and a corresponding increase in the nh4 concentration after phase 2 the concentrations of the intermediate products including dma mma and hcooh were obviously lower than that in phase 1 and were almost determined during the early period of each phase which suggested intermediates were effectively utilized and acs was gradually becoming acclimated and specific to dmf it should be noted that in the ads control the concentration of dmf concentration changed only slightly and almost no biogas or nh4 was produced during the entire period with no intermediate products detected the results of ads control accorded with our failed sanmbr suggesting again that the ads from the wastewater treatment plant was unable to effectively degrade dmf the results indicated that a specially designed acs was successfully domesticated by combing two sources of inoculum dmf degrading as and normal ads under the anaerobic condition it is also possible that some facultatively anaerobic microorganisms played key roles in the anaerobic hydrolysis of dmf helping to degrade dmf anaerobically 3 5 mechanism of dmf methanogenic degradation dmf hydrolyzing enzyme in order to determine the significance of facultatively anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing microorganisms raw enzyme solutions of both dmf degrading as and acs were extracted an enzymatic specific activity esa test and a bmp test were respectively performed to verify the role of the dmf hydrolyzing enzyme in methanogenic degradation in the esa test serum vials were filled with 80 ml of raw enzyme extractions and dosed with dmf as shown in fig 5 a and b both raw enzyme extractions from as and acs after the long term batch experiment directly revealed dmf hydrolyzing ability with esas of 2 76 u mg 1 and 1 94 u mg 1 respectively in the bmp test serum vials were inoculated with 30 ml ads and 50 ml enzyme solution diluted to 100 50 20 10 and 0 respectively then dosed with 2000 mg cod l 1 dmf as raw enzyme extraction contains impurities like vfas as well as proteins and carbohydrates which were simultaneously extracted from the smashed cells along with enzyme these organic residuals could serve as substrates and be further fermented by ads therefore a control group without dmf was conducted in parallel to eliminate extra biogas production the results shown in fig 6 a and b indicated that the ads previously shown to be unable to degrade dmf began to produce methane from dmf after dosing with the enzyme extracted from as the results also revealed that dosing with the enzyme significantly influenced methane production more methane was produced when the enzyme dosage was increased from 0 to 100 even though all groups were fed with the same dmf concentration similarly in fig 6 c and d enzyme extraction of the acclimated acs also exhibited dmf hydrolyzing ability this is further evidence that facultatively anaerobic microorganisms surviving in acs indeed produced dmf hydrolyzing enzymes playing a key role in the hydrolysis step of dmf methanogenic degradation 3 6 verification of stoichiometric equation of dmf methanogenic degradation the theoretical stoichiometric equation of dmf methanogenic degradation below is based on empirical formula when neglecting biomass growth fang and zhang 2015 10 c n h a o b n c 4 n 7 c a 2 b 4 h 2 o 4 n 3 c a 2 b 8 c h 4 4 n 3 c a 2 b 8 c o 2 c n h 4 c h c o 3 in order to verify this equation by a real case another bmp test was conducted by respectively dosing dmf with increments of 500 mg l 1 into four serum vials the initial dmf concentrations total ch4 and co2 productions and final nh4 concentrations neglecting biomass growth were recorded and manipulated into mole concentrations the correlations of dmf between ch4 co2 and nh4 were respectively obtained by linear fittings with slopes representing 1 mol of dmf converted to a number of moles of ch4 co2 and nh4 as shown in fig 7 the four dmf concentration gradients fitted well with the final products the real mole coefficients calculated by the bmp test were 1 67 ch4 0 26 co2 and 0 93 nh4 which were in fairly good agreement with the theoretical values of 1 75 0 25 and 1 according to eq 6 demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of this stoichiometric equation and a thorough conversion from dmf to methane 3 7 metabolic pathway intermediate products and functional strains identification dmf was reported to be metabolized by two pathways and that the intermediate products produced on these two pathways were different although it was much more likely that dmf would convert into dma hcooh and mma under anaerobic condition since all these intermediates are methanogenic substrates it was considered possible that another pathway existed an sma test was conducted to determine whether pathway ii n methylformamide formamide and formaldehyde was relevant to the metabolization of dmf or whether it could be eliminated all the potential intermediate products including hac and meoh for basic methanogenesis were fed into the acs to test whether they could be fermented the results of the sma test illustrated in fig 8 indicated that while the n methylformamide nmf and formamide f were utilized by acs no methanogenic ability was found for hcho weaker than blank control recorded as zero as nmf and f are amides with properties were similar to dmf they were also potential substrates to acs nevertheless the unavailability of hcho suggests that dmf does not anaerobically decompose into hcho besides the high activities of meoh dma mma and hcooh and inactivation of hac indicate that the methanogenic pathways of dmf were methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic rather acetotrophic moreover the uplc spectrogram shown in fig 9 provides clear evidence that after 12 h 24 h and even 48 h no sign of nmf or f peak was observed in the batch samples from these results it was concluded that pathway ii did not exist under the anaerobic condition and the metabolic pathway of dmf methanogenic degradation was as follows dmf converts into dma further into mma and hcooh under anaerobic condition and intermediates convert to ch4 co2 and nh4 the microbial community structures of both bacteria and archaea in the sludge were analyzed by high throughput sequencing samples were taken from seed ads of sanmbr ads 0 as on day 30 as 30 ads of sanmbr on day 120 ads 120 and acs on day 54 acs 54 respectively genera which occupied relative abundance 0 5 were illustrated as representatives in fig 10 and uncultured sequences were classified as others in the case of bacteria paracoccus was clearly predominant in as 30 with 21 29 abundance but rare in both ads 0 and ads 120 indicating its excellent ability to degrade dmf under the aerobic condition as reported in previous studies nisha et al 2015 sanjeev kumar et al 2013 siddavattam et al 2011 and paracoccus also accounted for 2 52 in acs 54 however the representative bacteria in ads 0 and ads 120 did not seem either dmf degradable or dmf related which somehow explains why the ads of sanmbr in this study was unable to anaerobically degrade dmf consequently the predominant bacterial strains in both as 30 and acs 54 which were subordinated in ads 0 and ads 120 were selected as potential candidates for facultatively anaerobic dmf hydrolysis these are given in table 1 the results indicate that members of genus paracoccus were targeted among which paracoccus huijuniae sun et al 2013 paracoccus denitrificans and paracoccus kocurii ohara et al 1990 all aligned as facultative anaerobes were considered the most likely key dmf hydrolyzing strains due to their known ability to utilize amides or amines especially in the case of p denitrificans which has been documented as a dmf degrading strain in previous studies sanjeev kumar et al 2013 siddavattam et al 2011 however since paracoccus only remained 2 52 in acs 54 other bacteria might also be responsible for the hydrolysis of dmf catellibacterium nanjingense which accounted for 1 03 in acs 54 was also considered a possible facultative candidate since it has been reported capable of degrading propanil amide zhang et al 2012 besides nitratireductor aquibiodomus labbe 2004 and hyphomicrobium zavarzinii jérôme et al 2007 accounting 2 79 and 6 71 respectively in acs 54 were also considered likely to be facultative anaerobes although there is no direct evidence of their ability to degrade dmf they have been reported capable of degrading c1 sources such as mma which are dmf related the hydrolyzing ability of nitratireductor aquibiodomus and hyphomicrobium zavarzinii needs to be determined in a future study in the case of archaea it was obvious that acetotrophic genus methanosaeta lü et al 2016 venkiteshwaran et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 predominated in ads 120 with 70 73 abundance because dmf was so ineffectively degraded the ads in the sanmbr self digested with acetotrophic methanogens feeding on decayed cells it should be noted that the total number of archaeal sequences of acs 54 was much larger than other samples indicating that methanogens in acs smoothly grew with the substrates among which methylotrophic methanomethylovorans liu et al 2017 padmasiri et al 2007 obtained overwhelming superiority 75 35 in acs 54 and formate hydrogen utilizing methanobrevibacter cerrillo et al 2017 fang et al 1995 gagliano et al 2015 li et al 2014 also predominated 18 12 the results are further evidence that the intermediate products of dmf are dma mma and hcooh which are responsible for methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens and also show that the shift in the archaeal community from acetotrophic to methylotrophic hydrogenotrophic was significantly influenced by the facultative anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing bacteria this suggests that a specially designed consortium consisting of facultative anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing bacteria such as paracoccus along with methanogens methanomethylovorans and methanobrevibacter has potential for a thorough methanogenic degradation of dmf 4 conclusions the complete methanogenic degradation from dmf to methane was firstly achieved by introducing a co cultured sludge in this study the possibility and feasibility of dmf anaerobic treatment were systematically complemented and verified in detail by investigating stoichiometry and metabolism of dmf methanogenic degradation also leading the following key conclusions of significant enlightenments for the anaerobic treatment of dmf containing wastewater dmf exhibited weak biodegradability when fed to normal anaerobic digestion sludge as in which the lack of anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing microorganisms restricted dmf from hydrolyzing into fermentable intermediates dma and hcooh the inoculation of dmf hydrolyzing consortium or enzyme into anaerobic digestion sludge makes the conversion from dmf to methane available and effective a mixed consortium which consists of facultative anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing bacteria along with methylotrophic hydrogenotrophic methanogens has the potential for the methanogenic degradation of dmf and the consortium could be easily co cultured with activated sludge and anaerobic digestion sludge acknowledgements this work was supported by japan society for the promotion of science jsps no 17j02720 and china

19571,the complete methanogenic degradation of n n dimethylformamide dmf was achieved in this study initially dmf was found to be feebly degradable by a lab scale submerged anaerobic membrane

was confirmed that under the anaerobic condition with the help of enzyme dmf converts into dimethylamine and formic acid and the intermediates are effectively fermented through methylotrophic hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis analysis of the microbial community suggested that some facultatively anaerobic bacteria played the key roles in methanogenic degradation due to their dmf hydrolyzing ability by co culturing two sources of inoculum under the anaerobic condition the symbiosis of facultatively anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing bacteria and methylotrophic hydrogenotrophic methanogens makes methanogenic degradation of dmf available this study also provides a novel sludge cultivation method for anaerobic treatment of degradation resistant organics graphical abstract image 1 keywords n n

employed in a variety of chemical and manufacturing industries due to its excellent water miscibility bromley challenor et al 2000a sanjeev kumar et al 2013 swaroop et al 2009 consequently a massive amount of industrial wastewater which usually contains high concentration of dmf was produced from chemical processing according to statistics from the ministry of the environment in japan dmf ranks 9th on the pollutant release and transfer register with approximately 5 36 103 tons of dmf either discharged or transferred in 2015 jmoe 2015 moreover it has been estimated that the global consumption of dmf will increase at an average annual rate of about 3 5 during 2013 2018 ceh 2014 dmf is poisonous and presents a human health hazard it is both hepatotoxic and carcinogenic twiner et al 1998 also because of its thermal stability and low degradability it remains obstinate in natural environment sanjeev kumar et al 2012 as a result the effective treatment of dmf containing wastewater has become a challenge which has garnered the attention of researchers worldwide most of the physical and chemical methods proposed for dmf removal das et al 2006 kamimoto et al 2009 sun et al 2008 ye et al 2013

has been considered as one of the most suitable processes to treat wastewater containing high concentration of organic waste owing to its merits of less biomass yield and energy production de vrieze et al 2015 jang et al 2014 le and stuckey 2017 an effective process for the degradation of toxic and obstinate dmf containing wastewater for large scale operations using methanogenic degradation for bioenergy recovery would be a significant step forward however the mechanisms have yet to be determined and the concept of methanogenic degradation has not been applied to the treatment of dmf

et al 2000 naumann et al 1984 yeliseev et al 1993 by assuming that dmf can be degraded anaerobically conforming to pathway i the following methanogenesis phases of dma and mma are theoretically

the sequence number of each sample to 40 000 3 results and discussion 3 1 toxicity influence of dmf on methane fermentation the toxicity inhibition of dmf on methanogenesis was performed by a group of sma tests the influence of different dmf dosage concentrations on smas of acetic acid hac methanol meoh and h2 co2 or hcooh were investigated respectively although it has been reported that dmf had a toxic effect on activated sludge yang et al 2014 the results of this study shown in fig 1 suggested that sma remained even after high doses of concentrated dmf ic50 and ic10 were 28 32 g cod l 1 and 39 91 g cod l 1 respectively the high inhibition concentrations of dmf suggested that the inhibition effect of dmf on methanogenesis was indistinctive therefore the attempt on methanogenic degradation of dmf was considerable in this study 3 2 biodegradability of dmf and anaerobic sludge cultivation by sanmbr as illustrated in fig 2 during the batch cultivation period of sanmbr the dmf concentration slightly decreased from 328 64 mg l 1 to 269 63 mg l 1 indicating weak dmf removal even though an increase in the nh4 concentration was observed it was likely that the decay and lysis of sludge released nh4 during the continuous operation period synthetic wastewater containing 500 1000 mg dmf l 1 was pumped into the sanmbr and effluent was permeated by a flat membrane both the influent 7 31 0 22 and effluent ph 7 42 0 32 remained stable however there was barely no dmf degradation being observed dmf removal efficiency was consistently below 6 besides low nh4 concentration also indicated that little substrate had decomposed a small amount of biogas was produced during the entire period with a ch4 content of less than 40 however the low concentrations of possible intermediate products dma mma and hcooh detected since day 23 demonstrated that a small quantity of dmf was indeed degraded under anaerobic condition yet this biodegradability of dmf was weak and unreliable even after 120 days of cultivation it should be noted that while it has been reported that dmf anaerobic digestion was observed in a previous study no detailed information of the seed sludge or evidence of intermediates was provided stronach et al 1987 but another study suggested that the seed inoculum contains wasted activated sludge lausund 2014 which perhaps helps to degrade dmf however we could not repeat the results of previous studies by using the normal ads from a local wastewater treatment plant because the ads in this study seemed to lack dmf degrading microorganisms the results of our experiment suggested that the biodegradability of dmf may depend on the type of seed sludge therefore an effective cultivation method for dmf degrading sludge was clearly required 3 3 cultivation of dmf degrading activated sludge by car since the aerobic degradation of dmf has been widely reported rahmaninezhad et al 2016 sanjeev kumar et al 2012 xiao et al 2016 yang et al 2014 the cultivation of dmf degrading activated sludge as by car was considered a feasible option as shown in fig 3 a rapid decrease in the dmf concentration was observed within one week and high concentrations of dma and mma were detected during the continuous operation period both the influent 7 28 0 12 and effluent ph 8 34 0 37 remained stable although the dmf concentration in synthetic wastewater was elevated to 2000 mg l 1 the effluent dmf was consistently below 20 mg l 1 and the concentrations of the intermediate products were also low indicating a remarkable removal efficiency of almost 100 the results demonstrated that dmf can be effectively degraded under the aerobic condition and that dmf degrading activated sludge was successfully cultured by continuous aeration nevertheless according to the metabolic pathway of dmf mentioned above if anaerobic hydrolysis of dmf can be achieved methane producing archaea were able to directly utilize intermediates some previous studies enhanced the performance of anaerobic digestion or pre treatment by combining as with ads bromley challenor et al 2000b peces et al 2016 similarly we also made an attempt on co culturing a mixed sludge therefore we supposed that there might be facultatively anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing microorganisms in the as as normal ads from a wastewater treatment plant always contains abundant methane producing archaea the mixture of as with ads under anaerobic condition suggests those facultatively anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing microorganisms can effectively hydrolyze dmf this provides a thorough methanogenic degradation process for dmf 3 4 methanogenic degradation of dmf by a co culture of dmf degrading as and ads the entire batch test was conducted for 62 days and the concentrations of dmf nh4 and the intermediate products dma mma and hcooh are given in fig 4 with the biogas accumulation for the acs group a rapid decrease in the dmf was observed with a high amount of biogas production during the adaptive phase the increase in nh4 and observation of high intermediate products concentrations demonstrated that dmf was successfully and effectively degraded by the acs anaerobically however because the acs consisted of as and ads it was possible that the aerobic microorganisms may only temporarily remain activated and not survive under anaerobic condition during the adaptive phase consequently in order to eliminate that risk the acs should be tested and qualified repeatedly hence when the production of biogas was low a new phase was begun by centrifuging acs at 10000 rpm for 10 min and abandoning the old supernatant and refilling with a new substrate containing the same dmf concentration and nutrients as well as sparging with pure nitrogen gas for 30 min from day 23 to day 63 repeated batch tests were conducted under the same condition 4 times apparently steeper slopes of dmf concentrations demonstrated the degradation of dmf was more rapid in phase 2 with 5000 mg l 1 dmf consumed thoroughly within 10 days and a corresponding increase in the nh4 concentration after phase 2 the concentrations of the intermediate products including dma mma and hcooh were obviously lower than that in phase 1 and were almost determined during the early period of each phase which suggested intermediates were effectively utilized and acs was gradually becoming acclimated and specific to dmf it should be noted that in the ads control the concentration of dmf concentration changed only slightly and almost no biogas or nh4 was produced during the entire period with no intermediate products detected the results of ads control accorded with our failed sanmbr suggesting again that the ads from the wastewater treatment plant was unable to effectively degrade dmf the results indicated that a specially designed acs was successfully domesticated by combing two sources of inoculum dmf degrading as and normal ads under the anaerobic condition it is also possible that some facultatively anaerobic microorganisms played key roles in the anaerobic hydrolysis of dmf helping to degrade dmf anaerobically 3 5 mechanism of dmf methanogenic degradation dmf hydrolyzing enzyme in order to determine the significance of facultatively anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing microorganisms raw enzyme solutions of both dmf degrading as and acs were extracted an enzymatic specific activity esa test and a bmp test were respectively performed to verify the role of the dmf hydrolyzing enzyme in methanogenic degradation in the esa test serum vials were filled with 80 ml of raw enzyme extractions and dosed with dmf as shown in fig 5 a and b both raw enzyme extractions from as and acs after the long term batch experiment directly revealed dmf hydrolyzing ability with esas of 2 76 u mg 1 and 1 94 u mg 1 respectively in the bmp test serum vials were inoculated with 30 ml ads and 50 ml enzyme solution diluted to 100 50 20 10 and 0 respectively then dosed with 2000 mg cod l 1 dmf as raw enzyme extraction contains impurities like vfas as well as proteins and carbohydrates which were simultaneously extracted from the smashed cells along with enzyme these organic residuals could serve as substrates and be further fermented by ads therefore a control group without dmf was conducted in parallel to eliminate extra biogas production the results shown in fig 6 a and b indicated that the ads previously shown to be unable to degrade dmf began to produce methane from dmf after dosing with the enzyme extracted from as the results also revealed that dosing with the enzyme significantly influenced methane production more methane was produced when the enzyme dosage was increased from 0 to 100 even though all groups were fed with the same dmf concentration similarly in fig 6 c and d enzyme extraction of the acclimated acs also exhibited dmf hydrolyzing ability this is further evidence that facultatively anaerobic microorganisms surviving in acs indeed produced dmf hydrolyzing enzymes playing a key role in the hydrolysis step of dmf methanogenic degradation 3 6 verification of stoichiometric equation of dmf methanogenic degradation the theoretical stoichiometric equation of dmf methanogenic degradation below is based on empirical formula when neglecting biomass growth fang and zhang 2015 10 c n h a o b n c 4 n 7 c a 2 b 4 h 2 o 4 n 3 c a 2 b 8 c h 4 4 n 3 c a 2 b 8 c o 2 c n h 4 c h c o 3 in order to verify this equation by a real case another bmp test was conducted by respectively dosing dmf with increments of 500 mg l 1 into four serum vials the initial dmf concentrations total ch4 and co2 productions and final nh4 concentrations neglecting biomass growth were recorded and manipulated into mole concentrations the correlations of dmf between ch4 co2 and nh4 were respectively obtained by linear fittings with slopes representing 1 mol of dmf converted to a number of moles of ch4 co2 and nh4 as shown in fig 7 the four dmf concentration gradients fitted well with the final products the real mole coefficients calculated by the bmp test were 1 67 ch4 0 26 co2 and 0 93 nh4 which were in fairly good agreement with the theoretical values of 1 75 0 25 and 1 according to eq 6 demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of this stoichiometric equation and a thorough conversion from dmf to methane 3 7 metabolic pathway intermediate products and functional strains identification dmf was reported to be metabolized by two pathways and that the intermediate products produced on these two pathways were different although it was much more likely that dmf would convert into dma hcooh and mma under anaerobic condition since all these intermediates are methanogenic substrates it was considered possible that another pathway existed an sma test was conducted to determine whether pathway ii n methylformamide formamide and formaldehyde was relevant to the metabolization of dmf or whether it could be eliminated all the potential intermediate products including hac and meoh for basic methanogenesis were fed into the acs to test whether they could be fermented the results of the sma test illustrated in fig 8 indicated that while the n methylformamide nmf and formamide f were utilized by acs no methanogenic ability was found for hcho weaker than blank control recorded as zero as nmf and f are amides with properties were similar to dmf they were also potential substrates to acs nevertheless the unavailability of hcho suggests that dmf does not anaerobically decompose into hcho besides the high activities of meoh dma mma and hcooh and inactivation of hac indicate that the methanogenic pathways of dmf were methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic rather acetotrophic moreover the uplc spectrogram shown in fig 9 provides clear evidence that after 12 h 24 h and even 48 h no sign of nmf or f peak was observed in the batch samples from these results it was concluded that pathway ii did not exist under the anaerobic condition and the metabolic pathway of dmf methanogenic degradation was as follows dmf converts into dma further into mma and hcooh under anaerobic condition and intermediates convert to ch4 co2 and nh4 the microbial community structures of both bacteria and archaea in the sludge were analyzed by high throughput sequencing samples were taken from seed ads of sanmbr ads 0 as on day 30 as 30 ads of sanmbr on day 120 ads 120 and acs on day 54 acs 54 respectively genera which occupied relative abundance 0 5 were illustrated as representatives in fig 10 and uncultured sequences were classified as others in the case of bacteria paracoccus was clearly predominant in as 30 with 21 29 abundance but rare in both ads 0 and ads 120 indicating its excellent ability to degrade dmf under the aerobic condition as reported in previous studies nisha et al 2015 sanjeev kumar et al 2013 siddavattam et al 2011 and paracoccus also accounted for 2 52 in acs 54 however the representative bacteria in ads 0 and ads 120 did not seem either dmf degradable or dmf related which somehow explains why the ads of sanmbr in this study was unable to anaerobically degrade dmf consequently the predominant bacterial strains in both as 30 and acs 54 which were subordinated in ads 0 and ads 120 were selected as potential candidates for facultatively anaerobic dmf hydrolysis these are given in table 1 the results indicate that members of genus paracoccus were targeted among which paracoccus huijuniae sun et al 2013 paracoccus denitrificans and paracoccus kocurii ohara et al 1990 all aligned as facultative anaerobes were considered the most likely key dmf hydrolyzing strains due to their known ability to utilize amides or amines especially in the case of p denitrificans which has been documented as a dmf degrading strain in previous studies sanjeev kumar et al 2013 siddavattam et al 2011 however since paracoccus only remained 2 52 in acs 54 other bacteria might also be responsible for the hydrolysis of dmf catellibacterium nanjingense which accounted for 1 03 in acs 54 was also considered a possible facultative candidate since it has been reported capable of degrading propanil amide zhang et al 2012 besides nitratireductor aquibiodomus labbe 2004 and hyphomicrobium zavarzinii jérôme et al 2007 accounting 2 79 and 6 71 respectively in acs 54 were also considered likely to be facultative anaerobes although there is no direct evidence of their ability to degrade dmf they have been reported capable of degrading c1 sources such as mma which are dmf related the hydrolyzing ability of nitratireductor aquibiodomus and hyphomicrobium zavarzinii needs to be determined in a future study in the case of archaea it was obvious that acetotrophic genus methanosaeta lü et al 2016 venkiteshwaran et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 predominated in ads 120 with 70 73 abundance because dmf was so ineffectively degraded the ads in the sanmbr self digested with acetotrophic methanogens feeding on decayed cells it should be noted that the total number of archaeal sequences of acs 54 was much larger than other samples indicating that methanogens in acs smoothly grew with the substrates among which methylotrophic methanomethylovorans liu et al 2017 padmasiri et al 2007 obtained overwhelming superiority 75 35 in acs 54 and formate hydrogen utilizing methanobrevibacter cerrillo et al 2017 fang et al 1995 gagliano et al 2015 li et al 2014 also predominated 18 12 the results are further evidence that the intermediate products of dmf are dma mma and hcooh which are responsible for methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens and also show that the shift in the archaeal community from acetotrophic to methylotrophic hydrogenotrophic was significantly influenced by the facultative anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing bacteria this suggests that a specially designed consortium consisting of facultative anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing bacteria such as paracoccus along with methanogens methanomethylovorans and methanobrevibacter has potential for a thorough methanogenic degradation of dmf 4 conclusions the complete methanogenic degradation from dmf to methane was firstly achieved by introducing a co cultured sludge in this study the possibility and feasibility of dmf anaerobic treatment were systematically complemented and verified in detail by investigating stoichiometry and metabolism of dmf methanogenic degradation also leading the following key conclusions of significant enlightenments for the anaerobic treatment of dmf containing wastewater dmf exhibited weak biodegradability when fed to normal anaerobic digestion sludge as in which the lack of anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing microorganisms restricted dmf from hydrolyzing into fermentable intermediates dma and hcooh the inoculation of dmf hydrolyzing consortium or enzyme into anaerobic digestion sludge makes the conversion from dmf to methane available and effective a mixed consortium which consists of facultative anaerobic dmf hydrolyzing bacteria along with methylotrophic hydrogenotrophic methanogens has the potential for the methanogenic degradation of dmf and the consortium could be easily co cultured with activated sludge and anaerobic digestion sludge acknowledgements this work was supported by japan society for the promotion of science jsps no 17j02720 and china

19572,when reclaimed water is used as municipal miscellaneous water acute exposure of the generated aerosol with high levels of endotoxins can cause severe inflammation in the lungs however the potential risks of long term inhalation of reclaimed water remains unclear to identify the adverse effects of sub chronic reclaimed water inhalation and explain the underlying mechanisms a mouse model of 12 week sub chronic exposure was established and wastewater before a membrane bioreactor mbr positive control and the mbr effluent reclaimed water which met the quality standard of urban use and was currently used for landscape irrigation were tested in this study the exposure dose was set to approach the real working scenarios lung lavage and histology were analyzed obvious epithelial cell apoptosis in the bronchi was observed along with the accumulation of myofibroblasts and the collagen deposition both in main bronchi and terminal bronchioles all these symptoms were persistent after 4 weeks of recovery inflammation and induced bronchus associated lymphoid tissues ibalt were also observed but diminished after recovery indicating inflammation may not be the direct cause of the symptom furthermore two fibrogenic cytokines tnf α and tgf β were constantly high in the lung during the study they might be the biomarkers of lung damage after the inhalation of reclaimed water adaptive immune responses were also detected as elevated levels of igg and iga but not for ige inhalation of reclaimed water causes sustained fibrotic lesions in the lungs which suggests potential

growth factor β 1 introduction the urban use of reclaimed water from municipal wastewater significantly reduces the stress of water resource shortages however the risk studies related to the application of reclaimed water fail to keep up with the prevalence of reclaimed water around the world most of these efforts focused on the risk of pathogens and carcinogenic compounds in water such as enterovirus trihalomethanes thms and heavy metals debroux et al 2012 oesterholt et al 2007 hamilton et al 2006 it is mainly because the accidental ingestion was hypothesized as the major exposure route in the process of application however when reclaimed water is used for urban miscellaneous water such as that used for car washing or landscape irrigation the water is nebulized and the resulting aerosol can expose to the operators or passersby mainly through inhalation however few studies concerned the health risks generated by inhalation of reclaimed water lozano 2013 barker et al 2017 and the key risk source was identified to be carcinogenic compounds such as volatile organic compounds vocs aina and ahmab 2007 wang et al 2013 therefore because the lung and associated respiratory tract is the primary organ that contacts the exogenous contaminants the potential risk might relate to those components in water that directly or indirectly cause lung injury recently endotoxins in reclaimed water were found to induce acute lung inflammation which may result in lung damage in long term exposure zhang et al 2016 xue et al 2016 endotoxins also known as lipopolysaccharides lps are large molecules in the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria and elicit strong immune responses in mammals liebers et al 2008 the cell bound endotoxins are released to

inhalation exposure of endotoxins in mice could induce tumor necrosis factor tnf α and interleukin il 6 in the lung and cause polymorphonuclear cell dominated inflammation zhang et al 2016 xue et al 2016 the cytokine responses reached maximal levels before 1 h and the polymorphonuclear neutrophil pmn percentage in lavage peaked at 3 h after exposure all the responses fell back to the baseline level within 24 h thus the acute pulmonary inflammation is not a persistent impairment caused by reclaimed water inhalation however mild but persistent inflammation in the lung has proven to be closely related with other diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the us lee et al 2009 inflammation biomarkers such as c reactive protein crp fibrinogen and leukocyte counts wbc in individuals were found to be significantly higher in copd patients compared with those of the control group fattouh and alkady 2014 airway inflammation injuries resulting from tobacco and other environmental exposures was associated with increased risk of lung cancer hecht 2008 in addition to the direct effects of deregulated inflammation on airway epithelium remodeling chronic inflammation indirectly promotes apoptosis resistance and angiogenesis and was ultimately capable of inducing a pro tumor microenvironment raghuwanshi et al 2008 montuenga and pio 2007 these observations prompt us to further question the consequences of sub chronic exposure under an environmental exposure scenario which is more severe due to the modest but successive stimulation through inhalation previous studies have found the inflammation related profound damage caused by chronic exposure of pure lipopolysaccharide solution with a relatively high dose and more persistent effects were also observed such as pulmonary dysfunction sub epithelial fibrin deposition airflow obstruction and emphysema like changes in mouse lungs savov et al 2003 brass et al 2008 lai et al 2012 also the geometric mean of ambient air endotoxin levels was 0 3 eu m3 in the urban region of denmark madsen 2006 and the median value of air endotoxin levels in pm10 was lower than 0 3 eu m3 in a japanese study yoda et al 2017 while an air with 50 moisture from a 100 eu ml reclaimed water at 1 atm and 25 c can have 1155 eu m3 endotoxin by calculation together with the fact that lps is abundant in reclaimed water it is reasonable to assume that chronic reclaimed water exposure is more hazardous and irreversible effects were also expected this study was the first attempt to test the possible adverse effects that resulted from sub chronic inhalation exposure of reclaimed water in mice which provides important information for further risk assessment of water reuse when aerosol is generated 2 materials and methods 2 1 animals all the animals used in this study were imprinting control region icr male mice 8 9 weeks old purchased from the vital river company beijing china and kept in the center of biomedical analysis of tsinghua university the innate immune systems in adult males and females are the same and they have the same responses to endotoxins since this study aimed to identify the possible injury caused by the inhalation of reclaimed water using one gender is enough and can reduce the animal number under the ethical consideration animal maintenance and experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the institutional animal care and use committee iacuc of tsinghua university which is a branch of the beijing animal care and use committee the light dark cycle was 12 12 the mice were allowed to take food and water freely 5 mice per group were kept in one cage all experiments were reviewed and approved by the iacuc permit number 13 ly1 and all efforts were made to minimize the suffering of test animals 2 2 water samples two representative water samples the influent and effluent of the mbr process of a reclaimed water plant were collected to illustrate the high dose and low dose exposure the water samples were collected from the sampling valves in plastic buckets the volume of which are about 3 l before the sampling the buckets were pre washed by the water and then filled fully with the water sample the bucket was shipped to the lab and stored at 4 c for 5 days of exposure to sampling every 5 exposure days was based on the factors that the storage time of real reclaimed water in the regulation tank or distribution system could be several days depending on the application activities and the endotoxin activities did not change in the lab conditions for two weeks the influent water is contacted by the workers in the plant it has high endotoxin levels and was also considered as a positive control the effluent is used to irrigate a group of green areas there are hundreds of sprayers in the green areas but some regions need to be manually irrigated with pipes the exposed person is the gardener who is responsible for adjusting the sprayers and manual irrigation five water indexes were measured because the acute exposure caused severe inflammation and only macromolecules and microorganisms can trigger the immune response xue et al 2016 thus the total heterotrophic bacteria total number of microbes and endotoxin activity were measured total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were also checked to know whether the water was properly treated the total heterotrophic bacteria was determined by standard plate counting as previously described xue et al 2016 and the total number of microbes were counted by fluorescent staining 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi the toc and tn were determined by a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan the endotoxin levels were measured by the standard limulus amebocyte lysate lal assay kits according to the manufacturer s instruction xiamen houshiji ltd china the major water quality parameters can be found in the supplementary materials figure s1 2 3 inhalation exposure operation and parameter determination animals were exposed 2 h per day 5 days per week to imitate the common situation of a gardener the reclaimed water is also qualified for other urban miscellaneous water consumption according to a chinese standard gb t 18920 2002 thus the daily exposure time was relatively low if a carwash scenario was considered the exposure duration was set as 4 8 12 weeks respectively an extra 4 week recovery period was also scheduled after the 12 weeks of exposure to test the possible persistence or reversibility of the adverse effects in our previous study mice treated with di water containing disinfectant were used as the negative control and no obvious inflammation was observed compared with animals without any treatment zhang et al 2016 also ro effluent with very low endotoxin concentration 1eu ml also could not induce inflammation xue et al 2016 considering the possibility of cross contamination in one equipment unexposed mice were used as negative controls in this study three control groups without exposure were examined at 0 4 and 8 weeks there was no significant difference between these control groups figure s3 thus to save the experimental animals no more older mice were tested and 8 week untreated mice were used as the control group in the following text the inhalation was conducted using a hope med 8050 dynamic inhalation system hope ltd tianjin china briefly the water samples were pumped into a nebulizer inside an inner chamber to form aerosols with the help of carrier gas 3 m3 h the aerosols were evenly distributed in the chamber where the animals were kept for 2 h in steady humidity the flow rate of water samples was 0 7 ml min to maintain the water concentration in air around 9 mg l which was close to 50 of the relative humidity at 25 c considering that 14 of the elevated air moisture in the working area with reciprocating gantry machine calculated from 3 2 mg l of average air water content at 25 c and 1 atm wu et al 2013 and 8 h of carwash the exposure dose was similar to the environmental condition of carwash to calculate the dose the same equation used for acute exposure was applied xue et al 2016 the only difference was that the exposure duration was 120 min in this study 2 4 animal euthanasia and sample preservation according to the previous study all the acute inflammatory effects in mice caused by reclaimed water inhalation were attenuated to the background level after 18 h post exposure xue et al 2016 in this study in order to identify the sub chronic effects all the animals were sacrificed after 24 h of the final exposure 400 800 μl of blood were collected by cardiac puncture from each animal and put into anticoagulant tubes mindray medical international ltd shenzhen china bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf was collected subsequently total white blood cells wbc in blood and balf were counted immediately after the samples were ready by a hematology analyzer mindray medical international ltd shenzhen china the rest blood samples were centrifuged 6000 rpm 5min to get the plasma and stored at 80 c in the process of lavage the left lobe of the lung were tied to block the airway after the lavage the left lobe was untied and 1 ml of 4 paraformaldehyde pfa was injected into the whole lung only the left lobes were token out and fixed in 4 pfa liquid overnight for histology the lung lobes were washed by phosphate buffered saline pbs the next day and then dehydrated and embedded in paraffin 2 5 cytokines and immunoglobulin ig expression determination an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa was performed to detect the levels of cytokines and igs in balf or plasma the kits for cytokines il 4 6 10 13 ifn γ il 6 tnf α tgf β1 the catalog no are m4000b m6000b m1000b m1300cb mta00b mb100b mif00 respectively were purchased from r d systems minneapolis mn usa the kits for immunoglobulin g igg ige and iga were obtained from uscn life science inc wuhan china the catalog no are sea544mu sea545mu sea546mu respectively 2 6 immunohistochemistry the he staining and the immunohistochemical operations were performed according to the classical steps briefly paraffin sections were dewaxed by xylene followed by rehydration for he staining hematoxylin and eosin were stained sequentially for immunohistochemisty heat induced antigen retrieval was performed by boiling in 10 mm citrate buffer ph 6 0 blocking was conducted by incubating sections in 5 normal donkey serum and 5 mg ml of bovine serum albumin bsa in phosphate buffered saline with triton pbst solution for 1 h at room temperature then the sections were incubated with primary antibody 1 500 for cleaved caspase 3 from cell signaling 1 400 for α smooth muscle actin from sigma in the blocking solution at 4 c overnight after 3 washes with pbst 10 min per wash all sections were incubated with fluorescence labeled secondary antibody jackson antibody 1 500 diluted by blocking solution at room temperature for 2 h away from light after further washing sections were counterstained by 5 μg ml of 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi then mounted and sealed the image was taken by a confocal laser scanning microscope zeiss german 2 7 statistical methods the difference of cytokine ig levels and pmn proportion in balf between control and dose groups were compared by the student s t test excel and the data were shown as means sd n 3 5 3 results the aim of this study was to discover possible lung injury caused by inhalation of reclaimed water in an environmental scenario therefore inflammatory cell responses cytokines and immunohistochemistry of several specific cell markers for apoptosis and differentiation were examined in general both the low dose and high dose groups showed similar injury such as apoptosis of airway epithelial cells and signs of fibrotic lesion and the adverse responses appeared much earlier and stronger in high dose groups 3 1 inflammatory cell infiltration in a previous study it was found that acute inhalation of reclaimed water can induce strong pmn dominant inflammation in the lung and the pmn in balf is the most sensitive indicator at 3 h post exposure xue et al 2016 however this response diminishes gradually within 18 h after the sub chronic exposure we had similar observations for the low dose groups the pmn did not increase significantly after 4 weeks of exposure fig 1 a but it increased approximately 10 times at 8 weeks these results suggest that sub chronic exposure could also induce pmn dominated inflammation and although acute inflammatory response is reversible it can be accumulated at a daily exposure frequency it is also notable that the exposure dose counted by endotoxin activity was as low as 36 eu kg d which was only 20 of the acute threshold 185eu kg d in mice xue et al 2016 indicating that even the undetectable and reversible acute inflammation may increase to produce a significant effect in long term exposure at 12 weeks the pmn in lavage dropped slightly however the difference was not significant compared to that of 8 weeks and it further fell back to the background level after the recovery period fig 1a this means that reclaimed water induced inflammatory responses are reversible eventually the high dose groups had a similar trend in pmn responses fig 1b but earlier and stronger the drop at 12 weeks may be caused by immune tolerance seeley and ghosh 2017 and the exposure dose counted by endotoxin activity was 1501 eu kg d in these groups more intuitive results can be found in the histologic results in the low dose samples inducible bronchus associated lymphoid tissue ibalt hwang et al 2016 could be seen at multiple loci under the main bronchial epithelia starting from 4 weeks fig 2 b and expanded as large as hundreds of cells fig 2c but could hardly be observed at the terminal bronchioles until 12 weeks the ibalts the of recovery group were obviously dissipating fig 2e in the high dose groups a similar but more severe phenotype was observed in the distal bronchioles fig 2g 2 h which indicates that the inflammatory responses were developed down to the distal lung under high level exposure it is reasonable that the deeper airway should have less precipitation of aerosol and less adverse responses after the 4 weeks of recovery a significant number of lymphocytes remained under the main bronchi fig 2i but could not be found in the terminal airways 3 2 epithelial apoptosis and lung fibrotic lesion it is well known that long term inflammation causes tissue injury brass et al 2008 apoptosis is the most apparent observation for injury which can be recognized by the activation of caspase 3 in untreated control mice there was no obvious staining fig 3 a and a the signal was observed in the main bronchi as early as 4 weeks after low dose exposure fig 3b similar to the inflammatory responses apoptosis started in the distal bronchioles at 8 weeks fig 3c the delay of responses in terminal bronchioles reflects the different accessibilities of different airway locations in high dose groups the apoptotic signal in terminal bronchioles could be seen earlier at 4 weeks and the staining was much stronger fig 3f g h one surprising observation is that the apoptosis lasted after 4 weeks of recovery in both the low and high dose groups fig 3e e i i this suggests that pmn is not necessary to keep the continuous injury in the lung and the persistent interstitial inflammatory cells may be the cause of sustained apoptosis apoptosis of airway epithelial cells induce excessive collagen deposition in the lungs to maintain the structural integrity of the lungs in human lung biopsy specimens fragmented dna an apoptosis marker was found most frequently in regions that were immediately adjacent to α smooth muscle actin α sma positive interstitial cells interspersed within a heavy collagen deposition kuwano et al 2001 uhal et al 1998 on the other hand abundant studies of animal models support the proposition that apoptosis of alveolar or bronchiolar epithelial cells could lead to fibrogenic response and the targeted inhibition of apoptosis proved to be capable of blocking collagen deposition wang et al 2000 therefore the collagen fibrils in lungs were stained by masson dye in low dose groups the gradual exacerbation of collagen deposition along with the exposure duration was obvious especially in main bronchi fig 4 after 4 weeks of recovery the thickness of collagen under the epithelium remains pronounced fig 4e similarly moderate collagen deposition was also detected in terminal bronchioles although the phenotype was comparable among animals treated with high dose water the disparity between the two dose groups was distinguishable in terminal bronchioles the collagen layer was evidently thickened after 4 weeks of exposure compared to control groups fig 4g and worsened as the exposure duration was prolonged after the recovery period the collagen fibrous layer in both main bronchi and the terminal bronchioles were even thicker than the 12 week exposure groups fig 4i i which was consistent with the apoptosis results fig 3 the collagen precipitation further demonstrated that the lung injury persisted during the recovery period myofibroblasts are functionally distinguishable from fibroblasts for example they possess a capacity of collagen synthesis collagen i and iii and fibronectin which constitutes the major parts of matrix deposition during fibrosis zhang et al 1994 thus α sma which is an important biomarker for myofibroblasts was also examined in fig 5 much more α sma positive cells were found under the main bronchi epithelium after 4 weeks of low dose reclaimed water exposure fig 5b while in the terminal bronchioles such evidence did not emerge until 8 weeks of exposure fig 5c in the high dose groups the expression of α sma appeared earlier in terminal bronchioles fig 5f the trend was in accordance with the phenotype found in apoptosis and masson results figs 3 and 4 again after the recovery period the number of myofibroblasts showed no sign of reduction in both the low and high dose groups 3 3 cytokine profiles to determine the possible signaling pathway of fibrotic lesion that was described above seven cytokines il 4 6 10 13 tnf α interferon ifn γ and tgf β1 in balf were also detected among which only three il 6 tnf α and tgf β1 exhibited significant increases after the exposure compared to the control group il 6 and tnf α were both th 2 cytokines and they showed significantly high levels in the previous study of acute inhalation xue et al 2016 however in acute exposure both cytokine levels fell back to baseline at 7 h post exposure and the cytokine secretion peak should be earlier than 1 h post exposure in contrast all the animals in the sub chronic exposure group were sacrificed at 24 h post exposure even so the expression levels of tnf α and tgf β1 was still significantly upregulated and il 6 was also upregulated in high dose groups fig 6 the expression of il 6 was not maintained after the recovery period however the level of tnf α in balf was increased after recovery fig 6c and d it could explain the persistence of epithelial apoptosis and even the fibrotic lesion tgf β1 is not only a pro inflammatory cytokine but is also important for the formation of fibrosis that is often combined with chronic inflammation in low dose groups tgf β1 levels increased significantly after 8 weeks of exposure while in the high dose groups the expression did not vary obviously in any of the exposure groups although both increased significantly after recovery fig 6e and f these results explain the sustained collagen precipitation however the reason for the undisturbed tgf β1 level during high dose exposure is unclear 3 4 ig in plasma and balf the mucosal immune system is very active in the lungs since the lungs can be reached by many airborne microorganisms the igg ige and iga levels in both balf and plasma were measured since they are commonly functional in lung diseases klooster et al 2015 roberts et al 1973 the changing trends of igg and iga in balf are similar fig 7 a b e and f igg levels showed pronounced growth after 8 weeks of exposure and maintained high levels after recovery iga increased as early as 4 weeks and remained high until the end of recovery ige levels in balf did not change significantly regardless of the extension of exposure duration fig 7c and d this is expected because ige is mainly responsible for type i immune hypersensitivity reactions gould et al 2003 for plasma the rising trends of both igg and iga were also similar to the results in balf figure s2 whereas ige levels had a decreasing tendency and this repression was also persistent after recovery in high dose group 4 discussion in this study we imitated the weekday cycle of occupational reclaimed water inhalation exposure such as that affecting gardeners and car wash workers in a murine model thus our results are reliable as a reference of human chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd lee at al 2009 the longest inhalation duration in our study was 12 weeks and we also set a 4 week recovery period to observe the persistence of potential adverse effects increased expression of th2 cytokines and igs were accompanied with the transient wave of pmn percentage in balf epithelial cell apoptosis together with lung fibrotic lesions were the most detrimental phenotype we observed in this study which could be even more severe after 4 weeks of recovery in our previous study we demonstrated that the free endotoxins in reclaimed water are the dominant risk factor that induced pmn dominant inflammation during acute exposure xue et al 2016 in the present study the role of endotoxins in the reclaimed water was not clear because the endotoxin dose of the low dose groups was only 20 of the acute threshold derived from different types of reclaimed water xue et al 2016 however some evidence from the phenotype suggest that endotoxins are likely to be the key driver the first evidence is from the neutrophil infiltration in the acute experiment the pmn returned to the baseline level within 18 h post exposure xue et al 2016 while in this study the pmn percentages were measured 24 h after the final exposure which means even if the pmn changed after exposure but it might not be observed during the whole treatment however we still observed a significant increase of pmn in lavage at 24 h after 8 week exposure fig 1a such delay of pmn growth may reflect the accumulation of weak inflammatory response from low dose endotoxins during the chronic exposure this is the primary evidence that endotoxins in reclaimed water could cause damage as lps activated neutrophils can cause tissue injury by generating reactive oxygen species proteases and inflammation mediators savov et al 2002 and neutrophil chemotaxis was the typical response of long term lps inhalation in all the previous studies summarized in table s1 furthermore neutrophil infiltration can be recovered within 4 weeks in this study as well as other lps studies brass et al 2008 savov et al 2003 which supports the role of endotoxins in reclaimed water second the fibrotic observation in this study was also found in the chronic lps exposed lung table s1 brass et al 2008 reported upregulation of procollagen types i iii and iv after 4 week pure lps exposure in c57bl 6 mice similarly lps induced submucosal area expansion in small and medium airways was also observed which were proven to be fibrin and collagen deposits savov et al 2002 2003 brass et al 2003 these matrix proteins are mainly produced by myofibroblasts zhang et al 1994 their population also significantly expanded in the airway submucosa of both the reclaimed water exposed fig 5 and lps treated mice vernooy et al 2002 which further supports fibrogenesis another similarity is the upregulation of tgf β1 and persistent high levels of tgf β1 after recovery table s1 tgf β1 is well known for its involvement in fibrogenesis induction of collagen formation robert et al 1986 and differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts king et al 2011 it is considered as a central molecule in airway diseases as it possesses both immunomodulatory and fibrogenic activities yang et al 2012 koli et al 2008 these findings suggest that lps in the reclaimed water may be responsible for tgf β1 induction and afterward causes the fibrotic properties moreover the tgf β1 level remained high after 4 weeks of recovery in both reclaimed water treatment fig 6 and lps inhalation studies savov et al 2003 this implies that lps induced tgf β1 expression can be maintained without continuous lps stimulation it may be explained by the autocrine of some lung cells such as airway smooth muscle cells which could contribute to the irreversible fibrosis and remodeling coutts et al 2001 third apoptosis was also found in the airways and alveoli of chronic lps exposed lungs brass et al 2008 however in this study only airway epithelial cells not alveolar cells were observed with active caspase 3 staining this could be due to the low endotoxin levels in the reclaimed water all the previous chronic lps exposure experiments applied high doses of more than 10 000 eu kg d table s1 while we only used 36 eu kg d in the low dose groups and 1501 eu kg d in the high dose groups our observation also indicated that the deeper in the lung the milder the injury that was caused this is because the endotoxins preferentially precipitate in the proximal lung it is also the reason that alveolar enlargement and emphysema like syndrome were seen with heavy lps exposure by these studies brass et al 2008 vernooy et al 2002 but not in the present study since substantial lps reached alveoli when the dose was increased over 300 times the direct cause of alveolar injury is possibly the production of excessive proteinases activated neutrophils can secrete many proteinases such as elastase which can degrade almost all the proteins in the extracellular matrix as well as many key plasma proteins lee et al 2017 thus low doses of endotoxins cause inflammation mainly in the airways and generate fibrotic lesions while high doses deliver large amounts of endotoxins to the distal lung and destroy alveoli by secreting proteinases apoptosis may be induced by tnf α tnf α has various functions including stimulating immune cell accumulation proliferation and differentiation as well as oxidative stress apoptosis angiogenesis and tissue remodeling malaviya et al 2017 it is produced by macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells after endotoxin exposure ermert et al 2003 and can act locally in an autocrine or paracrine manner barbara et al 1996 when stimulated in the lungs of mice tnf α can persist for more than 70 days piguet et al 1990 therefore it is not surprising that the levels of tnf α in both low dose and high dose groups reached even higher after recovery in this study fig 6c and d this also could be the reason why apoptosis could still be observed after the 4 week recovery period fig 3e e i i although many apoptotic cells were observed the epithelial layer was morphologically normal in this study this implies that some cells proliferated to compensate for the loss of epithelial cells during the injury we stained the lungs with anti phosphohistone h3 antibody but few positive cells were observed data not shown this might be due to the slow proliferation of adult epithelial cells vernooy et al 2002 did not see obvious proliferating cells with ki 67 staining after 12 week instillation only in 1 chronic lps inhalation study significant increase of epithelial and submucosal cell proliferation were observed with 8 h brdu pretreatment brass et al 2003 which can dramatically enhance the detection sensitivity this evidence suggests that the epithelial cells did divide but very slowly to make up the cell death the proliferation of epithelial cells after injury was reported to be il 6 dependent yu et al 2002 lai et al 2012 found increased il 6 in mouse lung lavage after 8 week high dose lps inhalation we also demonstrated that il 6 levels in lavage were found to be elevated immediately after acute exposure and diminished within several hours xue et al 2016 however in this study il 6 levels were only significantly altered in 8 week treatment in high dose groups fig 6b these suggest that il 6 is a transiently expressed cytokine under high dose treatment which is also consistent with the observation of the low epithelial proliferation rate to further support the important role of endotoxins in the reclaimed water some studies found that even tap water may cause lung problems due to high levels of endotoxins if not handled properly muttari et al stated that endotoxins contaminated tap water will cause bath water fever muttari et al 1980a 1980b and they suggested a threshold dose in human as 0 002 μg kg at which the fever could be observed most people were not suffering the similar symptom after their bath which suggests that clean water inhalation should not elicit inflammatory in healthy population in 1986 endotoxin was thought to be responsible for an accident of lifeguards in a recreation center the reported symptoms included dry cough chest tightening shortness of breath and sluggishness which was described as hypersensitivity pneumonitis in the pool where accident occurred fan sprays and wall spouts were equipped as well as a water levitator to generate water column from the bottom of the pool the investigators found that although other two pools contain higher levels of endotoxin activity levels in water there were no health problems were observed among the lifeguards they thus concluded that the route of exposure in case of lifeguards was inhalation mcgregor et al 1993 this study implies that even if the water contains relative high levels of endotoxins as long as it not enter human respiratory tract the adverse health effects were avoidable although all the phenotype caused by reclaimed water exposure and literature with animal exposure suggested that the endotoxin could be the key inducer of the lung injury the estimated content of endotoxins 10 eu 1 ng in the reclaimed water was less than 0 2 of total dissolved organics which makes the presence of other risk factors or cofactors possible the examination with separated components as was done in acute exposure may be necessary xue et al 2016 furthermore the lps induced inflammation was recoverable which also makes it unlikely a direct cause of the fibrotic lesion the inflammation could be the inducer of tnf α and tgf β1 which maintain their expression levels by some positive feedback mechanisms the constant high levels of these two cytokines may be the disease drivers the innate immune responses induced by lps have been well studied but the adaptive immune responses of lps were not paid much attention none of the chronic lps exposure experiments tested ig table s1 however airway secretion of iga igg and ige plays a protective role against airborne microbes and organics and altered humoral responses have been found in most lung diseases with antigen allergen exposure or pathogen infection for instance sputum iga increased in chronic bronchitis with the presence of active chest infection stockley and burnett 1980 inflammation dependent transudation was determined to be one of the causes the total sputum iga levels correlated significantly with eosinophil counts in asthmatic patients and suggested that iga in lung secretions may be involved in eosinophil degranulation nahm and park 1997 part of this iga was allergen and bacterial antigen specific nahm et al 1998 patients with cystic fibrosis have a high prevalence of pseudomonas aeruginosa which causes chronic infection and the infection has been associated with increased total iga concentrations moss and lewiston 1980 igg is a more potent opsonin than iga smokers have relatively more igg in balf reynolds 1988 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients have an increased number of inflammatory cells with a high level of igg while iga and ige are not affected reynolds et al 1977 in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis an organic inhaled antigen is often identified as the causative agent antigen specific igg and iga are elevated in balf reynolds et al 1977 calvanico et al 1980 and precipitation of antibody antigen complex is likely to be the cause of this disease reynolds 1988 active pulmonary sarcoidosis exhibits an increased amount of igg and complement components reynolds 1978 lambre et al 1986 as well as igg secreting cells in the lung lawrence et al 1980 allergic asthma features elevated eosinophil counts and specific ige and igg to the allergen ige is a specific reactive antibody that can initiate an attack of asthma reynolds hy 1988 in this study lavage iga and igg were significantly elevated fig 7 this could be due to the increased transudation caused by inflammation however their levels remained high after the 4 week recovery period when inflammation diminished the half life of igg in mouse serum is less than 8 days vieira and rajewsky 1988 while that of iga was even shorter sigounas et al 1994 although little was known about the half life of ig in airways they should turn over faster due to the degradation enzymes secreted by inflammatory cells or bacteria niederman et al 1986 fick et al 1985 therefore the local production of antibodies from ibalt may persist during the recovery period since ibalt is usually maintained for months independent of inflammation hwang et al 2016 lps in the reclaimed water which can induce a specific antibody fick et al 1980 is one of the antigens elicited in humoral responses bacterial infection or repetitive exposure could be another possibility but no obvious bacterial colonization was observed no change of ige levels was detected in both the lavage and serum this does not mean that there were no allergens in the reclaimed water as the mice were raised in the facility and kept away from sensitization by most common allergens further studies are necessary to elucidate the possible antigens and allergens in the reclaimed water 5 conclusions our data demonstrated that successive inhalation of reclaimed water that contains relatively low doses of endotoxins 36 eu kg d was adequate to impair the lung tissue mainly revealed as lung fibrogenesis and epithelial cell apoptosis the injury could not be repaired after a 4 week recovery period compared with the previous studies endotoxins were proposed as the possible main risk factor in the reclaimed water under chronic exposure tnf α and tgf β were identified as the key molecular mediators these results suggest a potential health risk for the reclaimed water users such as gardeners and carwash workers even for the residents enjoying reclaimed water supplied to parks

19572,when reclaimed water is used as municipal miscellaneous water acute exposure of the generated aerosol with high levels of endotoxins can cause severe inflammation in the lungs however the potential risks of long term inhalation of reclaimed water remains unclear to identify the adverse effects of sub chronic reclaimed water inhalation and explain the underlying mechanisms a mouse model of 12 week sub chronic exposure was established and wastewater before a membrane bioreactor mbr positive control and the mbr effluent reclaimed water which met the quality standard of urban use and was currently used for landscape irrigation were tested in this study the exposure dose was set to approach the real working scenarios lung lavage and histology were analyzed obvious epithelial cell apoptosis in the bronchi was observed along with the accumulation of myofibroblasts and the collagen deposition both in main bronchi and terminal bronchioles all these symptoms were persistent after 4 weeks of recovery inflammation and induced bronchus associated lymphoid tissues ibalt were also observed but diminished after recovery indicating inflammation may not be the direct cause of the symptom furthermore two fibrogenic cytokines tnf α and tgf β were constantly high in the lung during the study they might be the biomarkers of lung damage after the inhalation of reclaimed water adaptive immune responses were also detected as elevated levels of igg and iga but not for ige inhalation of reclaimed water causes sustained fibrotic lesions in the lungs which suggests potential

as enterovirus trihalomethanes thms and heavy metals debroux et al 2012 oesterholt et al 2007 hamilton et al 2006 it is mainly because the accidental ingestion was hypothesized as the major exposure route in the process of application however when reclaimed water is used for urban miscellaneous water such as that used for car washing or landscape irrigation the water is nebulized and the resulting aerosol can expose to the operators or passersby mainly through inhalation however few studies concerned the health risks generated by inhalation of reclaimed water lozano 2013 barker et al 2017 and the key risk source was identified to be carcinogenic compounds such as volatile organic compounds vocs aina and ahmab 2007 wang et al 2013 therefore because the lung and associated respiratory tract is the primary organ that contacts the exogenous contaminants the potential risk might relate to those components in water that directly or indirectly cause lung injury recently endotoxins in reclaimed water were found to induce acute lung inflammation which may result in lung damage in long term exposure zhang et al 2016 xue et al 2016 endotoxins also known as lipopolysaccharides lps are large molecules in the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria and elicit strong immune responses in mammals liebers et al 2008 the cell bound endotoxins are released to the water as free endotoxins when the bacteria die or are broken the endotoxin levels in the reclaimed water ranged from 3 to 19700 eu ml and the median value was 422 eu ml huang et al 2013 acute inhalation exposure of endotoxins in mice could induce tumor necrosis factor tnf α and interleukin il 6 in the lung and cause polymorphonuclear cell dominated inflammation zhang et al 2016 xue et al 2016 the cytokine responses reached maximal levels before 1 h and the polymorphonuclear neutrophil pmn percentage in lavage peaked at 3 h after exposure all the responses fell back to the baseline level within 24 h thus the acute pulmonary inflammation is not a persistent impairment caused by reclaimed water inhalation however mild but persistent inflammation in the lung has proven to be closely related with other diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the us lee et al 2009 inflammation biomarkers such as c reactive protein crp fibrinogen and leukocyte counts wbc in individuals were found to be significantly higher in copd patients compared with those of the control group fattouh and alkady 2014 airway inflammation injuries resulting from tobacco and other environmental exposures was associated with increased risk of lung cancer hecht 2008 in addition to the direct effects of deregulated inflammation on airway epithelium remodeling chronic inflammation indirectly promotes apoptosis resistance and angiogenesis and was ultimately capable of inducing a pro tumor microenvironment raghuwanshi et al 2008 montuenga and pio 2007 these observations prompt us to further question the consequences of sub chronic exposure under an environmental exposure scenario which is more severe due to the modest but successive stimulation through inhalation previous studies have found the inflammation related profound damage caused by chronic exposure of pure lipopolysaccharide solution with a relatively high dose and more persistent effects were also observed such as pulmonary dysfunction sub epithelial fibrin deposition airflow obstruction and emphysema like changes in mouse lungs savov et al 2003 brass et al 2008 lai et al 2012 also the geometric mean of ambient air endotoxin levels was 0 3 eu m3 in the urban region of denmark madsen 2006 and the median value of air endotoxin levels in pm10 was lower than 0 3 eu m3 in a japanese study yoda et al 2017 while an air with 50 moisture from a 100 eu ml reclaimed water at 1 atm and 25 c can have 1155 eu m3 endotoxin by calculation together with the fact that lps is abundant in reclaimed water it is reasonable to assume that chronic reclaimed water exposure is more hazardous and irreversible effects were also expected this study was the first attempt to test the possible adverse effects that resulted from sub chronic inhalation exposure of reclaimed water in mice which provides important information for further risk assessment of water reuse when aerosol is generated 2 materials and methods 2 1 animals all the animals used in this study were imprinting control region icr male mice 8 9 weeks old purchased from the vital river company beijing china and kept in the center of biomedical analysis of tsinghua university the innate immune systems in adult males and females are the same and they have the same responses to endotoxins since this study aimed to identify the possible injury caused by the inhalation of reclaimed water using one gender is enough and can reduce the animal number under the ethical consideration animal maintenance and experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the institutional animal care and use committee iacuc of tsinghua university which is a branch of the beijing animal care and use committee the light dark cycle was 12 12 the mice were allowed to take food and water freely 5 mice per group were kept in one cage all experiments were reviewed and approved by the iacuc permit number 13 ly1 and all efforts were made to minimize the suffering of test animals 2 2 water samples two representative water samples the influent and effluent of the mbr process of a reclaimed water plant were collected to illustrate the high dose and low dose exposure the water samples were collected from the sampling valves in plastic buckets the volume of which are about 3 l before the sampling the buckets were pre washed by the water and then filled fully with the water sample the bucket was shipped to the lab and stored at 4 c for 5 days of exposure to sampling every 5 exposure days was based on the factors that the storage time of real reclaimed water in the regulation tank or distribution system could be several days depending on the application activities and the endotoxin activities did not change in the lab conditions for two weeks the influent water is contacted by the workers in the plant it has high endotoxin levels and was also considered as a positive control the effluent is used to irrigate a group of green areas there are hundreds of sprayers in the green areas but some regions need to be manually irrigated with pipes the exposed person is the gardener who is responsible for adjusting the sprayers and manual irrigation five water indexes were measured because the acute exposure caused severe inflammation and only macromolecules and microorganisms can trigger the immune response xue et al 2016 thus the total heterotrophic bacteria total number of microbes and endotoxin activity were measured total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn were also checked to know whether the water was properly treated the total heterotrophic bacteria was determined by standard plate counting as previously described xue et al 2016 and the total number of microbes were counted by fluorescent staining 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi the toc and tn were determined by a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu kyoto japan the endotoxin levels were measured by the standard limulus amebocyte lysate lal assay kits according to the manufacturer s instruction xiamen houshiji ltd china the major water quality parameters can be found in the supplementary materials figure s1 2 3 inhalation exposure operation and parameter determination animals were exposed 2 h per day 5 days per week to imitate the common situation of a gardener the reclaimed water is also qualified for other urban miscellaneous water consumption according to a chinese standard gb t 18920 2002 thus the daily exposure time was relatively low if a carwash scenario was considered the exposure duration was set as 4 8 12 weeks respectively an extra 4 week recovery period was also scheduled after the 12 weeks of exposure to test the possible persistence or reversibility of the adverse effects in our previous study mice treated with di water containing disinfectant were used as the negative control and no obvious inflammation was observed compared with animals without any treatment zhang et al 2016 also ro effluent with very low endotoxin concentration 1eu ml also could not induce inflammation xue et al 2016 considering the possibility of cross contamination in one equipment unexposed mice were used as negative controls in this study three control groups without exposure were examined at 0 4 and 8 weeks there was no significant difference between these control groups figure s3 thus to save the experimental animals no more older mice were tested and 8 week untreated mice were used as the control group in the following text the inhalation was conducted using a hope med 8050 dynamic inhalation system hope ltd tianjin china briefly the water samples were pumped into a nebulizer inside an inner chamber to form aerosols with the help of carrier gas 3 m3 h the aerosols were evenly distributed in the chamber where the animals were kept for 2 h in steady humidity the flow rate of water samples was 0 7 ml min to maintain the water concentration in air around 9 mg l which was close to 50 of the relative humidity at 25 c considering that 14 of the elevated air moisture in the working area with reciprocating gantry machine calculated from 3 2 mg l of average air water content at 25 c and 1 atm wu et al 2013 and 8 h of carwash the exposure dose was similar to the environmental condition of carwash to calculate the dose the same equation used for acute exposure was applied xue et al 2016 the only difference was that the exposure duration was 120 min in this study 2 4 animal euthanasia and sample preservation according to the previous study all the acute inflammatory effects in mice caused by reclaimed water inhalation were attenuated to the background level after 18 h post exposure xue et al 2016 in this study in order to identify the sub chronic effects all the animals were sacrificed after 24 h of the final exposure 400 800 μl of blood were collected by cardiac puncture from each animal and put into anticoagulant tubes mindray medical international ltd shenzhen china bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf was collected subsequently total white blood cells wbc in blood and balf were counted immediately after the samples were ready by a hematology analyzer mindray medical international ltd shenzhen china the rest blood samples were centrifuged 6000 rpm 5min to get the plasma and stored at 80 c in the process of lavage the left lobe of the lung were tied to block the airway after the lavage the left lobe was untied and 1 ml of 4 paraformaldehyde pfa was injected into the whole lung only the left lobes were token out and fixed in 4 pfa liquid overnight for histology the lung lobes were washed by phosphate buffered saline pbs the next day and then dehydrated and embedded in paraffin 2 5 cytokines and immunoglobulin ig expression determination an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa was performed to detect the levels of cytokines and igs in balf or plasma the kits for cytokines il 4 6 10 13 ifn γ il 6 tnf α tgf β1 the catalog no are m4000b m6000b m1000b m1300cb mta00b mb100b mif00 respectively were purchased from r d systems minneapolis mn usa the kits for immunoglobulin g igg ige and iga were obtained from uscn life science inc wuhan china the catalog no are sea544mu sea545mu sea546mu respectively 2 6 immunohistochemistry the he staining and the immunohistochemical operations were performed according to the classical steps briefly paraffin sections were dewaxed by xylene followed by rehydration for he staining hematoxylin and eosin were stained sequentially for immunohistochemisty heat induced antigen retrieval was performed by boiling in 10 mm citrate buffer ph 6 0 blocking was conducted by incubating sections in 5 normal donkey serum and 5 mg ml of bovine serum albumin bsa in phosphate buffered saline with triton pbst solution for 1 h at room temperature then the sections were incubated with primary antibody 1 500 for cleaved caspase 3 from cell signaling 1 400 for α smooth muscle actin from sigma in the blocking solution at 4 c overnight after 3 washes with pbst 10 min per wash all sections were incubated with fluorescence labeled secondary antibody jackson antibody 1 500 diluted by blocking solution at room temperature for 2 h away from light after further washing sections were counterstained by 5 μg ml of 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi then mounted and sealed the image was taken by a confocal laser scanning microscope zeiss german 2 7 statistical methods the difference of cytokine ig levels and pmn proportion in balf between control and dose groups were compared by the student s t test excel and the data were shown as means sd n 3 5 3 results the aim of this study was to discover possible lung injury caused by inhalation of reclaimed water in an environmental scenario therefore inflammatory cell responses cytokines and immunohistochemistry of several specific cell markers for apoptosis and differentiation were examined in general both the low dose and high dose groups showed similar injury such as apoptosis of airway epithelial cells and signs of fibrotic lesion and the adverse responses appeared much earlier and stronger in high dose groups 3 1 inflammatory cell infiltration in a previous study it was found that acute inhalation of reclaimed water can induce strong pmn dominant inflammation in the lung and the pmn in balf is the most sensitive indicator at 3 h post exposure xue et al 2016 however this response diminishes gradually within 18 h after the sub chronic exposure we had similar observations for the low dose groups the pmn did not increase significantly after 4 weeks of exposure fig 1 a but it increased approximately 10 times at 8 weeks these results suggest that sub chronic exposure could also induce pmn dominated inflammation and although acute inflammatory response is reversible it can be accumulated at a daily exposure frequency it is also notable that the exposure dose counted by endotoxin activity was as low as 36 eu kg d which was only 20 of the acute threshold 185eu kg d in mice xue et al 2016 indicating that even the undetectable and reversible acute inflammation may increase to produce a significant effect in long term exposure at 12 weeks the pmn in lavage dropped slightly however the difference was not significant compared to that of 8 weeks and it further fell back to the background level after the recovery period fig 1a this means that reclaimed water induced inflammatory responses are reversible eventually the high dose groups had a similar trend in pmn responses fig 1b but earlier and stronger the drop at 12 weeks may be caused by immune tolerance seeley and ghosh 2017 and the exposure dose counted by endotoxin activity was 1501 eu kg d in these groups more intuitive results can be found in the histologic results in the low dose samples inducible bronchus associated lymphoid tissue ibalt hwang et al 2016 could be seen at multiple loci under the main bronchial epithelia starting from 4 weeks fig 2 b and expanded as large as hundreds of cells fig 2c but could hardly be observed at the terminal bronchioles until 12 weeks the ibalts the of recovery group were obviously dissipating fig 2e in the high dose groups a similar but more severe phenotype was observed in the distal bronchioles fig 2g 2 h which indicates that the inflammatory responses were developed down to the distal lung under high level exposure it is reasonable that the deeper airway should have less precipitation of aerosol and less adverse responses after the 4 weeks of recovery a significant number of lymphocytes remained under the main bronchi fig 2i but could not be found in the terminal airways 3 2 epithelial apoptosis and lung fibrotic lesion it is well known that long term inflammation causes tissue injury brass et al 2008 apoptosis is the most apparent observation for injury which can be recognized by the activation of caspase 3 in untreated control mice there was no obvious staining fig 3 a and a the signal was observed in the main bronchi as early as 4 weeks after low dose exposure fig 3b similar to the inflammatory responses apoptosis started in the distal bronchioles at 8 weeks fig 3c the delay of responses in terminal bronchioles reflects the different accessibilities of different airway locations in high dose groups the apoptotic signal in terminal bronchioles could be seen earlier at 4 weeks and the staining was much stronger fig 3f g h one surprising observation is that the apoptosis lasted after 4 weeks of recovery in both the low and high dose groups fig 3e e i i this suggests that pmn is not necessary to keep the continuous injury in the lung and the persistent interstitial inflammatory cells may be the cause of sustained apoptosis apoptosis of airway epithelial cells induce excessive collagen deposition in the lungs to maintain the structural integrity of the lungs in human lung biopsy specimens fragmented dna an apoptosis marker was found most frequently in regions that were immediately adjacent to α smooth muscle actin α sma positive interstitial cells interspersed within a heavy collagen deposition kuwano et al 2001 uhal et al 1998 on the other hand abundant studies of animal models support the proposition that apoptosis of alveolar or bronchiolar epithelial cells could lead to fibrogenic response and the targeted inhibition of apoptosis proved to be capable of blocking collagen deposition wang et al 2000 therefore the collagen fibrils in lungs were stained by masson dye in low dose groups the gradual exacerbation of collagen deposition along with the exposure duration was obvious especially in main bronchi fig 4 after 4 weeks of recovery the thickness of collagen under the epithelium remains pronounced fig 4e similarly moderate collagen deposition was also detected in terminal bronchioles although the phenotype was comparable among animals treated with high dose water the disparity between the two dose groups was distinguishable in terminal bronchioles the collagen layer was evidently thickened after 4 weeks of exposure compared to control groups fig 4g and worsened as the exposure duration was prolonged after the recovery period the collagen fibrous layer in both main bronchi and the terminal bronchioles were even thicker than the 12 week exposure groups fig 4i i which was consistent with the apoptosis results fig 3 the collagen precipitation further demonstrated that the lung injury persisted during the recovery period myofibroblasts are functionally distinguishable from fibroblasts for example they possess a capacity of collagen synthesis collagen i and iii and fibronectin which constitutes the major parts of matrix deposition during fibrosis zhang et al 1994 thus α sma which is an important biomarker for myofibroblasts was also examined in fig 5 much more α sma positive cells were found under the main bronchi epithelium after 4 weeks of low dose reclaimed water exposure fig 5b while in the terminal bronchioles such evidence did not emerge until 8 weeks of exposure fig 5c in the high dose groups the expression of α sma appeared earlier in terminal bronchioles fig 5f the trend was in accordance with the phenotype found in apoptosis and masson results figs 3 and 4 again after the recovery period the number of myofibroblasts showed no sign of reduction in both the low and high dose groups 3 3 cytokine profiles to determine the possible signaling pathway of fibrotic lesion that was described above seven cytokines il 4 6 10 13 tnf α interferon ifn γ and tgf β1 in balf were also detected among which only three il 6 tnf α and tgf β1 exhibited significant increases after the exposure compared to the control group il 6 and tnf α were both th 2 cytokines and they showed significantly high levels in the previous study of acute inhalation xue et al 2016 however in acute exposure both cytokine levels fell back to baseline at 7 h post exposure and the cytokine secretion peak should be earlier than 1 h post exposure in contrast all the animals in the sub chronic exposure group were sacrificed at 24 h post exposure even so the expression levels of tnf α and tgf β1 was still significantly upregulated and il 6 was also upregulated in high dose groups fig 6 the expression of il 6 was not maintained after the recovery period however the level of tnf α in balf was increased after recovery fig 6c and d it could explain the persistence of epithelial apoptosis and even the fibrotic lesion tgf β1 is not only a pro inflammatory cytokine but is also important for the formation of fibrosis that is often combined with chronic inflammation in low dose groups tgf β1 levels increased significantly after 8 weeks of exposure while in the high dose groups the expression did not vary obviously in any of the exposure groups although both increased significantly after recovery fig 6e and f these results explain the sustained collagen precipitation however the reason for the undisturbed tgf β1 level during high dose exposure is unclear 3 4 ig in plasma and balf the mucosal immune system is very active in the lungs since the lungs can be reached by many airborne microorganisms the igg ige and iga levels in both balf and plasma were measured since they are commonly functional in lung diseases klooster et al 2015 roberts et al 1973 the changing trends of igg and iga in balf are similar fig 7 a b e and f igg levels showed pronounced growth after 8 weeks of exposure and maintained high levels after recovery iga increased as early as 4 weeks and remained high until the end of recovery ige levels in balf did not change significantly regardless of the extension of exposure duration fig 7c and d this is expected because ige is mainly responsible for type i immune hypersensitivity reactions gould et al 2003 for plasma the rising trends of both igg and iga were also similar to the results in balf figure s2 whereas ige levels had a decreasing tendency and this repression was also persistent after recovery in high dose group 4 discussion in this study we imitated the weekday cycle of occupational reclaimed water inhalation exposure such as that affecting gardeners and car wash workers in a murine model thus our results are reliable as a reference of human chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd lee at al 2009 the longest inhalation duration in our study was 12 weeks and we also set a 4 week recovery period to observe the persistence of potential adverse effects increased expression of th2 cytokines and igs were accompanied with the transient wave of pmn percentage in balf epithelial cell apoptosis together with lung fibrotic lesions were the most detrimental phenotype we observed in this study which could be even more severe after 4 weeks of recovery in our previous study we demonstrated that the free endotoxins in reclaimed water are the dominant risk factor that induced pmn dominant inflammation during acute exposure xue et al 2016 in the present study the role of endotoxins in the reclaimed water was not clear because the endotoxin dose of the low dose groups was only 20 of the acute threshold derived from different types of reclaimed water xue et al 2016 however some evidence from the phenotype suggest that endotoxins are likely to be the key driver the first evidence is from the neutrophil infiltration in the acute experiment the pmn returned to the baseline level within 18 h post exposure xue et al 2016 while in this study the pmn percentages were measured 24 h after the final exposure which means even if the pmn changed after exposure but it might not be observed during the whole treatment however we still observed a significant increase of pmn in lavage at 24 h after 8 week exposure fig 1a such delay of pmn growth may reflect the accumulation of weak inflammatory response from low dose endotoxins during the chronic exposure this is the primary evidence that endotoxins in reclaimed water could cause damage as lps activated neutrophils can cause tissue injury by generating reactive oxygen species proteases and inflammation mediators savov et al 2002 and neutrophil chemotaxis was the typical response of long term lps inhalation in all the previous studies summarized in table s1 furthermore neutrophil infiltration can be recovered within 4 weeks in this study as well as other lps studies brass et al 2008 savov et al 2003 which supports the role of endotoxins in reclaimed water second the fibrotic observation in this study was also found in the chronic lps exposed lung table s1 brass et al 2008 reported upregulation of procollagen types i iii and iv after 4 week pure lps exposure in c57bl 6 mice similarly lps induced submucosal area expansion in small and medium airways was also observed which were proven to be fibrin and collagen deposits savov et al 2002 2003 brass et al 2003 these matrix proteins are mainly produced by myofibroblasts zhang et al 1994 their population also significantly expanded in the airway submucosa of both the reclaimed water exposed fig 5 and lps treated mice vernooy et al 2002 which further supports fibrogenesis another similarity is the upregulation of tgf β1 and persistent high levels of tgf β1 after recovery table s1 tgf β1 is well known for its involvement in fibrogenesis induction of collagen formation robert et al 1986 and differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts king et al 2011 it is considered as a central molecule in airway diseases as it possesses both immunomodulatory and fibrogenic activities yang et al 2012 koli et al 2008 these findings suggest that lps in the reclaimed water may be responsible for tgf β1 induction and afterward causes the fibrotic properties moreover the tgf β1 level remained high after 4 weeks of recovery in both reclaimed water treatment fig 6 and lps inhalation studies savov et al 2003 this implies that lps induced tgf β1 expression can be maintained without continuous lps stimulation it may be explained by the autocrine of some lung cells such as airway smooth muscle cells which could contribute to the irreversible fibrosis and remodeling coutts et al 2001 third apoptosis was also found in the airways and alveoli of chronic lps exposed lungs brass et al 2008 however in this study only airway epithelial cells not alveolar cells were observed with active caspase 3 staining this could be due to the low endotoxin levels in the reclaimed water all the previous chronic lps exposure experiments applied high doses of more than 10 000 eu kg d table s1 while we only used 36 eu kg d in the low dose groups and 1501 eu kg d in the high dose groups our observation also indicated that the deeper in the lung the milder the injury that was caused this is because the endotoxins preferentially precipitate in the proximal lung it is also the reason that alveolar enlargement and emphysema like syndrome were seen with heavy lps exposure by these studies brass et al 2008 vernooy et al 2002 but not in the present study since substantial lps reached alveoli when the dose was increased over 300 times the direct cause of alveolar injury is possibly the production of excessive proteinases activated neutrophils can secrete many proteinases such as elastase which can degrade almost all the proteins in the extracellular matrix as well as many key plasma proteins lee et al 2017 thus low doses of endotoxins cause inflammation mainly in the airways and generate fibrotic lesions while high doses deliver large amounts of endotoxins to the distal lung and destroy alveoli by secreting proteinases apoptosis may be induced by tnf α tnf α has various functions including stimulating immune cell accumulation proliferation and differentiation as well as oxidative stress apoptosis angiogenesis and tissue remodeling malaviya et al 2017 it is produced by macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells after endotoxin exposure ermert et al 2003 and can act locally in an autocrine or paracrine manner barbara et al 1996 when stimulated in the lungs of mice tnf α can persist for more than 70 days piguet et al 1990 therefore it is not surprising that the levels of tnf α in both low dose and high dose groups reached even higher after recovery in this study fig 6c and d this also could be the reason why apoptosis could still be observed after the 4 week recovery period fig 3e e i i although many apoptotic cells were observed the epithelial layer was morphologically normal in this study this implies that some cells proliferated to compensate for the loss of epithelial cells during the injury we stained the lungs with anti phosphohistone h3 antibody but few positive cells were observed data not shown this might be due to the slow proliferation of adult epithelial cells vernooy et al 2002 did not see obvious proliferating cells with ki 67 staining after 12 week instillation only in 1 chronic lps inhalation study significant increase of epithelial and submucosal cell proliferation were observed with 8 h brdu pretreatment brass et al 2003 which can dramatically enhance the detection sensitivity this evidence suggests that the epithelial cells did divide but very slowly to make up the cell death the proliferation of epithelial cells after injury was reported to be il 6 dependent yu et al 2002 lai et al 2012 found increased il 6 in mouse lung lavage after 8 week high dose lps inhalation we also demonstrated that il 6 levels in lavage were found to be elevated immediately after acute exposure and diminished within several hours xue et al 2016 however in this study il 6 levels were only significantly altered in 8 week treatment in high dose groups fig 6b these suggest that il 6 is a transiently expressed cytokine under high dose treatment which is also consistent with the observation of the low epithelial proliferation rate to further support the important role of endotoxins in the reclaimed water some studies found that even tap water may cause lung problems due to high levels of endotoxins if not handled properly muttari et al stated that endotoxins contaminated tap water will cause bath water fever muttari et al 1980a 1980b and they suggested a threshold dose in human as 0 002 μg kg at which the fever could be observed most people were not suffering the similar symptom after their bath which suggests that clean water inhalation should not elicit inflammatory in healthy population in 1986 endotoxin was thought to be responsible for an accident of lifeguards in a recreation center the reported symptoms included dry cough chest tightening shortness of breath and sluggishness which was described as hypersensitivity pneumonitis in the pool where accident occurred fan sprays and wall spouts were equipped as well as a water levitator to generate water column from the bottom of the pool the investigators found that although other two pools contain higher levels of endotoxin activity levels in water there were no health problems were observed among the lifeguards they thus concluded that the route of exposure in case of lifeguards was inhalation mcgregor et al 1993 this study implies that even if the water contains relative high levels of endotoxins as long as it not enter human respiratory tract the adverse health effects were avoidable although all the phenotype caused by reclaimed water exposure and literature with animal exposure suggested that the endotoxin could be the key inducer of the lung injury the estimated content of endotoxins 10 eu 1 ng in the reclaimed water was less than 0 2 of total dissolved organics which makes the presence of other risk factors or cofactors possible the examination with separated components as was done in acute exposure may be necessary xue et al 2016 furthermore the lps induced inflammation was recoverable which also makes it unlikely a direct cause of the fibrotic lesion the inflammation could be the inducer of tnf α and tgf β1 which maintain their expression levels by some positive feedback mechanisms the constant high levels of these two cytokines may be the disease drivers the innate immune responses induced by lps have been well studied but the adaptive immune responses of lps were not paid much attention none of the chronic lps exposure experiments tested ig table s1 however airway secretion of iga igg and ige plays a protective role against airborne microbes and organics and altered humoral responses have been found in most lung diseases with antigen allergen exposure or pathogen infection for instance sputum iga increased in chronic bronchitis with the presence of active chest infection stockley and burnett 1980 inflammation dependent transudation was determined to be one of the causes the total sputum iga levels correlated significantly with eosinophil counts in asthmatic patients and suggested that iga in lung secretions may be involved in eosinophil degranulation nahm and park 1997 part of this iga was allergen and bacterial antigen specific nahm et al 1998 patients with cystic fibrosis have a high prevalence of pseudomonas aeruginosa which causes chronic infection and the infection has been associated with increased total iga concentrations moss and lewiston 1980 igg is a more potent opsonin than iga smokers have relatively more igg in balf reynolds 1988 idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients have an increased number of inflammatory cells with a high level of igg while iga and ige are not affected reynolds et al 1977 in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis an organic inhaled antigen is often identified as the causative agent antigen specific igg and iga are elevated in balf reynolds et al 1977 calvanico et al 1980 and precipitation of antibody antigen complex is likely to be the cause of this disease reynolds 1988 active pulmonary sarcoidosis exhibits an increased amount of igg and complement components reynolds 1978 lambre et al 1986 as well as igg secreting cells in the lung lawrence et al 1980 allergic asthma features elevated eosinophil counts and specific ige and igg to the allergen ige is a specific reactive antibody that can initiate an attack of asthma reynolds hy 1988 in this study lavage iga and igg were significantly elevated fig 7 this could be due to the increased transudation caused by inflammation however their levels remained high after the 4 week recovery period when inflammation diminished the half life of igg in mouse serum is less than 8 days vieira and rajewsky 1988 while that of iga was even shorter sigounas et al 1994 although little was known about the half life of ig in airways they should turn over faster due to the degradation enzymes secreted by inflammatory cells or bacteria niederman et al 1986 fick et al 1985 therefore the local production of antibodies from ibalt may persist during the recovery period since ibalt is usually maintained for months independent of inflammation hwang et al 2016 lps in the reclaimed water which can induce a specific antibody fick et al 1980 is one of the antigens elicited in humoral responses bacterial infection or repetitive exposure could be another possibility but no obvious bacterial colonization was observed no change of ige levels was detected in both the lavage and serum this does not mean that there were no allergens in the reclaimed water as the mice were raised in the facility and kept away from sensitization by most common allergens further studies are necessary to elucidate the possible antigens and allergens in the reclaimed water 5 conclusions our data demonstrated that successive inhalation of reclaimed water that contains relatively low doses of endotoxins 36 eu kg d was adequate to impair the lung tissue mainly revealed as lung fibrogenesis and epithelial cell apoptosis the injury could not be repaired after a 4 week recovery period compared with the previous studies endotoxins were proposed as the possible main risk factor in the reclaimed water under chronic exposure tnf α and tgf β were identified as the key molecular mediators these results suggest a potential health risk for the reclaimed water users such as gardeners and carwash workers even for the residents enjoying reclaimed water supplied to parks

conditions i e rainfall in the preceding days or weeks and the distance of each monitoring station to land were compared to the percent of samples exceeding the fda criterion for managing shellfish harvest areas sample stations beyond 1000m from land had fc densities consistently below the fda criterion and were excluded from further analysis rainfall events greater than an inch tended to result in significantly elevated fc for the following two days followed by lower levels thereafter the total amount of rain in the last three weeks was positively related to the proportion of samples with fc greater than the fda criterion bay wide the percent of samples exceeding the fda criterion rose from seven percent for rainfall less than an inch to 37 following one or more inches of rain watersheds were classified based on the percent of fc densities over the criterion when rainfall was an inch or more with 41 of 81 watersheds showing fc responses indicative of potential conditionally approved areas those shellfish growing areas where the one inch precipitation trigger may be applied these areas largely overlapped the current conditionally approved areas defined by maryland the percent of open water wetlands and poorly drained soils explained a significant amount of the variability r2 0 72 in the difference in percent of samples exceeding the fda criterion when rainfall was greater than an inch and when it was less than an inch logistic regression analysis showed that the current trigger of one inch of rain in 24 h is predictive of fc densities over the fda criterion though the appropriate threshold will most likely depend on how far the particular shellfish growing area is from land and antecedent rain conditions in watersheds with relatively high percentages of open water to total watershed size higher rainfall thresholds might be appropriate the approach taken in this study could be applied to individual stations and sub watersheds potentially allowing the reclassification of some shellfish harvest areas graphical abstract image 1 keywords fecal coliforms shellfish closures indicator bacteria water quality prediction 1 introduction fecal indicator bacteria in estuarine waters are used as indicators of fecal pollution and an increased risk of encountering human pathogens in nearby shellfish ashbolt et al 2001 fda 2015 in areas where non point sources are present or stormwater overflows occur fecal pollution in estuaries is often related to rainfall fda 2015 kelsey et al 2004 thus in the united states us under the food and drug administration fda guidance for management of shellfish harvest fda 2015 and environmental protection agency epa guidance for recreational water use epa 1986 access to these natural resources may be restricted after a specified level of precipitation for shellfish such areas are classified as conditionally approved meaning that the area being open to harvest is conditional upon some set of environmental conditions shellfish harvest in many us coastal states is prohibited from conditionally approved beds whenever a specified amount of rain has fallen in the last 24 h in maryland the classification of conditionally approved shellfish beds is based on field studies that identified conditions generally meeting the fda criteria except after large rainfall events the bulk of these studies occurred in the 1980 s the threshold for closure one inch of rain in the last 24 h was established by quantifying fecal coliform fc densities in surface waters during and after rain events in select areas of the bay in 1987 the level of fc in surface waters was measured at several times over several days following rain events kathy brohawn mde personal communication the resulting management decision was to close conditionally approved areas for three days following a rain event over and inch in 24 h although this process provided evidence of the link between rainfall and fc densities in water and the extent of time that elevated fc densities occurred it was limited in the number of samples watersheds and rain events tested therefore the amount of rain necessary to produce significant runoff may not have been thoroughly investigated nor were antecedent rainfall conditions i e rainfall that occurred in the days or weeks preceding the current rain event always taken into account additionally field studies designed to assess the impact of rain events did not quantify related factors such as land use or soil types which may affect levels of fecal pollution studies in other aquatic systems have assessed the relationship of fecal indicator bacteria such as fc in surface waters to a large number of environmental variables and in some cases have been able to develop models with moderate capability to predict fecal indicator bacteria densities epa 2010a gonzalez et al 2012 kelsey et al 2010 maimone et al 2007 mallin et al 2001 predictive models for fecal indicator bacteria in recreational waters at beaches has been of particular focus epa 2010a variables found to be predictive in previous studies included rainfall wind velocity turbidity water temperature and riverflow campos et al 2013 epa 2010a kelsey et al 2010 maimone et al 2007 mallin et al 2001 these studies primarily focused on using linear regression models ferguson et al 1996 kelsey et al 2010 maimone et al 2007 and decision trees maimone et al 2007 to provide guidance for risk of fecal bacterial densities exceeding established criteria though some use of logistic regressions has attempted to predict probability of occurrence eleria and vogel 2005 the predictive power of rainfall and or riverflow typically a function of rainfall for fecal indicator densities relates to the land based source of most fecal bacteria kelsey et al 2004 in general the ability to predict concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria in natural water bodies with low uncertainty has proved challenging epa 2010a novotny and olem 1994 for convenience the use of a rainfall threshold that is predictive of excessive fecal bacteria may serve as a tool for shellfish managers to make decisions about shellfish bed closures based on the relative risk of having fecal pollution in the growing waters an assessment of fc densities at california beaches following large storm events underscored the utility of precipitation thresholds ackerman and weisberg 2003 in this study empirical data was used to examine the relationship between fc densities and precipitation in maryland s estuarine waters the null hypotheses were that the level of precipitation necessary to result in fc densities in excess of the fda criterion is at least an inch and is uniform between various small watersheds across maryland s portion of the chesapeake bay supporting hypotheses were that the relationship between precipitation and fc levels was not influenced by the distance of the monitoring stations in each watershed to land antecedent rain conditions wind speed and air temperature as a proxy for seasonal patterns the response of fc densities to rainfall was further compared to characteristics of the watershed such as the percent of open water impervious surface and soil types logistic regressions were used to assess the amount of rainfall resulting in a significant probability of fecal densities exceeding the fda criterion for management of shellfish harvest areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 meteorological data several sources of precipitation data were considered including daily estimates from national weather service weather stations as well as estimated rainfall based on doppler radar images ultimately rainfall estimates produced by the middle atlantic river forecast center marfc called multi sensor precipitation estimates mpe http www weather gov marfc multisensor precipitation were chosen primarily due to their use by the maryland department of the environment mde to regulate closures of their conditionally approved shellfish beds and the relatively fine spatial coverage grid size is approximately 16 km2 some mpe data was excluded from our analysis on the advice of the marfc jason nolan marfc personal communication mpe data prior to 2004 was excluded based on a lower level of confidence in the estimates and data for the months january through march were excluded because the radar precipitation estimates were not as accurate for frozen precipitation and suffer from bright banding where melting snow registers as large raindrops the archived mpe data represents 24 h estimates of total precipitation in inches from 8 00pm to 8 00pm utc 5 the same time span used by mde for conditionally approved shellfish area closures antecedent rainfall amounts were calculated by summing previous rainfall amounts for each day up to a week and then by week up to a month prior to the target date wind speed and air temperature data were gathered from the global historical climatology network daily ghcn d database through the national centers for environmental information ncei www ncei noaa gov accessed 4 7 2016 mean daily air temperature and wind speed data were chosen from noaa weather stations based on their completeness of record and geographic locations air temperature data came from weather stations at the conowingo dam usc00182060 and royal oak usc00187806 while wind data came from baltimore washington national airport usw00093721 and salisbury wicomico regional airport usw00093720 temperature and wind data were averaged between stations to account for sharp changes in air temperature between consecutive days an average of the air temperature for the day of sampling and the previous day was used averaging of weather station spatially and temporally has been conducted routinely by ncei such as the monthly mean air temperatures calculated for the climate divisions of the u s www ncdc noaa gov monitoring references maps us climate divisions php 2 2 station and watershed data water quality stations monitored by the maryland department of environment mde were selected for this study based on the frequency and duration of sampling all monitoring stations in maryland s portion of the chesapeake bay sampled consistently from 2004 to 2014 were considered in order to match the time period of the precipitation data this provided data from 509 stations with an average sample count of 107 per station and a total of 54 580 observations mde typically collects data from these stations twice a month though data gaps exist due primarily to winter ice conditions and extreme weather events distance from each mde station to the closest point of land was calculated by plotting the stations in arcmap version 10 2 2 esri inc and using the distance tool and a map of the chesapeake bay waterline made by the chesapeake bay program cbp 2003 united states geological survey usgs hydrodynamic unit code 12 digit watersheds huc12 were used to compare precipitation and fc levels http water usgs gov gis huc these watersheds are the smallest of the watershed delineations included in the usgs watershed boundary dataset http nhd usgs gov wbd html and are the closest in size to the current conditionally approved shellfish harvest areas in maryland average size approximately 3 km2 mde monitoring stations were associated with the usgs huc12 watershed in which they fell esri arcmap spatial join tool these stations were located within 81 huc12 watersheds with an average of six stations per watershed mpe precipitation grids were associated with usgs huc12 watersheds in which any part of the grid fell the chesapeake bay mainstem 020600010000 eastern bay 020600020609 lower choptank river mainstem 020600050508 and the lower potomac river 020700111001 huc12 watersheds were excluded because their watersheds consisted of greater than 99 open water and they likely receive riverine and tidal inputs from larger areas than the other watersheds land use characteristics and soils data for each watershed were collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa coastal change analysis program c cap https coast noaa gov digitalcoast tools lca and the united states department of agriculture usda soil survey http websoilsurvey nrcs usda gov respectively all data sources and time periods of data collected are provided in supplementary table 1 2 3 data analysis precipitation and fc data were matched by huc12 watershed and date see supplemental fig 1 for example median daily precipitation levels were calculated for each watershed and day the us fda criterion of 49mpn 100 ml for fc was used to assess response to rainfall where mpn stands for an estimate of bacterial concentration called the most probable number fda 2015 maryland uses the three tube dilution method for estimating fc densities which involves inoculation of selective liquid culture media a1 at three different volumes of sample water 0 1 1 0 and 10 0 ml with three tubes per dilution followed by incubation in waterbaths at 44 5 c apha 1998 when using this three tube dilution method the median fc density estimate must be below 14mpn 100 ml while the calculated 90th percentile estimate must fall below 49mpn 100 ml for the area to remain open to harvest management of existing conditionally approved areas is slightly different than other areas in that the classification is based on the most recent 15 samples collected during the open status without rainfall in comparison to the 49mpn 100 ml criterion the 49mpn 100 ml criterion is used because it is more indicative of conditions resulting from a rain event such as runoff from land or stormwater overflow caused by a large rainfall fda 2015 whereas the median value is more likely to exceed the 14mpn 100 ml criterion in the absence of an event if less than 10 of samples collected when rainfall was not present are below 49mpn 100 ml the area remains classified as conditionally approved because the focus of this study was to assess responses at the watershed level the percent of samples over 49mpn 100 ml for a watershed was used instead of a station based percentile resulting in an average of 677 data points per watershed 2 3 1 frequency analysis the relationship of rain and fc was first examined by comparing the proportion of samples above the 49mpn 100 ml fda criterion with the number of days since the last daily rainfall amount over an inch the potential effect of antecedent rainfall on the levels of fc resulting from a rain event greater than an inch was tested by comparing the amount of rainfall in the previous one two three and four weeks exclusive of rainfall over the previous two days to fc levels after a daily rainfall greater than an inch based on elevated fecal coliform levels for 48 h following a rainfall over an inch see results below and the random chance of water sampling occurring after a rainfall a rainevent was considered to have occurred if there was rainfall over an inch in either of the previous two days rain2day this criterion was chosen over a cumulative amount of rain for the previous two days because it is in keeping with the current management strategy of closing conditionally approved beds after a 24hr total for rainfall in order to assess the use of rainfall as an appropriate variable for conditional closure of maryland shellfish beds the percent of fc densities over 49mpn 100 ml following a rainevent both at the bay wide scale the entire study area and by huc12 watershed were compared a set of decision points was used to classify huc12 watersheds based on these frequencies supplemental fig 2 the first decision point was whether or not there were at least three rainevents sampled for those watersheds with three or more rainevents the next decision point was whether or not the percentage of samples over 49mpn 100 ml when a rainevent had not occurred was less than 10 a threshold similar to the 10 of samples management rule used to classify shellfish growing areas fda 2015 for those watersheds with less than 10 fc exceedance of the fda criteria without rainevents those with greater than 10 exceedances after rainevents were considered responsive watersheds while those that had less than 10 exceedances after rainevents were considered not responsive to rainfall 2 3 2 comparison of frequencies to watershed characteristics for those watersheds determined to be responsive to rainfall the difference in percentage of samples over the 49mpn 100 ml criterion when a rainevent occurred versus the percentage when rainfall was less than an inch hereafter called pdiff was compared by pearson correlation tests to the percent of various land use classifications and the percentage of soil groups within each watershed classification and regression tree cart analysis was also conducted to identify the most important land use and soil type variables and corresponding thresholds that best categorize the range of pdiff values percent land use was estimated for each of the watersheds by comparing the amount of land area classified by c cap https coast noaa gov digitalcoast tools lca for each of the 21 land cover categories to the total amount of land in each usgs huc12 watershed a correlation matrix revealed strong linear relationships r 0 70 between types of developed land in the watersheds i e high intensity medium intensity etc and between cropland and pasture so these were combined into total development and total cropland percentages respectively before cart analysis the appropriate number of branches for the tree pruning was determined using cross validation k 10 and by choosing the tree that had the minimum sums of square error lemon et al 2003 the results from the frequency analysis were also used to select watersheds for inclusion in the logistic regression analysis described below 2 3 3 logistic regression analysis logistic regressions were conducted to assess the amount of rainfall rain2day leading to exceedance of the fda criterion specifically the 50 probability of a surface water sample to contain fc exceeding 49mpn 100 ml was calculated as a function of the greater amount of rainfall for the previous two days rain2day the total amount of rainfall in the previous three weeks excluding the previous two days the distance of each sample from the nearest shoreline air temperature and the average wind speed for the previous day for this analysis the fc density for each sample was converted to a binary response variable as either above or below the 49mpn 100 ml criterion an analysis of all bay wide data from within 1000m of land was first conducted models were compared using akiake s information criteria aic and the area under the receiver operating curve roc hastie et al 2009 the aic is a measure of model parsimony which is the amount of variance explained relative to the number of variables included in the model the area under the roc is a measure of correct classification of observations smaller aic and larger roc values are indicators of more parsimonious and accurate models respectively parameter estimates were assessed using bootstrapping techniques with 1000 iterations of model run kelsey et al 2010 in order to further evaluate the ability of the chosen model to correctly predict probability of exceeding the fda criteria data were binned by model predicted probability to the nearest 0 5 percent and compared to the observed frequency of occurrence for the raw data in each bin jacobs et al 2014 the predicted probability and percent occurrence values were then compared using linear regression logistic regression analyses using the same predictor variables from the selected bay wide model were then conducted for each of the watersheds that were considered to be responsive to rainfall based on the decision points used in the frequency analysis logistic regression results were reported for watersheds with significant relationships between rainfall and the proportion of samples over 49mpn 100 ml p 0 05 with a percent concordance greater than 75 and sufficient data to calculate a rainfall threshold with 95 confidence limits the logistic regression approach was further tested by application to an existing conditionally approved area as characterized by mde although many of the existing conditionally approved areas were established decades ago and included targeted sampling efforts around precipitation events and sampling stations that no longer exist sufficient data existed to test the logistic regression approach for several of them one of these is the st mary s river there were only two stations located in or beside the conditionally approved area at the head of the east branch of the st mary s river that were consistently monitored from 2004 to 2014 supplemental fig 3 one hundred fifty six samples including those from six rainevents were collected over that time span because logistic regression results may be biased by such small sample numbers the firth bias correction method firth 1993 was used to estimate model parameters 2 3 4 analysis software datasets were combined and queried using sas sas institute inc cary nc the frequency analysis was also conducted in sas logistic regressions including firth bias correction and bootstrapped parameter estimates were performed using r the r foundation for statistical computing version 3 3 1 classification and regression tree analysis cart were also conducted using r 3 results a decrease in fc levels was noted with increasing distance from land with all stations beyond 1000m having less than 10 of their samples above 49mpn 100 ml the fda criterion for restricting harvest fig 1 a distinct significant relationship between fc and rainfall was seen when comparing the number of days between a rainevent and the date of surface water sampling for samples collected within 20 days of a rainevent chisq p 0 001 fig 2 panel a greater than 30 of all samples within 1000m of land contained fc above the 49mpn 100 ml criterion when a rainevent occurred in the previous two days however this percentage decreased sharply after two days to less than 20 percent and continued to decrease until it reached a level below 10 percent after five days antecedent rainfall the total amount of rain over the previous three weeks exclusive of the last two days was also significantly and positively related to fc densities that were detected following a rainevent supplemental table 2 though the r2 values indicate antecedent rainfall explained very little of the variation in the fc data the amount of rainfall within the previous three weeks fig 2 panel b had the highest r2 value 0 16 of the time periods considered the larger percentage of violations that were found when total 3 week rainfall was 9 inches resulted from extremely high fc densities in samples collected directly after super storm sandy in 2011 wind was associated with increased proportions of samples over the fda criterion for several speeds over 10mph fig 2 panel c average air temperature for the day samples were collected and the previous day had a generally negative relationship with the proportion of samples containing fc over the fda criterion fig 2 panel d however a significant drop in the proportion of samples over the criterion occurred in the 35 f bin relative to the bins on either side of it this large discrepancy results from earlywinter samples november and december with wet and dry winters generally falling into different temperature bins 3 1 frequency analysis seven percent of water samples collected within 1000m of land contained fc exceeding the 49mpn 100 ml criterion when rainfall for each of the previous two days was less than one inch in contrast 37 of the samples nearly a six fold increase exceeded the criterion after a rainevent when analyzed at the watershed huc12 scale 41 watersheds contained less than 10 exceedances of fc over the criteria with rainfall less than an inch and greater than 10 after a rainfall over an inch these watersheds were classified as being responsive to rainfall fig 3 the difference in percent exceedance between samples above and below one inch of rainfall pdiff ranged from 3 to 68 for watersheds classified as responsive fig 4 twenty seven of the 34 conditionally approved shellfish harvest areas as designated by mde fall within these responsive watersheds supplemental table 3 five of the remaining areas classified by mde as conditionally approved were located in watersheds where there were insufficient numbers of rainevents sampled 3 to make a reasonable assessment one of the mde conditionally approved areas bolingbroke creek resides within watersheds having more than 10 of the samples above the fda criterion of 49mpn 100 ml 3 2 comparison of frequencies to watershed characteristics for each watershed the difference in the percent of samples with fc densities over the 49mpn 100 ml criterion when rainfall was less than an inch versus the percent when rainfall was greater than an inch rainevent was not significantly related to the number of rainevents the average amount of rainfall for all rainevents or the maximum rainfall amount p value 0 05 however pdiff was significantly correlated p 0 05 to just six land use and soil type characteristics table 1 the strongest relationship was a negative correlation to the percent of open water in the watershed followed by a negative relationship to the percent of unconsolidated shoreline and a positive relationship to the percent of cultivated crops unconsolidated shores are those lacking permanent vegetation and composed of sediment which is prone to inundation and redistribution by waves https coast noaa gov digitalcoast tools lca classification and regression tree analysis also showed that the percent of open water was the strongest indicator of how fc densities respond to rainfall and that a percentage of open water for a watershed above 25 8 tended to result in lower levels of fc following rainevents fig 5 for those watersheds with less than 25 8 open water the next most important variable was a significant negative relationship to the percent of palustrine forested wetland in the watershed based on the wetlands classification scheme used by noaa s c cap noaa 2016 palustrine forested wetlands are low salinity non tidal wetlands primarily consisting of woody vegetation that is at least 5m in height and total vegetation coverage greater than 20 percent the next most important variable for classification was the percentage of c d soils in the watershed these are soils that have slow to very low infiltration rates and relatively high runoff potentials supplemental table 4 altogether the percentages of open water palustrine forested wetland and c d soils account for 72 of the variability in the pdiff for samples exceeding the 49mpn 100 ml threshold relative to rainevents the average distance of the stations in each watershed to land was not correlated to pdiff suggesting that distance to land is not important in how many samples exceed the criteria but may be important in the amount of rainfall required to result in fc densities above the fda criterion 3 3 logistic regression analysis logistic regression analysis of pooled data from all responsive watersheds revealed a predictable increase in the probability of exceeding the fda criterion with increasing amounts of rainfall increasing antecedent rainfall decreasing air temperature and decreasing distance from land analysis of data from all responsive watersheds combined produced a logistic model with a concordance of 76 5 when including all of these independent variables and a concordance of 60 2 when only including recent rainfall rain2day in the model table 2 tests for variance inflation indicated that no significant collinearity existed between the predictor variables or between the predictor variables and the intercept α 0 05 p value 0 05 the value for rain2day corresponding to a 50 chance of exceeding the 49mpn 100 ml criterion under average antecedent rainfall and distance from land was between 2 and 2 2 inches for all models tested although the inclusion of air temperature lowered the aic it did not significantly increase the area under the receiver response curve therefore the model using only rainfall rain2day and 3wkrainfall distance from land and antecedent rainfall was chosen for further testing for the 50 probability threshold the percent of false negatives observations above the fda criterion predicted to be below the criterion was low 10 while the percent of false positives observations below the fda criterion predicted to be above the criterion was higher 10 however a plot of the observed proportion of samples over the 49mpn 100 ml criterion within each of the predicted probability bins fig 6 showed a significant positive relationship with some notable nonlinear scatter for bins close to 50 probability bootstrapping showed that there was relatively small error associated with the parameter estimates for this model supplemental table 5 see table 3 logistic regression analysis conducted for each of the responsive watersheds revealed statistically significant models with concordance above 75 and sufficient data to determine 95 confidence limits for 10 of the 41 watersheds table 4 the amount of rainfall rain2day corresponding to a 50 chance of exceeding the fda criterion based on average watershed values for all other significant variables ranged from 1 2 to 2 4 inches table 4 these rainfall probability threshold values had a significant positive relationship to the percentage of open water in the watershed and to highly impervious soils type d fig 7 but were not related to the time of year that the exceedances occurred p 0 05 application of the logistic approach to an existing mde conditionally approved area in the st mary s river produced superior results to the watershed scale analysis testing the probability of exceeding the 49mpn 100 ml criterion confirms the findings for this watershed and provides strong evidence for the dominant influence of rainfall on fc densities in this conditionally approved area table 5 with an odds ratio of 50 9 and no significant variable other than rain2day remaining in the model the relationship between fc densities and rainfall was highlighted 4 discussion the findings from this study underscore the importance of rainfall in effecting fc densities in estuarine surface waters and provide evidence that the effect of rainfall on these densities varies between different watersheds the amount of rainfall in the last 2 days rain2day provided a convenient and useful metric for separating watersheds based on the frequency of encountering high densities of fc and was consistently more important highest odds ratio than antecedent rainfall wind speed and air temperature in determining the probability of high fc densities these findings both confirm the importance of rainfall in surface water conditions and supports the use of rainfall as a conditional closure tool in select areas the drop in fc densities after two days post rainevent also suggests the current management strategy of closing conditionally approved areas for a defined number of days is protective from a human health risk perspective however the proportion of samples below the fda criterion did not fall below 10 for five days after a rainevent if all of the stations less than 1000m from land were part of conditionally approved areas then there would likely be some times and or places when the three day closure rule was not fully protective any establishment of a new conditionally approved area would need to assess the rate of fc dilution and decay for that particular area the frequency analysis also provided key insights into the influence of land based conditions on fc densities in shellfish harvest waters other studies didonato et al 2009 glasoe and christy 2004 mallin et al 2001 have found statistically significant relationships between impervious surfaces and or urban development on indicator bacteria densities in coastal systems these land use types may help explain the excessive number of samples over the fda criteria regardless of rain in the heavily urbanized watershed draining baltimore city and two agricultural watersheds on the eastern shore however this study found that the frequency of fc densities exceeding the fda criterion was highly variable within region and had more connection to characteristics of the water body percent open water and land margin percentages of palustrine forested wetland than to dominant upland characteristics the percent of soils with moderate to high runoff potential c d soil and the percent of cultivated crops were also significantly positively related to the frequency of exceedances pdiff but explained less variability than the percentage of open water the strong relationship to open water despite the exclusion of stations greater than 1000m from land indicates dilution of fc laden runoff in tidal systems with relatively large proportions of water to land this finding is supported by the total maximum daily load tmdl modeling efforts of mde which show that inputs of fc from land are often diluted to very low levels within several kilometers of where they are introduced mde 2006 more importantly the significant relationship to open water implies that watersheds with small water to land ratios are more prone to rainfall driven fc densities in exceedance of the fda criterion the positive correlation to percentage of c d soils in the watershed suggests that soils with decreased infiltration rates and higher runoff potential may increase runoff introduction of fc following rain events the significant negative relationship of fc to certain types of wetlands might be expected as both natural and constructed wetlands have been shown to reduce or retain fecal bacteria and pathogens green et al 1997 knox et al 2008 however others grant et al 2001 huang 2010 have detected a significant positive relationship between wetlands and numbers of indicator bacteria in estuarine waters huang 2010 hypothesizes this positive relationship results from the use of wetlands by warm blooded animals such as geese and deer one of the watersheds in this study the monie bay watershed on the lower eastern shore had high fc densities regardless of rainfall in extensive estuarine wetlands 18 estuarine emergent wetlands https coast noaa gov digitalcoast tools lca indicating that types of wetlands based on salinity levels and the kind of vegetation might be important in their relationship to fecal bacteria in adjacent waters the results of the logistic regression analysis for individual watersheds lead to several important conclusions foremost fc densities in exceedance of the fda criterion in these watersheds are strongly related to rainfall secondly the level of rainfall required to produce exceedances of the fda criterion may vary between watersheds in part this variability is related to the average distance of the sampling stations to land however the differences between odds ratios the odds that an increase in 2dayrain will result in fc concentration of 49mpn 100 ml or greater for rain2day between the watersheds suggest different degrees of influence of rainfall on fc densities in these systems the findings of this study also indicate that the level of rainfall necessary to produce fc densities exceeding the fda criteria is dependent on a handful of variables including the distance of the sample stations from land and the proportion of open water that makes up the watershed these findings agree with those from the frequency analysis with percentages of open water and soil type influencing not only the frequency of encountering high levels of fc but also the amount of rainfall needed to produce those high levels logistic models proved capable of estimating the relative importance of environmental variables on fc densities in surface waters and in estimating the level of rainfall associated with a 50 chance or greater of exceeding the fda criteria although recent rainfall and distance to land had the strongest relationship to probability of exceedance antecedent rainfall and air temperature also showed significant influence the negative relationship to air temperature may indicate a seasonal influence with higher probabilities of exceeding the fda criterion in cooler times of the year a previous study of fc data in maryland found an increase in fda exceedances late in the year october through december with a lag in time between peak precipitation and fc levels leight et al 2016 one potential reason for elevated numbers of exceedances in cool time periods is an increase in the amount of rainfall that leads directly to runoff when trees lose their leaves and ground cover has died back this phenomenon is a known factor in chesapeake bay runoff such that it is included in the chesapeake bay watershed model used by epa and relevant states to set criteria for pollution epa 2010b other possibilities include an increase in larger rain events and therefore greater soil saturation from late year tropical storms leading to increased runoff of fc bacteria a decrease in deactivation of bacterial cells by ultraviolet radiation and an increase in the presence of migratory waterfowl particularly canada geese branta canadensis by selecting those watersheds that were responsive to rainfall based on the frequency analysis the logistic regression was targeted at watersheds where exceedances related to rainfall would tip the balance towards violation of the fda criterion both the predictive capability of the logistic model seen in the observed and predicted probabilities and the odds ratios for rain2day support the importance of rainfall driven violations in the watersheds selected application of the logistic approach to a defined growing area in the st mary s river produced low percentages of false negatives and false positives a very high odds ratio and very high concordance values despite the modest number of samples included in the analysis in development of our logistic regression models one important consideration was the fc density used for assessing violations fc densities in surface waters after rain events may peak at levels well above 49mpn 100 ml increasing the fc concentration considered excessive to some value above 49mpn 100 ml would increase the concordance and lower the rate of false positives in the logistic regression however the 90th percentile criterion used here was chosen based on the existing management structure and understanding of risk for illnesses additionally picking a higher probability of exceedance would lower the percent of false positives but would increase the percent of false negatives and therefore run the risk of not being as protective of human health the co location of most areas currently classified as conditionally approved by mde with the watersheds defined in this study as being responsive to rainfall supports the classification of these areas and the general use of the conditionally approved classification the frequency analysis also suggests that fc densities in many of the watersheds in maryland s portion of the chesapeake bay are responsive to rainfall such that they do not exceed the 90th percentile over 49mpn 100 ml fda criterion without significant rain events this finding suggests that targeted sampling would likely uncover new areas suitable for being classified as conditionally approved focused analysis such as that done for st mary s river in this study may be used to target assessments for classification any conversion of restricted areas to conditionally approved would have important economic and sociopolitical ramifications for both shellfish harvesters and shellfish aquaculturists further any increases in the precipitation threshold would decrease the number of days that shellfish beds are closed employing logistic regressions such as those developed in this study could provide important information when considering such management decisions while distance to land has been shown previously to be an important driver of fc densities mde 2006 the inclusion of this variable in a regression model might provide an informative way to make decisions about conditional closure areas using empirical data results from the logistic regression analysis underscore the importance of how far the sampling location is from land with decreasing influence of rainfall on fc densities as distance to land increases by using the average conditions for distance for each watershed antecedent rainfall and wind speed the probability values calculated by logistic regression support the use of a one inch rainfall threshold models including not only measurements of rainfall in the last 24 h but also air temperature and antecedent rainfall could be used to better estimate the current probability of exceeding the threshold the principal limitation in conducting this study was the relatively modest number of samples collected soon after rain events several watersheds with areas currently classified as conditionally approved lacked sufficient rain event data to include in the analyses with increasing amounts of data as the mde monitoring program continues additional data from samples collected within 48 h of rain events should improve estimates of rainfall triggers and the appropriate areas for their application further our analysis excluded information from january through march based on the advice of the middle atlantic river forecast office which produces the rainfall product although exclusion of winter precipitation coincides with a large window of oyster harvest from natural beds in maryland earlier research leight et al 2016 showed that both precipitation amounts and fc densities in january through march tend to be lower than the rest of the year one management strategy would be to exclude any frozen precipitation as a trigger for closing conditionally approved shellfish areas another important consideration for maintaining conditionally approved areas and understanding rainfall triggers is that other shellfish collections principally clams and oysters grown by the burgeoning aquaculture industry in maryland are permitted year round this importance is underscored by the current mde strategy which uses numbers of fc from year round sampling to make management decisions about shellfish harvest closures 5 conclusions rainfall plays a dominant role in the introduction of fecal coliforms to maryland shellfish waters distance to land and antecedent rainfall correspond to the densities of fecal coliforms following rain events the response of fecal coliform densities to rainfall differs between watersheds and is related to characteristics such as the percent of open water the percent and types of wetlands and the percent of soils with moderate to high runoff potential the level of rainfall predictive of a 50 or greater chance of fecal coliforms exceeding the closure criterion is typically more than an inch but may vary by watershed conflicts of interest

19573,many coastal states of the united states restrict harvest of shellfish from select areas based on some environmental trigger such areas are classified as being conditionally approved in maryland the trigger is an inch or more of rainfall that has fallen in the last 24 h this study used 11 years of monitoring data to test the relationship between daily rainfall totals and densities of fecal indicators in maryland shellfish harvest waters precipitation and fecal coliform fc water monitoring data from 2004 to 2014 were matched by date and watershed the influence of antecedent rainfall conditions i e rainfall in the preceding days or weeks and the distance of each monitoring station to land were compared to the percent of samples exceeding the fda criterion for managing shellfish harvest areas sample stations beyond 1000m from land had fc densities consistently below the fda criterion and were excluded from further analysis rainfall events greater than an inch tended to result in significantly elevated fc for the following two days followed by lower levels thereafter the total amount of rain in the last three weeks was positively related to the proportion of samples with fc greater than the fda criterion bay wide the percent of samples exceeding the fda criterion rose from seven percent for rainfall less than an inch to 37 following one or more inches of rain watersheds were classified based on the percent of fc densities over the criterion when rainfall was an inch or more with 41 of 81 watersheds showing fc responses indicative of potential conditionally approved areas those shellfish growing areas where the one inch precipitation trigger may be applied these areas largely overlapped the current conditionally approved areas defined by maryland the percent of open water wetlands and poorly drained soils explained a significant amount of the variability r2 0 72 in the difference in percent of samples exceeding the fda criterion when rainfall was greater than an inch and when it was less than an inch logistic regression analysis showed that the current trigger of one inch of rain in 24 h is predictive of fc densities over the fda criterion though the appropriate threshold will most likely depend on how far the particular shellfish growing area is from land and antecedent rain conditions in watersheds with relatively high percentages of open water to total watershed size higher rainfall thresholds might be appropriate the approach taken in this study could be applied to individual stations and sub watersheds potentially allowing the reclassification of some shellfish harvest areas graphical abstract image 1 keywords fecal coliforms shellfish closures indicator bacteria water quality prediction 1 introduction fecal indicator bacteria in estuarine waters are used as indicators of fecal pollution and an increased risk of encountering human pathogens in nearby shellfish ashbolt et al 2001 fda 2015 in areas where non point sources are present or stormwater overflows occur fecal pollution in estuaries is often related to rainfall fda 2015 kelsey et al 2004 thus in the united states us under the food and drug administration fda guidance for management of shellfish harvest fda 2015 and environmental protection agency epa guidance for recreational water use epa 1986 access to these natural resources may be restricted after a specified level of precipitation for shellfish such areas are classified as conditionally approved meaning that the area being open to harvest is conditional upon some set of environmental conditions shellfish harvest in many us coastal states is prohibited from conditionally approved beds whenever a specified amount of rain has fallen in the last 24 h in maryland the classification of conditionally approved shellfish beds is based on field studies that identified conditions generally meeting the fda criteria except after large rainfall events the bulk of these studies occurred in the 1980 s the threshold for closure one inch of rain in the last 24 h was established by quantifying fecal coliform fc densities in surface waters during and after rain events in select areas of the bay in 1987 the level of fc in surface waters was measured at several times over several days following rain events kathy brohawn mde personal communication the resulting management decision was to close conditionally approved areas for three days following a rain event over and inch in 24 h although this process provided evidence of the link between rainfall and fc densities in water and the extent of time that elevated fc densities occurred it was limited in the number of samples watersheds and rain events tested therefore the amount of rain necessary to produce significant runoff may not have been thoroughly investigated nor were antecedent rainfall conditions i e rainfall that occurred in the days or weeks preceding the current rain event always taken into account additionally field studies designed to assess the impact of rain events did not quantify related factors such as land use or soil types which may affect levels of fecal pollution studies in other aquatic systems have assessed the relationship of fecal indicator bacteria such as fc in surface waters to a large number of environmental variables and in some cases have been able to develop models with moderate capability to predict fecal indicator bacteria densities epa 2010a gonzalez et al 2012 kelsey et al 2010 maimone et al 2007 mallin et al 2001 predictive models for fecal indicator bacteria in recreational waters at beaches has been of particular focus epa 2010a variables found to be predictive in previous studies included rainfall wind velocity turbidity water temperature and riverflow campos et al 2013 epa 2010a kelsey et al 2010 maimone et al 2007 mallin et al 2001 these studies primarily focused on using linear regression models ferguson et al 1996 kelsey et al 2010 maimone et al 2007 and decision trees maimone et al 2007 to provide guidance for risk of fecal bacterial densities exceeding established criteria though some use of logistic regressions has attempted to predict probability of occurrence eleria and vogel 2005 the predictive power of rainfall and or riverflow typically a function of rainfall for fecal indicator densities relates to the land based source of most fecal bacteria kelsey et al 2004 in general the ability to predict concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria in natural water bodies with low uncertainty has proved challenging epa 2010a novotny and olem 1994 for convenience the use of a rainfall threshold that is predictive of excessive fecal bacteria may serve as a tool for shellfish managers to make decisions about shellfish bed closures based on the relative risk of having fecal pollution in the growing waters an assessment of fc densities at california beaches following large storm events underscored the utility of precipitation thresholds ackerman and weisberg 2003 in this study empirical data was used to examine the relationship between fc densities and precipitation in maryland s estuarine waters the null hypotheses were that the level of precipitation necessary to result in fc densities in excess of the fda criterion is at least an inch and is uniform between various small watersheds across maryland s portion of the chesapeake bay supporting hypotheses were that the relationship between precipitation and fc levels was not influenced by the distance of the monitoring stations in each watershed to land antecedent rain conditions wind speed and air temperature as a proxy for seasonal patterns the response of fc densities to rainfall was further compared to characteristics of the watershed such as the percent of open water impervious surface and soil types logistic regressions were used to assess the amount of rainfall resulting in a significant probability of fecal densities exceeding the fda criterion for management of shellfish harvest areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 meteorological data several sources of precipitation data were considered including daily estimates from national weather service weather stations as well as estimated rainfall based on doppler radar images ultimately rainfall estimates produced by the middle atlantic river forecast center marfc called multi sensor precipitation estimates mpe http www weather gov marfc multisensor precipitation were chosen primarily due to their use by the maryland department of the environment mde to regulate closures of their conditionally approved shellfish beds and the relatively fine spatial coverage grid size is approximately 16 km2 some mpe data was excluded from our analysis on the advice of the marfc jason nolan marfc personal communication mpe data prior to 2004 was excluded based on a lower level of confidence in the estimates and data for the months january through march were excluded because the radar precipitation estimates were not as accurate for frozen precipitation and suffer from bright banding where melting snow registers as large raindrops the archived mpe data represents 24 h estimates of total precipitation in inches from 8 00pm to 8 00pm utc 5 the same time span used by mde for conditionally approved shellfish area closures antecedent rainfall amounts were calculated by summing previous rainfall amounts for each day up to a week and then by week up to a month prior to the target date wind speed and air temperature data were gathered from the global historical climatology network daily ghcn d database through the national centers for environmental information ncei www ncei noaa gov accessed 4 7 2016 mean daily air temperature and wind speed data were chosen from noaa weather stations based on their completeness of record and geographic locations air temperature data came from weather stations at the conowingo dam usc00182060 and royal oak usc00187806 while wind data came from baltimore washington national airport usw00093721 and salisbury wicomico regional airport usw00093720 temperature and wind data were averaged between stations to account for sharp changes in air temperature between consecutive days an average of the air temperature for the day of sampling and the previous day was used averaging of weather station spatially and temporally has been conducted routinely by ncei such as the monthly mean air temperatures calculated for the climate divisions of the u s www ncdc noaa gov monitoring references maps us climate divisions php 2 2 station and watershed data water quality stations monitored by the maryland department of environment mde were selected for this study based on the frequency and duration of sampling all monitoring stations in maryland s portion of the chesapeake bay sampled consistently from 2004 to 2014 were considered in order to match the time period of the precipitation data this provided data from 509 stations with an average sample count of 107 per station and a total of 54 580 observations mde typically collects data from these stations twice a month though data gaps exist due primarily to winter ice conditions and extreme weather events distance from each mde station to the closest point of land was calculated by plotting the stations in arcmap version 10 2 2 esri inc and using the distance tool and a map of the chesapeake bay waterline made by the chesapeake bay program cbp 2003 united states geological survey usgs hydrodynamic unit code 12 digit watersheds huc12 were used to compare precipitation and fc levels http water usgs gov gis huc these watersheds are the smallest of the watershed delineations included in the usgs watershed boundary dataset http nhd usgs gov wbd html and are the closest in size to the current conditionally approved shellfish harvest areas in maryland average size approximately 3 km2 mde monitoring stations were associated with the usgs huc12 watershed in which they fell esri arcmap spatial join tool these stations were located within 81 huc12 watersheds with an average of six stations per watershed mpe precipitation grids were associated with usgs huc12 watersheds in which any part of the grid fell the chesapeake bay mainstem 020600010000 eastern bay 020600020609 lower choptank river mainstem 020600050508 and the lower potomac river 020700111001 huc12 watersheds were excluded because their watersheds consisted of greater than 99 open water and they likely receive riverine and tidal inputs from larger areas than the other watersheds land use characteristics and soils data for each watershed were collected from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa coastal change analysis program c cap https coast noaa gov digitalcoast tools lca and the united states department of agriculture usda soil survey http websoilsurvey nrcs usda gov respectively all data sources and time periods of data collected are provided in supplementary table 1 2 3 data analysis precipitation and fc data were matched by huc12 watershed and date see supplemental fig 1 for example median daily precipitation levels were calculated for each watershed and day the us fda criterion of 49mpn 100 ml for fc was used to assess response to rainfall where mpn stands for an estimate of bacterial concentration called the most probable number fda 2015 maryland uses the three tube dilution method for estimating fc densities which involves inoculation of selective liquid culture media a1 at three different volumes of sample water 0 1 1 0 and 10 0 ml with three tubes per dilution followed by incubation in waterbaths at 44 5 c apha 1998 when using this three tube dilution method the median fc density estimate must be below 14mpn 100 ml while the calculated 90th percentile estimate must fall below 49mpn 100 ml for the area to remain open to harvest management of existing conditionally approved areas is slightly different than other areas in that the classification is based on the most recent 15 samples collected during the open status without rainfall in comparison to the 49mpn 100 ml criterion the 49mpn 100 ml criterion is used because it is more indicative of conditions resulting from a rain event such as runoff from land or stormwater overflow caused by a large rainfall fda 2015 whereas the median value is more likely to exceed the 14mpn 100 ml criterion in the absence of an event if less than 10 of samples collected when rainfall was not present are below 49mpn 100 ml the area remains classified as conditionally approved because the focus of this study was to assess responses at the watershed level the percent of samples over 49mpn 100 ml for a watershed was used instead of a station based percentile resulting in an average of 677 data points per watershed 2 3 1 frequency analysis the relationship of rain and fc was first examined by comparing the proportion of samples above the 49mpn 100 ml fda criterion with the number of days since the last daily rainfall amount over an inch the potential effect of antecedent rainfall on the levels of fc resulting from a rain event greater than an inch was tested by comparing the amount of rainfall in the previous one two three and four weeks exclusive of rainfall over the previous two days to fc levels after a daily rainfall greater than an inch based on elevated fecal coliform levels for 48 h following a rainfall over an inch see results below and the random chance of water sampling occurring after a rainfall a rainevent was considered to have occurred if there was rainfall over an inch in either of the previous two days rain2day this criterion was chosen over a cumulative amount of rain for the previous two days because it is in keeping with the current management strategy of closing conditionally approved beds after a 24hr total for rainfall in order to assess the use of rainfall as an appropriate variable for conditional closure of maryland shellfish beds the percent of fc densities over 49mpn 100 ml following a rainevent both at the bay wide scale the entire study area and by huc12 watershed were compared a set of decision points was used to classify huc12 watersheds based on these frequencies supplemental fig 2 the first decision point was whether or not there were at least three rainevents sampled for those watersheds with three or more rainevents the next decision point was whether or not the percentage of samples over 49mpn 100 ml when a rainevent had not occurred was less than 10 a threshold similar to the 10 of samples management rule used to classify shellfish growing areas fda 2015 for those watersheds with less than 10 fc exceedance of the fda criteria without rainevents those with greater than 10 exceedances after rainevents were considered responsive watersheds while those that had less than 10 exceedances after rainevents were considered not responsive to rainfall 2 3 2 comparison of frequencies to watershed characteristics for those watersheds determined to be responsive to rainfall the difference in percentage of samples over the 49mpn 100 ml criterion when a rainevent occurred versus the percentage when rainfall was less than an inch hereafter called pdiff was compared by pearson correlation tests to the percent of various land use classifications and the percentage of soil groups within each watershed classification and regression tree cart analysis was also conducted to identify the most important land use and soil type variables and corresponding thresholds that best categorize the range of pdiff values percent land use was estimated for each of the watersheds by comparing the amount of land area classified by c cap https coast noaa gov digitalcoast tools lca for each of the 21 land cover categories to the total amount of land in each usgs huc12 watershed a correlation matrix revealed strong linear relationships r 0 70 between types of developed land in the watersheds i e high intensity medium intensity etc and between cropland and pasture so these were combined into total development and total cropland percentages respectively before cart analysis the appropriate number of branches for the tree pruning was determined using cross validation k 10 and by choosing the tree that had the minimum sums of square error lemon et al 2003 the results from the frequency analysis were also used to select watersheds for inclusion in the logistic regression analysis described below 2 3 3 logistic regression analysis logistic regressions were conducted to assess the amount of rainfall rain2day leading to exceedance of the fda criterion specifically the 50 probability of a surface water sample to contain fc exceeding 49mpn 100 ml was calculated as a function of the greater amount of rainfall for the previous two days rain2day the total amount of rainfall in the previous three weeks excluding the previous two days the distance of each sample from the nearest shoreline air temperature and the average wind speed for the previous day for this analysis the fc density for each sample was converted to a binary response variable as either above or below the 49mpn 100 ml criterion an analysis of all bay wide data from within 1000m of land was first conducted models were compared using akiake s information criteria aic and the area under the receiver operating curve roc hastie et al 2009 the aic is a measure of model parsimony which is the amount of variance explained relative to the number of variables included in the model the area under the roc is a measure of correct classification of observations smaller aic and larger roc values are indicators of more parsimonious and accurate models respectively parameter estimates were assessed using bootstrapping techniques with 1000 iterations of model run kelsey et al 2010 in order to further evaluate the ability of the chosen model to correctly predict probability of exceeding the fda criteria data were binned by model predicted probability to the nearest 0 5 percent and compared to the observed frequency of occurrence for the raw data in each bin jacobs et al 2014 the predicted probability and percent occurrence values were then compared using linear regression logistic regression analyses using the same predictor variables from the selected bay wide model were then conducted for each of the watersheds that were considered to be responsive to rainfall based on the decision points used in the frequency analysis logistic regression results were reported for watersheds with significant relationships between rainfall and the proportion of samples over 49mpn 100 ml p 0 05 with a percent concordance greater than 75 and sufficient data to calculate a rainfall threshold with 95 confidence limits the logistic regression approach was further tested by application to an existing conditionally approved area as characterized by mde although many of the existing conditionally approved areas were established decades ago and included targeted sampling efforts around precipitation events and sampling stations that no longer exist sufficient data existed to test the logistic regression approach for several of them one of these is the st mary s river there were only two stations located in or beside the conditionally approved area at the head of the east branch of the st mary s river that were consistently monitored from 2004 to 2014 supplemental fig 3 one hundred fifty six samples including those from six rainevents were collected over that time span because logistic regression results may be biased by such small sample numbers the firth bias correction method firth 1993 was used to estimate model parameters 2 3 4 analysis software datasets were combined and queried using sas sas institute inc cary nc the frequency analysis was also conducted in sas logistic regressions including firth bias correction and bootstrapped parameter estimates were performed using r the r foundation for statistical computing version 3 3 1 classification and regression tree analysis cart were also conducted using r 3 results a decrease in fc levels was noted with increasing distance from land with all stations beyond 1000m having less than 10 of their samples above 49mpn 100 ml the fda criterion for restricting harvest fig 1 a distinct significant relationship between fc and rainfall was seen when comparing the number of days between a rainevent and the date of surface water sampling for samples collected within 20 days of a rainevent chisq p 0 001 fig 2 panel a greater than 30 of all samples within 1000m of land contained fc above the 49mpn 100 ml criterion when a rainevent occurred in the previous two days however this percentage decreased sharply after two days to less than 20 percent and continued to decrease until it reached a level below 10 percent after five days antecedent rainfall the total amount of rain over the previous three weeks exclusive of the last two days was also significantly and positively related to fc densities that were detected following a rainevent supplemental table 2 though the r2 values indicate antecedent rainfall explained very little of the variation in the fc data the amount of rainfall within the previous three weeks fig 2 panel b had the highest r2 value 0 16 of the time periods considered the larger percentage of violations that were found when total 3 week rainfall was 9 inches resulted from extremely high fc densities in samples collected directly after super storm sandy in 2011 wind was associated with increased proportions of samples over the fda criterion for several speeds over 10mph fig 2 panel c average air temperature for the day samples were collected and the previous day had a generally negative relationship with the proportion of samples containing fc over the fda criterion fig 2 panel d however a significant drop in the proportion of samples over the criterion occurred in the 35 f bin relative to the bins on either side of it this large discrepancy results from earlywinter samples november and december with wet and dry winters generally falling into different temperature bins 3 1 frequency analysis seven percent of water samples collected within 1000m of land contained fc exceeding the 49mpn 100 ml criterion when rainfall for each of the previous two days was less than one inch in contrast 37 of the samples nearly a six fold increase exceeded the criterion after a rainevent when analyzed at the watershed huc12 scale 41 watersheds contained less than 10 exceedances of fc over the criteria with rainfall less than an inch and greater than 10 after a rainfall over an inch these watersheds were classified as being responsive to rainfall fig 3 the difference in percent exceedance between samples above and below one inch of rainfall pdiff ranged from 3 to 68 for watersheds classified as responsive fig 4 twenty seven of the 34 conditionally approved shellfish harvest areas as designated by mde fall within these responsive watersheds supplemental table 3 five of the remaining areas classified by mde as conditionally approved were located in watersheds where there were insufficient numbers of rainevents sampled 3 to make a reasonable assessment one of the mde conditionally approved areas bolingbroke creek resides within watersheds having more than 10 of the samples above the fda criterion of 49mpn 100 ml 3 2 comparison of frequencies to watershed characteristics for each watershed the difference in the percent of samples with fc densities over the 49mpn 100 ml criterion when rainfall was less than an inch versus the percent when rainfall was greater than an inch rainevent was not significantly related to the number of rainevents the average amount of rainfall for all rainevents or the maximum rainfall amount p value 0 05 however pdiff was significantly correlated p 0 05 to just six land use and soil type characteristics table 1 the strongest relationship was a negative correlation to the percent of open water in the watershed followed by a negative relationship to the percent of unconsolidated shoreline and a positive relationship to the percent of cultivated crops unconsolidated shores are those lacking permanent vegetation and composed of sediment which is prone to inundation and redistribution by waves https coast noaa gov digitalcoast tools lca classification and regression tree analysis also showed that the percent of open water was the strongest indicator of how fc densities respond to rainfall and that a percentage of open water for a watershed above 25 8 tended to result in lower levels of fc following rainevents fig 5 for those watersheds with less than 25 8 open water the next most important variable was a significant negative relationship to the percent of palustrine forested wetland in the watershed based on the wetlands classification scheme used by noaa s c cap noaa 2016 palustrine forested wetlands are low salinity non tidal wetlands primarily consisting of woody vegetation that is at least 5m in height and total vegetation coverage greater than 20 percent the next most important variable for classification was the percentage of c d soils in the watershed these are soils that have slow to very low infiltration rates and relatively high runoff potentials supplemental table 4 altogether the percentages of open water palustrine forested wetland and c d soils account for 72 of the variability in the pdiff for samples exceeding the 49mpn 100 ml threshold relative to rainevents the average distance of the stations in each watershed to land was not correlated to pdiff suggesting that distance to land is not important in how many samples exceed the criteria but may be important in the amount of rainfall required to result in fc densities above the fda criterion 3 3 logistic regression analysis logistic regression analysis of pooled data from all responsive watersheds revealed a predictable increase in the probability of exceeding the fda criterion with increasing amounts of rainfall increasing antecedent rainfall decreasing air temperature and decreasing distance from land analysis of data from all responsive watersheds combined produced a logistic model with a concordance of 76 5 when including all of these independent variables and a concordance of 60 2 when only including recent rainfall rain2day in the model table 2 tests for variance inflation indicated that no significant collinearity existed between the predictor variables or between the predictor variables and the intercept α 0 05 p value 0 05 the value for rain2day corresponding to a 50 chance of exceeding the 49mpn 100 ml criterion under average antecedent rainfall and distance from land was between 2 and 2 2 inches for all models tested although the inclusion of air temperature lowered the aic it did not significantly increase the area under the receiver response curve therefore the model using only rainfall rain2day and 3wkrainfall distance from land and antecedent rainfall was chosen for further testing for the 50 probability threshold the percent of false negatives observations above the fda criterion predicted to be below the criterion was low 10 while the percent of false positives observations below the fda criterion predicted to be above the criterion was higher 10 however a plot of the observed proportion of samples over the 49mpn 100 ml criterion within each of the predicted probability bins fig 6 showed a significant positive relationship with some notable nonlinear scatter for bins close to 50 probability bootstrapping showed that there was relatively small error associated with the parameter estimates for this model supplemental table 5 see table 3 logistic regression analysis conducted for each of the responsive watersheds revealed statistically significant models with concordance above 75 and sufficient data to determine 95 confidence limits for 10 of the 41 watersheds table 4 the amount of rainfall rain2day corresponding to a 50 chance of exceeding the fda criterion based on average watershed values for all other significant variables ranged from 1 2 to 2 4 inches table 4 these rainfall probability threshold values had a significant positive relationship to the percentage of open water in the watershed and to highly impervious soils type d fig 7 but were not related to the time of year that the exceedances occurred p 0 05 application of the logistic approach to an existing mde conditionally approved area in the st mary s river produced superior results to the watershed scale analysis testing the probability of exceeding the 49mpn 100 ml criterion confirms the findings for this watershed and provides strong evidence for the dominant influence of rainfall on fc densities in this conditionally approved area table 5 with an odds ratio of 50 9 and no significant variable other than rain2day remaining in the model the relationship between fc densities and rainfall was highlighted 4 discussion the findings from this study underscore the importance of rainfall in effecting fc densities in estuarine surface waters and provide evidence that the effect of rainfall on these densities varies between different watersheds the amount of rainfall in the last 2 days rain2day provided a convenient and useful metric for separating watersheds based on the frequency of encountering high densities of fc and was consistently more important highest odds ratio than antecedent rainfall wind speed and air temperature in determining the probability of high fc densities these findings both confirm the importance of rainfall in surface water conditions and supports the use of rainfall as a conditional closure tool in select areas the drop in fc densities after two days post rainevent also suggests the current management strategy of closing conditionally approved areas for a defined number of days is protective from a human health risk perspective however the proportion of samples below the fda criterion did not fall below 10 for five days after a rainevent if all of the stations less than 1000m from land were part of conditionally approved areas then there would likely be some times and or places when the three day closure rule was not fully protective any establishment of a new conditionally approved area would need to assess the rate of fc dilution and decay for that particular area the frequency analysis also provided key insights into the influence of land based conditions on fc densities in shellfish harvest waters other studies didonato et al 2009 glasoe and christy 2004 mallin et al 2001 have found statistically significant relationships between impervious surfaces and or urban development on indicator bacteria densities in coastal systems these land use types may help explain the excessive number of samples over the fda criteria regardless of rain in the heavily urbanized watershed draining baltimore city and two agricultural watersheds on the eastern shore however this study found that the frequency of fc densities exceeding the fda criterion was highly variable within region and had more connection to characteristics of the water body percent open water and land margin percentages of palustrine forested wetland than to dominant upland characteristics the percent of soils with moderate to high runoff potential c d soil and the percent of cultivated crops were also significantly positively related to the frequency of exceedances pdiff but explained less variability than the percentage of open water the strong relationship to open water despite the exclusion of stations greater than 1000m from land indicates dilution of fc laden runoff in tidal systems with relatively large proportions of water to land this finding is supported by the total maximum daily load tmdl modeling efforts of mde which show that inputs of fc from land are often diluted to very low levels within several kilometers of where they are introduced mde 2006 more importantly the significant relationship to open water implies that watersheds with small water to land ratios are more prone to rainfall driven fc densities in exceedance of the fda criterion the positive correlation to percentage of c d soils in the watershed suggests that soils with decreased infiltration rates and higher runoff potential may increase runoff introduction of fc following rain events the significant negative relationship of fc to certain types of wetlands might be expected as both natural and constructed wetlands have been shown to reduce or retain fecal bacteria and pathogens green et al 1997 knox et al 2008 however others grant et al 2001 huang 2010 have detected a significant positive relationship between wetlands and numbers of indicator bacteria in estuarine waters huang 2010 hypothesizes this positive relationship results from the use of wetlands by warm blooded animals such as geese and deer one of the watersheds in this study the monie bay watershed on the lower eastern shore had high fc densities regardless of rainfall in extensive estuarine wetlands 18 estuarine emergent wetlands https coast noaa gov digitalcoast tools lca indicating that types of wetlands based on salinity levels and the kind of vegetation might be important in their relationship to fecal bacteria in adjacent waters the results of the logistic regression analysis for individual watersheds lead to several important conclusions foremost fc densities in exceedance of the fda criterion in these watersheds are strongly related to rainfall secondly the level of rainfall required to produce exceedances of the fda criterion may vary between watersheds in part this variability is related to the average distance of the sampling stations to land however the differences between odds ratios the odds that an increase in 2dayrain will result in fc concentration of 49mpn 100 ml or greater for rain2day between the watersheds suggest different degrees of influence of rainfall on fc densities in these systems the findings of this study also indicate that the level of rainfall necessary to produce fc densities exceeding the fda criteria is dependent on a handful of variables including the distance of the sample stations from land and the proportion of open water that makes up the watershed these findings agree with those from the frequency analysis with percentages of open water and soil type influencing not only the frequency of encountering high levels of fc but also the amount of rainfall needed to produce those high levels logistic models proved capable of estimating the relative importance of environmental variables on fc densities in surface waters and in estimating the level of rainfall associated with a 50 chance or greater of exceeding the fda criteria although recent rainfall and distance to land had the strongest relationship to probability of exceedance antecedent rainfall and air temperature also showed significant influence the negative relationship to air temperature may indicate a seasonal influence with higher probabilities of exceeding the fda criterion in cooler times of the year a previous study of fc data in maryland found an increase in fda exceedances late in the year october through december with a lag in time between peak precipitation and fc levels leight et al 2016 one potential reason for elevated numbers of exceedances in cool time periods is an increase in the amount of rainfall that leads directly to runoff when trees lose their leaves and ground cover has died back this phenomenon is a known factor in chesapeake bay runoff such that it is included in the chesapeake bay watershed model used by epa and relevant states to set criteria for pollution epa 2010b other possibilities include an increase in larger rain events and therefore greater soil saturation from late year tropical storms leading to increased runoff of fc bacteria a decrease in deactivation of bacterial cells by ultraviolet radiation and an increase in the presence of migratory waterfowl particularly canada geese branta canadensis by selecting those watersheds that were responsive to rainfall based on the frequency analysis the logistic regression was targeted at watersheds where exceedances related to rainfall would tip the balance towards violation of the fda criterion both the predictive capability of the logistic model seen in the observed and predicted probabilities and the odds ratios for rain2day support the importance of rainfall driven violations in the watersheds selected application of the logistic approach to a defined growing area in the st mary s river produced low percentages of false negatives and false positives a very high odds ratio and very high concordance values despite the modest number of samples included in the analysis in development of our logistic regression models one important consideration was the fc density used for assessing violations fc densities in surface waters after rain events may peak at levels well above 49mpn 100 ml increasing the fc concentration considered excessive to some value above 49mpn 100 ml would increase the concordance and lower the rate of false positives in the logistic regression however the 90th percentile criterion used here was chosen based on the existing management structure and understanding of risk for illnesses additionally picking a higher probability of exceedance would lower the percent of false positives but would increase the percent of false negatives and therefore run the risk of not being as protective of human health the co location of most areas currently classified as conditionally approved by mde with the watersheds defined in this study as being responsive to rainfall supports the classification of these areas and the general use of the conditionally approved classification the frequency analysis also suggests that fc densities in many of the watersheds in maryland s portion of the chesapeake bay are responsive to rainfall such that they do not exceed the 90th percentile over 49mpn 100 ml fda criterion without significant rain events this finding suggests that targeted sampling would likely uncover new areas suitable for being classified as conditionally approved focused analysis such as that done for st mary s river in this study may be used to target assessments for classification any conversion of restricted areas to conditionally approved would have important economic and sociopolitical ramifications for both shellfish harvesters and shellfish aquaculturists further any increases in the precipitation threshold would decrease the number of days that shellfish beds are closed employing logistic regressions such as those developed in this study could provide important information when considering such management decisions while distance to land has been shown previously to be an important driver of fc densities mde 2006 the inclusion of this variable in a regression model might provide an informative way to make decisions about conditional closure areas using empirical data results from the logistic regression analysis underscore the importance of how far the sampling location is from land with decreasing influence of rainfall on fc densities as distance to land increases by using the average conditions for distance for each watershed antecedent rainfall and wind speed the probability values calculated by logistic regression support the use of a one inch rainfall threshold models including not only measurements of rainfall in the last 24 h but also air temperature and antecedent rainfall could be used to better estimate the current probability of exceeding the threshold the principal limitation in conducting this study was the relatively modest number of samples collected soon after rain events several watersheds with areas currently classified as conditionally approved lacked sufficient rain event data to include in the analyses with increasing amounts of data as the mde monitoring program continues additional data from samples collected within 48 h of rain events should improve estimates of rainfall triggers and the appropriate areas for their application further our analysis excluded information from january through march based on the advice of the middle atlantic river forecast office which produces the rainfall product although exclusion of winter precipitation coincides with a large window of oyster harvest from natural beds in maryland earlier research leight et al 2016 showed that both precipitation amounts and fc densities in january through march tend to be lower than the rest of the year one management strategy would be to exclude any frozen precipitation as a trigger for closing conditionally approved shellfish areas another important consideration for maintaining conditionally approved areas and understanding rainfall triggers is that other shellfish collections principally clams and oysters grown by the burgeoning aquaculture industry in maryland are permitted year round this importance is underscored by the current mde strategy which uses numbers of fc from year round sampling to make management decisions about shellfish harvest closures 5 conclusions rainfall plays a dominant role in the introduction of fecal coliforms to maryland shellfish waters distance to land and antecedent rainfall correspond to the densities of fecal coliforms following rain events the response of fecal coliform densities to rainfall differs between watersheds and is related to characteristics such as the percent of open water the percent and types of wetlands and the percent of soils with moderate to high runoff potential the level of rainfall predictive of a 50 or greater chance of fecal coliforms exceeding the closure criterion is typically more than an inch but may vary by watershed conflicts of interest

19574,effective process monitoring and instability diagnosis are important for stable anaerobic digestion ad of vegetable waste vw in order to evaluate the performance of thermophilic digestion of vw to make early diagnosis for instability after organic overload and to reveal the dynamics of microbial community under different running states thermophilic ad of vw was carried out under improved organic loading rates olr of 0 5 2 5 g volatile solid vs l d in this study gaseous parameters including volumetric methane production rate vmpr ch4 co2 and h2 concentrations and liquid parameters including ph oxidation reduction potential volatile fatty acid vfa and total alkalinity ta bicarbonate alkalinity ba intermediate alkalinity ia and ammonia were monitored the coupling parameters such as the ch4 co2 vfa ba and ba ta ratios were also used to evaluate stability the dynamics of syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob acetoclastic methanogens am and hydrogenotrophic methanogens hm were analyzed by high throughput sequencing the main methanogenic bacteria were hm methanothermobacter during the start up period of olr 0 5 gvs l d while they were am methanosarcina during the stable period of olr of 1 0 gvs l d the vmpr of stable period was about 0 29 l l d with total vfa concentration below 100 mg l ch4 co2 1 3 and ba ta 0 9 the first instability due to the accumulation of vfa and self recovery due to syntrophic acetate oxidation occurred at an olr of 1 5 gvs l d the syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria probably belong to genus s1 family thermotogaceae the digestion failed at an olr of 2 0 g vs l d h2 was only detected during collapsed period instead of instable period the total ammonia nitrogen loss and bicarbonate alkalinity ba reduction were the primary causes for the instability of ad of vw without effluent recirculation compared with single parameters the ch4 co2 and ba total alkalinity ta ratios are recommended as early warning indicators for engineering applications of thermophilic ad of vw graphical abstract image 1 keywords vegetable waste thermophilic digestion process monitoring instability diagnosis syntrophic acetate oxidization 1 introduction based on the china statistical abstract 2015 760 million tons of vegetables were produced in 2014 in china vegetable waste vw is produced in large quantities in markets and vegetable producing areas thus constituting a source of decay and odor which results in the pollution of the environment when not properly treated the high water content 80 high organic content 95 dry basis and easy biodegradability of vw are suitable for anaerobic digestion ad to recover energy and produce organic fertilizer however carbohydrate rich substrates such as vw tend to accumulate volatile fatty acids vfa which can lead to acidification low ph and process inhibition several studies indicate that the anaerobic digestion of vw is only stable at low organic loading rates olr a preliminary study by knol et al 1978 showed that the olr of stable digestion of vw is 1 6 g volatile solid vs l d mata alvarez et al mataalvarez et al 1992 found that the maximum olr that could be achieved is 3 g vs l d for mesophilic single stage digestion of fruit and vegetable waste fvw these studies suggested that there might be some instability in the anaerobic digestion of vw or fvw at a high olr to increase the tolerable olr and obtain a high volumetric biogas production rate vbpr co digestion and two stage digestion are usually adopted zuo et al 2014 2015 adopted two stage digestion and recirculation of effluent to obtain a higher olr of 3 g vs l d chicken manure callaghan et al 2002 food waste lin et al 2012 yang et al 2013 fish waste abattoir wastewater and waste activated sludge bouallagui et al 2009 were used as co substrates to increase the olr and vbpr the two stage system employs a process configuration that utilizes acidogenic and methanogenic reactors allowing the optimization of both processes and avoiding vfa inhibition of methanogens bouallagui et al 2005 the promotion of co digestion is due the supply of alkalinity improving the buffering capacity and the supply of trace elements jiang et al 2012 effective monitoring and diagnosis of the ad process are great challenges during stable operation to develop effective ad reactor diagnosis and risk prediction methods li et al 2017 carried out ad of vw at organic loading rates olr of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g vs l d the process parameters including biogas production and components volatile fatty acids ammonia ph total alkalinity ta bicarbonate alkalinity ba and intermediate alkalinity ia were monitored daily the ch4 co2 and vfa ba ratios propionate n butyrate and isovalerate were selected as early warning indicators however these vw digestions were all carried out under mesophilic conditions there is no report about the thermophilic digestion of vw temperature has a direct effect on the physical chemical properties of all components in the digester and thermodynamics and kinetics of the biological processes increasing the temperature has several advantages 1 increased solubility of organic compounds which makes them more accessible to microorganisms 2 increased chemical and biological reaction rates thus accelerating the conversion process so the reactor can be smaller and can run with a shorter hydraulic retention time hrt 3 improvement of several physical chemical properties such as improved diffusivity of soluble substrate increased liquid gas transfer rate and decreased liquid viscosity which requires less energy for mixing and improved liquid solid biomass separation and 4 increased death rate of pathogenic bacteria especially under thermophilic conditions which decreases the retention time required for pathogen reduction smith et al 2005 van lier 1995 although a lot of studies of early warning indicators have been conducted the proposed early warning indicators are only effective when applied to these specific substrates and operating conditions while they are less effective in systems with different substrates and operating conditions unfortunately there is no report regarding process monitoring and instability diagnosis for thermophilic digestion of vw using continuous stirred tank reactor cstr the aims of this paper were to evaluate the performance of thermophilic digestion of vw to make early diagnosis for instability under overloaded condition and to reveal the dynamics of microbial community in this study the parameters of the gaseous and liquid phases were monitored daily microbial community dynamics were analyzed by high throughput sequencing and an instability diagnosis was carried out for thermophilic digestion of vw based on process monitoring and microbial community analysis 2 material and methods 2 1 substrates and inoculum four batches of vw were obtained from the chengdu higreen wholesale vegetable market impurities such as plastic bags were manually removed the main constituents of the vw were cabbage leaves potatoes lettuce leaves benincasa hispida and pumpkins the collected and sorted vw was chopped into particles with a size of 4 5 mm uniformly mixed and stored at 4 c the vw characteristics are listed in table 1 the inoculum was the digested residue filtered through a 1 mm sieve the digested residue was taken from an anaerobic digester fed with pig manure the inoculum was acclimated for 20 days by incrementally increasing the loading using vw as substrate until the biogas could be ignited the ph of the acclimated inoculum was 7 6 2 2 experimental setup and design the continuous experimental system consisted of three parts including the digester online gas monitoring and online liquid monitoring electronic supplementary material s1 and s2 the total volume of the reactor was 70 l to avoid pipe blockage due to the expansion of the digested material the loading volume was restricted to 55 l the ad was carried out at 55 c 2 c the contents of the reactor were mixed eight times per day at 40 rpm for 30 min the thermophilic ad of vw was carried out at gradually increased olrs of 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0

database project classifier wang et al 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 monitoring of process parameters 3 1 1 biogas production and components biogas production is the most common parameter measured it can be expressed in terms of volumetric biogas production rate vbpr or volumetric methane production rate vmpr the vbpr vmpr and biogas content are shown in fig 1 during the start up period of the first 38 days the methane concentration varied greatly and the vmpr increased during the following stable period of 25 days the vmpr was stabilized at 0 29 l l d and the methane content was maintained at 54 when the ad system was operated at an olr of 1 5 g vs l d the vmpr and methane content both began to continuously decline from day 65 to day 73 this stage was defined as first instable period surprisingly the system self recovered from day 74 without any stabilization measures such as stopping the feed or adding stabilizing agent the vmpr gradually increased and stabilized at maximum values of 0 52 l l d in later of olr of 1 5 g vs l d the methane concentration again stabilized at 54 the period between days 74 and 99 was defined as self recovery period for mesophilic digestion of vw the phenomenon of self recovery was not found at a stable olr of 1 0 g vs l d li et al 2017 the second instable period occurred at an olr of 2 0 g vs l d the methane content decreased from day 100 while the carbon dioxide content increased until the methane content was lower than the carbon dioxide content the methane concentration was below the detection limit on day 121 the biogas production ceased on day 129 hydrogen is important for the digestion process both as an intermediate and electron carrier the hydrogen metabolism involves fermentation syntrophic acetogenesis homoacetogenesis syntrophic acetate oxidization and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis iwa 2002 a high hydrogen concentration can inhibit the vfa degradation resulting in vfa accumulation thus hydrogen accumulation has been suggested to be an indicator for the serious imbalance of the process steyer et al 2002 in this study no hydrogen was detected in the biogas before day 114 however large amounts of hydrogen were detected after day 114 the period after the 114th day was defined as the collapsed stage in this period hydrogenotrophic methanogens hm stopped producing methane but fermentative bacteria fb and syntrophic acetogenesis bacteria ab were still active 3 1 2 volatile fatty acids vfas the vfas are products of acidogenesis and substrates of methanogenesis stable vfa concentrations indicate a balance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis the vfa accumulation reflects kinetic uncoupling between acid producers and consumers in this study individual vfas were monitored every day by gas chromatography fig 2 at an olr of 0 5 g vs l d the concentration of vfas showed a downward trend during the stable period the acetate and propionate concentrations were below 100 mg l and 20 mg l respectively the n butyrate isobutyrate n valerate and isovalerate concentrations were lower than the detection limit during the first instable period all vfa concentrations increased the acetate concentration began to decrease after 76 days although other vfa concentrations still increased during mesophilic digestion of vw no self reduction of acetate was observed li et al 2017 theoretically the acetate could be consumed by syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob or acetoclastic methanogens am the reason for acetate consumption will be analyzed using microbial communities the decrease of other vfa concentrations was also observed during the self recovery period during the second instable and collapsed periods actate and n butyrate increased continuously and reached a maximum value of 2499 mg l and 3313 mg l respectively compared with n valerate isovalerate was the main isomer of valerate the isovalerate mainly originated from the degradation of protein boe 2006 the vw used in this study contained 13 protein based on ts 3 1 3 ammonia alkalinity and ph the buffering ability reflects the capacity of the liquid to withstand acidification without lowering the ph alkalinity is an index of the buffering ability the ta normally includes both ba hco3 and ia vfa of an ad system the ta is mainly made up of ba in a stable ad system because the total vfa concentration is very low the ba is mainly derived from ammonia eq 1 therefore ta and tan have similar trends fig 3 a 1 nh 3 h 2 o co 2 aq nh 4 hco 3 b a the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in vw was negligible table 1 no effluent recirculation was taken in this study which resulted in the washout of ammonia therefore the tan concentration declined from 1480 mg l on day 11 to a minimum of 197 mg l the decline of tan resulted in the decrease of both ta and ba during the first and second instable periods the accumulation of vfas led to the rapid increase of ia although ta did not significantly change during these two periods the ba showed a sharp downward trend this result proved once again that the ba and ia should be specified when ta is used a monitoring parameter the use of ph as a process indicator is normally based on the fact that a ph drop corresponds to vfa accumulation a ph change does not necessarily reflect the system state because of the presence of strong buffers such as bicarbonate hco3 and ionized volatile fatty acid vfa the ba or ia are two better alternatives indicating vfa accumulation than the ph because increased vfas will directly reduce the alkalinity before causing any major ph changes however the ph is a good indicator of the process state in a low buffer system such as vw digestion with low ammonia concentration during the first and second instable periods the change of ph reflected the change of ia and ba in time this result is in agreement with that of murto murto et al 2004 when the ph decreased to 5 70 4 40 and 4 36 respectively the ba ia and ta decreased to zero this disagrees with the titration endpoint proposed by anderson and yang 1992 where the ph value of the titration end point for ta determination was 3 8 this indicates that the total alkalinity included only hco3 and vfa in the thermophilic digestion system of vw although the tan was 277 mg l at the end of the digestion all were ionized forms of ammonium nh4 because of the lower ph 3 1 4 oxidation reduction potential orp in theory the measurement of the oxidation reduction potential orp is a good tool to accurately describe variations in the intermediate product composition of an anaerobic digester previously researchers measured the orp of anaerobic digesters subjected to overloading and found a good correlation between electrode potential measurements and vfa accumulation switzenbaum et al 1990 in this study orp and ph were negatively correlated fig 3b there are four significant orp increases the first two increases occurred during the first and second instable periods respectively the increase of orp might be related to propionic acid accumulation iwa 2002 the third and fourth increases occurred during the collapsed period in addition to propionic acid accumulation the third increase may also be related to the formation of hydrogen from reduced nadide the orp value of the last rising period far exceeded the general value 400 mv of the ad system pind et al 2003 this might be due to the fact that incoming oxygen accompanied by feeding could not be consumed by facultative fb because the fb was also completely inhibited due to the extremely low ph value 3 2 syntrophic acetate oxidation to reveal the cause of the natural decline of the acetic acid concentration during the self recovery period the microbial community dynamics of am saob and hydrogenotrophic methanogens hm were analyzed methanogens in the anaerobic digester are mainly methanosarcinales and methanobacteriales dridi et al 2012 liu 2010 sakai et al 2008 methanosarcinales including the family methanosarcinaceae and methanosaetaceae are well known am methanobacteriales including methanobacteriaceae are well known hm table 3 summarizes the published saob the thermacetogenium and thermotoga genuses belong to thermophilic microorganisms in this study an unknown genus s1 was found unfortunately there is little information about genus s1 except for the taxonomy that is the genuses s1 and thermotoga both belong to the family thermotogaceae however genus s1 is probably saob the dynamic changes of am saob and hm are shown in fig 4 methanothermobacter and methanosarcina are the main methanogens of the start up and stable periods respectively this illustrates that the most important methanogenic bacteria in inoculum are hm the am gradually evolved into major methanogens with the daily feed of vw during the first instable period the relative abundance of am methanosarcina declined while the relative abundance of saob thermotogaceae s1 increased it can be concluded that the consumption of acetic acid during the self recovery period is due to syntrophic acetate oxidizing instead of acetoclastic methanogenesis the self reduction of acetate concentration due to the syntrophic acetate oxidizing was not found during mesophilic digestion of vw in previous study of the author li et al 2017 however it was observed during thermophilic digestion of vw in this study the degradation of vfa became more energetic at a higher temperature which is favorable to avoid vfa inhibition on methanogens de bok et al 2004 under standard temperatures 25 c the acetate consumption by aceticlastic methanogenesis eq 2 is also more favorable than syntrophic acetate oxidation into hydrogen and carbon dioxide eq 3 at higher temperatures 55 c the syntrophic acetate oxidation pathway becomes more favorable sasaki et al 2011 revealed that approximately 80 of acetate was decomposed via syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled with a hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis eq 4 pathway whereas the remainder was converted to methane via an am pathway furthermore the degradation of acetate will promote syntrophic propionate n butyrate isobutyrate n valerate isovalerate oxidation eqs 5 9 2 ch 3 cooh ch 4 co 2 δg 0 31 kj mol 3 ch 3 cooh 2 h 2 o 2 co 2 4 h 2 δg 0 104 kj mol 4 co 2 4 h 2 ch 4 2 h 2 o δg 0 135 kj mol 5 ch 3 ch 2 cooh 2

indicators for thermophilic ad of vw the coupling parameters such as the ch4 co2 vfa ba vfa ta ia ba and ba ta ratios were used as potential indicators of the process imbalance in this study fig 5 illustrates the change curves of the coupling indicators the sudden changes of ia ba vfa ba and vfa ta were later than that of ch4 co2 and ba ta during second instable period the slopes of ia ba vfa ba and vfa ta were lower than that of ch4 co2 and ba ta during first instable period in this study the biogas production ceased on day 129 the warning time is defined as the day on which the biogas production ceased minus the day of sudden change during the second instable period the day of sudden change and corresponding changes are listed in table 4 for all process parameters table 4 shows that the vmpr acetate and isovalerate concentration and ia ch4 co2 and ba ta values can be used as early warning indicators for thermophilic ad of vw in general an online biogas flowmeter and component ch4 co2 h2s and o2 analyzer were installed in the biogas plant when the ad system was acidified the ch4 content decreased while the co2 content increased the ch4 co2 ratio had a greater response value due to the superposition effect the technology for individual vfa online monitoring is still not mature biogas projects generally do not include gas chromatography due to the high cost the automatic potentiometric titration instrument is usually set up in the field laboratory of biogas plants the ta ba and ia can be rapidly determined using an automatic titration apparatus by setting different titration endpoint ph values although the warning time of ia was also 29 day the normalized value of ba ta could resist the impact of the determination error vmpr is an important parameter as it indicates the overall performance of the process however it cannot be used to indicate process imbalance since changes in the vmpr depends on olr and feed composition for example there was a larger difference in vmpr between olr 0 5 and 1 0 g vs l d however the values of ba ta between olr 0 5 and 1 0 g vs l d was very closed accordingly the ch4 co2 and ba ta ratios are recommended as early warning indicators for the engineering application of thermophilic ad of vw the instability thresholds of ch4 co2 and ba ta are 1 2 and 0 8 respectively the severe instability thresholds of ch4 co2 and ba ta are 1 0 and 0 4 respectively 3 4 instability diagnosis fig 6 illustrates the instability diagnosis for thermophilic ad of vw during the stable period the feed way without effluent recirculation led to total ammonia loss although there was a balance between fa ab and am hm the loss of ammonia resulted in ba and ta reduction when the olr increased to 1 5 g vs l d the increase of fermentative substrates resulted in an increase of vfas the rise of vfas reduced the ba and ph values at the lower ba level the increase of vfas and decline of ph rapidly increased the concentration of free vfas the high concentration of free vfas caused the inhibition of am fortunately at higher temperatures 55 c the syntrophic acetate oxidation pathway became more favorable the saob appeared and its abundance gradually increased the saob oxidized acetate into hydrogen and carbon dioxide which were used by hm to produce methane subsequently the propionate butyrate and valerate were also degraded to acetate via the syntrophic oxidation pathway the consumption of vfas removed the inhibition of am the balance between fb ab and saob am hm was re established when the olr further increased to 2 0 g vs l d the increase of vfas caused the decline of ba and ph which resulted in the inhibition of saob am and hm the ba decreased to zero on day 114 at ph 5 7 while the ia increased to the maximum of 1780 mg l during the collapsed period the continued accumulation of acetate and n butyrate resulted in a sharp decline of the ph because there was no ba the lower ph below 5 7 shifted the ionized vfa to free vfa vfa until all vfas were in a free state at ph 4 4 at this point the methane production stopped because the saob am and hm were inhibited completely by the higher free vfa vfa it is worth mentioning that hydrogen was detected in biogas during the collapsed period because the tolerance of fb and ab to free vfa vfa was stronger than that of methanogens when the ph decreased to 4 46 and below the fb and ab were also completely inhibited to enhance the capacity of the liquid to withstand acidification without lowering the ph the ba concentration of the ad system should be increased for the engineering application of ad of vw the ba concentration could be maintained at a higher level by recovering or supplying alkalinity by effluent recirculation and nh4hco3 addition respectively for example the effluent recirculation should be adopted during whole process the nh4hco3 reagent could be added when the values of ch4 co2 and ba ta are 1 2 and 0 8 respectively 4 conclusions the vmpr of 0 29 l l d was obtained at stable period of olr 1 0 gvs l d with total vfa concentration below 100 mg l ch4 co2 1 3 and ba ta 0 9 the first instability due to the accumulation of vfa and self recovery due to syntrophic acetate oxidation occurred at an olr of 1 5 gvs l d the digestion failed at an olr of 2 0 g vs l d compared with mesophilic digestion thermophilic digestion

19574,effective process monitoring and instability diagnosis are important for stable anaerobic digestion ad of vegetable waste vw in order to evaluate the performance of thermophilic digestion of vw to make early diagnosis for instability after organic overload and to reveal the dynamics of microbial community under different running states thermophilic ad of vw was carried out under improved organic loading rates olr of 0 5 2 5 g volatile solid vs l d in this study gaseous parameters including volumetric methane production rate vmpr ch4 co2 and h2 concentrations and liquid parameters including ph oxidation reduction potential volatile fatty acid vfa and total alkalinity ta bicarbonate alkalinity ba intermediate alkalinity ia and ammonia were monitored the coupling parameters such as the ch4 co2 vfa ba and ba ta ratios were also used to evaluate stability the dynamics of syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob acetoclastic methanogens am and hydrogenotrophic methanogens hm were analyzed by high throughput sequencing the main methanogenic bacteria were hm methanothermobacter during the start up period of olr 0 5 gvs l d while they were am methanosarcina during the stable period of olr of 1 0 gvs l d the vmpr of stable period was about 0 29 l l d with total vfa concentration below 100 mg l ch4 co2 1 3 and ba ta 0 9 the first instability due to the accumulation of vfa and self recovery due to syntrophic acetate oxidation occurred at an olr of 1 5 gvs l d the syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria probably belong to genus s1 family thermotogaceae the digestion failed at an olr of 2 0 g vs l d h2 was only detected during collapsed period instead of instable period the total ammonia nitrogen loss and bicarbonate alkalinity ba reduction were the primary causes for the instability of ad of vw without effluent recirculation compared with single parameters the ch4 co2 and ba total alkalinity ta ratios are recommended as early warning indicators for engineering applications of thermophilic ad of vw graphical abstract image 1 keywords vegetable waste thermophilic digestion process monitoring instability diagnosis syntrophic acetate oxidization 1 introduction based on the china statistical abstract 2015 760 million tons of vegetables were produced in 2014 in china vegetable waste vw is produced in large quantities in markets and vegetable producing areas thus constituting a source of decay and odor which results in the pollution of the environment when not properly treated the high water content 80 high organic content 95 dry basis and easy biodegradability of vw are suitable for anaerobic digestion ad to recover energy and produce organic fertilizer however carbohydrate rich substrates such as vw tend to accumulate volatile fatty acids vfa which can lead to acidification low ph and process inhibition several studies indicate that the anaerobic digestion of vw is only stable at low organic loading rates olr a preliminary study by knol et al 1978 showed that the olr of stable digestion of vw is 1 6 g volatile solid vs l d mata alvarez et al mataalvarez et al 1992 found that the maximum olr that could be achieved is 3 g vs l d for mesophilic single stage digestion of fruit and vegetable waste fvw these studies suggested that there might be some instability in the anaerobic digestion of vw or fvw at a high olr to increase the tolerable olr and obtain a high volumetric biogas production rate vbpr co digestion and two stage digestion are usually adopted zuo et al 2014 2015 adopted two stage digestion and recirculation of effluent to obtain a higher olr of 3 g vs l d chicken manure callaghan et al 2002 food waste lin et al 2012 yang et al 2013 fish waste abattoir wastewater and waste activated sludge bouallagui et al 2009 were used as co substrates to increase the olr and vbpr the two stage system employs a process configuration that utilizes acidogenic and methanogenic reactors allowing the optimization of both processes and avoiding vfa inhibition of methanogens bouallagui et al 2005 the promotion of co digestion is due the supply of alkalinity improving the buffering capacity and the supply of trace elements jiang et al 2012 effective monitoring and diagnosis of the ad process are great challenges during stable operation to develop effective ad reactor diagnosis and risk prediction methods li et al 2017 carried out ad of vw at organic loading rates olr of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g vs l d the process parameters including biogas production and components volatile fatty acids ammonia ph total alkalinity ta bicarbonate alkalinity ba and intermediate alkalinity ia were monitored daily the ch4 co2 and vfa ba ratios propionate n butyrate and isovalerate were selected as early warning indicators however these vw digestions were all carried out under mesophilic conditions there is no report about the thermophilic digestion of vw temperature has a direct effect on the physical chemical properties of all components in the digester and thermodynamics and kinetics of the biological processes increasing the temperature has several advantages 1 increased solubility of organic compounds which makes them more accessible to microorganisms 2 increased chemical and biological reaction rates thus accelerating the conversion process so the reactor can be smaller and can run with a shorter hydraulic retention time hrt 3 improvement of several physical chemical properties such as improved diffusivity of soluble substrate increased liquid gas transfer rate and decreased liquid viscosity which requires less energy for mixing and improved liquid solid biomass separation and 4 increased death rate of pathogenic bacteria especially under thermophilic conditions which decreases the retention time required for pathogen reduction smith et al 2005 van lier 1995 although a lot of studies of early warning indicators have been conducted the proposed early warning indicators are only effective when applied to these specific substrates and operating conditions while they are less effective in systems with different substrates and operating conditions unfortunately there is no report regarding process monitoring and instability diagnosis for thermophilic digestion of vw using continuous stirred tank reactor cstr the aims of this paper were to evaluate the performance of thermophilic digestion of vw to make early diagnosis for instability under overloaded condition and to reveal the dynamics of microbial community in this study the parameters of the gaseous and liquid phases were monitored daily microbial community dynamics were analyzed by high throughput sequencing and an instability diagnosis was carried out for thermophilic digestion of vw based on process monitoring and microbial community analysis 2 material and methods 2 1 substrates and inoculum four batches of vw were obtained from the chengdu higreen wholesale vegetable market impurities such as plastic bags were manually removed the main constituents of the vw were cabbage leaves potatoes lettuce leaves benincasa hispida and pumpkins the collected and sorted vw was chopped into particles with a size of 4 5 mm uniformly mixed and stored at 4 c the vw characteristics are listed in table 1 the inoculum was the digested residue filtered through a 1 mm sieve the digested residue was taken from an anaerobic digester fed with pig manure the inoculum was acclimated for 20 days by incrementally increasing the loading using vw as substrate until the biogas could be ignited the ph of the acclimated inoculum was 7 6 2 2 experimental setup and design the continuous experimental system consisted of three parts including the digester online gas monitoring and online liquid monitoring electronic supplementary material s1 and s2 the total volume of the reactor was 70 l to avoid pipe blockage due to the expansion of the digested material the loading volume was restricted to 55 l the ad was carried out at 55 c 2 c the contents of the reactor were mixed eight times per day at 40 rpm for 30 min the thermophilic ad of vw was carried out at gradually increased olrs of 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0

database project classifier wang et al 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 monitoring of process parameters 3 1 1 biogas production and components biogas production is the most common parameter measured it can be expressed in terms of volumetric biogas production rate vbpr or volumetric methane production rate vmpr the vbpr vmpr and biogas content are shown in fig 1 during the start up period of the first 38 days the methane concentration varied greatly and the vmpr increased during the following stable period of 25 days the vmpr was stabilized at 0 29 l l d and the methane content was maintained at 54 when the ad system was operated at an olr of 1 5 g vs l d the vmpr and methane content both began to continuously decline from day 65 to day 73 this stage was defined as first instable period surprisingly the system self recovered from day 74 without any stabilization measures such as stopping the feed or adding stabilizing agent the vmpr gradually increased and stabilized at maximum values of 0 52 l l d in later of olr of 1 5 g vs l d the methane concentration again stabilized at 54 the period between days 74 and 99 was defined as self recovery period for mesophilic digestion of vw the phenomenon of self recovery was not found at a stable olr of 1 0 g vs l d li et al 2017 the second instable period occurred at an olr of 2 0 g vs l d the methane content decreased from day 100 while the carbon dioxide content increased until the methane content was lower than the carbon dioxide content the methane concentration was below the detection limit on day 121 the biogas production ceased on day 129 hydrogen is important for the digestion process both as an intermediate and electron carrier the hydrogen metabolism involves fermentation syntrophic acetogenesis homoacetogenesis syntrophic acetate oxidization and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis iwa 2002 a high hydrogen concentration can inhibit the vfa degradation resulting in vfa accumulation thus hydrogen accumulation has been suggested to be an indicator for the serious imbalance of the process steyer et al 2002 in this study no hydrogen was detected in the biogas before day 114 however large amounts of hydrogen were detected after day 114 the period after the 114th day was defined as the collapsed stage in this period hydrogenotrophic methanogens hm stopped producing methane but fermentative bacteria fb and syntrophic acetogenesis bacteria ab were still active 3 1 2 volatile fatty acids vfas the vfas are products of acidogenesis and substrates of methanogenesis stable vfa concentrations indicate a balance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis the vfa accumulation reflects kinetic uncoupling between acid producers and consumers in this study individual vfas were monitored every day by gas chromatography fig 2 at an olr of 0 5 g vs l d the concentration of vfas showed a downward trend during the stable period the acetate and propionate concentrations were below 100 mg l and 20 mg l respectively the n butyrate isobutyrate n valerate and isovalerate concentrations were lower than the detection limit during the first instable period all vfa concentrations increased the acetate concentration began to decrease after 76 days although other vfa concentrations still increased during mesophilic digestion of vw no self reduction of acetate was observed li et al 2017 theoretically the acetate could be consumed by syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria saob or acetoclastic methanogens am the reason for acetate consumption will be analyzed using microbial communities the decrease of other vfa concentrations was also observed during the self recovery period during the second instable and collapsed periods actate and n butyrate increased continuously and reached a maximum value of 2499 mg l and 3313 mg l respectively compared with n valerate isovalerate was the main isomer of valerate the isovalerate mainly originated from the degradation of protein boe 2006 the vw used in this study contained 13 protein based on ts 3 1 3 ammonia alkalinity and ph the buffering ability reflects the capacity of the liquid to withstand acidification without lowering the ph alkalinity is an index of the buffering ability the ta normally includes both ba hco3 and ia vfa of an ad system the ta is mainly made up of ba in a stable ad system because the total vfa concentration is very low the ba is mainly derived from ammonia eq 1 therefore ta and tan have similar trends fig 3 a 1 nh 3 h 2 o co 2 aq nh 4 hco 3 b a the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in vw was negligible table 1 no effluent recirculation was taken in this study which resulted in the washout of ammonia therefore the tan concentration declined from 1480 mg l on day 11 to a minimum of 197 mg l the decline of tan resulted in the decrease of both ta and ba during the first and second instable periods the accumulation of vfas led to the rapid increase of ia although ta did not significantly change during these two periods the ba showed a sharp downward trend this result proved once again that the ba and ia should be specified when ta is used a monitoring parameter the use of ph as a process indicator is normally based on the fact that a ph drop corresponds to vfa accumulation a ph change does not necessarily reflect the system state because of the presence of strong buffers such as bicarbonate hco3 and ionized volatile fatty acid vfa the ba or ia are two better alternatives indicating vfa accumulation than the ph because increased vfas will directly reduce the alkalinity before causing any major ph changes however the ph is a good indicator of the process state in a low buffer system such as vw digestion with low ammonia concentration during the first and second instable periods the change of ph reflected the change of ia and ba in time this result is in agreement with that of murto murto et al 2004 when the ph decreased to 5 70 4 40 and 4 36 respectively the ba ia and ta decreased to zero this disagrees with the titration endpoint proposed by anderson and yang 1992 where the ph value of the titration end point for ta determination was 3 8 this indicates that the total alkalinity included only hco3 and vfa in the thermophilic digestion system of vw although the tan was 277 mg l at the end of the digestion all were ionized forms of ammonium nh4 because of the lower ph 3 1 4 oxidation reduction potential orp in theory the measurement of the oxidation reduction potential orp is a good tool to accurately describe variations in the intermediate product composition of an anaerobic digester previously researchers measured the orp of anaerobic digesters subjected to overloading and found a good correlation between electrode potential measurements and vfa accumulation switzenbaum et al 1990 in this study orp and ph were negatively correlated fig 3b there are four significant orp increases the first two increases occurred during the first and second instable periods respectively the increase of orp might be related to propionic acid accumulation iwa 2002 the third and fourth increases occurred during the collapsed period in addition to propionic acid accumulation the third increase may also be related to the formation of hydrogen from reduced nadide the orp value of the last rising period far exceeded the general value 400 mv of the ad system pind et al 2003 this might be due to the fact that incoming oxygen accompanied by feeding could not be consumed by facultative fb because the fb was also completely inhibited due to the extremely low ph value 3 2 syntrophic acetate oxidation to reveal the cause of the natural decline of the acetic acid concentration during the self recovery period the microbial community dynamics of am saob and hydrogenotrophic methanogens hm were analyzed methanogens in the anaerobic digester are mainly methanosarcinales and methanobacteriales dridi et al 2012 liu 2010 sakai et al 2008 methanosarcinales including the family methanosarcinaceae and methanosaetaceae are well known am methanobacteriales including methanobacteriaceae are well known hm table 3 summarizes the published saob the thermacetogenium and thermotoga genuses belong to thermophilic microorganisms in this study an unknown genus s1 was found unfortunately there is little information about genus s1 except for the taxonomy that is the genuses s1 and thermotoga both belong to the family thermotogaceae however genus s1 is probably saob the dynamic changes of am saob and hm are shown in fig 4 methanothermobacter and methanosarcina are the main methanogens of the start up and stable periods respectively this illustrates that the most important methanogenic bacteria in inoculum are hm the am gradually evolved into major methanogens with the daily feed of vw during the first instable period the relative abundance of am methanosarcina declined while the relative abundance of saob thermotogaceae s1 increased it can be concluded that the consumption of acetic acid during the self recovery period is due to syntrophic acetate oxidizing instead of acetoclastic methanogenesis the self reduction of acetate concentration due to the syntrophic acetate oxidizing was not found during mesophilic digestion of vw in previous study of the author li et al 2017 however it was observed during thermophilic digestion of vw in this study the degradation of vfa became more energetic at a higher temperature which is favorable to avoid vfa inhibition on methanogens de bok et al 2004 under standard temperatures 25 c the acetate consumption by aceticlastic methanogenesis eq 2 is also more favorable than syntrophic acetate oxidation into hydrogen and carbon dioxide eq 3 at higher temperatures 55 c the syntrophic acetate oxidation pathway becomes more favorable sasaki et al 2011 revealed that approximately 80 of acetate was decomposed via syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled with a hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis eq 4 pathway whereas the remainder was converted to methane via an am pathway furthermore the degradation of acetate will promote syntrophic propionate n butyrate isobutyrate n valerate isovalerate oxidation eqs 5 9 2 ch 3 cooh ch 4 co 2 δg 0 31 kj mol 3 ch 3 cooh 2 h 2 o 2 co 2 4 h 2 δg 0 104 kj mol 4 co 2 4 h 2 ch 4 2 h 2 o δg 0 135 kj mol 5 ch 3 ch 2 cooh 2

indicators for thermophilic ad of vw the coupling parameters such as the ch4 co2 vfa ba vfa ta ia ba and ba ta ratios were used as potential indicators of the process imbalance in this study fig 5 illustrates the change curves of the coupling indicators the sudden changes of ia ba vfa ba and vfa ta were later than that of ch4 co2 and ba ta during second instable period the slopes of ia ba vfa ba and vfa ta were lower than that of ch4 co2 and ba ta during first instable period in this study the biogas production ceased on day 129 the warning time is defined as the day on which the biogas production ceased minus the day of sudden change during the second instable period the day of sudden change and corresponding changes are listed in table 4 for all process parameters table 4 shows that the vmpr acetate and isovalerate concentration and ia ch4 co2 and ba ta values can be used as early warning indicators for thermophilic ad of vw in general an online biogas flowmeter and component ch4 co2 h2s and o2 analyzer were installed in the biogas plant when the ad system was acidified the ch4 content decreased while the co2 content increased the ch4 co2 ratio had a greater response value due to the superposition effect the technology for individual vfa online monitoring is still not mature biogas projects generally do not include gas chromatography due to the high cost the automatic potentiometric titration instrument is usually set up in the field laboratory of biogas plants the ta ba and ia can be rapidly determined using an automatic titration apparatus by setting different titration endpoint ph values although the warning time of ia was also 29 day the normalized value of ba ta could resist the impact of the determination error vmpr is an important parameter as it indicates the overall performance of the process however it cannot be used to indicate process imbalance since changes in the vmpr depends on olr and feed composition for example there was a larger difference in vmpr between olr 0 5 and 1 0 g vs l d however the values of ba ta between olr 0 5 and 1 0 g vs l d was very closed accordingly the ch4 co2 and ba ta ratios are recommended as early warning indicators for the engineering application of thermophilic ad of vw the instability thresholds of ch4 co2 and ba ta are 1 2 and 0 8 respectively the severe instability thresholds of ch4 co2 and ba ta are 1 0 and 0 4 respectively 3 4 instability diagnosis fig 6 illustrates the instability diagnosis for thermophilic ad of vw during the stable period the feed way without effluent recirculation led to total ammonia loss although there was a balance between fa ab and am hm the loss of ammonia resulted in ba and ta reduction when the olr increased to 1 5 g vs l d the increase of fermentative substrates resulted in an increase of vfas the rise of vfas reduced the ba and ph values at the lower ba level the increase of vfas and decline of ph rapidly increased the concentration of free vfas the high concentration of free vfas caused the inhibition of am fortunately at higher temperatures 55 c the syntrophic acetate oxidation pathway became more favorable the saob appeared and its abundance gradually increased the saob oxidized acetate into hydrogen and carbon dioxide which were used by hm to produce methane subsequently the propionate butyrate and valerate were also degraded to acetate via the syntrophic oxidation pathway the consumption of vfas removed the inhibition of am the balance between fb ab and saob am hm was re established when the olr further increased to 2 0 g vs l d the increase of vfas caused the decline of ba and ph which resulted in the inhibition of saob am and hm the ba decreased to zero on day 114 at ph 5 7 while the ia increased to the maximum of 1780 mg l during the collapsed period the continued accumulation of acetate and n butyrate resulted in a sharp decline of the ph because there was no ba the lower ph below 5 7 shifted the ionized vfa to free vfa vfa until all vfas were in a free state at ph 4 4 at this point the methane production stopped because the saob am and hm were inhibited completely by the higher free vfa vfa it is worth mentioning that hydrogen was detected in biogas during the collapsed period because the tolerance of fb and ab to free vfa vfa was stronger than that of methanogens when the ph decreased to 4 46 and below the fb and ab were also completely inhibited to enhance the capacity of the liquid to withstand acidification without lowering the ph the ba concentration of the ad system should be increased for the engineering application of ad of vw the ba concentration could be maintained at a higher level by recovering or supplying alkalinity by effluent recirculation and nh4hco3 addition respectively for example the effluent recirculation should be adopted during whole process the nh4hco3 reagent could be added when the values of ch4 co2 and ba ta are 1 2 and 0 8 respectively 4 conclusions the vmpr of 0 29 l l d was obtained at stable period of olr 1 0 gvs l d with total vfa concentration below 100 mg l ch4 co2 1 3 and ba ta 0 9 the first instability due to the accumulation of vfa and self recovery due to syntrophic acetate oxidation occurred at an olr of 1 5 gvs l d the digestion failed at an olr of 2 0 g vs l d compared with mesophilic digestion thermophilic digestion can tolerate a higher olr the syntrophic acetate oxidation played a major role in the consumption of acetic acid during the thermophilic ad process the syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria probably belong to genus s1 family thermotogaceae the hm methanothermobacter and am methanosarcina respectively were main methanogenic bacteria during the start up and stable periods the tan loss and ba reduction were the primary causes for the instability of ad of vw without effluent recirculation hydrogen concentration can not be used as early warning indcator compared with single parameters the ch4 co2 and ba ta ratios are recommended as early warning indicators for engineering applications of thermophilic ad of vw acknowledgements this research was supported by the national natural science
