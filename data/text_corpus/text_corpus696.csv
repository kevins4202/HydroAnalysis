3480,urban polluted rivers are important sources of n2o because they receive heavy nitrogen loads containing n2o and its precursors understanding the n2o budget is vital to the formulation of n2o emissions reduction policies the isotopic ratios of n2o from different sources can provide insights into global n2o budgets isotopic ratios of n2o from soil and marine has been well studied yet few studies have explored dynamics of dissolved n2o and its isotopic ratios in urban polluted rivers in this study we quantified n2o concentrations environmental variables and the production pathways of n2o measured the nitrogen isotope ratios of nitrate and ammonia to revealed the nitrogen pollution sources assessed the isotopic ratios of n2o emitted from a series of polluted rivers and compare them with those of soils oceans and freshwaters and revealed the influence of n2o production pathways and nitrogen pollution sources on the δ15n n2o and n2o concentrations of urban polluted rivers in shenzhen city china the concentrations of dissolved n2o ranged from 0 3 to 2482 9 nmol l with most values exceeding those equilibrium with the atmosphere indicating that these rivers in urban subtropical areas are significant n2o sources to atmosphere the isotopic ratios of dissolved n2o from polluted rivers varied widely with δ15n n2o ranging from 11 9 to 34 8 δ18o n2o from 37 9 to 68 2 and sp from 10 5 to 36 2 the δ15n of emitted n2o from water surface to atmosphere ranged from 11 9 to 34 8 with a mean value of 9 2 which was higher than that from natural rivers soil and the troposphere δ15nsp and δ18o values of dissolved n2o were adopted to quantify the relative contributions of nitrification f denitrification 1 f and the magnitude of n2o reduction fr by denitrification the results showed that denitrification was dominant pathway of n2o production although the relative contribution of denitrification and nitrification had a great temporal and spatial variability there is no distinct linear relationship between the concentrations of dissolved n2o δ15n n2o and environmental variables do doc no3 and nh4 the non linear relationship among δ15n n2o and δ15n no3 f fr and environmental variables were explored by regression tree analysis the results suggested that f and fr not do doc no3 and nh4 were the primary correlates of dissolved n2o for which the n2o concentrations were higher when n2o was primarily produced via nitrification f 77 5 or denitrification f 8 and were lower when fr 69 5 it is the first attempt to reveal the connection between production and consumption processes with n2o concentrations directly in addition the elevated values of δ15n no3 4 3 to 29 8 and δ15n nh4 3 2 to 9 3 in these urban rivers consequence that the nitrogen contamination is predominantly sourced from urban sewage regression tree analysis also indicated that intense denitrification and sewage effluent result in enriched δ15n in n2o from polluted rivers for which the δ15n values were higher when n2o was primarily produced via denitrification f 12 or δ15n no3 were higher than 15 6 these findings provide a foundation upon which to devise strategies to reducing n2o production and emission in urban rivers keywords nitrous oxide isotopic signature production pathway polluted river denitrification 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is a greenhouse gas that catalytically destroy ozone in the stratosphere and thus is an important contributor to global climate change ipcc 2013 anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen have continuously increased in aquatic ecosystems worldwide resulting in accumulation of dissolved n2o in rivers lakes and reservoirs borges et al 2015 kroeze et al 2010 ostad ali askar and navabpour 2018a strokal and kroeze 2014 polluted rivers are important sources of n2o because they receive high nitrogen load which carry n2o and its precursors organic matter and inorganic nitrogen however the n2o present in rivers has receive much less attention than that found in contaminated soils hu et al 2018 understanding the n2o budget is essential for formulating n2o emissions reduction policies a recent report revealed that there is great uncertainty in current estimate of n2o emissions form fresh water soils and oceans ipcc 2013 the isotopic ratio of 15n 14n in n2o can be used to distinguish among the contribution of different sources in order to understand the global n2o budget baulch et al 2011 the results of bayesian isotopic mixing and two box models have shown that terrestrial n2o sources contribute 74 76 all global n2o emissions snider et al 2015 terrestrial soil and fresh water that generally emit n2o are depleted in 15n range 40 and 5 relative to the tropospheric background 6 7 0 12 while the δ15n emitted from the oceans range 5 and 20 tend to be enriched relative to the tropospheric n2o kaiser et al 2006 therefore n2o from terrestrial sources fresh water and soils should account for both the tropospheric 15n n2o becoming higher and the increase in the tropospheric n2o concentration since preindustrial times park et al 2012 fresh water and soil sources of n2o are also isotopically distinct as fresh water sources 4 54 9 8 are enriched relative to soil sources 14 85 12 01 fresh water has been found to contribute 24 of all n2o sources based on a bayesian isotopic mixing model snider et al 2015 isotopic characterization studies were initially focused on the ocean but have rapidly expanded to cover soils and fresh water nevertheless n2o data from rivers are only available from six studies three which are located in temperate climates one being a tropical river in a forested swamp and the remaining two being located in temperate climates with little urban development and significant agricultural land use baulch et al 2011 boontanon et al 2000 derakhshannia et al 2020 li et al 2020 ma et al 2019 ostad ali askar et al 2018b thuan et al 2017 toyoda et al 2009 the n2o fluxes from rivers especially polluted rivers have been found to be significantly higher than those in the natural rivers beaulieu et al 2010 hu et al 2018 tan 2014 however research on the isotopic signatures of n2o emitted from polluted rivers remains inadequate if the isotopic signature of n2o emitted from polluted river distinct from that from natural river this could affect the accuracy of global n2o budgets according to isotope fractionation theory the value of δ15n in n2o depends on the enrichment factor ε of different n2o production pathways and the δ15n on a reaction substrate e g nitrate and ammonium nitrification heterotrophic denitrification and nitrifier denitrification are predominant production pathways in rivers li et al 2020 ma et al 2019 higher nitrate concentrations and sufficient organic carbon under anaerobic conditions are beneficial to heterotrophic denitrification while higher concentrations of ammonia and dissolved oxygen are beneficial to nitrification and nitrifier denitrification beaulieu et al 2010 in pure bacterial cultures the enrichment factors during nitrification nh2oh n2o ε 35 5 4 nh3 n2o ε 54 6 should be higher than those for denitrification no3 n2o ε 9 8 6 0 no2 n2o ε 26 11 indicating that the n2o produced from nitrification is more depleted in 15n and 18o relative to the precursors that were produced via denitrification baulch et al 2011 toyoda et al 2011 therefore the 15n of n2o in well aerated soil ecosystems are relatively depleted while that in rivers lakes and oceans is relatively enriched the difference observed in the abundance of 15n in the central and outer positions of n2o sp δ15nα δ15nβ is associated with biological processing and represents a powerful tool that can be used to distinguish among different n2o production pathways that is not affected by the δ15n present in a substrate sutka et al 2006 according to microbial culture data the sp value of n2o produced via nitrification is 33 3 dominika et al 2017 toyoda et al 2015 while that produced via denitrification is 0 3 4 frame and casciotti 2010 additionally the δ18o and sp results from n2o reduction conform to a rayleigh fractionation model koba et al 2009 the sp values of nitrification and denitrification are quite different which provides a new means of quantifying the relative contributions of nitrification and denitrification to n2o this model has been applied to define the n2o production pathways of agricultural soils and waste water treatment plants yet relatively little research exists on rivers and streams ishii et al 2014 wunderlin et al 2013 thuan et al 2017 a positive relationship was found between δ15n n2o and δ15n no3 which indicates the influence of δ15n present in a substrate on the δ15n in n2o li et al 2019 the δ15n values in nitrate and ammonia n are closely related to their sources while the δ15n values in nitrogen from manure and sewage are higher than those from atmospheric deposition and chemical fertilizer nestler et al 2011 therefore the δ15n n2o in rivers where nitrogen originate from manure and sewage is supposed higher than that in natural rivers where nitrogen comes from atmospheric deposition we hypothesize that δ15n n2o is higher in polluted rivers than in natural rivers while sewage contributes to river pollution and denitrification dominate n2o production the concentration of n2o is significantly correlated to ph do nh4 no3 water temperature and dissolved organic carbon doc hu et al 2018 it is widely accepted that increases in inorganic nitrogen contribute to increases in the n2o in rivers and a linear relationship between dissolved or n2o emission and inorganic nitrogen has been proposed gardner et al 2016 quick et al 2016 a positive relationship between n2o and doc has been observed in previous studies stow et al 2005 jake et al 2010 however is also been reported that maximum nitrate values do not correspond to the highest n2o values and some studies suggested that there is no distinct relationship between n2o and doc nitrate and ammonia borges et al 2015 additionally negative relationships between do and dissolved n2o have been reported for many rivers with denitrification yielding more n2o under anoxic conditions than nitrification under oxic conditions ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 rosamond et al 2012 positive relationships have also been observed between do and n2o in many rivers clough et al 2007 while n2o can be produced under both oxic and anoxic conditions via different pathways unlike soil and groundwater systems environmental factors measured from river surfaces water do not necessarily reflect the characteristics of the environments in which n2o was produced i e in sediments or deeper waters these are the likely reasons for the inconsistent conclusions regarding the relationship between these factors and n2o therefore we attempt to directly explored the relationship between n2o production pathways and n2o concentrations water pollution in the pearl river delta region of china is serious due to human activities although much attention has been paid to its water quality and ecological health wang et al 2018 few studies explored dissolved n2o and its isotopic dynamics in associated river systems smith et al 2017 in this paper we qualify n2o concentrations and the production pathways of n2o assess the isotopic character of n2o emitted from a series of polluted rivers and compare them with those of soils oceans and natural rivers and reveal the influence of n2o production pathways and nitrogen pollution sources on the δ15n n2o and n2o concentrations of rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the study rivers examined in this study are located within shenzhen city china fig 1 in an area of high urban development the study area has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with a mean temperature of 22 4 c and a mean annual rainfall of 1769 mm huang et al 2012 urban rivers in shenzhen city have suffered serious anthropogenic pollution due to industrialization and urbanization treated wastewater has been used to replenish rivers and prevent black odor problems streams were sampled at tributaries of the shenzhen river dasha river ds and xixiang river x in july and december of 2018 excluding the periods of highest and lowest air temperatures water samples were collected in may and december form xixiang river which was previously described by li et al 2020 we approximately sampled 35 sites on the river network water samples from xixiang river were share with earlier publication by li et al 2020 the distance between two adjacent sites in one stream was 1 km which afford high resolution of captured spatial heterogeneities water samples were collected to analyze the concentrations and stable isotope compositions of n2o analysis were collected with method described by li et al 2020 samples taken for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 analyses were filled 100 ml polyethylene bottles without treatment 2 2 laboratory analyses dissolved oxygen concentrations were measured on situ using portable sensors hq30d hach co usa while no3 no2 and nh4 concentrations were determined via flow injection analyzer aa3 autoanalyer seal analytical ltd german the dissolved concentrations of n2o were measured by a gas chromatograph using headspace method gc2014 shimadzu co japan isotopic measurements were made according to the method described by baulch et al 2011 gas samples from three replicates were introduced into the same evacuated airbag and determined at the environmental stable isotope lab institute of agricultural environment and sustainable development chinese academy of agricultural sciences caas peking the δ15nbulk n2o δ15nα n2o and δ18o n2o of the gas samples were measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms connected to a trace gas gas sample concentration system isotope trace gas co uk isoprime 100 co uk the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 ratios in nitrate were determined by the denitrifier method briefly this involved transforming the nitrate in a water sample to n2o by denitrifying bacteria that lacked of n2o reductase then the n2o was extracted and purified through the aforementioned system and δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were measured using irms delta v thermo fisher scientific usa li et al 2019 the δ15n nh4 values were analyzed via acidified disk diffusion with a precision of 0 4 in which a few drops of 1 m was placed onto an acidified quartz disk and then a gas membrane was used to pack the disk the dissolved nh4 in water sample was transformed to nh3 gas by adjusting the ph values to 8 9 and subsequently adsorbed by the prepared quartz disk finally the nh4 in the water was converted to nh4 2so4 which was trapped in the quartz disk and then analyzed using and elemental analyzer ea irms flash 2000 delta v thermo fisher scientific usa the typical analytical precisions were 0 5 0 9 and 0 6 for δ15nbulk δ15nα and δ18o respectively the no3 no2 nh4 n2o contents as well as δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ15n nh4 were analyzed in a laboratory of sun yat sen university guangzhou finally the δ15nbulk δ15nα δ15nβ and δ18o were determined at the institute of agricultural environment and sustainable development caas 2 3 calculations isotopomer maps i e plots of δ15nsp vs δ15nbulk or δ15nsp vs δ18o have been used to distinguish different n2o production pathways ishii et al 2014 koba et al 2009 and to quantify the reduction of n2o to n2 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 well et al 2012 based on isotopic mixing and rayleigh fractionation models relative contributions of nitrification f and the magnitude of the n2o reduction fr were calculated by the method described by our earlier publication see supporting information for detail of calculations li et al 2020 the isotopic ratios of emitted n2o were then calculated from isotopic ratios of dissolved n2o which based on the effects of kinetic fractionation

r flux 18 n 2 18 o flux n 2 16 o flux in order to determine the relationships between dissolved n2o and the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification in polluted rivers regression tree analyses were performed with the mvpart package in r v 3 6 venkiteswaran et al 2014 this method allowed us to explore the data in more depth though we were unable to determine the linear regression the relationship among δ15n n2o and δ15n no3 f fr and environmental variables were also analyzed by regression tree statistical analysis was done with spss 19 0 software spss inc chicago usa correlation analysis between n2o and environmental factors were by spearman correlation coefficients 3 results 3 1 environmental variables the ranges of do doc no3 n and nh4 n are listed in fig 2 most of the do values were higher than the 2 mg l indicating an oxic environment with sufficient oxygen for oxidation processes however the values of do at some sampling sites located in the rivers of xz and ft were lower than 2 mg l suggesting the water may polluted serious at these sites doc values ranged from 0 1 to 15 8 mg l exhibiting wide variations among different rivers and the two sampling periods similar concentrations of doc were observed in the rivers of sw xz and x while great seasonal variations of doc were observed in other rivers all the sampling sites have elevated no3 n and nh4 n concentrations that varied from 0 3 to 15 8 mg l and 0 to 9 6 mg l respectively nh4 n was low or undetected of many sampling sites while no3 n showed high concentration in most of the sites such fluvial n enrichment is widespread has been observed in many countries and regions he et al 2013 3 2 concentrations and isotopic ratios of dissolved n2o the concentrations of dissolved n2o varied between 0 3 nmol l and 2482 9 nmol l with most values exceeding those at equilibrium with the atmosphere 5 10 nmol l suggesting that sampled rivers were significant source of n2o emissions to the atmosphere fig 3 the higher concentrations and seasonal variability of dissolved n2o were observed in ds and xz river the isotopic ratios of dissolved n2o varied widely with δ15n n2o ranging from 11 9 34 8 sp from 10 5 36 2 and δ18o n2o from 37 9 to 68 2 enriched δ15n n2o was observed in ft and xz river while enriched δ18o n2o appeared in bj and sw river the temporal and spatial variation of δ18o n2owas not consistent with δ15n n2o owing to the isotope exchange 18o between h2o and n2o the δ15n and δ18o of emitted n2o were calculated and compared those value with other literatures fig 4 previous studies have reported that the δ15n emitted from rivers with sewage inflows are not differ with those of natural rivers despite different n substrates baulch et al 2011 however the δ15n emitted 9 25 from rivers in this study is distinct from that derived from other fresh water 4 6 one sample t test p 0 00 soil 14 86 6 marine 6 6 one sample t test p 0 00 and tropospheric n2o 6 7 one sample t test p 0 02 sources the mean δ18o of emitted n2o 53 9 was higher than that previously reported in freshwaters 41 8 and tropospheric n2o 44 4 both one sample t test p 0 00 p 0 02 respectively 3 3 contributions of nitrification and denitrification to n2o the relative contributions of nitrification and denitrification to n2o production in a system are key determinants of n2o character models based on isotopic ratios of n2o can be used to estimate the partitioning between nitrification and denitrification and as well as the magnitude of n2o reduction it s obviously that over half part of all n2o was produced from denitrification in most of sampling sites fig 5 however the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification varied temporally and spatially the dominant process of n2o production changed between nitrification and denitrification from june to december in ds ft sw and xz river whereas denitrification was the dominant process of n2o production both in june and december in bj and x river most values of fr were higher than 50 illustrated that large amount of produced n2o form nitrification and denitrification was reduced to n2 by complete denitrification 3 4 isotopic ratios of nitrate and ammonia different isotopic signatures of 15n indicate different ammonium and nitrate sources fig 6 the dual isotope approach δ15n and δ18o in no3 has been applied to identify different no3 sources distinguish no3 transformation pathways and define n biochemical processes hendry et al 2018 ostad ali askari et al 2017 in this study δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values ranged from 4 3 to 29 8 and 2 2 to 14 1 respectively which appears to have various sources fig 6a few data falls in the range of soil nitrogen the elevated values of δ15n no3 in these urban rivers consequence that the nitrate contamination is predominantly sourced from urban wastewater discharge from wwtps the values of δ15n no3 exceed range of manure and septic waste may enriched by denitrification the values of δ15n nh4 ranged from 18 2 to 23 4 indicating septic effluent sources of ammonium in a few samples fig 6b however the δ15n nh4 values varied from 3 2 to 9 3 indicating natural organic nitrogen sources of ammonium in most of the samples in addition values of δ15n nh4 were undetected due to low concentrations of nh4 in some sites 3 5 relationships between n2o δ15n n2o and production pathways do doc no3 n and nh4 n were considered as the key factors controlling the production of n2o however we detected no distinct linear relationship between dissolved n2o and do doc no3 n and nh4 n fig 7 a d f h whereas there was a significant negative correlation between do and dissolved nh4 n fig 7g linear relationship has not been found between n2o and f or fr fig 7c i therefore regression tree analysis was used to analyze the relationships between n2o and do doc no3 nh4 f and fr fig 8 a the result show that f and fr were the main factors related to the concentration of dissolved n2o rather than do no3 nh4 or doc the model subdivided the n2o concentration data three times in the first branch 10 samples with lower nitrification contribution ratios f 8 and higher dissolved n2o concentrations mean 801 9 nmol l were separated from other samples in the second branch 11 samples with higher contribution ratio of nitrification f 77 5 and higher concentration of dissolved n2o mean 763 4 nmol l were separated from the other samples in the third branch the remaining 51 samples were divided into two groups according to the n2o reduction ratio fr 69 5 with 18 samples with fr 69 5 having higher n2o concentrations mean 325 0 nmol l and 33 samples with fr 69 5 having lower n2o concentrations mean 135 7 nmol l regression tree was also used to analyze the relationship between δ15n n2o and δ15n no3 f and fr the model subdivided the δ15n n2o data twice fig 8b in the first branch 11 samples with low nitrification contribution ratios f 12 and high δ15n n2o values mean 20 7 were separated from the other samples in the second branch the remaining 59 samples were divided into two groups based on their δ 15n no3 values 14 6 34 samples with δ 15n no3 14 6 had higher δ 15n n2o values mean 9 64 and 25 samples with δ 15n no3 14 6 had lower δ 15n n2o value mean 3 51 4 discussions 4 1 mapping approach to distinguishing n2o mixing and reduction processes isotopic values sp and δ15n or δ18o in n2o can apportion the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification when analyzed using an isotopic mixing model frame and casciotti 2010 it has been hypothesized that the sp value in n2o is determined by the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification however the increase of sp values via reduction could result in an overestimation of the relative contribution of nitrification thus the n2o reduction process must be considered during quantification most researches have studies hypothesized that n2o from two end members nitrification and denitrification is first mixed and then the mixed n2o is reduced secondly scenario 1 duan et al 2017 ishii et al 2014 toyoda et al 2011 however it has also been hypothesized that n2o from heterotrophic denitrification is first reduced and then mixed with nitrification sources n2o scenario 2 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 both scenarios yield identical results for f values because if two intersecting lines are intercepted by a pair of parallels fig 9 it is equivalent to the theorem about ratios in similar triangles whereas fr values are higher for scenario 1 than that for scenario 2 additionally li et al 2019 selected 8 to present the sp value from denitrification enriched by n2o reduction and the relative contributions from nitrification and denitrification were then calculated by a mixing model therefore there remains some uncertainty when using isotopic signatures of n2o here we adopted scenario 1 which has been applied in most studies to obtain f and fr values 4 2 production pathways of dissolved n2o in polluted river in previous studies environmental factors e g do organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen have been used to infer the production pathways of n2o hu et al 2018 however n2o may be produced in sediments and rivers at different depths and environmental factors in water samples often do not reflect the environmental characteristics of n2o production sites for example n2o in aerobic surface waters may originate from anaerobic sediments so it is difficult to infer the n2o production pathway from the environment conditions of the surface water n2o production pathways have been identified in other studies via incubation experiments under laboratory conditions but these do not reflect field conditions thuan et al 2017 fortunately the isotopic signatures of n2o preserve the information needed to distinguish among n2o production pathways despite the transference of n2o from sediments and deep water to the surface toyoda et al 2017 therefore we attempted to establish the relationship between n2o production pathway f and fr and n2o concentration the results showed that the low contribution of nitrification f 8 formed first and primary branch of the regression tree was split again by f 77 5 which once again indicated that the n2o in the water was strongly explained by f and illustrated the close correlation between n2o and production pathway the values of f varied widely indicating that nitrification and denitrification both contribute to the dissolved n2o in polluted rivers regression tree analysis showed that the concentration of n2o was high when f 8 and f 77 5 indicating that n2o accumulated in the river water while the production pathway tended to be dominated by one end member nitrification or denitrification it has been reported that nitrification rates equal to or greater than denitrification rates in river systems arango and tank 2008 richardson et al 2004 and that n2o cannot be consumed by nitrifiers hence n2o can accumulate when nitrification dominates the n2o production pathway the high nitrate and organic carbon loading of these rivers is beneficial to n2o production via heterotrophic denitrification furthermore the high concentration of nitrate also inhibits the reduction of n2o to n2 thus increase the n2o yield either baggs and philippot 2011 groffman et al 2000 ma et al 2019 despite all of this denitrification was still the main source of n2o as has been reported in the literature denitrification is likely dominant in river systems quick et al 2019 the reduction of n2o to n2 by complete denitrification is considered the only known biological pathway of n2o consumption pauleta et al 2019 increases in the abundance of denitrifiers with increased expressions of n2o reductase in wwtps serve urban rivers weisener et al 2017 in this study the regression tree was split by low n2o reduction ratios fr suggesting that fr explains much of the variability in n2o relatively lower n2o concentrations occurred when fr 69 5 confirming high magnitude of n2o reduction contribute to n2o elimination moreover fr values exhibited a wide range of variation in this study as in some studies on soil n2o but distinct with n2o in groundwater mean fr 94 3 as reported by koba et al 2009 it might because the groundwater has relatively stable redox conditions and enough residence time to allow for great reduction while redox condition of terrestrial surface soil and fresh water has more temporal and spatial variability in summary we found that parameters from n2o production pathway f and fr could be a new tool to explain the variations of dissolved n2o concentration in river 4 3 enriched emitted δ15n n2o from polluted rivers snider 2015 found that δ15n n2o emitted from fresh water sources was with a range of 4 54 9 84 which is lower than the tropospheric values and precious study reported that δ15n emitted from river with sewage inflows was similar to that natural river in spite of based on different n substrates baulch et al 2011 however in recent studies li et al 2019 reported that the δ15n n2o in a eutrophic lake ranged from 3 6 to 20 5 76 3 9 while ma 2019 reported that the δ15n n2o in a river heavily polluted with ranged from 0 04 to 13 84 and li et al 2020 reported that the δ15n n2o in an urban river drained by wwtp effluent ranged from 19 34 to 16 6 we found that the mean and upper end of the ranges of δ15n n2o values from fresh water in recent studies displayed an increase compare with those reported in snider et al 2015 in this study the range of δ15n n2o emitted from urban rivers ranged from 12 0 to 34 7 with mean value of 9 2 that higher than values from natural rivers increasing amount of data indicated that the δ15n n2o emitted from urban rivers has a distinct range with other sources however mechanism of the higher values emitted δ15n n2o from urban rivers has not been revealed yet the ratio of 15n 14n in n2o depends on the isotopic signatures of the substrate nitrate or ammonium and the production pathway firstly enriched δ15n in substrates will lead to enriched δ15n in the n2o derived from there substrates well et al 2012 in polluted rivers that receive large amounts of treated waste water the n present in nitrate and ammonium are believed to be more enriched than in natural rivers schmidt et al 2016 secondly complete denitrification n2o reduction could also result in a heavier n isotopic ratio in n2o due to isotope fractionation effect denitrification has been reported as a main source of n2o thuan et al 2017 yang and lei 2018 which could be the reason for the higher upper range of the δ15n n2o in some polluted rivers additionally the higher δ15n n2o values from the anaerobic tank in wwtps also due to the greater contribution from denitrification duan et al 2017 wunderlin et al 2013 therefore the δ15n n2o values will be higher if large amounts of treated wastewater from anaerobic tanks are charged into rivers in this study regression tree analysis confirmed that these two factors resulted in higher δ15n n2o values from polluted rivers the root node was first split by f indicating that the δ15n n2o values were strongly explained by f the tree was split again by the δ15n of no3 suggesting that variability in these values explains much of the variability in the δ15n of n2o higher values of δ15n of n2o occur when f 12 or f 36 5 and when the δ15n of nitrate exceeds 14 6 supports the hypothesis that the n2o from denitrification and higher δ15n from the substrate resulting in n2o with higher δ15n values 5 conclusions in this study environment variables dissolved n2o concentrations and its isotopic compositions form urban rivers were

ratios of dissolved n2o varied widely with δ15n n2o ranging from 11 9 to 34 8 δ18o n2o from 37 9 to 68 2 and sp from 10 5 to 36 2 the δ15n of emitted n2o ranged from 11 9 to 34 8 with a mean value of 9 2 which was higher than that from natural rivers soil and the troposphere the elevated values of δ15n no3 4 3 29 8 and δ15n nh4 3 2 to 9 2 in these urban rivers consequence that the nitrogen contamination is predominantly sourced from urban wastewater discharge from wwtps regression tree analysis indicated that intense denitrification and sewage effluent result in enriched δ15n in n2o

3480,urban polluted rivers are important sources of n2o because they receive heavy nitrogen loads containing n2o and its precursors understanding the n2o budget is vital to the formulation of n2o emissions reduction policies the isotopic ratios of n2o from different sources can provide insights into global n2o budgets isotopic ratios of n2o from soil and marine has been well studied yet few studies have explored dynamics of dissolved n2o and its isotopic ratios in urban polluted rivers in this study we quantified n2o concentrations environmental variables and the production pathways of n2o measured the nitrogen isotope ratios of nitrate and ammonia to revealed the nitrogen pollution sources assessed the isotopic ratios of n2o emitted from a series of polluted rivers and compare them with those of soils oceans and freshwaters and revealed the influence of n2o production pathways and nitrogen pollution sources on the δ15n n2o and n2o concentrations of urban polluted rivers in shenzhen city china the concentrations of dissolved n2o ranged from 0 3 to 2482 9 nmol l with most values exceeding those equilibrium with the atmosphere indicating that these rivers in urban subtropical areas are significant n2o sources to atmosphere the isotopic ratios of dissolved n2o from polluted rivers varied widely with δ15n n2o ranging from 11 9 to 34 8 δ18o n2o from 37 9 to 68 2 and sp from 10 5 to 36 2 the δ15n of emitted n2o from water surface to atmosphere ranged from 11 9 to 34 8 with a mean value of 9 2 which was higher than that from natural rivers soil and the troposphere δ15nsp and δ18o values of dissolved n2o were adopted to quantify the relative contributions of nitrification f denitrification 1 f and the magnitude of n2o reduction fr by denitrification the results showed that denitrification was dominant pathway of n2o production although the relative contribution of denitrification and nitrification had a great temporal and spatial variability there is no distinct linear relationship between the concentrations of dissolved n2o δ15n n2o and environmental variables do doc no3 and nh4 the non linear relationship among δ15n n2o and δ15n no3 f fr and environmental variables were explored by regression tree analysis the results suggested that f and fr not do doc no3 and nh4 were the primary correlates of dissolved n2o for which the n2o concentrations were higher when n2o was primarily produced via nitrification f 77 5 or denitrification f 8 and were lower when fr 69 5 it is the first attempt to reveal the connection between production and consumption processes with n2o concentrations directly in addition the elevated values of δ15n no3 4 3 to 29 8 and δ15n nh4 3 2 to 9 3 in these urban rivers consequence that the nitrogen contamination is predominantly sourced from urban sewage regression tree analysis also indicated that intense denitrification and sewage effluent result in enriched δ15n in n2o from polluted rivers for which the δ15n values were higher when n2o was primarily produced via denitrification f 12 or δ15n no3 were higher than 15 6 these findings provide a foundation upon which to devise strategies to reducing n2o production and emission in urban rivers keywords nitrous oxide isotopic signature production pathway polluted river denitrification 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is a greenhouse gas that catalytically destroy ozone in the stratosphere and thus is an important contributor to global climate change ipcc 2013 anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen have continuously increased in aquatic ecosystems worldwide resulting in accumulation of dissolved n2o in rivers lakes and reservoirs borges et al 2015 kroeze et al 2010 ostad ali askar and navabpour 2018a strokal and kroeze 2014 polluted rivers are important sources of n2o because they receive high nitrogen load which carry n2o and its precursors organic matter and inorganic nitrogen however the n2o present in rivers has receive much less attention than that found in contaminated soils hu et al 2018 understanding the n2o budget is essential for formulating n2o emissions reduction policies a recent report revealed that there is great uncertainty in current estimate of n2o emissions form fresh water soils and oceans ipcc 2013 the isotopic ratio of 15n 14n in n2o can be used to distinguish among the contribution of different sources in order to understand the global n2o budget baulch et al 2011 the results of bayesian isotopic mixing and two box models have shown that terrestrial n2o sources contribute 74 76 all global n2o emissions snider et al 2015 terrestrial soil and fresh water that generally emit n2o are depleted in 15n range 40 and 5 relative to the tropospheric background 6 7 0 12 while the δ15n emitted from the oceans range 5 and 20 tend to be enriched relative to the tropospheric n2o kaiser et al 2006 therefore n2o from terrestrial sources fresh water and soils should account for both the tropospheric 15n n2o becoming higher and the increase in the tropospheric n2o concentration since preindustrial times park et al 2012 fresh water and soil sources of n2o are also isotopically distinct as fresh water sources 4 54 9 8 are enriched relative to soil sources 14 85 12 01 fresh water has been found to contribute 24 of all n2o sources based on a bayesian isotopic mixing model snider et al 2015 isotopic characterization studies were initially focused on the ocean but have rapidly expanded to cover soils and fresh water nevertheless n2o data from rivers are only available from six studies three which are located in temperate climates one being a tropical river in a forested swamp and the remaining two being located in temperate climates with little urban development and significant agricultural land use baulch et al 2011 boontanon et al 2000 derakhshannia et al 2020 li et al 2020 ma et al 2019 ostad ali askar et al 2018b thuan et al 2017 toyoda et al 2009 the n2o fluxes from rivers especially polluted rivers have been found to be significantly higher than those in the natural rivers beaulieu et al 2010 hu et al 2018 tan 2014 however research on the isotopic signatures of n2o emitted from polluted rivers remains inadequate if the isotopic signature of n2o emitted from polluted river distinct from that from natural river this could affect the accuracy of global n2o budgets according to isotope fractionation theory the value of δ15n in n2o depends on the enrichment factor ε of different n2o production pathways and the δ15n on a reaction substrate e g nitrate and ammonium nitrification heterotrophic denitrification and nitrifier denitrification are predominant production pathways in rivers li et al 2020 ma et al 2019 higher nitrate concentrations and sufficient organic carbon under anaerobic conditions are beneficial to heterotrophic denitrification while higher concentrations of ammonia and dissolved oxygen are beneficial to nitrification and nitrifier denitrification beaulieu et al 2010 in pure bacterial cultures the enrichment factors during nitrification nh2oh n2o ε 35 5 4 nh3 n2o ε 54 6 should be higher than those for denitrification no3 n2o ε 9 8 6 0 no2 n2o ε 26 11 indicating that the n2o produced from nitrification is more depleted in 15n and 18o relative to the precursors that were produced via denitrification baulch et al 2011 toyoda et al 2011 therefore the 15n of n2o in well aerated soil ecosystems are relatively depleted while that in rivers lakes and oceans is relatively enriched the difference observed in the abundance of 15n in the central and outer positions of n2o sp δ15nα δ15nβ is associated with biological processing and represents a powerful tool that can be used to distinguish among different n2o production pathways that is not affected by the δ15n present in a substrate sutka et al 2006 according to microbial culture data the sp value of n2o produced via nitrification is 33 3 dominika et al 2017 toyoda et al 2015 while that produced via denitrification is 0 3 4 frame and casciotti 2010 additionally the δ18o and sp results from n2o reduction conform to a rayleigh fractionation model koba et al 2009 the sp values of nitrification and denitrification are quite different which provides a new means of quantifying the relative contributions of nitrification and denitrification to n2o this model has been applied to define the n2o production pathways of agricultural soils and waste water treatment plants yet relatively little research exists on rivers and streams ishii et al 2014 wunderlin et al 2013 thuan et al 2017 a positive relationship was found between δ15n n2o and δ15n no3 which indicates the influence of δ15n present in a substrate on the δ15n in n2o li et al 2019 the δ15n values in nitrate and ammonia n are closely related to their sources while the δ15n values in nitrogen from manure and sewage are higher than those from atmospheric deposition and chemical fertilizer nestler et al 2011 therefore the δ15n n2o in rivers where nitrogen originate from manure and sewage is supposed higher than that in natural rivers where nitrogen comes from atmospheric deposition we hypothesize that δ15n n2o is higher in polluted rivers than in natural rivers while sewage contributes to river pollution and denitrification dominate n2o production the concentration of n2o is significantly correlated to ph do nh4 no3 water temperature and dissolved organic carbon doc hu et al 2018 it is widely accepted that increases in inorganic nitrogen contribute to increases in the n2o in rivers and a linear relationship between dissolved or n2o emission and inorganic nitrogen has been proposed gardner et al 2016 quick et al 2016 a positive relationship between n2o and doc has been observed in previous studies stow et al 2005 jake et al 2010 however is also been reported that maximum nitrate values do not correspond to the highest n2o values and some studies suggested that there is no distinct relationship between n2o and doc nitrate and ammonia borges et al 2015 additionally negative relationships between do and dissolved n2o have been reported for many rivers with denitrification yielding more n2o under anoxic conditions than nitrification under oxic conditions ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 rosamond et al 2012 positive relationships have also been observed between do and n2o in many rivers clough et al 2007 while n2o can be produced under both oxic and anoxic conditions via different pathways unlike soil and groundwater systems environmental factors measured from river surfaces water do not necessarily reflect the characteristics of the environments in which n2o was produced i e in sediments or deeper waters these are the likely reasons for the inconsistent conclusions regarding the relationship between these factors and n2o therefore we attempt to directly explored the relationship between n2o production pathways and n2o concentrations water pollution in the pearl river delta region of china is serious due to human activities although much attention has been paid to its water quality and ecological health wang et al 2018 few studies explored dissolved n2o and its isotopic dynamics in associated river systems smith et al 2017 in this paper we qualify n2o concentrations and the production pathways of n2o assess the isotopic character of n2o emitted from a series of polluted rivers and compare them with those of soils oceans and natural rivers and reveal the influence of n2o production pathways and nitrogen pollution sources on the δ15n n2o and n2o concentrations of rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the study rivers examined in this study are located within shenzhen city china fig 1 in an area of high urban development the study area has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with a mean temperature of 22 4 c and a mean annual rainfall of 1769 mm huang et al 2012 urban rivers in shenzhen city have suffered serious anthropogenic pollution due to industrialization and urbanization treated wastewater has been used to replenish rivers and prevent black odor problems streams were sampled at tributaries of the shenzhen river dasha river ds and xixiang river x in july and december of 2018 excluding the periods of highest and lowest air temperatures water samples were collected in may and december form xixiang river which was previously described by li et al 2020 we approximately sampled 35 sites on the river network water samples from xixiang river were share with earlier publication by li et al 2020 the distance between two adjacent sites in one stream was 1 km which afford high resolution of captured spatial heterogeneities water samples were collected to analyze the concentrations and stable isotope compositions of n2o analysis were collected with method described by li et al 2020 samples taken for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 analyses were filled 100 ml polyethylene bottles without treatment 2 2 laboratory analyses dissolved oxygen concentrations were measured on situ using portable sensors hq30d hach co usa while no3 no2 and nh4 concentrations were determined via flow injection analyzer aa3 autoanalyer seal analytical ltd german the dissolved concentrations of n2o were measured by a gas chromatograph using headspace method gc2014 shimadzu co japan isotopic measurements were made according to the method described by baulch et al 2011 gas samples from three replicates were introduced into the same evacuated airbag and determined at the environmental stable isotope lab institute of agricultural environment and sustainable development chinese academy of agricultural sciences caas peking the δ15nbulk n2o δ15nα n2o and δ18o n2o of the gas samples were measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms connected to a trace gas gas sample concentration system isotope trace gas co uk isoprime 100 co uk the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 ratios in nitrate were determined by the denitrifier method briefly this involved transforming the nitrate in a water sample to n2o by denitrifying bacteria that lacked of n2o reductase then the n2o was extracted and purified through the aforementioned system and δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were measured using irms delta v thermo fisher scientific usa li et al 2019 the δ15n nh4 values were analyzed via acidified disk diffusion with a precision of 0 4 in which a few drops of 1 m was placed onto an acidified quartz disk and then a gas membrane was used to pack the disk the dissolved nh4 in water sample was transformed to nh3 gas by adjusting the ph values to 8 9 and subsequently adsorbed by the prepared quartz disk finally the nh4 in the water was converted to nh4 2so4 which was trapped in the quartz disk and then analyzed using and elemental analyzer ea irms flash 2000 delta v thermo fisher scientific usa the typical analytical precisions were 0 5 0 9 and 0 6 for δ15nbulk δ15nα and δ18o respectively the no3 no2 nh4 n2o contents as well as δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ15n nh4 were analyzed in a laboratory of sun yat sen university guangzhou finally the δ15nbulk δ15nα δ15nβ and δ18o were determined at the institute of agricultural environment and sustainable development caas 2 3 calculations isotopomer maps i e plots of δ15nsp vs δ15nbulk or δ15nsp vs δ18o have been used to distinguish different n2o production pathways ishii et al 2014 koba et al 2009 and to quantify the reduction of n2o to n2 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 well et al 2012 based on isotopic mixing and rayleigh fractionation models relative contributions of nitrification f and the magnitude of the n2o reduction fr were calculated by the method described by our earlier publication see supporting information for detail of calculations li et al 2020 the isotopic ratios of emitted n2o were then calculated from isotopic ratios of dissolved n2o which based on the effects of kinetic fractionation

r flux 18 n 2 18 o flux n 2 16 o flux in order to determine the relationships between dissolved n2o and the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification in polluted rivers regression tree analyses were performed with the mvpart package in r v 3 6 venkiteswaran et al 2014 this method allowed us to explore the data in more depth though we were unable to determine the linear regression the relationship among δ15n n2o and δ15n no3 f fr and environmental variables were also analyzed by regression tree statistical analysis was done with spss 19 0 software spss inc chicago usa correlation analysis between n2o and environmental factors were by spearman correlation coefficients 3 results 3 1 environmental variables the ranges of do doc no3 n and nh4 n are listed in fig 2 most of the do values were higher than the 2 mg l indicating an oxic environment with sufficient oxygen for oxidation processes however the values of do at some sampling sites located in the rivers of xz and ft were lower than 2 mg l suggesting the water may polluted serious at these sites doc values ranged from 0 1 to 15 8 mg l exhibiting wide variations among different rivers and the two sampling periods similar concentrations of doc were observed in the rivers of sw xz and x while great seasonal variations of doc were observed in other rivers all the sampling sites have elevated no3 n and nh4 n concentrations that varied from 0 3 to 15 8 mg l and 0 to 9 6 mg l respectively nh4 n was low or undetected of many sampling sites while no3 n showed high concentration in most of the sites such fluvial n enrichment is widespread has been observed in many countries and regions he et al 2013 3 2 concentrations and isotopic ratios of dissolved n2o the concentrations of dissolved n2o varied between 0 3 nmol l and 2482 9 nmol l with most values exceeding those at equilibrium with the atmosphere 5 10 nmol l suggesting that sampled rivers were significant source of n2o emissions to the atmosphere fig 3 the higher concentrations and seasonal variability of dissolved n2o were observed in ds and xz river the isotopic ratios of dissolved n2o varied widely with δ15n n2o ranging from 11 9 34 8 sp from 10 5 36 2 and δ18o n2o from 37 9 to 68 2 enriched δ15n n2o was observed in ft and xz river while enriched δ18o n2o appeared in bj and sw river the temporal and spatial variation of δ18o n2owas not consistent with δ15n n2o owing to the isotope exchange 18o between h2o and n2o the δ15n and δ18o of emitted n2o were calculated and compared those value with other literatures fig 4 previous studies have reported that the δ15n emitted from rivers with sewage inflows are not differ with those of natural rivers despite different n substrates baulch et al 2011 however the δ15n emitted 9 25 from rivers in this study is distinct from that derived from other fresh water 4 6 one sample t test p 0 00 soil 14 86 6 marine 6 6 one sample t test p 0 00 and tropospheric n2o 6 7 one sample t test p 0 02 sources the mean δ18o of emitted n2o 53 9 was higher than that previously reported in freshwaters 41 8 and tropospheric n2o 44 4 both one sample t test p 0 00 p 0 02 respectively 3 3 contributions of nitrification and denitrification to n2o the relative contributions of nitrification and denitrification to n2o production in a system are key determinants of n2o character models based on isotopic ratios of n2o can be used to estimate the partitioning between nitrification and denitrification and as well as the magnitude of n2o reduction it s obviously that over half part of all n2o was produced from denitrification in most of sampling sites fig 5 however the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification varied temporally and spatially the dominant process of n2o production changed between nitrification and denitrification from june to december in ds ft sw and xz river whereas denitrification was the dominant process of n2o production both in june and december in bj and x river most values of fr were higher than 50 illustrated that large amount of produced n2o form nitrification and denitrification was reduced to n2 by complete denitrification 3 4 isotopic ratios of nitrate and ammonia different isotopic signatures of 15n indicate different ammonium and nitrate sources fig 6 the dual isotope approach δ15n and δ18o in no3 has been applied to identify different no3 sources distinguish no3 transformation pathways and define n biochemical processes hendry et al 2018 ostad ali askari et al 2017 in this study δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values ranged from 4 3 to 29 8 and 2 2 to 14 1 respectively which appears to have various sources fig 6a few data falls in the range of soil nitrogen the elevated values of δ15n no3 in these urban rivers consequence that the nitrate contamination is predominantly sourced from urban wastewater discharge from wwtps the values of δ15n no3 exceed range of manure and septic waste may enriched by denitrification the values of δ15n nh4 ranged from 18 2 to 23 4 indicating septic effluent sources of ammonium in a few samples fig 6b however the δ15n nh4 values varied from 3 2 to 9 3 indicating natural organic nitrogen sources of ammonium in most of the samples in addition values of δ15n nh4 were undetected due to low concentrations of nh4 in some sites 3 5 relationships between n2o δ15n n2o and production pathways do doc no3 n and nh4 n were considered as the key factors controlling the production of n2o however we detected no distinct linear relationship between dissolved n2o and do doc no3 n and nh4 n fig 7 a d f h whereas there was a significant negative correlation between do and dissolved nh4 n fig 7g linear relationship has not been found between n2o and f or fr fig 7c i therefore regression tree analysis was used to analyze the relationships between n2o and do doc no3 nh4 f and fr fig 8 a the result show that f and fr were the main factors related to the concentration of dissolved n2o rather than do no3 nh4 or doc the model subdivided the n2o concentration data three times in the first branch 10 samples with lower nitrification contribution ratios f 8 and higher dissolved n2o concentrations mean 801 9 nmol l were separated from other samples in the second branch 11 samples with higher contribution ratio of nitrification f 77 5 and higher concentration of dissolved n2o mean 763 4 nmol l were separated from the other samples in the third branch the remaining 51 samples were divided into two groups according to the n2o reduction ratio fr 69 5 with 18 samples with fr 69 5 having higher n2o concentrations mean 325 0 nmol l and 33 samples with fr 69 5 having lower n2o concentrations mean 135 7 nmol l regression tree was also used to analyze the relationship between δ15n n2o and δ15n no3 f and fr the model subdivided the δ15n n2o data twice fig 8b in the first branch 11 samples with low nitrification contribution ratios f 12 and high δ15n n2o values mean 20 7 were separated from the other samples in the second branch the remaining 59 samples were divided into two groups based on their δ 15n no3 values 14 6 34 samples with δ 15n no3 14 6 had higher δ 15n n2o values mean 9 64 and 25 samples with δ 15n no3 14 6 had lower δ 15n n2o value mean 3 51 4 discussions 4 1 mapping approach to distinguishing n2o mixing and reduction processes isotopic values sp and δ15n or δ18o in n2o can apportion the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification when analyzed using an isotopic mixing model frame and casciotti 2010 it has been hypothesized that the sp value in n2o is determined by the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification however the increase of sp values via reduction could result in an overestimation of the relative contribution of nitrification thus the n2o reduction process must be considered during quantification most researches have studies hypothesized that n2o from two end members nitrification and denitrification is first mixed and then the mixed n2o is reduced secondly scenario 1 duan et al 2017 ishii et al 2014 toyoda et al 2011 however it has also been hypothesized that n2o from heterotrophic denitrification is first reduced and then mixed with nitrification sources n2o scenario 2 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 both scenarios yield identical results for f values because if two intersecting lines are intercepted by a pair of parallels fig 9 it is equivalent to the theorem about ratios in similar triangles whereas fr values are higher for scenario 1 than that for scenario 2 additionally li et al 2019 selected 8 to present the sp value from denitrification enriched by n2o reduction and the relative contributions from nitrification and denitrification were then calculated by a mixing model therefore there remains some uncertainty when using isotopic signatures of n2o here we adopted scenario 1 which has been applied in most studies to obtain f and fr values 4 2 production pathways of dissolved n2o in polluted river in previous studies environmental factors e g do organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen have been used to infer the production pathways of n2o hu et al 2018 however n2o may be produced in sediments and rivers at different depths and environmental factors in water samples often do not reflect the environmental characteristics of n2o production sites for example n2o in aerobic surface waters may originate from anaerobic sediments so it is difficult to infer the n2o production pathway from the environment conditions of the surface water n2o production pathways have been identified in other studies via incubation experiments under laboratory conditions but these do not reflect field conditions thuan et al 2017 fortunately the isotopic signatures of n2o preserve the information needed to distinguish among n2o production pathways despite the transference of n2o from sediments and deep water to the surface toyoda et al 2017 therefore we attempted to establish the relationship between n2o production pathway f and fr and n2o concentration the results showed that the low contribution of nitrification f 8 formed first and primary branch of the regression tree was split again by f 77 5 which once again indicated that the n2o in the water was strongly explained by f and illustrated the close correlation between n2o and production pathway the values of f varied widely indicating that nitrification and denitrification both contribute to the dissolved n2o in polluted rivers regression tree analysis showed that the concentration of n2o was high when f 8 and f 77 5 indicating that n2o accumulated in the river water while the production pathway tended to be dominated by one end member nitrification or denitrification it has been reported that nitrification rates equal to or greater than denitrification rates in river systems arango and tank 2008 richardson et al 2004 and that n2o cannot be consumed by nitrifiers hence n2o can accumulate when nitrification dominates the n2o production pathway the high nitrate and organic carbon loading of these rivers is beneficial to n2o production via heterotrophic denitrification furthermore the high concentration of nitrate also inhibits the reduction of n2o to n2 thus increase the n2o yield either baggs and philippot 2011 groffman et al 2000 ma et al 2019 despite all of this denitrification was still the main source of n2o as has been reported in the literature denitrification is likely dominant in river systems quick et al 2019 the reduction of n2o to n2 by complete denitrification is considered the only known biological pathway of n2o consumption pauleta et al 2019 increases in the abundance of denitrifiers with increased expressions of n2o reductase in wwtps serve urban rivers weisener et al 2017 in this study the regression tree was split by low n2o reduction ratios fr suggesting that fr explains much of the variability in n2o relatively lower n2o concentrations occurred when fr 69 5 confirming high magnitude of n2o reduction contribute to n2o elimination moreover fr values exhibited a wide range of variation in this study as in some studies on soil n2o but distinct with n2o in groundwater mean fr 94 3 as reported by koba et al 2009 it might because the groundwater has relatively stable redox conditions and enough residence time to allow for great reduction while redox condition of terrestrial surface soil and fresh water has more temporal and spatial variability in summary we found that parameters from n2o production pathway f and fr could be a new tool to explain the variations of dissolved n2o concentration in river 4 3 enriched emitted δ15n n2o from polluted rivers snider 2015 found that δ15n n2o emitted from fresh water sources was with a range of 4 54 9 84 which is lower than the tropospheric values and precious study reported that δ15n emitted from river with sewage inflows was similar to that natural river in spite of based on different n substrates baulch et al 2011 however in recent studies li et al 2019 reported that the δ15n n2o in a eutrophic lake ranged from 3 6 to 20 5 76 3 9 while ma 2019 reported that the δ15n n2o in a river heavily polluted with ranged from 0 04 to 13 84 and li et al 2020 reported that the δ15n n2o in an urban river drained by wwtp effluent ranged from 19 34 to 16 6 we found that the mean and upper end of the ranges of δ15n n2o values from fresh water in recent studies displayed an increase compare with those reported in snider et al 2015 in this study the range of δ15n n2o emitted from urban rivers ranged from 12 0 to 34 7 with mean value of 9 2 that higher than values from natural rivers increasing amount of data indicated that the δ15n n2o emitted from urban rivers has a distinct range with other sources however mechanism of the higher values emitted δ15n n2o from urban rivers has not been revealed yet the ratio of 15n 14n in n2o depends on the isotopic signatures of the substrate nitrate or ammonium and the production pathway firstly enriched δ15n in substrates will lead to enriched δ15n in the n2o derived from there substrates well et al 2012 in polluted rivers that receive large amounts of treated waste water the n present in nitrate and ammonium are believed to be more enriched than in natural rivers schmidt et al 2016 secondly complete denitrification n2o reduction could also result in a heavier n isotopic ratio in n2o due to isotope fractionation effect denitrification has been reported as a main source of n2o thuan et al 2017 yang and lei 2018 which could be the reason for the higher upper range of the δ15n n2o in some polluted rivers additionally the higher δ15n n2o values from the anaerobic tank in wwtps also due to the greater contribution from denitrification duan et al 2017 wunderlin et al 2013 therefore the δ15n n2o values will be higher if large amounts of treated wastewater from anaerobic tanks are charged into rivers in this study regression tree analysis confirmed that these two factors resulted in higher δ15n n2o values from polluted rivers the root node was first split by f indicating that the δ15n n2o values were strongly explained by f the tree was split again by the δ15n of no3 suggesting that variability in these values explains much of the variability in the δ15n of n2o higher values of δ15n of n2o occur when f 12 or f 36 5 and when the δ15n of nitrate exceeds 14 6 supports the hypothesis that the n2o from denitrification and higher δ15n from the substrate resulting in n2o with higher δ15n values 5 conclusions in this study environment variables dissolved n2o concentrations and its isotopic compositions form urban rivers were measured δ15nsp and δ18o values were adopted to quantify the relative contributions of nitrification f denitrification 1 f and the magnitude of n2o reduction fr based on mixing and rayleigh fractionation models we found that the concentrations of dissolved n2o varied between 0 3 nmol l and 2482 9 nmol l indicating that rivers replenished with treated wastewater in urban subtropical areas are key sources of n2o denitrification was dominant pathway of n2o production although the relative contribution of denitrification and nitrification had a great temporal and spatial variability we detected no distinct linear relationship between the concentrations of dissolved n2o and do doc no3 and nh4 however regression tree analysis suggested that f and fr not do doc no3 and nh4 were the primary correlates of dissolved n2o for which the concentrations were higher when n2o was primarily produced via nitrification f 77 5 or denitrification f 8 and were lower when fr 69 5 the isotopic ratios of dissolved n2o varied widely with δ15n n2o ranging from 11 9 to 34 8 δ18o n2o from 37 9 to 68 2 and sp from 10 5 to 36 2 the δ15n of emitted n2o ranged from 11 9 to 34 8 with a mean value of 9 2 which was higher than that from natural rivers soil and the troposphere the elevated values of δ15n no3 4 3 29 8 and δ15n nh4 3 2 to 9 2 in these urban rivers consequence that the nitrogen contamination is predominantly sourced from urban wastewater discharge from wwtps regression tree analysis indicated that intense denitrification and sewage effluent result in enriched δ15n in n2o from polluted rivers these findings provide a foundation upon which to devise strategies to reducing n2o production and emission in urban rivers credit authorship contribution statement xing li

3481,low impact development lid facilities have been regarded to have important regulatory effects on urban evapotranspiration et however due to the influences of heterogeneity of underlying surfaces or facilities solar radiation building shading and rainfall conditions the et variations in outdoor space of urban buildings osub with various lid facilities are complex and have not been reported in this paper a three temperature model so called 3t model combining with a portable thermal infrared imaging sensor was used to in situ measure the et rates of different lid facilities and traditional underlying surfaces of an osub in 2019 in shenzhen china specifically the seasonal daily and diurnal variations of et in the osub and their influencing factors were investigated the results indicate that 1 the lid facilities have higher et rates than the traditional surfaces in wet seasons the et rates of bioretention br h vegetated swale vs z and permeable concrete pavement pcp are 38 18 and 250 higher than those of traditional garden tg h lawn tl z and impermeable brick pavement ibp respectively in this study 2 the diurnal variation of et is greatly affected by solar radiation intensity building shadow and moisture inside the lid facilities and the et increase by lid is higher in the osub with higher solar radiation and no shadow 3 vegetated lid facilities e g br h and vs z can maintain at a relatively high et rate for a longer period after rain than the non vegetated lid facilities e g pcp indicating a stronger ability to increase urban et 4 when the proportion of lid in osubs increases from 0 to 50 and 100 the et rate of osubs increases by 28 and 51 respectively and the annual et of built up areas in shenzhen increases by 6 58 mm and 11 41 mm respectively the effects of soil media vegetative cover lid facility structure local climate and building shadow on the et of osubs should be considered for extrapolating the site scale study to urban or catchment scale keywords evapotranspiration low impact development three temperature model infrared remote sensing outdoor space of urban buildings 1 introduction evapotranspiration et plays important roles not only in regulating the urban hydrological cycle but also in alleviating the urban heat island uhi effect marasco et al 2014 tian et al 2014 xiong et al 2015 however et is greatly reduced in urban areas where the natural underlying surfaces are constantly replaced by the impervious surfaces such as buildings roads and squares van mechelen et al 2015 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b vijayaraghavan 2016 low impact development lid has been proposed to restore the urban hydrological process to the pre development status ahiablame et al 2012 eckart et al 2017 the lid facilities including green roofs bioretentions permeable pavements etc are designed to store or infiltrate water at source during rainfall instead of draining it rapidly dietz 2007 eckart et al 2017 the facilities have the ability to increase urban et and thus moderate the urban hydrological cycle and mitigate the uhi effect feng et al 2016 the outdoor space of urban buildings osub is one of the main places for residents daily outdoor activities et significantly affects the microclimate and human comfort in an osub at the same time this space is also one of the main places for lid implementation therefore there is a need to understand the influence of lid on et in an osub however in situ measurement of et from different underlying surfaces in an osub is rather difficult an osub is usually composed of various underlying surfaces e g pavement garden lawn and et of different underlying surfaces varies greatly with the introduction of lid facilities the types of underlying surfaces are further increased resulting in higher spatial heterogeneity of et in an osub these features pose great difficulties for traditional et estimation methods in addition et is not only affected by solar radiation and air temperature but also affected by building shadow and antecedent rainfall conditions feng et al 2014 poë et al 2015 shadow can affect et by changing the path of near ground radiation feng et al 2014 which is especially common in urban environment the introduction of lid facilities may increase the moisture of underlying surfaces after rain thus affecting et in an osub li et al 2019 therefore there is a need to understand the heterogeneity and variations of et from different underlying surfaces and lid facilities once the increase in et in specific lid facilities as compared to traditional types of land covers is known the hydrological regulation effect of lid on osubs can be further evaluated by using an area weighted approach furthermore the effect of lid on et at a city or catchment scale can be evaluated by using some up scale methods actual et of lid facilities has been investigated by laboratory experiments with installing samples in reduced size many previous studies focused on the et of green roofs and permeable pavement materials brown and borst 2015 syrrakou et al 2014 the methods used to estimate et in these studies can be mainly divided into two categories one is the weighing method load cells or mass balances and the other is the measurement of the change of water content cascone et al 2019 tziampou et al 2020 weighing method has been applied to quantify et rates of permeable pavements and green roofs chen et al 2019 li et al 2014 liu et al 2018 ouldboukhitine et al 2014 poë et al 2015 yilmaz et al 2016 used four water content probes to estimate volumetric water content inside the growing media of green roofs and calculate actual et based on daily water balance actual et of lid facilities has also been measured in situ in some previous studies the methods used in these studies included water balance method weighing lysimeter eddy covariance method etc cascone et al 2019 heusinger and weber 2016 tziampou et al 2020 water balance method has been used to quantify evaporation from permeable pavements brown and borst 2015 weighing lysimeter has been applied to quantify et from green roofs and rain gardens denich and bradford 2010 feng et al 2018 hess et al 2017 eddy covariance method has been used to observe et of green roofs heusinger and weber 2016 in addition to these traditional et observation methods werner 2000 developed a device called tunnel verdunstungsmesser tuv to measure the actual et from vegetated and non vegetated areas in field conditions the method has been used to measure evaporation from urban pavements lal et al 2017 starke et al 2010 wang et al 2019 jerjen et al 2015 although the methods mentioned above can be used to observe et of lid facilities under real environmental conditions they all have their own limitations fisher et al 2011 marasco et al 2014 tziampou et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 so far there is a lack of evaluation of the effects of lid on et in osubs based on in situ measurements the three temperature model 3t model is an et measurement method based on energy balance qiu et al 1996 qiu et al 1998 by introducing a reference leaf or reference soil the model eliminates parameters such as aerodynamic resistance that are difficult to estimate in traditional models parameters in this model only include temperatures net radiations and heat fluxes unlike other radiation or temperature based et estimation method such as hargreaves and priestley taylor models the 3t model does not include empirical parameters required under the assumption that the underlying surface is sufficiently moist or free from moisture limitation thus 3t model considers the energy exchange process of water and it is applicable to estimate actual et under not only the condition of energy limitation but also the condition of water limitation the 3t model has been successfully applied to measure actual et of various types of underlying surfaces such as bare soil grassland shrub and forests qiu et al 2015 qiu et al 2017 qiu and zhao 2010 tian et al 2014 voortman et al 2016 xiong and qiu 2014 xiong et al 2019 zou et al 2019 in a previous study we examined the accuracy of the 3t model on the et observation of vegetated and non vegetated lid facilities zhang et al 2020 validation results show that the 3t model has the ability to measure variations of et of lid facilities because the 3t model is simple to use high spatial resolution and portable it is especially suitable for in situ observation of et of lid facilities therefore the 3t model provides a potential method for evaluating the effect of lid on et in osubs based on in situ measurement however the 3t model has not been used to estimate the et variations in a real osub which are greatly affected by heterogeneity of underlying surfaces or lid facilities solar radiation intensity building shading and rainfall conditions this study aims to investigate the effects of lid on et in an osub by using the 3t model combined with a thermal infrared imager more explicitly the objectives are to 1 compare et of lid facilities and traditional underlying surfaces 2 investigate the effect of lid facilities on diurnal et and its variation with building shadow 3 investigate the effect of lid facilities on et variation after rain and 4 evaluate the effect of lid on the overall et in the osub 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in a community in shenzhen china 22 38 6 n 113 57 14 e the community consists of three side by side 6 storey buildings which covers an area of 11250 m2 fig 1 there are two outdoor spaces between the three buildings one osub is fully covered with impermeable asphalt pavement control area for short the other osub is a low impact development demonstration area lid area for short in which lid facilities e g bioretention vegetated swale and permeable concrete pavement are installed the lid area also retains some traditional underlying surfaces such as traditional garden traditional lawn and impermeable brick pavement fig 1 there are two types of bioretention in the lid area one is the sunken bioretention that mainly receives the rainfall runoff from surrounding permeable pavement fig 2 a the other is the elevated bioretention which is installed 1 m above the ground to mainly receive the rainfall runoff from building roofs fig 2b both the sunken bioretention and the elevated bioretention are composed of vegetation layer soil layer geotextile and gravel layer the sunken bioretention is planted with pennisetum purpureum br p and canna indica br c while the elevated bioretention is planted with hibiscus rosa sinensis br h the traditional garden is mainly covered by hibiscus rosa sinensis tr h fig 2c and the traditional lawn is mainly covered by zoysia tenuifolia tl z fig 2d the vegetated swale consists of vegetation layer planted with zoysia tenuifolia vs z soil layer 30 cm geotextile and gravel layer 30 cm fig 2e the impermeable brick pavement ibp consists of surface layer 6 cm and subgrade fig 2f in the control area the impermeable asphalt pavement iap consists of surface layer 3 cm and subgrade fig 2g the permeable concrete pavement pcp consists of surface layer 15 cm subbase layer 15 cm geotextile and subgrade fig 2h the surface layer is permeable concrete with porosity of 15 25 the subbase layer is filled with graded broken stones the areas of different types of underlying surfaces in lid area and control area are shown in table 1 2 2 3t model and infrared remote sensing method the 3t model proposed by qiu et al 1996 1998 can be expressed as follows 1 le s r n s g s r n sd g sd t s t a t sd t a for soil 2 le v r n v r n vd t v t a t vd t a for vegetation where le s le v is the latent heat flux for soil and vegetation w m 2 respectively l is the latent heat of vaporization 2 42 106 w m 2 mm 1 e s e v is the evapotranspiration mm for soil and vegetation respectively r n s r n s d r n v and r n v d are the net radiations of soil surface reference dry soil surface leaf surface and reference dry leaf surface w m 2 respectively g s and g sd are the heat fluxes of soil and reference dry soil w m 2 respectively ts tsd t v and t vd are the surface temperatures of soil reference dry soil leaf and reference dry leaf k respectively ta is air temperature k in this study equation 1 was used to calculate et of pavements while equation 2 was used to calculate et of vegetated underlying surfaces zhang et al 2020 in this study a color photo of plant leaves was used to represent the imitation dry leaf of the vegetated underlying surface during the observation the imitation dry leaf is placed next to the observation leaves to ensure that their surrounding meteorological conditions are consistent a piece of pavement was selected as the reference dry pavement which was covered by waterproof plastic film to keep it dry during rainfall event and was remained uncovered during the subsequent drying period zhang et al 2020 the 3t model does not directly account for the impact of wind field however aerodynamic resistance which is highly related with wind speed is included in the energy balance equation used for derivation of 3t model qiu et al 1996 1998 zhou et al 2014 it can be seen that the input parameters of the 3t model only include net radiations soil heat fluxes air temperature and surface temperature net radiations and temperatures can be directly measured and the soil heat fluxes can be directly extracted from the net radiations tian et al 2014 by using a thermal infrared imager to obtain surfaces temperatures and by using a net radiometer to obtain net radiations the 3t model becomes portable and suitable for et observation in situ in addition the 3t model has high spatial resolution and can distinguish et of different underlying surfaces in a highly heterogeneous environment 2 3 data collection and processing to apply the three temperature model and thermal infrared imaging technique to measure actual et of different underlying surfaces the following parameters need to be measured in this study the surface temperatures were measured with an infrared thermal imager fluke ir flexcam ti55 fluck crop usa the measuring wave length of the thermal camera is 8 14 μm and its resolution is 0 05 c each thermal infrared image contains 76 800 320 240 temperature data points before the experiment the thermal imager was calibrated against a blackbody temperature the images were taken every hour in triplicate from 8 30 to 17 30 on each day net radiation was measured by a one component net radiometer nr lite2 kipp zonen b v netherlands with an accuracy of 10 µv w m2 air temperature data was collected by an automatic temperature and humidity sensor hobo u23 001 onset computer crop usa with an accuracy of 0 2 c at an interval of 10 min at a height of 2 m above ground surface the heat flux of pavement was estimated as a proportion of net radiation g s λ r n s qiu et al 2006 we obtain the ratio λ for each pavement by observing the net radiation and heat flux using pilot devices the ratio for permeable concrete pavement and its reference system was 0 10 and 0 14 respectively the ratios for impermeable brick and its reference system were both 0 16 and the ratios for impermeable asphalt and its reference system were both 0 26 during et observation periods we measured the wind speed with an anemometer installed 2 m above ground in the lid area hourly actual et of each type of underlying surfaces was measured in the wet season july 25 27 august 5 15 and august 20 24 2019 and the dry season december 11 17 2019 in the wet season measurements were conducted for 3 7 consecutive days after four rainfall periods with rainfall 10 4 89 4 mm in the first three days before experiments around 200 h of et data for br p br c br h tg h vs z and tl z were obtained while around 70 h of et data for pcp ibp and iap were obtained in shenzhen the average antecedent drying period adp during wet seasons is about 3 days and weather conditions with adp greater than 7 days in wet seasons are very rare thus only et variations within up to 7 days after rain were measured in the dry season measurements were conducted after a long dry period more than 30 days 69 h of et data for br p br c br h tg h vs z and tl z were obtained negative values of et data estimated by the 3t model were excluded and pauta criterion 3δ criterion shen et al 2017 was used to filter out abnormal et data estimated by the 3t model in addition due to the influence of building shadow distribution under the sunlight the et data at different monitoring points in the osubs may correspond to inconsistent shadow conditions at some time the data with inconsistent shadow conditions was deleted to ensure data comparability which accounts for around 12 of the total data one way anova lsd was used to compare the hourly et of lid facilities and traditional underlying surfaces and indicate the significant differences p 0 05 2 4 model validation we have validated the 3t model by comparing the et from pilot lid facilities measured by 3t model with that measured by weighing platform in our previously published paper zhang et al 2020 the results show that the coefficient determinants r2 between et measured by 3t model and weighing platform are larger than 0 6 and the slopes of regression equations are close to 1 and their intercepts are close to 0 thus 3t model can accurately quantify et rate of the lid facilities to further validate the et rates in this study we compared the et rates estimated by 3t model with those estimated by a soil water balance method we measured the soil moisture at three points around 0 1 m below the surface of a sunken bioretention and a vegetated swale at one day intervals by using soil moisture sensor sm300 delta t uk on july 25 27 and august 5 15 2019 the daily et of each lid facility was approximately estimated by the daily decrease of averaged soil moisture in the facility the non parametric test man whitney u test was used to verify the difference between the et rates estimated by 3t model and soil water balance method the results show that there is no significant difference at p 0 05 in daily et estimated by the two method fig 3 although there are limitations in using water balance method to calculate et marasco et al 2014 the validation results show et estimated by the 3t model was comparable to that estimated by the water balance method 2 5 scenario settings the area weighted averaging method was used to quantify the overall et in the osub installed with and without lid the lid area includes a variety of lid facilities bioretention vegetated swale and permeable concrete pavement as well as the traditional underlying surfaces traditional garden traditional lawn and impermeable brick pavement etc four scenarios were designed 1 current control area scenario 100 impermeable scenario in this scenario the lid area is all covered with the impermeable pavement fig 4 a 2 lid area with all current lid facilities replaced by their corresponding traditional underlying surfaces 0 lid scenario in this scenario the permeable pavement is replaced by the impermeable pavement the vegetated swale is replaced by the traditional lawn and the bioretention is replaced by the traditional garden fig 4b 3 current lid area scenario 51 lid scenario fig 4c 4 lid area with all current traditional underlying surfaces replaced by their corresponding lid facilities 100 lid scenario in this scenario the impermeable pavement is replaced by the permeable pavement the traditional lawn is replaced by the vegetated swale and the traditional garden is replaced by the bioretention fig 4d 3 results 3 1 hourly et of lid facilities and traditional underlying surfaces firstly the hourly et of each type of lid facilities and traditional underlying surfaces in the osubs during both wet and dry season were investigated the measured wind speed in the study area was as low as 0 36 0 16 m s and 0 49 0 33 m s during the wet season and the dry season respectively which could be classified as calm wind 0 56 m s therefore the wind field in this study has little effect on et fig 5 a shows average hourly et and its standard deviation of each underlying surface in the wet season the et rate of the three lid facilities decreases in the order of bioretention vegetated swale permeable pavement the average hourly et of bioretention with different plants ranges from 0 18 mm h to 0 25 mm h while the average hourly et of vegetated swale and permeable pavement is 0 13 mm h and 0 01 mm h respectively the et of different plants in the same bioretention is different the et rate of br p 0 25 mm h is significantly higher than that of br c 0 20 mm h the possible reason is that compared with c indica p purpureum grows faster has more developed roots and consumes more water zou et al 2011 furthermore the et rate of lid facilities is higher than that of corresponding traditional underlying surfaces for example the et rate of br h 0 18 mm h is significantly higher than that of tg h 0 13 mm h the et rate of vs z 0 13 mm h is 18 higher than that of tl z 0 11 mm h while the evaporation rate of pcp 0 0126 mm h is 250 higher than that of ibp 0 0036 mm h and 186 higher than that of iap 0 0044 mm h fig 5b shows average hourly et and its standard deviation of each underlying surface in the dry season the evaporation rate of pavements is usually too low 0 01 mm d to observe due to shortage of moisture in their surface layer thus only et rates of vegetated underlying surfaces were compared in this study the average hourly et of br p is significantly higher than that of vs z however the et of bioretention with other two plants are not significantly different from that of vegetated swale furthermore there is no significant difference in the et rate of br h and tg h the et rate of vs z 0 041 mm h is higher than that of tl z 0 029 mm h but the difference is not significant in addition compared to the wet season the average hourly et of vegetated lid facilities decreases by 76 in the dry season 0 04 mm h 3 2 effect of lid facilities on diurnal variation of et secondly the effect of lid facilities on diurnal et variation was analyzed by calculating the differences between lid facilities and corresponding traditional underlying surfaces in the study area three pairs of comparisons were investigated including bioretention br h versus traditional garden tg h vegetated swale vs z versus traditional lawn tl z and permeable pavement pcp versus impermeable pavement ibp as shown in fig 6 a the average hourly et of br h increases from 0 09 mm h at 8 00 reaches its maximum value of 0 17 mm h at 11 00 then declines and reaches 0 at 18 00 from 8 00 to 11 00 the et rate of br h increases with the increase of solar radiation intensity however although the solar radiation intensity continues to rise after 11 00 the corresponding et rate begins to decrease this is because the facility s frequency of being in the building shadow rapidly increases after 11 00 the average difference of the hourly et between the bioretention and the traditional garden increases from 0 03 mm h at 8 00 reaches its maximum value of 0 12 mm h at 11 00 then declines and reaches 0 at 17 00 the average difference is larger when the solar radiation intensity is higher and the frequency at which the facility is in the building shadow is lower it should be noted that sometimes the et difference between the bioretention and the traditional garden is negative indicating that et of the traditional garden is higher than that of the bioretention this may be due to the difference of microclimate parameters such as wind speed temperature and humidity at different measuring points at some time as shown in fig 6b the average hourly et of vs z increases from 0 06 mm h at 8 00 reaches its maximum value of 0 37 mm h at 10 00 then declines and reaches 0 at 18 00 from 8 00 to 10 00 the et rate of vs z increases with the increase of solar radiation intensity however although the solar radiation intensity continues to rise after 10 00 the corresponding et rate begins to decrease this is because the facility s frequency of being in the building shadow increases after 10 00 the average difference of the hourly et between the vegetated swale and the traditional lawn increases from 0 01 mm h at 8 00 reaches it maximum value of 0 05 mm h at 10 00 then declines and reaches 0 at 18 00 the average difference is larger when the solar radiation intensity is higher and the frequency at which the facility is in the shadow is lower as shown in fig 6c the average hourly evaporation of pcp increases from 0 01 mm h at 8 00 and reaches its maximum value of 0 05 mm h at 10 00 then declines and reaches 0 at 13 00 from 8 00 to 10 00 the evaporation rate of pcp increases with the increase of solar radiation intensity however although the solar radiation intensity continues to rise after 10 00 and the facility s frequency of being in the building shadow keeps low the corresponding evaporation rate begins to decrease this is because the moisture inside the pavement is being depleted quickly since the sunrise thus even as solar radiation continues to increase there is no water left to evaporate for pcp the evaporation rate of ibp reduces to 0 since 11 00 while the evaporation rate of pcp reduces to 0 since 13 00 the evaporation of pcp lasts 2 h longer than that of ibp the average difference is larger when the solar radiation intensity is higher and the frequency at which the facility is in the building shadow is lower as well as there is moisture inside the facility in the morning as can be seen from the above analysis in general lid facilities have an effect on increasing et in the osub however this et effect changes over time and is particularly influenced by the building shadow in the osub fig 7 was obtained by dividing hourly et of each pair of comparison into with and without shadow categories as shown in fig 7a the average et difference between the bioretention br h and the traditional garden tg h without shadow is 0 06 mm h comparatively the average et difference under shadow decreases by 50 as shown in fig 7b the average et difference between the vegetated swale vs z and the traditional lawn tl z without shadow is 0 03 mm h comparatively the average et difference under shadow decreases by 67 as shown in fig 7c the average evaporation difference between pcp and ibp without shadow is 0 04 mm h comparatively the average evaporation difference under shadow decreases by 80 from the above analysis it can be seen that the effect of lid on et in the osub is greatly influenced by the building shadow and the et increase due to lid under shadow is much lower than that without shadow 3 3 effect of lid facilities on et variation after rain lid facilities are usually designed to store more water during rain which can enhance et after rainfall event in this section the et increase due to lid after rain was further investigated by comparing the et of lid facilities and the corresponding traditional underlying surfaces in the days after rainfall events fig 8 a shows et variation of the bioretention br h and the traditional garden tg h after rain the et rate of bioretention has no downward trend within 7 days after rain and its fluctuation is mainly affected by the intensity of solar radiation however the et rate of the traditional garden shows a downward trend after 4 days no downward trend of et rate indicates that the water in the bioretention cell is sufficient and that et of vegetation in the bioretention cell is not restricted by water availability the et rate of bioretention would be expected to decrease when rainwater stored in the bioretention is depleted after a longer period of time the average hourly et of the bioretention is higher than that of the traditional garden the average et difference between the bioretention and the traditional garden is around 0 03 mm h 0 05 mm h and 0 07 mm h in the first 2 days 3 5 days and 6 7 days respectively after rain therefore the et difference increases with time in 7 days after rain this indicates that the bioretention can maintain at a higher et rate for a longer period after rain than the traditional garden fig 8b shows et variation of the vegetated swale vs z and the traditional lawn tl z after rain the et rate of vegetated swale changes mainly with the intensity of solar radiation the average hourly et of the swale is higher than that of the traditional lawn the average et difference between the swale and the traditional lawn is around 0 01 mm h 0 02 mm h and 0 05 mm h in the first 2 days 3 5 days and 6 days respectively after rain therefore the et difference increases with time in 6 days after rain this indicates that vegetated swale can maintain at a higher et rate for a longer period after rain than the traditional lawn fig 8c shows evaporation variation of pcp and ibp after rain unlike vegetated lid facilities the evaporation of pcp is dominated by moisture available inside the facility the average hourly evaporation of pcp is higher than that of ibp the average evaporation difference between pcp and ibp is around 0 01 mm h 0 005 mm h and 0 001 mm h in the first 2 days 3 5 days and 6 7 days respectively after rain therefore the evaporation difference decreases with time in 7 days after rain this is because the moisture inside the pavement is evaporated quickly in a short time after rain this indicates that pcp can maintain at a higher evaporation rate than ibp only for a short period of time after rain 3 4 overall et in an osub installed with and without lid fig 9 shows average daily et of different scenarios in the wet and dry season for current control area scenario average daily et is 0 05 mm d and 0 in the wet season and dry season respectively for 0 lid scenario average daily et is 0 43 mm d and 0 11 mm d in the wet and dry season respectively et rate of 0 lid scenario is 10 times higher than that for control scenario in the wet season for 51 lid scenario average daily et is 0 55 mm d and 0 13 mm d in the wet and dry season respectively for 100 lid scenario average daily et is 0 65 mm d and 0 14 mm d in the wet and dry season respectively in the wet season et rate of 51 lid scenario and 100 lid scenario is 28 and 51 higher than that of 0 lid scenario respectively in the dry season et rate of 51 lid scenario and 100 lid scenario is 18 and 27 higher than that of 0 lid scenario statistical analysis showed that in the wet season 100 lid scenario can significantly increase et compared with 0 lid scenario one way anova p 0 001 in the dry season the et of 100 lid scenario is still higher than that of 0 lid scenario but the difference is not significant one way anova p 0 069 4 discussion 4 1 et variation of lid facilities in this study the average daily et of vegetated lid facilities varies between 1 61 and 2 95 mm d the finding is consistent with the result of a previous study carried out by hickman et al 2011 that the average daily et from a bioinfiltration lysimeter in august and september was 1 93 and 1 17 mm d respectively however the daily et measured in this study is much lower than that measured by denich and bradford 2010 from a bioretention in canada the difference may be due to different climatic meteorological conditions or facility structures ebrahimian et al 2019 which is further discussed in 4 2 in this study the et rate of the three lid facilities decreases in the order of bioretention vegetated swale permeable pavement which is mainly affected by type of vegetation and moisture inside the facilities the et rates of vegetated lid facilities are higher than that of pavement because more water is retained in the substrate of vegetated lid facilities during rainfall the reason why et from bioretention is higher than that from vegetated swale is that they have different plant types and structures the plant type in the bioretention and swale is shrub and grass respectively in general shrubs consume more water through transpiration than grasses pockman and small 2010 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b in addition bioretention can retain more water than vegetated swale after rainfall because of its deeper storage depth the differences of et rates between lid and traditional land covers depend on the seasonal or meteorological factors in the wet season the et rates of lid facilities are much higher than those of traditional land covers however the difference between them is much less in the dry season in this study lid facilities maintain higher et rates in the days following precipitation events this is due to not only the facilities receiving greater volumes of water per footprint area but also the structure in the facilities for example lid facilities are usually designed to receive surrounding rainfall runoff and they may be designed to store more runoff by installing a storage layer beneath the soil layer in addition vegetated lid facilities can maintain at a relatively high et rate for a longer period after rain than non vegetated lid facilities this is because rainwater can be retained in a gravel layer installed at the bottom of vegetated lid facilities e g br h during rainfall which can replenish the upper soil layer with water and leads to the slow decline of soil water content during dry periods after rain take br h as an example the soil water content of the bioretention cell only decreases from 17 81 to 16 93 in 7 days after rain while the moisture inside non vegetated lid facilities e g pcp is depleted quickly in a short time after rain under the hot urban environment this finding suggests that vegetated lid facilities are more useful than non vegetated lid facilities in increasing urban et and alleviating uhi effects 4 2 influence factors of et from lid facilities et from lid facilities may be affected by many factors including solar radiation intensity substrate moisture plant type and its growth status etc ebrahimian et al 2019 hess et al 2017 payne et al 2018 the higher the solar radiation the more water consuming plant type the more flourishing the plant growth and the more abundant the substrate water the higher et from a lid facility will be for example the lid facility with higher field water holding capacity of soil substrate or with an additional storage layer beneath the soil layer can retain more runoff and possibly has a higher et in this study the vegetation coverage in the bioretention was approximately 100 however in many cases bioretention facilities do not contain vegetation as robust as this study generally the et of bioretention with sparse vegetation would be less than that of bioretention with dense vegetation while in some cases such as when photosynthesis transpiration is low the sparse vegetation facility might have greater et nicholls and carey 2021 ma et al 2019 in particular et from an osub is affected by the building shadow thus the spatial layout of urban buildings such as building orientation aspect ratio height width spacing etc has an important influence on the et of an osub morakinyo et al 2017 in addition the layout of lid facilities in an osub also has potential impacts to et for example the lid facilities designed to receive greater volumes of water per footprint area can maintain higher et rates in the days following precipitation events the runoff from impermeable pavement may flow into the swale or rain garden rainwater may infiltrate into the permeable pavement and flow into the swale or rain garden through the drainage pipes below the pavement generally if lid facilities are linked together the lid facilities upstream may affect the lid facilities downstream as the runoff generated upstream flows into the downstream facilities during rainfall thus lid facilities downstream tend to have higher et the study area belongs to the southern subtropical monsoon climate with high temperature average temperature 23 c and abundant rainfall annual rainfall 1935 mm the et of lid facilities in other areas with smaller rainfall and lower temperature would be less than the estimated et of this study in addition in shenzhen it rains frequently during the wet season but rarely in the dry season therefore et measurement in the wet season was taken usually following rainfall events while et measurement in the dry season was not the measurement arrangement could have impacts on the comparisons of wet and dry season et if et measurement in the dry season could be conducted after rainfall the measured et could be higher than the result obtained in this study among all meteorological factors the solar radiation intensity and the drying period after rain which impact the moisture inside the facilities are the dominant factors affecting the et increase due to lid the et of lid facilities might also be affected by lid structure drainage area soil type depth to water table and other factors the effects of the factors have not been fully discussed in this study and would be included in our next study 4 3 urban or catchment scale implications quantifying et rates of lid facilities and traditional underlying surfaces in a highly heterogeneous environment has important implications for the assessment of urban or catchment et taking shenzhen as an example when an osub is installed with 0 lid 50 lid and 100 lid its annual et 183 days in wet season and 182 days in dry season is 98 7 126 1 and 146 3 mm respectively according to the remote sensing extraction of underlying surface in shenzhen the osub excluding roof accounts for about 24 of the built up area if all the osubs choose 100 lid instead of 0 lid there would be an expected increase of annual et of 11 4 mm in the built up area of shenzhen it should be noted that when extrapolating the site scale study to larger scales generally the influence factors discussed in 4 2 should be considered including climatic meteorological conditions soil media water applied received vegetative cover as well as layout of buildings and lid facilities 4 4 limitations of this study the 3t model does not directly account for the impact of aerodynamics in this study the wind speed is small and has little influence on et so the estimation of et by 3t model is considered reasonable however further experimental studies are needed to confirm the applicability of the 3t model under the condition of high wind speed in this study et from typical lid facilities is measured by using the 3t model combined with a portable thermal infrared imager and then the overall et in the osub is estimated by the area weighted averaging method the method is based on the assumption that et of the same type of lid facilities at different locations is consistent however due to the different external e g microclimate or internal e g structure conditions at different locations even if the lid facilities are of the same type their et may vary thus the method used in this paper is not suitable for the study area with highly heterogeneous environmental conditions in order to further consider the spatial heterogeneity of lid facilities and environmental conditions it is recommended to use unmanned aerial vehicle uav equipped with thermal imager to obtain thermal parameters with high spatial resolution before applying the 3t model in addition in this study the external environmental conditions in the control area are assumed to be similar to those in the lid area and thus the increase of et in the osub caused by lid can be estimated by subtracting et in the control area from et in the lid area however comparing with the lid area the control area is more closed i e surrounded by buildings and has more unfavorable aerodynamic conditions for et therefore the increase of et in the osub caused by lid might be slightly overestimated in this study it should be noted that the quantitative discussions in this case study are site specific in order to investigate et at a watershed scale it is necessary to classify osubs according to their external or internal factors and then measure et from each type of osubs furthermore it is necessary to develop a mathematical model for simulating et of osubs which might consider the effect of various external conditions and internal structures of lid implementation combined with a watershed hydrological model the model might be used to further analyze the effect of lid facilities on et at a watershed scale 5 conclusions in this study the effects of lid on et in an osub in shenzhen were investigated by using the 3t model combined with a thermal infrared imager the main results obtained are summarized below 1 in the wet season lid facilities have higher et rates than traditional underlying surfaces e g garden lawn and impermeable pavement the et rate of the three investigated lid facilities decreases in the order of bioretention vegetated swale permeable pavement however in the dry season the et rate of vegetated lid facilities is much lower around 70 lower in this study than that in the wet season and there is no significant difference in et between lid facilities and traditional underlying surfaces 2 the diurnal variation of et in the osub is greatly affected by solar radiation intensity building shadow and moisture inside the lid facilities the higher solar radiation intensity and the lower frequency at which the lid facilities are in the shadow of buildings the higher et increase by lid in addition only when there is moisture inside the permeable pavement the evaporation of the permeable pavement is higher than that of the impervious pavement 3 the vegetated lid facilities can maintain at a higher et rate for a longer period after rain than the non vegetated lid facilities indicating that vegetated lid facilities are more useful than non vegetated lid facilities in increasing et and alleviating uhi effects 4 when the proportion of lid in osubs increases from 0 to 50 and 100 the et rate of osubs increases by 28 and 51 respectively and the annual et of built up areas in shenzhen increases by 6 58 mm and 11 41 mm respectively indicating that lid facilities can moderate et at watershed scale however the effects of soil media vegetative cover lid facility structure local climate and building shadow on the et of osubs should be considered for extrapolating the site scale study to urban or catchment scale this study provides insights into the effect of lid on et in an osub under moist sub tropical weather condition in further study the method applied in this paper can be used to investigate the effects of lid on et in various urban environments with different lid implementations and under different climatic zones in addition this study focuses on site scale et in further study the scale up method should be developed to study the influence of lid on the watershed scale credit authorship contribution statement yuanyan zhang conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis writing

3481,low impact development lid facilities have been regarded to have important regulatory effects on urban evapotranspiration et however due to the influences of heterogeneity of underlying surfaces or facilities solar radiation building shading and rainfall conditions the et variations in outdoor space of urban buildings osub with various lid facilities are complex and have not been reported in this paper a three temperature model so called 3t model combining with a portable thermal infrared imaging sensor was used to in situ measure the et rates of different lid facilities and traditional underlying surfaces of an osub in 2019 in shenzhen china specifically the seasonal daily and diurnal variations of et in the osub and their influencing factors were investigated the results indicate that 1 the lid facilities have higher et rates than the traditional surfaces in wet seasons the et rates of bioretention br h vegetated swale vs z and permeable concrete pavement pcp are 38 18 and 250 higher than those of traditional garden tg h lawn tl z and impermeable brick pavement ibp respectively in this study 2 the diurnal variation of et is greatly affected by solar radiation intensity building shadow and moisture inside the lid facilities and the et increase by lid is higher in the osub with higher solar radiation and no shadow 3 vegetated lid facilities e g br h and vs z can maintain at a relatively high et rate for a longer period after rain than the non vegetated lid facilities e g pcp indicating a stronger ability to increase urban et 4 when the proportion of lid in osubs increases from 0 to 50 and 100 the et rate of osubs increases by 28 and 51 respectively and the annual et of built up areas in shenzhen increases by 6 58 mm and 11 41 mm respectively the effects of soil media vegetative cover lid facility structure local climate and building shadow on the et of osubs should be considered for extrapolating the site scale study to urban or catchment scale keywords evapotranspiration low impact development three temperature model infrared remote sensing outdoor space of urban buildings 1 introduction evapotranspiration et plays important roles not only in regulating the urban hydrological cycle but also in alleviating the urban heat island uhi effect marasco et al 2014 tian et al 2014 xiong et al 2015 however et is greatly reduced in urban areas where the natural underlying surfaces are constantly replaced by the impervious surfaces such as buildings roads and squares van mechelen et al 2015 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b vijayaraghavan 2016 low impact development lid has been proposed to restore the urban hydrological process to the pre development status ahiablame et al 2012 eckart et al 2017 the lid facilities including green roofs bioretentions permeable pavements etc are designed to store or infiltrate water at source during rainfall instead of draining it rapidly dietz 2007 eckart et al 2017 the facilities have the ability to increase urban et and thus moderate the urban hydrological cycle and mitigate the uhi effect feng et al 2016 the outdoor space of urban buildings osub is one of the main places for residents daily outdoor activities et significantly affects the microclimate and human comfort in an osub at the same time this space is also one of the main places for lid implementation therefore there is a need to understand the influence of lid on et in an osub however in situ measurement of et from different underlying surfaces in an osub is rather difficult an osub is usually composed of various underlying surfaces e g pavement garden lawn and et of different underlying surfaces varies greatly with the introduction of lid facilities the types of underlying surfaces are further increased resulting in higher spatial heterogeneity of et in an osub these features pose great difficulties for traditional et estimation methods in addition et is not only affected by solar radiation and air temperature but also affected by building shadow and antecedent rainfall conditions feng et al 2014 poë et al 2015 shadow can affect et by changing the path of near ground radiation feng et al 2014 which is especially common in urban environment the introduction of lid facilities may increase the moisture of underlying surfaces after rain thus affecting et in an osub li et al 2019 therefore there is a need to understand the heterogeneity and variations of et from different underlying surfaces and lid facilities once the increase in et in specific lid facilities as compared to traditional types of land covers is known the hydrological regulation effect of lid on osubs can be further evaluated by using an area weighted approach furthermore the effect of lid on et at a city or catchment scale can be evaluated by using some up scale methods actual et of lid facilities has been investigated by laboratory experiments with installing samples in reduced size many previous studies focused on the et of green roofs and permeable pavement materials brown and borst 2015 syrrakou et al 2014 the methods used to estimate et in these studies can be mainly divided into two categories one is the weighing method load cells or mass balances and the other is the measurement of the change of water content cascone et al 2019 tziampou et al 2020 weighing method has been applied to quantify et rates of permeable pavements and green roofs chen et al 2019 li et al 2014 liu et al 2018 ouldboukhitine et al 2014 poë et al 2015 yilmaz et al 2016 used four water content probes to estimate volumetric water content inside the growing media of green roofs and calculate actual et based on daily water balance actual et of lid facilities has also been measured in situ in some previous studies the methods used in these studies included water balance method weighing lysimeter eddy covariance method etc cascone et al 2019 heusinger and weber 2016 tziampou et al 2020 water balance method has been used to quantify evaporation from permeable pavements brown and borst 2015 weighing lysimeter has been applied to quantify et from green roofs and rain gardens denich and bradford 2010 feng et al 2018 hess et al 2017 eddy covariance method has been used to observe et of green roofs heusinger and weber 2016 in addition to these traditional et observation methods werner 2000 developed a device called tunnel verdunstungsmesser tuv to measure the actual et from vegetated and non vegetated areas in field conditions the method has been used to measure evaporation from urban pavements lal et al 2017 starke et al 2010 wang et al 2019 jerjen et al 2015 although the methods mentioned above can be used to observe et of lid facilities under real environmental conditions they all have their own limitations fisher et al 2011 marasco et al 2014 tziampou et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 so far there is a lack of evaluation of the effects of lid on et in osubs based on in situ measurements the three temperature model 3t model is an et measurement method based on energy balance qiu et al 1996 qiu et al 1998 by introducing a reference leaf or reference soil the model eliminates parameters such as aerodynamic resistance that are difficult to estimate in traditional models parameters in this model only include temperatures net radiations and heat fluxes unlike other radiation or temperature based et estimation method such as hargreaves and priestley taylor models the 3t model does not include empirical parameters required under the assumption that the underlying surface is sufficiently moist or free from moisture limitation thus 3t model considers the energy exchange process of water and it is applicable to estimate actual et under not only the condition of energy limitation but also the condition of water limitation the 3t model has been successfully applied to measure actual et of various types of underlying surfaces such as bare soil grassland shrub and forests qiu et al 2015 qiu et al 2017 qiu and zhao 2010 tian et al 2014 voortman et al 2016 xiong and qiu 2014 xiong et al 2019 zou et al 2019 in a previous study we examined the accuracy of the 3t model on the et observation of vegetated and non vegetated lid facilities zhang et al 2020 validation results show that the 3t model has the ability to measure variations of et of lid facilities because the 3t model is simple to use high spatial resolution and portable it is especially suitable for in situ observation of et of lid facilities therefore the 3t model provides a potential method for evaluating the effect of lid on et in osubs based on in situ measurement however the 3t model has not been used to estimate the et variations in a real osub which are greatly affected by heterogeneity of underlying surfaces or lid facilities solar radiation intensity building shading and rainfall conditions this study aims to investigate the effects of lid on et in an osub by using the 3t model combined with a thermal infrared imager more explicitly the objectives are to 1 compare et of lid facilities and traditional underlying surfaces 2 investigate the effect of lid facilities on diurnal et and its variation with building shadow 3 investigate the effect of lid facilities on et variation after rain and 4 evaluate the effect of lid on the overall et in the osub 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in a community in shenzhen china 22 38 6 n 113 57 14 e the community consists of three side by side 6 storey buildings which covers an area of 11250 m2 fig 1 there are two outdoor spaces between the three buildings one osub is fully covered with impermeable asphalt pavement control area for short the other osub is a low impact development demonstration area lid area for short in which lid facilities e g bioretention vegetated swale and permeable concrete pavement are installed the lid area also retains some traditional underlying surfaces such as traditional garden traditional lawn and impermeable brick pavement fig 1 there are two types of bioretention in the lid area one is the sunken bioretention that mainly receives the rainfall runoff from surrounding permeable pavement fig 2 a the other is the elevated bioretention which is installed 1 m above the ground to mainly receive the rainfall runoff from building roofs fig 2b both the sunken bioretention and the elevated bioretention are composed of vegetation layer soil layer geotextile and gravel layer the sunken bioretention is planted with pennisetum purpureum br p and canna indica br c while the elevated bioretention is planted with hibiscus rosa sinensis br h the traditional garden is mainly covered by hibiscus rosa sinensis tr h fig 2c and the traditional lawn is mainly covered by zoysia tenuifolia tl z fig 2d the vegetated swale consists of vegetation layer planted with zoysia tenuifolia vs z soil layer 30 cm geotextile and gravel layer 30 cm fig 2e the impermeable brick pavement ibp consists of surface layer 6 cm and subgrade fig 2f in the control area the impermeable asphalt pavement iap consists of surface layer 3 cm and subgrade fig 2g the permeable concrete pavement pcp consists of surface layer 15 cm subbase layer 15 cm geotextile and subgrade fig 2h the surface layer is permeable concrete with porosity of 15 25 the subbase layer is filled with graded broken stones the areas of different types of underlying surfaces in lid area and control area are shown in table 1 2 2 3t model and infrared remote sensing method the 3t model proposed by qiu et al 1996 1998 can be expressed as follows 1 le s r n s g s r n sd g sd t s t a t sd t a for soil 2 le v r n v r n vd t v t a t vd t a for vegetation where le s le v is the latent heat flux for soil and vegetation w m 2 respectively l is the latent heat of vaporization 2 42 106 w m 2 mm 1 e s e v is the evapotranspiration mm for soil and vegetation respectively r n s r n s d r n v and r n v d are the net radiations of soil surface reference dry soil surface leaf surface and reference dry leaf surface w m 2 respectively g s and g sd are the heat fluxes of soil and reference dry soil w m 2 respectively ts tsd t v and t vd are the surface temperatures of soil reference dry soil leaf and reference dry leaf k respectively ta is air temperature k in this study equation 1 was used to calculate et of pavements while equation 2 was used to calculate et of vegetated underlying surfaces zhang et al 2020 in this study a color photo of plant leaves was used to represent the imitation dry leaf of the vegetated underlying surface during the observation the imitation dry leaf is placed next to the observation leaves to ensure that their surrounding meteorological conditions are consistent a piece of pavement was selected as the reference dry pavement which was covered by waterproof plastic film to keep it dry during rainfall event and was remained uncovered during the subsequent drying period zhang et al 2020 the 3t model does not directly account for the impact of wind field however aerodynamic resistance which is highly related with wind speed is included in the energy balance equation used for derivation of 3t model qiu et al 1996 1998 zhou et al 2014 it can be seen that the input parameters of the 3t model only include net radiations soil heat fluxes air temperature and surface temperature net radiations and temperatures can be directly measured and the soil heat fluxes can be directly extracted from the net radiations tian et al 2014 by using a thermal infrared imager to obtain surfaces temperatures and by using a net radiometer to obtain net radiations the 3t model becomes portable and suitable for et observation in situ in addition the 3t model has high spatial resolution and can distinguish et of different underlying surfaces in a highly heterogeneous environment 2 3 data collection and processing to apply the three temperature model and thermal infrared imaging technique to measure actual et of different underlying surfaces the following parameters need to be measured in this study the surface temperatures were measured with an infrared thermal imager fluke ir flexcam ti55 fluck crop usa the measuring wave length of the thermal camera is 8 14 μm and its resolution is 0 05 c each thermal infrared image contains 76 800 320 240 temperature data points before the experiment the thermal imager was calibrated against a blackbody temperature the images were taken every hour in triplicate from 8 30 to 17 30 on each day net radiation was measured by a one component net radiometer nr lite2 kipp zonen b v netherlands with an accuracy of 10 µv w m2 air temperature data was collected by an automatic temperature and humidity sensor hobo u23 001 onset computer crop usa with an accuracy of 0 2 c at an interval of 10 min at a height of 2 m above ground surface the heat flux of pavement was estimated as a proportion of net radiation g s λ r n s qiu et al 2006 we obtain the ratio λ for each pavement by observing the net radiation and heat flux using pilot devices the ratio for permeable concrete pavement and its reference system was 0 10 and 0 14 respectively the ratios for impermeable brick and its reference system were both 0 16 and the ratios for impermeable asphalt and its reference system were both 0 26 during et observation periods we measured the wind speed with an anemometer installed 2 m above ground in the lid area hourly actual et of each type of underlying surfaces was measured in the wet season july 25 27 august 5 15 and august 20 24 2019 and the dry season december 11 17 2019 in the wet season measurements were conducted for 3 7 consecutive days after four rainfall periods with rainfall 10 4 89 4 mm in the first three days before experiments around 200 h of et data for br p br c br h tg h vs z and tl z were obtained while around 70 h of et data for pcp ibp and iap were obtained in shenzhen the average antecedent drying period adp during wet seasons is about 3 days and weather conditions with adp greater than 7 days in wet seasons are very rare thus only et variations within up to 7 days after rain were measured in the dry season measurements were conducted after a long dry period more than 30 days 69 h of et data for br p br c br h tg h vs z and tl z were obtained negative values of et data estimated by the 3t model were excluded and pauta criterion 3δ criterion shen et al 2017 was used to filter out abnormal et data estimated by the 3t model in addition due to the influence of building shadow distribution under the sunlight the et data at different monitoring points in the osubs may correspond to inconsistent shadow conditions at some time the data with inconsistent shadow conditions was deleted to ensure data comparability which accounts for around 12 of the total data one way anova lsd was used to compare the hourly et of lid facilities and traditional underlying surfaces and indicate the significant differences p 0 05 2 4 model validation we have validated the 3t model by comparing the et from pilot lid facilities measured by 3t model with that measured by weighing platform in our previously published paper zhang et al 2020 the results show that the coefficient determinants r2 between et measured by 3t model and weighing platform are larger than 0 6 and the slopes of regression equations are close to 1 and their intercepts are close to 0 thus 3t model can accurately quantify et rate of the lid facilities to further validate the et rates in this study we compared the et rates estimated by 3t model with those estimated by a soil water balance method we measured the soil moisture at three points around 0 1 m below the surface of a sunken bioretention and a vegetated swale at one day intervals by using soil moisture sensor sm300 delta t uk on july 25 27 and august 5 15 2019 the daily et of each lid facility was approximately estimated by the daily decrease of averaged soil moisture in the facility the non parametric test man whitney u test was used to verify the difference between the et rates estimated by 3t model and soil water balance method the results show that there is no significant difference at p 0 05 in daily et estimated by the two method fig 3 although there are limitations in using water balance method to calculate et marasco et al 2014 the validation results show et estimated by the 3t model was comparable to that estimated by the water balance method 2 5 scenario settings the area weighted averaging method was used to quantify the overall et in the osub installed with and without lid the lid area includes a variety of lid facilities bioretention vegetated swale and permeable concrete pavement as well as the traditional underlying surfaces traditional garden traditional lawn and impermeable brick pavement etc four scenarios were designed 1 current control area scenario 100 impermeable scenario in this scenario the lid area is all covered with the impermeable pavement fig 4 a 2 lid area with all current lid facilities replaced by their corresponding traditional underlying surfaces 0 lid scenario in this scenario the permeable pavement is replaced by the impermeable pavement the vegetated swale is replaced by the traditional lawn and the bioretention is replaced by the traditional garden fig 4b 3 current lid area scenario 51 lid scenario fig 4c 4 lid area with all current traditional underlying surfaces replaced by their corresponding lid facilities 100 lid scenario in this scenario the impermeable pavement is replaced by the permeable pavement the traditional lawn is replaced by the vegetated swale and the traditional garden is replaced by the bioretention fig 4d 3 results 3 1 hourly et of lid facilities and traditional underlying surfaces firstly the hourly et of each type of lid facilities and traditional underlying surfaces in the osubs during both wet and dry season were investigated the measured wind speed in the study area was as low as 0 36 0 16 m s and 0 49 0 33 m s during the wet season and the dry season respectively which could be classified as calm wind 0 56 m s therefore the wind field in this study has little effect on et fig 5 a shows average hourly et and its standard deviation of each underlying surface in the wet season the et rate of the three lid facilities decreases in the order of bioretention vegetated swale permeable pavement the average hourly et of bioretention with different plants ranges from 0 18 mm h to 0 25 mm h while the average hourly et of vegetated swale and permeable pavement is 0 13 mm h and 0 01 mm h respectively the et of different plants in the same bioretention is different the et rate of br p 0 25 mm h is significantly higher than that of br c 0 20 mm h the possible reason is that compared with c indica p purpureum grows faster has more developed roots and consumes more water zou et al 2011 furthermore the et rate of lid facilities is higher than that of corresponding traditional underlying surfaces for example the et rate of br h 0 18 mm h is significantly higher than that of tg h 0 13 mm h the et rate of vs z 0 13 mm h is 18 higher than that of tl z 0 11 mm h while the evaporation rate of pcp 0 0126 mm h is 250 higher than that of ibp 0 0036 mm h and 186 higher than that of iap 0 0044 mm h fig 5b shows average hourly et and its standard deviation of each underlying surface in the dry season the evaporation rate of pavements is usually too low 0 01 mm d to observe due to shortage of moisture in their surface layer thus only et rates of vegetated underlying surfaces were compared in this study the average hourly et of br p is significantly higher than that of vs z however the et of bioretention with other two plants are not significantly different from that of vegetated swale furthermore there is no significant difference in the et rate of br h and tg h the et rate of vs z 0 041 mm h is higher than that of tl z 0 029 mm h but the difference is not significant in addition compared to the wet season the average hourly et of vegetated lid facilities decreases by 76 in the dry season 0 04 mm h 3 2 effect of lid facilities on diurnal variation of et secondly the effect of lid facilities on diurnal et variation was analyzed by calculating the differences between lid facilities and corresponding traditional underlying surfaces in the study area three pairs of comparisons were investigated including bioretention br h versus traditional garden tg h vegetated swale vs z versus traditional lawn tl z and permeable pavement pcp versus impermeable pavement ibp as shown in fig 6 a the average hourly et of br h increases from 0 09 mm h at 8 00 reaches its maximum value of 0 17 mm h at 11 00 then declines and reaches 0 at 18 00 from 8 00 to 11 00 the et rate of br h increases with the increase of solar radiation intensity however although the solar radiation intensity continues to rise after 11 00 the corresponding et rate begins to decrease this is because the facility s frequency of being in the building shadow rapidly increases after 11 00 the average difference of the hourly et between the bioretention and the traditional garden increases from 0 03 mm h at 8 00 reaches its maximum value of 0 12 mm h at 11 00 then declines and reaches 0 at 17 00 the average difference is larger when the solar radiation intensity is higher and the frequency at which the facility is in the building shadow is lower it should be noted that sometimes the et difference between the bioretention and the traditional garden is negative indicating that et of the traditional garden is higher than that of the bioretention this may be due to the difference of microclimate parameters such as wind speed temperature and humidity at different measuring points at some time as shown in fig 6b the average hourly et of vs z increases from 0 06 mm h at 8 00 reaches its maximum value of 0 37 mm h at 10 00 then declines and reaches 0 at 18 00 from 8 00 to 10 00 the et rate of vs z increases with the increase of solar radiation intensity however although the solar radiation intensity continues to rise after 10 00 the corresponding et rate begins to decrease this is because the facility s frequency of being in the building shadow increases after 10 00 the average difference of the hourly et between the vegetated swale and the traditional lawn increases from 0 01 mm h at 8 00 reaches it maximum value of 0 05 mm h at 10 00 then declines and reaches 0 at 18 00 the average difference is larger when the solar radiation intensity is higher and the frequency at which the facility is in the shadow is lower as shown in fig 6c the average hourly evaporation of pcp increases from 0 01 mm h at 8 00 and reaches its maximum value of 0 05 mm h at 10 00 then declines and reaches 0 at 13 00 from 8 00 to 10 00 the evaporation rate of pcp increases with the increase of solar radiation intensity however although the solar radiation intensity continues to rise after 10 00 and the facility s frequency of being in the building shadow keeps low the corresponding evaporation rate begins to decrease this is because the moisture inside the pavement is being depleted quickly since the sunrise thus even as solar radiation continues to increase there is no water left to evaporate for pcp the evaporation rate of ibp reduces to 0 since 11 00 while the evaporation rate of pcp reduces to 0 since 13 00 the evaporation of pcp lasts 2 h longer than that of ibp the average difference is larger when the solar radiation intensity is higher and the frequency at which the facility is in the building shadow is lower as well as there is moisture inside the facility in the morning as can be seen from the above analysis in general lid facilities have an effect on increasing et in the osub however this et effect changes over time and is particularly influenced by the building shadow in the osub fig 7 was obtained by dividing hourly et of each pair of comparison into with and without shadow categories as shown in fig 7a the average et difference between the bioretention br h and the traditional garden tg h without shadow is 0 06 mm h comparatively the average et difference under shadow decreases by 50 as shown in fig 7b the average et difference between the vegetated swale vs z and the traditional lawn tl z without shadow is 0 03 mm h comparatively the average et difference under shadow decreases by 67 as shown in fig 7c the average evaporation difference between pcp and ibp without shadow is 0 04 mm h comparatively the average evaporation difference under shadow decreases by 80 from the above analysis it can be seen that the effect of lid on et in the osub is greatly influenced by the building shadow and the et increase due to lid under shadow is much lower than that without shadow 3 3 effect of lid facilities on et variation after rain lid facilities are usually designed to store more water during rain which can enhance et after rainfall event in this section the et increase due to lid after rain was further investigated by comparing the et of lid facilities and the corresponding traditional underlying surfaces in the days after rainfall events fig 8 a shows et variation of the bioretention br h and the traditional garden tg h after rain the et rate of bioretention has no downward trend within 7 days after rain and its fluctuation is mainly affected by the intensity of solar radiation however the et rate of the traditional garden shows a downward trend after 4 days no downward trend of et rate indicates that the water in the bioretention cell is sufficient and that et of vegetation in the bioretention cell is not restricted by water availability the et rate of bioretention would be expected to decrease when rainwater stored in the bioretention is depleted after a longer period of time the average hourly et of the bioretention is higher than that of the traditional garden the average et difference between the bioretention and the traditional garden is around 0 03 mm h 0 05 mm h and 0 07 mm h in the first 2 days 3 5 days and 6 7 days respectively after rain therefore the et difference increases with time in 7 days after rain this indicates that the bioretention can maintain at a higher et rate for a longer period after rain than the traditional garden fig 8b shows et variation of the vegetated swale vs z and the traditional lawn tl z after rain the et rate of vegetated swale changes mainly with the intensity of solar radiation the average hourly et of the swale is higher than that of the traditional lawn the average et difference between the swale and the traditional lawn is around 0 01 mm h 0 02 mm h and 0 05 mm h in the first 2 days 3 5 days and 6 days respectively after rain therefore the et difference increases with time in 6 days after rain this indicates that vegetated swale can maintain at a higher et rate for a longer period after rain than the traditional lawn fig 8c shows evaporation variation of pcp and ibp after rain unlike vegetated lid facilities the evaporation of pcp is dominated by moisture available inside the facility the average hourly evaporation of pcp is higher than that of ibp the average evaporation difference between pcp and ibp is around 0 01 mm h 0 005 mm h and 0 001 mm h in the first 2 days 3 5 days and 6 7 days respectively after rain therefore the evaporation difference decreases with time in 7 days after rain this is because the moisture inside the pavement is evaporated quickly in a short time after rain this indicates that pcp can maintain at a higher evaporation rate than ibp only for a short period of time after rain 3 4 overall et in an osub installed with and without lid fig 9 shows average daily et of different scenarios in the wet and dry season for current control area scenario average daily et is 0 05 mm d and 0 in the wet season and dry season respectively for 0 lid scenario average daily et is 0 43 mm d and 0 11 mm d in the wet and dry season respectively et rate of 0 lid scenario is 10 times higher than that for control scenario in the wet season for 51 lid scenario average daily et is 0 55 mm d and 0 13 mm d in the wet and dry season respectively for 100 lid scenario average daily et is 0 65 mm d and 0 14 mm d in the wet and dry season respectively in the wet season et rate of 51 lid scenario and 100 lid scenario is 28 and 51 higher than that of 0 lid scenario respectively in the dry season et rate of 51 lid scenario and 100 lid scenario is 18 and 27 higher than that of 0 lid scenario statistical analysis showed that in the wet season 100 lid scenario can significantly increase et compared with 0 lid scenario one way anova p 0 001 in the dry season the et of 100 lid scenario is still higher than that of 0 lid scenario but the difference is not significant one way anova p 0 069 4 discussion 4 1 et variation of lid facilities in this study the average daily et of vegetated lid facilities varies between 1 61 and 2 95 mm d the finding is consistent with the result of a previous study carried out by hickman et al 2011 that the average daily et from a bioinfiltration lysimeter in august and september was 1 93 and 1 17 mm d respectively however the daily et measured in this study is much lower than that measured by denich and bradford 2010 from a bioretention in canada the difference may be due to different climatic meteorological conditions or facility structures ebrahimian et al 2019 which is further discussed in 4 2 in this study the et rate of the three lid facilities decreases in the order of bioretention vegetated swale permeable pavement which is mainly affected by type of vegetation and moisture inside the facilities the et rates of vegetated lid facilities are higher than that of pavement because more water is retained in the substrate of vegetated lid facilities during rainfall the reason why et from bioretention is higher than that from vegetated swale is that they have different plant types and structures the plant type in the bioretention and swale is shrub and grass respectively in general shrubs consume more water through transpiration than grasses pockman and small 2010 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b in addition bioretention can retain more water than vegetated swale after rainfall because of its deeper storage depth the differences of et rates between lid and traditional land covers depend on the seasonal or meteorological factors in the wet season the et rates of lid facilities are much higher than those of traditional land covers however the difference between them is much less in the dry season in this study lid facilities maintain higher et rates in the days following precipitation events this is due to not only the facilities receiving greater volumes of water per footprint area but also the structure in the facilities for example lid facilities are usually designed to receive surrounding rainfall runoff and they may be designed to store more runoff by installing a storage layer beneath the soil layer in addition vegetated lid facilities can maintain at a relatively high et rate for a longer period after rain than non vegetated lid facilities this is because rainwater can be retained in a gravel layer installed at the bottom of vegetated lid facilities e g br h during rainfall which can replenish the upper soil layer with water and leads to the slow decline of soil water content during dry periods after rain take br h as an example the soil water content of the bioretention cell only decreases from 17 81 to 16 93 in 7 days after rain while the moisture inside non vegetated lid facilities e g pcp is depleted quickly in a short time after rain under the hot urban environment this finding suggests that vegetated lid facilities are more useful than non vegetated lid facilities in increasing urban et and alleviating uhi effects 4 2 influence factors of et from lid facilities et from lid facilities may be affected by many factors including solar radiation intensity substrate moisture plant type and its growth status etc ebrahimian et al 2019 hess et al 2017 payne et al 2018 the higher the solar radiation the more water consuming plant type the more flourishing the plant growth and the more abundant the substrate water the higher et from a lid facility will be for example the lid facility with higher field water holding capacity of soil substrate or with an additional storage layer beneath the soil layer can retain more runoff and possibly has a higher et in this study the vegetation coverage in the bioretention was approximately 100 however in many cases bioretention facilities do not contain vegetation as robust as this study generally the et of bioretention with sparse vegetation would be less than that of bioretention with dense vegetation while in some cases such as when photosynthesis transpiration is low the sparse vegetation facility might have greater et nicholls and carey 2021 ma et al 2019 in particular et from an osub is affected by the building shadow thus the spatial layout of urban buildings such as building orientation aspect ratio height width spacing etc has an important influence on the et of an osub morakinyo et al 2017 in addition the layout of lid facilities in an osub also has potential impacts to et for example the lid facilities designed to receive greater volumes of water per footprint area can maintain higher et rates in the days following precipitation events the runoff from impermeable pavement may flow into the swale or rain garden rainwater may infiltrate into the permeable pavement and flow into the swale or rain garden through the drainage pipes below the pavement generally if lid facilities are linked together the lid facilities upstream may affect the lid facilities downstream as the runoff generated upstream flows into the downstream facilities during rainfall thus lid facilities downstream tend to have higher et the study area belongs to the southern subtropical monsoon climate with high temperature average temperature 23 c and abundant rainfall annual rainfall 1935 mm the et of lid facilities in other areas with smaller rainfall and lower temperature would be less than the estimated et of this study in addition in shenzhen it rains frequently during the wet season but rarely in the dry season therefore et measurement in the wet season was taken usually following rainfall events while et measurement in the dry season was not the measurement arrangement could have impacts on the comparisons of wet and dry season et if et measurement in the dry season could be conducted after rainfall the measured et could be higher than the result obtained in this study among all meteorological factors the solar radiation intensity and the drying period after rain which impact the moisture inside the facilities are the dominant factors affecting the et increase due to lid the et of lid facilities might also be affected by lid structure drainage area soil type depth to water table and other factors the effects of the factors have not been fully discussed in this study and would be included in our next study 4 3 urban or catchment scale implications quantifying et rates of lid facilities and traditional underlying surfaces in a highly heterogeneous environment has important implications for the assessment of urban or catchment et taking shenzhen as an example when an osub is installed with 0 lid 50 lid and 100 lid its annual et 183 days in wet season and 182 days in dry season is 98 7 126 1 and 146 3 mm respectively according to the remote sensing extraction of underlying surface in shenzhen the osub excluding roof accounts for about 24 of the built up area if all the osubs choose 100 lid instead of 0 lid there would be an expected increase of annual et of 11 4 mm in the built up area of shenzhen it should be noted that when extrapolating the site scale study to larger scales generally the influence factors discussed in 4 2 should be considered including climatic meteorological conditions soil media water applied received vegetative cover as well as layout of buildings and lid facilities 4 4 limitations of this study the 3t model does not directly account for the impact of aerodynamics in this study the wind speed is small and has little influence on et so the estimation of et by 3t model is considered reasonable however further experimental studies are needed to confirm the applicability of the 3t model under the condition of high wind speed in this study et from typical lid facilities is measured by using the 3t model combined with a portable thermal infrared imager and then the overall et in the osub is estimated by the area weighted averaging method the method is based on the assumption that et of the same type of lid facilities at different locations is consistent however due to the different external e g microclimate or internal e g structure conditions at different locations even if the lid facilities are of the same type their et may vary thus the method used in this paper is not suitable for the study area with highly heterogeneous environmental conditions in order to further consider the spatial heterogeneity of lid facilities and environmental conditions it is recommended to use unmanned aerial vehicle uav equipped with thermal imager to obtain thermal parameters with high spatial resolution before applying the 3t model in addition in this study the external environmental conditions in the control area are assumed to be similar to those in the lid area and thus the increase of et in the osub caused by lid can be estimated by subtracting et in the control area from et in the lid area however comparing with the lid area the control area is more closed i e surrounded by buildings and has more unfavorable aerodynamic conditions for et therefore the increase of et in the osub caused by lid might be slightly overestimated in this study it should be noted that the quantitative discussions in this case study are site specific in order to investigate et at a watershed scale it is necessary to classify osubs according to their external or internal factors and then measure et from each type of osubs furthermore it is necessary to develop a mathematical model for simulating et of osubs which might consider the effect of various external conditions and internal structures of lid implementation combined with a watershed hydrological model the model might be used to further analyze the effect of lid facilities on et at a watershed scale 5 conclusions in this study the effects of lid on et in an osub in shenzhen were investigated by using the 3t model combined with a thermal infrared imager the main results obtained are summarized below 1 in the wet season lid facilities have higher et rates than traditional underlying surfaces e g garden lawn and impermeable pavement the et rate of the three investigated lid facilities decreases in the order of bioretention vegetated swale permeable pavement however in the dry season the et rate of vegetated lid facilities is much lower around 70 lower in this study than that in the wet season and there is no significant difference in et between lid facilities and traditional underlying surfaces 2 the diurnal variation of et in the osub is greatly affected by solar radiation intensity building shadow and moisture inside the lid facilities the higher solar radiation intensity and the lower frequency at which the lid facilities are in the shadow of buildings the higher et increase by lid in addition only when there is moisture inside the permeable pavement the evaporation of the permeable pavement is higher than that of the impervious pavement 3 the vegetated lid facilities can maintain at a higher et rate for a longer period after rain than the non vegetated lid facilities indicating that vegetated lid facilities are more useful than non vegetated lid facilities in increasing et and alleviating uhi effects 4 when the proportion of lid in osubs increases from 0 to 50 and 100 the et rate of osubs increases by 28 and 51 respectively and the annual et of built up areas in shenzhen increases by 6 58 mm and 11 41 mm respectively indicating that lid facilities can moderate et at watershed scale however the effects of soil media vegetative cover lid facility structure local climate and building shadow on the et of osubs should be considered for extrapolating the site scale study to urban or catchment scale this study provides insights into the effect of lid on et in an osub under moist sub tropical weather condition in further study the method applied in this paper can be used to investigate the effects of lid on et in various urban environments with different lid implementations and under different climatic zones in addition this study focuses on site scale et in further study the scale up method should be developed to study the influence of lid on the watershed scale credit authorship contribution statement yuanyan zhang conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis writing

3482,increasing legal requirements by local and regional governments to protect hydrosystems and maintain their hydrological services require nowadays the identification of wetlands of particular interest for conservation individual wetlands however have a limited effect on these services especially on stream flow at the watershed scale in general on the other hand the compound effect of all wetlands does not allow for the identification of wetlands with substantial effects building on previous hydrological modelling development and seeking for a compromise between assessing the impact of individual wetlands and all wetlands we propose the creation of wetland networks i e wetlandscapes based on i geographic location ii typology iii wetland area and iv contributing area thus we tested the relevance of different ways of building wetland networks using the semi distributed hydrological model hydrotel with a case study that of the st charles river watershed quebec canada we defined 48 wetland networks and assessed their capacity to attenuate peak flows and support low flows using 47 years of meteorological data at both the sub watershed scale and the watershed scale our results clearly demonstrate differences in the networks effect confirming the relevance of the proposed framework although large wetlands with large contributing areas tend to have the strongest effect on high and low flows we illustrate that small wetlands with large contributing areas can have a significant effect on extreme stream flows this study also suggests that riparian wetlands might amplify peak flows as well as low flows the application of the proposed modelling framework to various climates and geological contexts has the potential to be useful to support the design of wetland conservation programs and to meet some legal requirements based on the protection of wetland networks keywords conservation networks hydrological services hydrotel hydroconnectivity wetland contributing area wetland location 1 introduction all individual wetlands are hydrologically significant bullock and acreman 2003 but do not provide ecological services equally zedler 2003 their location layout topography slope and soil characteristics determine their effect on downstream flows acreman and holden 2013 acreman and holden 2013 reported that upstream wetlands tend to be flood generating areas while downstream ones reduce floods with more efficiency while small upstream wetlands can reduce and delay flood peaks through water storage large downstream wetlands are more prone to reduce water levels in rivers zedler 2003 hence individual wetlands should not be expected to provide all ecosystem services recently thorslund et al 2017 argued the importance of wetlandscapes in the assessment of wetland functions services and impact in contrast to evaluating the impact of a single wetland considering wetlandscapes enables the assessment of broader ecological services and accounts for the interactions between individual wetlands undeniably hydrological models have proven to be useful to investigate wetland features affecting low flow support and peak flow attenuation and therefore guide wetland management programs geared towards building hydrological resilience at the watershed scale ameli and creed 2019 fossey et al 2016 golden et al 2016 lee et al 2018 wang et al 2010 wu et al 2020 for example fossey et al 2016 used the semi distributed hydrological model hydrotel to assess the impact of wetlands on stream flows of the bécancour river watershed in quebec 2597 km2 they considered different wetland scenarios defined by i geographic location ii wetland typologies isolated or riparian and iii seasonality results demonstrate that isolated wetlands mitigate stream flows more efficiently at the headwater of a stream rather than downstream while riparian wetlands have a stronger impact when associated with the main channel wu et al 2020 also used hydrotel to study the effect of wetland distribution and location on flood resilience in the nenjiang river basin china 297 100 km2 they simulated five wetland removal scenarios characterized by an upstream downstream gradient they quantified the scenarios using four indices peak flow mean flow duration and flow volume they found out that the removal of wetland areas primarily affected high flows they also reported that the location of wetlands affected the efficiency of their contribution to flood mitigation services the particular fill spill dynamic of the wetlands located in the prairie pothole region has encouraged the development improvement and application of hydrological models to this specific context recently ameli and creed 2019 investigated the hydrological function of wetlands with respect to their distance from the main channel developing a fully distributed physically based subsurface surface hydrological model applied to the nose creek watershed 886 km2 located in the prairie pothole region alberta canada they simulated scenarios in which they removed wetlands located at various distances 0 m 100 m 2000 m and 4000 m from fourth order streams and assessed peak flow cumulative stream flow and base flow at the watershed outlet their results showed that the removal of wetlands closer than 100 m from the main channel induced a stronger impact on peak flows and cumulative stream flows than wetlands located farther than 4000 m evenson et al 2018 assessed the impact of depressional wetland prairie potholes size on the hydrologic biogeochemical and biological functions at the watershed scale they applied a modified swat model to the pipestem river watershed north dakota usa and simulated six scenarios i baseline ii removal of all depressional wetlands iii removal of depressional wetlands smaller than 3 ha iv removal of depressional wetlands larger than 3 ha v removal of wetlands located 30 m and beyond from the hydrographic network and vi removal of wetlands located 457 m and beyond from streams they observed that large depressional wetlands have a greater impact on peak flows than small wetlands although large wetlands represented only 5 of the wetland population it appears that their greater storage capacity explained their stronger impact on high flows the authors also reported no significant impact on low flow events however they did not account for the contributing area ca of wetlands in the definition of their scenarios and excluded riparian wetlands of their assessment other authors driven by the complexity of the fill spill dynamics in the prairie pothole region have tried to refine the watershed scale modelling of wetlands in order to reach a middle ground between simulating individual and lumped wetlands representation and improve stream flow replication mekonnen et al 2016 shook et al 2021 evenson et al 2016 tahmasebi nasab et al 2017 mekonnen et al 2016 showed that the introduction of a probability distribution of landscape depressions in swat resulted in a better representation of stream flows than the lumped one for two watersheds in saskatchewan canada recently shook et al 2021 used the wetland digital elevation ponding model and the pothole cascade model to quantify the effect of spatial and frequency distribution of depressional storage on the relationship between water storage and the basin fractions that are connected to the outlet their results showed that with a small number of depressions the size and spatial distribution shape the relationship heavily in addition they demonstrated that the relative size and location of a single large depression had a strong impact on the relationship between storage and the connected fraction of the watershed all of the above studies have undoubtedly improved the representation of wetlands in hydrological models and increased our understanding of their benefits for societies but there remain many questions around this topic beyond the prairie pothole region the available literature on the impact of different spatial configurations of wetlandscapes is scarce and has some limitations given the specific characteristics of each watershed climate spatial distribution of wetlands wetland typologies etc while wetland areas and location have received attention very few studies have accounted for wetland size contributing area typology and location in the definition of their scenarios at the global scale the 170 signatories of the ramsar convention agreed on three pillars ramsar convention on wetlands 2018 i the wise use of all wetlands ii the designation and management of wetlands of international importance and iii international cooperation including on shared wetlands river basins and populations of migratory waterbirds the ramsar convention encouraged the signatories to develop national wetland policies moomaw et al 2018 as of 2017 among the 193 members of the united nations 16 9 had a wetland specific policy while 73 38 had a broad environmental policy including wetlands or specific types of wetlands peimer et al 2017 in north america which alone accounts for 27 of the global wetlands specific policies were adopted at state and provincial levels with the adoption in june 2017 of bill 132 an act respecting the conservation of wetlands and bodies of water quebec canada has developed the necessary legislative framework to improve wetland conservation owing to this reform 87 regional county municipalities rcm and 14 cities and agglomerations in the province must prepare implement and update every 10 years a regional wetlands and water bodies plan the development of these plans due by june 2022 will emerge from a collaboration with watershed organisations regional advisory panels and rcms drawing on the well known mitigation sequence avoid minimize compensate ramsar convention on wetlands 2012 these plans will include a territorial wetland inventory with i a description of the threats ii the identification of wetlands of particular interest for conservation iii the identification of locations for wetland restoration and iv as compensation measures the suitable locations for wetland development projects therefore the regional wetlands and water bodies plan development requires detailed information namely the evaluation of the hydrological services provided by wetlands however with wetlands covering 189 593 km2 12 5 of the province pellerin and poulin 2013 this assessment requires some tools development and novel methods while distributed and semi distributed hydrological models represent powerful tools to quantify the impact of wetlands on stream flows at the watershed scale they are less adapted to assess the effect of individual wetlands martinez martinez et al 2014 in this context a gap exists between the need for governments to ensure an efficient protection of wetlands and their ecological services and the knowledge gathered from hydrological modelling studies our goal here is to propose an approach connecting the two ends of this spectrum we propose to divide the wetlandscape of a specific watershed into wetland networks based on spatial criteria we present such an approach using the physitel hydrotel modelling platform applied to the st charles river watershed quebec canada 2 materials and methods 2 1 st charles river watershed located in the quebec city region canada the st charles river watershed 554 km2 has five major tributaries des hurons draining a 137 km2 subwatershed jaune 82 km2 duberger 57 km2 st

low flow events were recorded in 2002 and 2010 threatening the water availability at the château d eau intake for these specific events the city had to turn an old pumping station back on from a neighbouring watershed to ensure sufficient water supply brodeur et al 2012 two meander sections of the st charles river and sections of the jaune nelson and lorette rivers are prone to flooding major flood events occurred on the lorette river in 2005 and 2013 compelling the city to build or rebuild pumping stations dams and bridges to ensure public safety and protect infrastructures city of quebec 2017 altitude ranges from 4 m to 844 m above mean sea level natural resources canada 2013 a subpolar and humid climate characterizes the northern half of the watershed while the southern half has moderate and sub humid climate conditions gerardin and mckenney 2001 three geological provinces meet on the st charles river watershed the grenville made of metamorphic rocks the st lawrence platform composed of unaltered sedimentary rocks and the appalachians mountains made of folded sedimentary rocks the dominant soil texture is sandy loam 73 followed by clay loam 23 and loamy sand 4 forests

bare soils 2 cover the rest of the territory wetlands cover 6 but at the sub watershed level total wetland area varies between 4 des hurons and jaune river sub watersheds and 10 nelson river sub

ha standard deviation of 3 9 ha beaulieu et al 2014b blanchette et al 2018 meanwhile isolated and riparian wetlands are distributed equally for most sub watersheds except for the du berger river with a higher percentage of riparian wetlands 5 4 than isolated wetlands 1 9 and the lorette sub watershed with a higher proportion of isolated wetlands 4 8 than riparian wetlands 2 1 swamps 3 and forested peatlands 2 dominate the wetland classes in the st charles river watershed followed by shallow waters fens marshes wet meadows and bogs blanchette et al 2019 reported a 15 decrease of wetland areas between 1978 and 2014 based on the analysis of landsat images at the sub watershed scale the jaune river sub watershed had the strongest decrease in wetland cover 44 followed by the des hurons with a 40 loss 2 2 physitel hydrotel modelling platform input data and calibration we used the physitel hydrotel modelling platform to assess the impact of wetland networks on high and low flows fossey et al 2015 integrated two modules to explicitly simulate both isolated and riparian wetlands physitel noël et al 2014 rousseau et al 2011 turcotte et al 2001 is the geographic information system used to process the input data digital elevation model dem hydrographic data land cover and soil type for hydrotel using the dem and the hydrographic network physitel first discretizes the watershed in relatively homogenous hydrological units rhhus that is hillslopes the simulation unit at which the hydrological processes are computed in this project we subdivided the watershed into 1505 hillslopes table 1 physitel recognizes wetlands as a land cover class and distinguishes the isolated and riparian wetlands based on the percentage of pixels adjacent to the hydrographic network based on flow orientation physitel processes the flow accumulation matrix and generates the ca of each wetland finally in agreement with the concept of hydrologically equivalent wetland hew a term proposed by wang et al 2008 to designate the hydrologic response unit hru scale lumped representation of wetlands in swat physitel aggregates wetlands into one isolated hew and or one riparian hew per rhhu consequently a hew equals the sum of each individual wetland within a rhhu in terms of wetland area and ca in addition while the parameters of isolated hews are numerically integrated those of riparian hews are numerically and spatially placement on a specific location on the river reach integrated for the entire st charles watershed 83 of isolated hews were composed of 10 or less individual wetlands with a maximum number of 108 individual wetlands for a single hew meanwhile 81 of riparian hews were made of 11 or less individual wetlands and the maximum number of individual wetlands was 64 for a single hew those rhhus contain large wetland complexes made of various wetland classes marshes swamps bogs fens and forested peatlands the wetland layer used as input data in physitel treats each polygon of a specific class as a single wetland no matter the adjacency which may overestimate the number of wetlands for those rhhus hydrotel bouda et al 2014 bouda et al 2012

obtained from a network of 30 meteorological stations environment and climate change canada 2021 finally we used daily observed stream flows from six hydrometric stations ministry of the environment

interpolation coefficients for meteorological data ii snow parameters and iii soil parameters we performed an automatic calibration using the asynchronous parallel multi objective optimization

heuristics ostrich v17 12 19 http www civil uwaterloo ca envmodelling ostrich html matott 2017 first with both wetland modules enabled we individually calibrated the des hurons jaune du berger lorette and nelson river sub watersheds then we integrated their calibrated set of parameters into the st charles river sub watershed calibration see fig 1 for each sub watershed we ran the model for the period corresponding to the availability of observed data in contrast with the classic split sample approach either two period mixed bag or odd even methods model calibration was performed on the entire period of available observed stream flows foregoing the validation step in a recent study arsenault et al 2018 showed that the longer the calibration period the better the model performance therefore a calibration based on the entire dataset leads to the most robust parameter sets making the most of the available observed stream flows this calibration approach also aimed at minimizing the subsequent error in wetlands impacts analysis we calibrated the model using the kling gupta efficiency criterion kge gupta et al 2009 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 calculated on log transformed flows nse log oudin et al 2006 this combination of objective functions favors both high and low flows foulon and rousseau 2018 for each sub watershed we performed 10 optimization trials with a computational budget of 250 runs to identify the final parameter set we plotted the kge versus nse log values of the 10 archived non dominated solutions and chose the set of parameters corresponding to the better compromise between the two objective functions we also compared simulated and observed stream flows using the percent bias pbias yapo et al 1996 and the root mean squared error rmse singh et al 2005 to assess model performance table2 after running the calibrated model for the whole 1969 2016 period we calculated these metrics using the r package hydrogof r core team 2020 zambrano bigiarini 2020 in each case we considered a one year spin up period and excluded stream flows simulated under ice cover from november to march from the objective function calculation 2 3 wetland networks and simulations we constructed wetland networks to assess how the area of wetlands and their ca impact high and low flows first for a given sub watershed and a given typology isolated vs riparian we separated the total number of hews in two groups of equal numbers using the median area as a threshold second we separated each group in two groups of equal sizes using the median ca as a threshold fig 3 see supplementary materials for threshold values this resulted into four networks for each typology and sub watershed table3 by separating the wetlands of the study area into networks we propose a compromise between accurate wetland process representation i e considering all wetlands in a single simulation and computational complexity evaluating the impact of each wetland for each network the model was run with i the isolated wetlands module enabled and ii the riparian wetlands module enabled we ran eight 8 simulations for each sub watershed 4 networks 2 wetland typologies 6 sub watersheds 48 simulations in total finally as a baseline scenario we ran a watershed scale simulation with the wetland modules disabled and recorded the stream flows at every sub watershed outlet including the watershed outlet in this scenario the wetlands are simulated as vegetated surface depending on wetland type and initial conditions of saturated soils and the equations simulating the hydrological behaviour of wetlands are not used we calculated stream flow indicators to assess the effect of each wetland networks on high and low flows for high flows we calculated the maximum annual flow over a period of 2 q2 20 q20 and 100 q100 years for low flows we quantified the 2 year minimum flow q2 7 and the 10 year minimum flow q10 7 over 7 consecutive days and the 5 year minimum flow over 30 days q5 30 these stream flow indicators were selected because they are used by the quebec ministry of sustainable development the environment and the fight against climate change to characterize the flow regimes of key river segments for regulating point sources of discharge pollution under current and future climate conditions we computed the empirical cumulative frequencies using the cunnane 1978 formula to avoid introducing another source of uncertainty with statistical fitting we compared each stream flow indicators with the baseline as a percentage of reduction or increase in order to reinforce the comparison between the different networks we also calculated a wetland scenario specific impact for all networks fossey et al 2016 1 ws i

log values range from 0 36 du berger to 0 75 des hurons nse log values higher than 0 5 indicate a satisfactory fit with the 1 1 line on the plot of observed versus simulated data and a good fit of the hydrograph moriasi et al 2007 pbias values vary from 0 70 st charles to 8 30 du berger pbias measures the general deviation of simulated data in comparison with observed data positive values indicate an overestimation of stream flows negative values reflect underestimation with 0 reflecting an optimal calibration performance and 10 values indicating a good performance for stream flows moriasi et al 2015 finally the rmse which measures the size of a typical error moriasi et al 2015 fluctuates between 0 92 m3 s nelson and 6 45 m3 s st charles based on the annual hydrograph see fig 4 the st charles and nelson river simulated stream flows show a good agreement with the observed stream flows the des hurons jaune and lorette river simulated data reproduce stream flows correctly except for peak flows that tend to be lower than the observations especially during snowmelt and summer for the du berger river the model underestimates simulated stream flows during winter and spring but overestimates summer peak flows that being mentioned we believe hydrological modelling is well suited to illustrate the proposed framework based on wetland networks given its relative independence from raw performances 3 2 spatial characteristics of wetland networks as mentioned earlier on in order to support wetland conservation programs and to reach the middle ground between wetland individual and lumped simulations we constructed four networks i iv of isolated hews iw and four networks of riparian hews rw for each sub watershed six of them resulting in 48 networks table4 for networks i ii and iii the total percentage of wetlands is somewhat similar among sub watersheds 1 while it is larger for network iv 2 to 4 except for the des hurons iw jaune iw and rw and du berger iw sub watersheds given our definition of each network the total areas of hews of most sub watersheds are similar for networks i and ii and for networks iii and iv fig 5 top however for the riparian networks of the lorette sub watershed the hew areas increase from network i to ii at the sub watershed scale the total percentage of cas shows a gradual increase from networks i to iii and a clear increase with network iv table4 for network i it is lower than 1 for network ii lower than 2 for network iii between 1 and 3 and for network iv between 4 and 23 this confirms that large wetlands generally drain large areas ahlen et al 2020 the increase is also noticeable at the rhhu scale fig 5 bottom moreover although networks ii and iii should have large and small cas respectively they actually have equivalent cas for isolated wetlands of the des hurons jaune du berger and lorette sub watersheds and riparian networks of the lorette sub watershed this suggests that cas of small wetlands can be similar to those of large wetlands 3 3 effect of wetland networks on high flows primary results show an increasing relative effect from wetland networks i to iv fig 6 with impacts close to zero for networks i and ii and networkiv being typically two to three times as impactful as networkiii the latter is not surprising given the steep increase of wetland cas at the sub watershed scale with networks iv table4 the effect of wetland networks is much higher at the sub watershed outlets top panels from 0 00 to 14 64 for isolated hews and from 0 11 to 25 58 for riparian hews than at the watershed outlet bottom panels from 0 00 to 2 44 for isolated hews and from 0 28 to 5 48 for riparian hews for example at the outlet of the jaune sub watershed the impact of isolated hew networks on the q20 are 0 03 0 20 0 58 and 3 54 from networks i to iv while the impact at the st charles watershed outlet are all below 0 4 this reflects a decreasing effect of wetland networks with increasing distance between the process origins wetland location and the hydrological services assessment locations with an increased downstream total ca a comparison between sub watersheds also highlights some differences among networks for example for the isolated hew network iv of the nelson sub watershed the relative effects are higher than those of the other sub watershed networks especially at the st charles watershed outlet fig 6 bottom panel this is in line with this network having the highest ca covering 23 of the sub watershed for both isolated and riparian networks table4 the relative impacts of the isolated hew networks of the du berger sub watershed are among the lowest especially at the watershed outlet however when considering the riparian hew networks we can see they have the highest relative effects at the sub watershed outlet as introduced in table4 the riparian hew networks iv covers a larger proportion 4 of the sub watersheds than the isolated ones 1 which explains their higher impacts this higher effect is not reproduced at the outlet of the watershed at the outlet of each sub watershed the wsi shows that isolated hew networks ii and iv are more impactful than those of networks i and iii this suggests that a square kilometer of isolated wetlands with large cas is more efficient at attenuating high flows at sub watershed outlets than that of isolated wetlands with a small ca on the other hand for riparian hew wetlands results show that network iii is more efficient at the outlet of the st charles watershed suggesting that a square kilometer of large riparian wetlands with a small ca is more efficient at reducing high flows downstream in contrast at the sub watershed and watershed outlets the wcasi shows that isolated hew networks i and iii have a higher impact than those of networks ii and iv and to a lesser extent a similar conclusion can be made for riparian hew networks this observation can be explained by the definition of the index indeed networks i and iii have small cas hence the denominator in the calculation of the wcasi is smaller giving the index a large value for networks with small cas compared to the wsi the wsi and the wcasi show that the riparian hew networks can sometimes worsen peak flows as shown with positive values this was not noticeable with the relative impact the highest increase of peak flows was related to the networks of the st charles sub watershed and affected the q100 at the outlet of the watershed in addition the worsening effects which are particularly significant for the q100 are not necessarily felt at the outlet of the watershed for example networks i and iii of the des hurons sub watershed withstand an increase of the q100 at the outlet of the sub watershed but a decrease at the outlet of the st charles watershed this is most likely due to the buffering effect of lake st charles moreover in the specific case of nelson river network i the increase of the wsi on the q100 is higher than the attenuation of the same flow indicator by network iv suggesting that a square kilometer of small riparian wetlands with small cas can also have a stronger worsening effect on extreme peak flows than a square kilometer of large wetlands with large cas can reduce them 3 4 effect of wetland networks on low flows at the sub watershed outlets and at the outlet of the st charles watershed the relative impacts of isolated and riparian hew networks on low flows are very low except for network iv fig 7 as observed for high flow attenuation the effects of wetland networks are higher at each sub watershed outlet than those at the st charles watershed outlet moreover both isolated and riparian hew networks iv of the hurons lorette and nelson river have higher relative impacts on low flows than the other networks at their outlet focusing on the riparian hew networks we can see that their impacts at the outlet of the st charles watershed is higher on the q2 7 than on the q10 7 and the q5 30 for the isolated and riparian hew networks the higher relative effect at the sub watershed outlets of the hurons and lorette are also noticeable with the wsi and the wcasi at the nelson sub watershed outlet the corresponding impact is also higher than those of the other sub watershed networks but mostly for the riparian networks as observed for high flows while network iv large wetlands with large cas has the highest relative impact on low flows network ii small wetlands with large cas has the highest wsi for isolated wetlands with regards to the wcasi riparian networks i of the hurons st charles and lorette sub watersheds have a high impact on the q2 7 at the outlet of the watershed suggesting that small riparian wetlands with small cas which are often distributed more homogeneously along the river than large wetlands with large cas are efficient at supporting low flow periods however it would require a large number of small riparian wetlands to have an effect similar to that of network iv in some cases riparian networks show a negative relative impact meaning that these networks can decrease discharges or worsen low flows these effects occur mostly during the severe low flow episodes of long return period and duration q10 7 and q5 30 suggesting that riparian wetland networks can help support regular low flows of short duration and return period q2 7 downstream but may have a tendency to worsen more severe low flow periods more precisely the riparian hew networks of the des hurons have the highest low flow support but during low flow periods of long duration 30 days they can also have the highest worsening effect at the outlet of the sub watershed with network iv showing a wsi of 0 0155 m3 s km2 and network iii having a wsi of 0 003 m3 s km2 on the q10 7 and the q5 30 respectively the negative wsi of network iii is also noticeable at the outlet of the st charles watershed located farther downstream this emphasizes the importance of assessing the effect of wetland conservation networks 4 discussion the mathematical modelling of the hydrological services of wetlands have provided strong arguments to scientists land managers and political bodies on the importance of protecting these landscapes evenson et al 2018 ameli and creed 2019 wu et al 2020 nowadays land managers are seeking objective information on the services provided by each wetland to support conservation planning and future land development opening a line of questions such as which wetlands should be protected given their impact at the watershed scale in this study we made the most of the versatility of a hydrological modelling platform and proposed a new framework to assess the hydrological services of isolated and riparian wetlands at the sub watershed and watershed scales we used hydrotel to simulate the impact of wetland networks based on their spatial distribution using the st charles river watershed as a case study we divided the entire dataset of wetlands into eight networks based on their area ca and typology we demonstrated that these characteristics represent good indicators of hydrological services high flow attenuation and low flow support the proposed modelling framework showed that networks iv large isolated and riparian hews with large cas have the strongest relative effects these wetland networks intercept a larger fraction of water flowing at the sub watershed scale compared to the small wetlands with small cas ahlen et al 2020 of network i however our results also suggest that small wetlands with large cas network ii can sometimes have a noticeable effect on stream flows as well especially for isolated wetlands highlighting the importance of including the conservation of cas in the process of land planning previous authors have already argued on the importance of small wetlands on some ecohydrological services small upstream wetlands store water and delay flood peaks more efficiently fossey et al 2016 zedler 2003 on another front with their increased residence time small depressional wetlands have the capacity to remove nutrients metals and other pollutants evenson et al 2018 the distribution of large wetlands in landscapes is typically uneven while small wetlands contributing to landscape heterogeneity are dispersed more continuously making them more available for wetland dependent species small wetlands and cas can modulate other ecological services such as habitats for rare plants waterfowl amphibians or pollinators giving small natural features an ecological importance disproportionate to their size hunter et al 2017 maximizing wetland ecosystem functions requires sites of various sizes types and locations systematic conservation planning addresses this concern by identifying configurations of complementary ecosystems to reach explicit and quantitative objectives while increasing cost effectiveness and reducing the effect of conservation measures on stakeholders cimon morin and poulin 2018 reis et al 2017 wetland scientists have used this approach to prioritize wetland conservation networks and it has proved efficient in bridging the gap between science and land planning decision making cimon morin and poulin 2018 recently applied this approach to the st charles river watershed and concluded that some wetlands of lower ecological values may present features and locations that give them a strong ecological role at landscape scale they suggested including large wetlands of high ecological value as part of conservation networks a priori and selecting small complementary wetlands using the systematic conservation planning approach aside from the size of wetlands and their cas on the attenuation of high flows and the support of low flows our results also highlight the dissimilarities between the networks of different sub watersheds while in the case of high flow attenuation the varying proportions of wetlands and cas covers between sub watersheds can be an explanation table4 it is not clear yet what determines the higher effect of some sub watersheds networks the spatial configuration of wetland networks and their location at the sub watershed scale could further our understanding of the features affecting these differences we reported differences between the typologies of wetland networks isolated vs riparian our results show for example that riparian wetlands have a good capacity for supporting regular low flow episodes q2 7 but can also in rare cases worsen the most severe stream flow indicators q10 7 and q5 30 although model outputs stream flows are associated with uncertainty and extreme low flows can fall under this uncertainty threshold other authors as mentioned by wu et al 2020 have also reported a worsening of stream flow extremes by wetlands in a review on the role of wetlands in the hydrological cycle bullock and acreman 2003 reported that out of 66 studies 27 showed that headwater wetlands increased flood peaks moreover 47 out of 71 studies concluded that wetlands reduce low flows during dry periods as a result of increased evaporation compared to other land types these conclusions raise awareness on the variability of wetlands hydrological services among watersheds wetland typologies and climates and emphasize the need for applied studies including uncertainty analysis over a wide range of conditions they also highlight the importance of clearly defining the stream flow indicators as it is highly related to the performance of the wetland conservation networks the framework proposed in this paper lies on the subdivision of a wetland dataset into eight 8 networks for each sub watershed in order to obtain four 4 networks of equal numbers of isolated wetlands and four 4 networks of equal numbers of riparian wetlands this method although inducing different network definitions among sub watersheds each of them having different thresholds enables the inclusion of the location of wetland networks in the assessment of their hydrological services future work could explore different wetland network definitions such as dividing the entire watershed dataset in groups of equal numbers before separating the sub watersheds wetland networks could also be split into groups of equal area for each sub watershed or for the entire watershed first which would limit the effect of wetland total area between networks on the hydrological services moreover knowing that 64 71 of wetlands have disappeared in the 1900s wetland restoration represents an important land planning objective for stream flow mitigation martinez martinez et al 2014 used the swat model to evaluate the effect of wetland scenarios on peak flows at the watershed and sub watershed scales of the shiawassee river watershed michigan their results showed that large wetlands provided greater stream flow reductions than small wetlands that stream flows were insensitive to wetland depth and wetland placement for wetland areas covering 500 ha in terms of stream order li et al 2021 presented an innovative framework in which they identified on one side priority areas for wetland restoration and on the other side areas of high stormwater resources linking those two types of areas could provide a useful framework to guide wetland restoration by identifying water availability at the watershed scale the customization of hydrological models gives them versatility for wide ranging applications our framework enables the transfer of watershed scale model outputs to a finer scale and may guide decision making when it comes to prioritizing conservation sites in complex landscapes suggested steps provide a better understanding of how individual wetlands provide hydrological services while remaining consistent with the concept of wetlandscapes 5 conclusion wetlands affect stream flows at the watershed scale by reducing high flows and supporting low flows with rising concerns about the importance of wetlands and the increased rate of their losses at global national and local scales scientists have adapted hydrological models to quantify their services at the watershed scale but further adaptations are required to meet the needs of legal bodies for local knowledge here we described a new framework to distribute the assessment of wetland effects by defining wetland networks based on their location typology areas and cas we report differences in the capacity of wetland networks to attenuate high flow indicators and support low flow episodes between networks confirming the relevance of our approach and the importance of the ca on stream flow mitigation our results suggest that a square kilometer of large wetlands with large cas network iv have the strongest relative impact on both high and low flows but a square kilometer of small wetlands with large cas network ii can also have an important effect on mitigating extreme stream flows when using the wetland scenario specific index wsi we also report a much stronger effect of wetland networks at the outlet of a sub watershed than at watershed scale there is room for future work to further our understanding of the factors impacting the variability of hydrological services provided by wetlands including the effect of land cover within cas hydrogeological characteristics and wetland locations at sub watershed scale remembering that hydrology remains an applied science we encourage replicating our approach under various physiographic conditions to draw more robust conclusions on the effect of these spatial characteristics on the hydrological services provided by wetlands relying on the objective and quantitative selection of wetlands to protect our conclusions could help support legal bodies in the application of national wetlands policies worldwide such as the recently adopted bill no 132 in quebec canada credit authorship contribution statement marianne blanchette writing

3482,increasing legal requirements by local and regional governments to protect hydrosystems and maintain their hydrological services require nowadays the identification of wetlands of particular interest for conservation individual wetlands however have a limited effect on these services especially on stream flow at the watershed scale in general on the other hand the compound effect of all wetlands does not allow for the identification of wetlands with substantial effects building on previous hydrological modelling development and seeking for a compromise between assessing the impact of individual wetlands and all wetlands we propose the creation of wetland networks i e wetlandscapes based on i geographic location ii typology iii wetland area and iv contributing area thus we tested the relevance of different ways of building wetland networks using the semi distributed hydrological model hydrotel with a case study that of the st charles river watershed quebec canada we defined 48 wetland networks and assessed their capacity to attenuate peak flows and support low flows using 47 years of meteorological data at both the sub watershed scale and the watershed scale our results clearly demonstrate differences in the networks effect confirming the relevance of the proposed framework although large wetlands with large contributing areas tend to have the strongest effect on high and low flows we illustrate that small wetlands with large contributing areas can have a significant effect on extreme stream flows this study also suggests that riparian wetlands might amplify peak flows as well as low flows the application of the proposed modelling framework to various climates and geological contexts has the potential to be useful to support the design of wetland conservation programs and to meet some legal requirements based on the protection of wetland networks keywords conservation networks hydrological services hydrotel hydroconnectivity wetland contributing area wetland location 1 introduction all individual wetlands are hydrologically significant bullock and acreman 2003 but do not provide ecological services equally zedler 2003 their location layout topography slope and soil characteristics determine their effect on downstream flows acreman and holden 2013 acreman and holden 2013 reported that upstream wetlands tend to be flood generating areas while downstream ones reduce floods with more efficiency while small upstream wetlands can reduce and delay flood peaks through water storage large downstream wetlands are more prone to reduce water levels in rivers zedler 2003 hence individual wetlands should not be expected to provide all ecosystem services recently thorslund et al 2017 argued the importance of wetlandscapes in the assessment of wetland functions services and impact in contrast to evaluating the impact of a single wetland considering wetlandscapes enables the assessment of broader ecological services and accounts for the interactions between individual wetlands undeniably hydrological models have proven to be useful to investigate wetland features affecting low flow support and peak flow attenuation and therefore guide wetland management programs geared towards building hydrological resilience at the watershed scale ameli and creed 2019 fossey et al 2016 golden et al 2016 lee et al 2018 wang et al 2010 wu et al 2020 for example fossey et al 2016 used the semi distributed hydrological model hydrotel to assess the impact of wetlands on stream flows of the bécancour river watershed in quebec 2597 km2 they considered different wetland scenarios defined by i geographic location ii wetland typologies isolated or riparian and iii seasonality results demonstrate that isolated wetlands mitigate stream flows more efficiently at the headwater of a stream rather than downstream while riparian wetlands have a stronger impact when associated with the main channel wu et al 2020 also used hydrotel to study the effect of wetland distribution and location on flood resilience in the nenjiang river basin china 297 100 km2 they simulated five wetland removal scenarios characterized by an upstream downstream gradient they quantified the scenarios using four indices peak flow mean flow duration and flow volume they found out that the removal of wetland areas primarily affected high flows they also reported that the location of wetlands affected the efficiency of their contribution to flood mitigation services the particular fill spill dynamic of the wetlands located in the prairie pothole region has encouraged the development improvement and application of hydrological models to this specific context recently ameli and creed 2019 investigated the hydrological function of wetlands with respect to their distance from the main channel developing a fully distributed physically based subsurface surface hydrological model applied to the nose creek watershed 886 km2 located in the prairie pothole region alberta canada they simulated scenarios in which they removed wetlands located at various distances 0 m 100 m 2000 m and 4000 m from fourth order streams and assessed peak flow cumulative stream flow and base flow at the watershed outlet their results showed that the removal of wetlands closer than 100 m from the main channel induced a stronger impact on peak flows and cumulative stream flows than wetlands located farther than 4000 m evenson et al 2018 assessed the impact of depressional wetland prairie potholes size on the hydrologic biogeochemical and biological functions at the watershed scale they applied a modified swat model to the pipestem river watershed north dakota usa and simulated six scenarios i baseline ii removal of all depressional wetlands iii removal of depressional wetlands smaller than 3 ha iv removal of depressional wetlands larger than 3 ha v removal of wetlands located 30 m and beyond from the hydrographic network and vi removal of wetlands located 457 m and beyond from streams they observed that large depressional wetlands have a greater impact on peak flows than small wetlands although large wetlands represented only 5 of the wetland population it appears that their greater storage capacity explained their stronger impact on high flows the authors also reported no significant impact on low flow events however they did not account for the contributing area ca of wetlands in the definition of their scenarios and excluded riparian wetlands of their assessment other authors driven by the complexity of the fill spill dynamics in the prairie pothole region have tried to refine the watershed scale modelling of wetlands in order to reach a middle ground between simulating individual and lumped wetlands representation and improve stream flow replication mekonnen et al 2016 shook et al 2021 evenson et al 2016 tahmasebi nasab et al 2017 mekonnen et al 2016 showed that the introduction of a probability distribution of landscape depressions in swat resulted in a better representation of stream flows than the lumped one for two watersheds in saskatchewan canada recently shook et al 2021 used the wetland digital elevation ponding model and the pothole cascade model to quantify the effect of spatial and frequency distribution of depressional storage on the relationship between water storage and the basin fractions that are connected to the outlet their results showed that with a small number of depressions the size and spatial distribution shape the relationship heavily in addition they demonstrated that the relative size and location of a single large depression had a strong impact on the relationship between storage and the connected fraction of the watershed all of the above studies have undoubtedly improved the representation of wetlands in hydrological models and increased our understanding of their benefits for societies but there remain many questions around this topic beyond the prairie pothole region the available literature on the impact of different spatial configurations of wetlandscapes is scarce and has some limitations given the specific characteristics of each watershed climate spatial distribution of wetlands wetland typologies etc while wetland areas and location have received attention very few studies have accounted for wetland size contributing area typology and location in the definition of their scenarios at the global scale the 170 signatories of the ramsar convention agreed on three pillars ramsar convention on wetlands 2018 i the wise use of all wetlands ii the designation and management of wetlands of international importance and iii international cooperation including on shared wetlands river basins and populations of migratory waterbirds the ramsar convention encouraged the signatories to develop national wetland policies moomaw et al 2018 as of 2017 among the 193 members of the united nations 16 9 had a wetland specific policy while 73 38 had a broad environmental policy including wetlands or specific types of wetlands peimer et al 2017 in north america which alone accounts for 27 of the global wetlands specific policies were adopted at state and provincial levels with the adoption in june 2017 of bill 132 an act respecting the conservation of wetlands and bodies of water quebec canada has developed the necessary legislative framework to improve wetland conservation owing to this reform 87 regional county municipalities rcm and 14 cities and agglomerations in the province must prepare implement and update every 10 years a regional wetlands and water bodies plan the development of these plans due by june 2022 will emerge from a collaboration with watershed organisations regional advisory panels and rcms drawing on the well known mitigation sequence avoid minimize compensate ramsar convention on wetlands 2012 these plans will include a territorial wetland inventory with i a description of the threats ii the identification of wetlands of particular interest for conservation iii the identification of locations for wetland restoration and iv as compensation measures the suitable locations for wetland development projects therefore the regional wetlands and water bodies plan development requires detailed information namely the evaluation of the hydrological services provided by wetlands however with wetlands covering 189 593 km2 12 5 of the province pellerin and poulin 2013 this assessment requires some tools development and novel methods while distributed and semi distributed hydrological models represent powerful tools to quantify the impact of wetlands on stream flows at the watershed scale they are less adapted to assess the effect of individual wetlands martinez martinez et al 2014 in this context a gap exists between the need for governments to ensure an efficient protection of wetlands and their ecological services and the knowledge gathered from hydrological modelling studies our goal here is to propose an approach connecting the two ends of this spectrum we propose to divide the wetlandscape of a specific watershed into wetland networks based on spatial criteria we present such an approach using the physitel hydrotel modelling platform applied to the st charles river watershed quebec canada 2 materials and methods 2 1 st charles river watershed located in the quebec city region canada the st charles river watershed 554 km2 has five major tributaries des hurons draining a 137 km2 subwatershed jaune 82 km2 duberger 57 km2 st charles 131 km2 lorette 72 km2 and nelson 74 km2 rivers fig 1 for the 1969 2016 period mean annual stream flows were 8 1 m3 s at station 050904 ministry of the environment and the fight against climate change 2021 mean annual precipitations reached 1329 mm 31 as snow while mean temperature was 3 9 c as one of the main drinking water source for quebec city lake st charles located at the very core of the watershed provides on average 59 1969 2016 of the distributed water to approximately 300 000 citizens the other source water 41 being supplied by the jaune and nelson sub watersheds severe low flow events were recorded in 2002 and 2010 threatening the water availability at the château d eau intake for these specific events the city had to turn an old pumping station back on from a neighbouring watershed to ensure sufficient water supply brodeur et al 2012 two meander sections of the st charles river and sections of the jaune nelson and lorette rivers are prone to flooding major flood events occurred on the lorette river in 2005 and 2013 compelling the city to build or rebuild pumping stations dams and bridges to ensure public safety and protect infrastructures city of quebec 2017 altitude ranges from 4 m to 844 m above mean sea level natural resources canada 2013 a subpolar and humid climate characterizes the northern half of the watershed while the southern half has moderate and sub humid climate conditions gerardin and mckenney 2001 three geological provinces meet on the st charles river watershed the grenville made of metamorphic rocks the st lawrence platform composed of unaltered sedimentary rocks and the appalachians mountains made of folded sedimentary rocks the dominant soil texture is sandy loam 73 followed by clay loam 23 and loamy sand 4 forests

bare soils 2 cover the rest of the territory wetlands cover 6 but at the sub watershed level total wetland area varies between 4 des hurons and jaune river sub watersheds and 10 nelson river sub

ha standard deviation of 3 9 ha beaulieu et al 2014b blanchette et al 2018 meanwhile isolated and riparian wetlands are distributed equally for most sub watersheds except for the du berger river with a higher percentage of riparian wetlands 5 4 than isolated wetlands 1 9 and the lorette sub watershed with a higher proportion of isolated wetlands 4 8 than riparian wetlands 2 1 swamps 3 and forested peatlands 2 dominate the wetland classes in the st charles river watershed followed by shallow waters fens marshes wet meadows and bogs blanchette et al 2019 reported a 15 decrease of wetland areas between 1978 and 2014 based on the analysis of landsat images at the sub watershed scale the jaune river sub watershed had the strongest decrease in wetland cover 44 followed by the des hurons with a 40 loss 2 2 physitel hydrotel modelling platform input data and calibration we used the physitel hydrotel modelling platform to assess the impact of wetland networks on high and low flows fossey et al 2015 integrated two modules to explicitly simulate both isolated and riparian wetlands physitel noël et al 2014 rousseau et al 2011 turcotte et al 2001 is the geographic information system used to process the input data digital elevation model dem hydrographic data land cover and soil type for hydrotel using the dem and the hydrographic network physitel first discretizes the watershed in relatively homogenous hydrological units rhhus that is hillslopes the simulation unit at which the hydrological processes are computed in this project we subdivided the watershed into 1505 hillslopes table 1 physitel recognizes wetlands as a land cover class and distinguishes the isolated and riparian wetlands based on the percentage of pixels adjacent to the hydrographic network based on flow orientation physitel processes the flow accumulation matrix and generates the ca of each wetland finally in agreement with the concept of hydrologically equivalent wetland hew a term proposed by wang et al 2008 to designate the hydrologic response unit hru scale lumped representation of wetlands in swat physitel aggregates wetlands into one isolated hew and or one riparian hew per rhhu consequently a hew equals the sum of each individual wetland within a rhhu in terms of wetland area and ca in addition while the parameters of isolated hews are numerically integrated those of riparian hews are numerically and spatially placement on a specific location on the river reach integrated for the entire st charles watershed 83 of isolated hews were composed of 10 or less individual wetlands with a maximum number of 108 individual wetlands for a single hew meanwhile 81 of riparian hews were made of 11 or less individual wetlands and the maximum number of individual wetlands was 64 for a single hew those rhhus contain large wetland complexes made of various wetland classes marshes swamps bogs fens and forested peatlands the wetland layer used as input data in physitel treats each polygon of a specific class as a single wetland no matter the adjacency which may overestimate the number of wetlands for those rhhus hydrotel bouda et al 2014 bouda et al 2012 fortin et al 2001 turcotte et al 2003 turcotte et al 2007 is a physically based semi distributed hydrological model operating at daily or sub daily time steps the model includes eight computational modules simulating distinct components of the hydrological cycle meteorological data interpolation snow accumulation and melt soil temperature and frost potential evapotranspiration vertical water budget surface runoff routing using a geomorphological unit hydrograph water routing in the hydrographic network and wetland hydrology isolated and riparian wetland modules hydrotel integrates both wetland modules at the rhhu scale and calculates the inflows by prorating the outputs of the vertical water budget with respect to hew ca and rhhu surface areas the model processes water balance calculation at the hew level and redirects the outputs to the runoff routing module isolated hews or the water routing in the hydrographic network module riparian hews for a detailed description of the wetland modules in hydrotel and the governing equations the reader should refer to fossey et al 2015 the dem was extracted from geogratis https maps canada ca czs index en html with a 20 m horizontal resolution and a 1 m vertical resolution natural resources canada 2013 the hydrographic network was downloaded from geogratis at a resolution of 1 50 000 the river network was filtered to remove intermittent river segments loops and river sections shorter than 20 m dem cell resolution we identified the soil textures percentages of loam clay and sand using the soil landscapes of canada soil landscapes of canada working group 2010 and hydraulic properties were attributed to each soil type following rawls and brakensiek 1989 finally we combined various datasets to create the land cover map i a land cover map produced by photo interpreting a 2014 orthophoto mosaic 650 coloured aerial photographs with a 10 cm ground resolution raimbault et al 2016 ii a detailed wetland map beaulieu et al 2014a iii the 4th decennial ecoforest inventory map ministry of natural ressources and wildlife 2014 iv a hydrographic network and v a road network the interpolation of meteorological data in hydrotel requires observed daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures at a daily or sub daily time step a set of meteorological data covering the 1969 2016 period was built with data obtained from a network of 30 meteorological stations environment and climate change canada 2021 finally we used daily observed stream flows from six hydrometric stations ministry of the environment and the fight against climate change 2021 for calibration purposes the 30 parameters of hydrotel see supplementary materials for a list of hydrotel parameters can be categorized in three groups i interpolation coefficients for meteorological data ii snow parameters and iii soil parameters we performed an automatic calibration using the asynchronous parallel multi objective optimization algorithm pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search parapadds asadzadeh and tolson 2009 tolson et al 2014 implemented in the optimization software toolkit for research involving computational heuristics ostrich v17 12 19 http www civil uwaterloo ca envmodelling ostrich html matott 2017 first with both wetland modules enabled we individually calibrated the des hurons jaune du berger lorette and nelson river sub watersheds then we integrated their calibrated set of parameters into the st charles river sub watershed calibration see fig 1 for each sub watershed we ran the model for the period corresponding to the availability of observed data in contrast with the classic split sample approach either two period mixed bag or odd even methods model calibration was performed on the entire period of available observed stream flows foregoing the validation step in a recent study arsenault et al 2018 showed that the longer the calibration period the better the model performance therefore a calibration based on the entire dataset leads to the most robust parameter sets making the most of the available observed stream flows this calibration approach also aimed at minimizing the subsequent error in wetlands impacts analysis we calibrated the model using the kling gupta efficiency criterion kge gupta et al 2009 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 calculated on log transformed flows nse log oudin et al 2006 this combination of objective functions favors both high and low flows foulon and rousseau 2018 for each sub watershed we performed 10 optimization trials with a computational budget of 250 runs to identify the final parameter set we plotted the kge versus nse log values of the 10 archived non dominated solutions and chose the set of parameters corresponding to the better compromise between the two objective functions we also compared simulated and observed stream flows using the percent bias pbias yapo et al 1996 and the root mean squared error rmse singh et al 2005 to assess model performance table2 after running the calibrated model for the whole 1969 2016 period we calculated these metrics using the r package hydrogof r core team 2020 zambrano bigiarini 2020 in each case we considered a one year spin up period and excluded stream flows simulated under ice cover from november to march from the objective function calculation 2 3 wetland networks and simulations we constructed wetland networks to assess how the area of wetlands and their ca impact high and low flows first for a given sub watershed and a given typology isolated vs riparian we separated the total number of hews in two groups of equal numbers using the median area as a threshold second we separated each group in two groups of equal sizes using the median ca as a threshold fig 3 see supplementary materials for threshold values this resulted into four networks for each typology and sub watershed table3 by separating the wetlands of the study area into networks we propose a compromise between accurate wetland process representation i e considering all wetlands in a single simulation and computational complexity evaluating the impact of each wetland for each network the model was run with i the isolated wetlands module enabled and ii the riparian wetlands module enabled we ran eight 8 simulations for each sub watershed 4 networks 2 wetland typologies 6 sub watersheds 48 simulations in total finally as a baseline scenario we ran a watershed scale simulation with the wetland modules disabled and recorded the stream flows at every sub watershed outlet including the watershed outlet in this scenario the wetlands are simulated as vegetated surface depending on wetland type and initial conditions of saturated soils and the equations simulating the hydrological behaviour of wetlands are not used we calculated stream flow indicators to assess the effect of each wetland networks on high and low flows for high flows we calculated the maximum annual flow over a period of 2 q2 20 q20 and 100 q100 years for low flows we quantified the 2 year minimum flow q2 7 and the 10 year minimum flow q10 7 over 7 consecutive days and the 5 year minimum flow over 30 days q5 30 these stream flow indicators were selected because they are used by the quebec ministry of sustainable development the environment and the fight against climate change to characterize the flow regimes of key river segments for regulating point sources of discharge pollution under current and future climate conditions we computed the empirical cumulative frequencies using the cunnane 1978 formula to avoid introducing another source of uncertainty with statistical fitting we compared each stream flow indicators with the baseline as a percentage of reduction or increase in order to reinforce the comparison between the different networks we also calculated a wetland scenario specific impact for all networks fossey et al 2016 1 ws i

log values range from 0 36 du berger to 0 75 des hurons nse log values higher than 0 5 indicate a satisfactory fit with the 1 1 line on the plot of observed versus simulated data and a good fit of the hydrograph moriasi et al 2007 pbias values vary from 0 70 st charles to 8 30 du berger pbias measures the general deviation of simulated data in comparison with observed data positive values indicate an overestimation of stream flows negative values reflect underestimation with 0 reflecting an optimal calibration performance and 10 values indicating a good performance for stream flows moriasi et al 2015 finally the rmse which measures the size of a typical error moriasi et al 2015 fluctuates between 0 92 m3 s nelson and 6 45 m3 s st charles based on the annual hydrograph see fig 4 the st charles and nelson river simulated stream flows show a good agreement with the observed stream flows the des hurons jaune and lorette river simulated data reproduce stream flows correctly except for peak flows that tend to be lower than the observations especially during snowmelt and summer for the du berger river the model underestimates simulated stream flows during winter and spring but overestimates summer peak flows that being mentioned we believe hydrological modelling is well suited to illustrate the proposed framework based on wetland networks given its relative independence from raw performances 3 2 spatial characteristics of wetland networks as mentioned earlier on in order to support wetland conservation programs and to reach the middle ground between wetland individual and lumped simulations we constructed four networks i iv of isolated hews iw and four networks of riparian hews rw for each sub watershed six of them resulting in 48 networks table4 for networks i ii and iii the total percentage of wetlands is somewhat similar among sub watersheds 1 while it is larger for network iv 2 to 4 except for the des hurons iw jaune iw and rw and du berger iw sub watersheds given our definition of each network the total areas of hews of most sub watersheds are similar for networks i and ii and for networks iii and iv fig 5 top however for the riparian networks of the lorette sub watershed the hew areas increase from network i to ii at the sub watershed scale the total percentage of cas shows a gradual increase from networks i to iii and a clear increase with network iv table4 for network i it is lower than 1 for network ii lower than 2 for network iii between 1 and 3 and for network iv between 4 and 23 this confirms that large wetlands generally drain large areas ahlen et al 2020 the increase is also noticeable at the rhhu scale fig 5 bottom moreover although networks ii and iii should have large and small cas respectively they actually have equivalent cas for isolated wetlands of the des hurons jaune du berger and lorette sub watersheds and riparian networks of the lorette sub watershed this suggests that cas of small wetlands can be similar to those of large wetlands 3 3 effect of wetland networks on high flows primary results show an increasing relative effect from wetland networks i to iv fig 6 with impacts close to zero for networks i and ii and networkiv being typically two to three times as impactful as networkiii the latter is not surprising given the steep increase of wetland cas at the sub watershed scale with networks iv table4 the effect of wetland networks is much higher at the sub watershed outlets top panels from 0 00 to 14 64 for isolated hews and from 0 11 to 25 58 for riparian hews than at the watershed outlet bottom panels from 0 00 to 2 44 for isolated hews and from 0 28 to 5 48 for riparian hews for example at the outlet of the jaune sub watershed the impact of isolated hew networks on the q20 are 0 03 0 20 0 58 and 3 54 from networks i to iv while the impact at the st charles watershed outlet are all below 0 4 this reflects a decreasing effect of wetland networks with increasing distance between the process origins wetland location and the hydrological services assessment locations with an increased downstream total ca a comparison between sub watersheds also highlights some differences among networks for example for the isolated hew network iv of the nelson sub watershed the relative effects are higher than those of the other sub watershed networks especially at the st charles watershed outlet fig 6 bottom panel this is in line with this network having the highest ca covering 23 of the sub watershed for both isolated and riparian networks table4 the relative impacts of the isolated hew networks of the du berger sub watershed are among the lowest especially at the watershed outlet however when considering the riparian hew networks we can see they have the highest relative effects at the sub watershed outlet as introduced in table4 the riparian hew networks iv covers a larger proportion 4 of the sub watersheds than the isolated ones 1 which explains their higher impacts this higher effect is not reproduced at the outlet of the watershed at the outlet of each sub watershed the wsi shows that isolated hew networks ii and iv are more impactful than those of networks i and iii this suggests that a square kilometer of isolated wetlands with large cas is more efficient at attenuating high flows at sub watershed outlets than that of isolated wetlands with a small ca on the other hand for riparian hew wetlands results show that network iii is more efficient at the outlet of the st charles watershed suggesting that a square kilometer of large riparian wetlands with a small ca is more efficient at reducing high flows downstream in contrast at the sub watershed and watershed outlets the wcasi shows that isolated hew networks i and iii have a higher impact than those of networks ii and iv and to a lesser extent a similar conclusion can be made for riparian hew networks this observation can be explained by the definition of the index indeed networks i and iii have small cas hence the denominator in the calculation of the wcasi is smaller giving the index a large value for networks with small cas compared to the wsi the wsi and the wcasi show that the riparian hew networks can sometimes worsen peak flows as shown with positive values this was not noticeable with the relative impact the highest increase of peak flows was related to the networks of the st charles sub watershed and affected the q100 at the outlet of the watershed in addition the worsening effects which are particularly significant for the q100 are not necessarily felt at the outlet of the watershed for example networks i and iii of the des hurons sub watershed withstand an increase of the q100 at the outlet of the sub watershed but a decrease at the outlet of the st charles watershed this is most likely due to the buffering effect of lake st charles moreover in the specific case of nelson river network i the increase of the wsi on the q100 is higher than the attenuation of the same flow indicator by network iv suggesting that a square kilometer of small riparian wetlands with small cas can also have a stronger worsening effect on extreme peak flows than a square kilometer of large wetlands with large cas can reduce them 3 4 effect of wetland networks on low flows at the sub watershed outlets and at the outlet of the st charles watershed the relative impacts of isolated and riparian hew networks on low flows are very low except for network iv fig 7 as observed for high flow attenuation the effects of wetland networks are higher at each sub watershed outlet than those at the st charles watershed outlet moreover both isolated and riparian hew networks iv of the hurons lorette and nelson river have higher relative impacts on low flows than the other networks at their outlet focusing on the riparian hew networks we can see that their impacts at the outlet of the st charles watershed is higher on the q2 7 than on the q10 7 and the q5 30 for the isolated and riparian hew networks the higher relative effect at the sub watershed outlets of the hurons and lorette are also noticeable with the wsi and the wcasi at the nelson sub watershed outlet the corresponding impact is also higher than those of the other sub watershed networks but mostly for the riparian networks as observed for high flows while network iv large wetlands with large cas has the highest relative impact on low flows network ii small wetlands with large cas has the highest wsi for isolated wetlands with regards to the wcasi riparian networks i of the hurons st charles and lorette sub watersheds have a high impact on the q2 7 at the outlet of the watershed suggesting that small riparian wetlands with small cas which are often distributed more homogeneously along the river than large wetlands with large cas are efficient at supporting low flow periods however it would require a large number of small riparian wetlands to have an effect similar to that of network iv in some cases riparian networks show a negative relative impact meaning that these networks can decrease discharges or worsen low flows these effects occur mostly during the severe low flow episodes of long return period and duration q10 7 and q5 30 suggesting that riparian wetland networks can help support regular low flows of short duration and return period q2 7 downstream but may have a tendency to worsen more severe low flow periods more precisely the riparian hew networks of the des hurons have the highest low flow support but during low flow periods of long duration 30 days they can also have the highest worsening effect at the outlet of the sub watershed with network iv showing a wsi of 0 0155 m3 s km2 and network iii having a wsi of 0 003 m3 s km2 on the q10 7 and the q5 30 respectively the negative wsi of network iii is also noticeable at the outlet of the st charles watershed located farther downstream this emphasizes the importance of assessing the effect of wetland conservation networks 4 discussion the mathematical modelling of the hydrological services of wetlands have provided strong arguments to scientists land managers and political bodies on the importance of protecting these landscapes evenson et al 2018 ameli and creed 2019 wu et al 2020 nowadays land managers are seeking objective information on the services provided by each wetland to support conservation planning and future land development opening a line of questions such as which wetlands should be protected given their impact at the watershed scale in this study we made the most of the versatility of a hydrological modelling platform and proposed a new framework to assess the hydrological services of isolated and riparian wetlands at the sub watershed and watershed scales we used hydrotel to simulate the impact of wetland networks based on their spatial distribution using the st charles river watershed as a case study we divided the entire dataset of wetlands into eight networks based on their area ca and typology we demonstrated that these characteristics represent good indicators of hydrological services high flow attenuation and low flow support the proposed modelling framework showed that networks iv large isolated and riparian hews with large cas have the strongest relative effects these wetland networks intercept a larger fraction of water flowing at the sub watershed scale compared to the small wetlands with small cas ahlen et al 2020 of network i however our results also suggest that small wetlands with large cas network ii can sometimes have a noticeable effect on stream flows as well especially for isolated wetlands highlighting the importance of including the conservation of cas in the process of land planning previous authors have already argued on the importance of small wetlands on some ecohydrological services small upstream wetlands store water and delay flood peaks more efficiently fossey et al 2016 zedler 2003 on another front with their increased residence time small depressional wetlands have the capacity to remove nutrients metals and other pollutants evenson et al 2018 the distribution of large wetlands in landscapes is typically uneven while small wetlands contributing to landscape heterogeneity are dispersed more continuously making them more available for wetland dependent species small wetlands and cas can modulate other ecological services such as habitats for rare plants waterfowl amphibians or pollinators giving small natural features an ecological importance disproportionate to their size hunter et al 2017 maximizing wetland ecosystem functions requires sites of various sizes types and locations systematic conservation planning addresses this concern by identifying configurations of complementary ecosystems to reach explicit and quantitative objectives while increasing cost effectiveness and reducing the effect of conservation measures on stakeholders cimon morin and poulin 2018 reis et al 2017 wetland scientists have used this approach to prioritize wetland conservation networks and it has proved efficient in bridging the gap between science and land planning decision making cimon morin and poulin 2018 recently applied this approach to the st charles river watershed and concluded that some wetlands of lower ecological values may present features and locations that give them a strong ecological role at landscape scale they suggested including large wetlands of high ecological value as part of conservation networks a priori and selecting small complementary wetlands using the systematic conservation planning approach aside from the size of wetlands and their cas on the attenuation of high flows and the support of low flows our results also highlight the dissimilarities between the networks of different sub watersheds while in the case of high flow attenuation the varying proportions of wetlands and cas covers between sub watersheds can be an explanation table4 it is not clear yet what determines the higher effect of some sub watersheds networks the spatial configuration of wetland networks and their location at the sub watershed scale could further our understanding of the features affecting these differences we reported differences between the typologies of wetland networks isolated vs riparian our results show for example that riparian wetlands have a good capacity for supporting regular low flow episodes q2 7 but can also in rare cases worsen the most severe stream flow indicators q10 7 and q5 30 although model outputs stream flows are associated with uncertainty and extreme low flows can fall under this uncertainty threshold other authors as mentioned by wu et al 2020 have also reported a worsening of stream flow extremes by wetlands in a review on the role of wetlands in the hydrological cycle bullock and acreman 2003 reported that out of 66 studies 27 showed that headwater wetlands increased flood peaks moreover 47 out of 71 studies concluded that wetlands reduce low flows during dry periods as a result of increased evaporation compared to other land types these conclusions raise awareness on the variability of wetlands hydrological services among watersheds wetland typologies and climates and emphasize the need for applied studies including uncertainty analysis over a wide range of conditions they also highlight the importance of clearly defining the stream flow indicators as it is highly related to the performance of the wetland conservation networks the framework proposed in this paper lies on the subdivision of a wetland dataset into eight 8 networks for each sub watershed in order to obtain four 4 networks of equal numbers of isolated wetlands and four 4 networks of equal numbers of riparian wetlands this method although inducing different network definitions among sub watersheds each of them having different thresholds enables the inclusion of the location of wetland networks in the assessment of their hydrological services future work could explore different wetland network definitions such as dividing the entire watershed dataset in groups of equal numbers before separating the sub watersheds wetland networks could also be split into groups of equal area for each sub watershed or for the entire watershed first which would limit the effect of wetland total area between networks on the hydrological services moreover knowing that 64 71 of wetlands have disappeared in the 1900s wetland restoration represents an important land planning objective for stream flow mitigation martinez martinez et al 2014 used the swat model to evaluate the effect of wetland scenarios on peak flows at the watershed and sub watershed scales of the shiawassee river watershed michigan their results showed that large wetlands provided greater stream flow reductions than small wetlands that stream flows were insensitive to wetland depth and wetland placement for wetland areas covering 500 ha in terms of stream order li et al 2021 presented an innovative framework in which they identified on one side priority areas for wetland restoration and on the other side areas of high stormwater resources linking those two types of areas could provide a useful framework to guide wetland restoration by identifying water availability at the watershed scale the customization of hydrological models gives them versatility for wide ranging applications our framework enables the transfer of watershed scale model outputs to a finer scale and may guide decision making when it comes to prioritizing conservation sites in complex landscapes suggested steps provide a better understanding of how individual wetlands provide hydrological services while remaining consistent with the concept of wetlandscapes 5 conclusion wetlands affect stream flows at the watershed scale by reducing high flows and supporting low flows with rising concerns about the importance of wetlands and the increased rate of their losses at global national and local scales scientists have adapted hydrological models to quantify their services at the watershed scale but further adaptations are required to meet the needs of legal bodies for local knowledge here we described a new framework to distribute the assessment of wetland effects by defining wetland networks based on their location typology areas and cas we report differences in the capacity of wetland networks to attenuate high flow indicators and support low flow episodes between networks confirming the relevance of our approach and the importance of the ca on stream flow mitigation our results suggest that a square kilometer of large wetlands with large cas network iv have the strongest relative impact on both high and low flows but a square kilometer of small wetlands with large cas network ii can also have an important effect on mitigating extreme stream flows when using the wetland scenario specific index wsi we also report a much stronger effect of wetland networks at the outlet of a sub watershed than at watershed scale there is room for future work to further our understanding of the factors impacting the variability of hydrological services provided by wetlands including the effect of land cover within cas hydrogeological characteristics and wetland locations at sub watershed scale remembering that hydrology remains an applied science we encourage replicating our approach under various physiographic conditions to draw more robust conclusions on the effect of these spatial characteristics on the hydrological services provided by wetlands relying on the objective and quantitative selection of wetlands to protect our conclusions could help support legal bodies in the application of national wetlands policies worldwide such as the recently adopted bill no 132 in quebec canada credit authorship contribution statement marianne blanchette writing

3483,numerous studies have analyzed how groundwater levels respond to pumping depending on aquifer and well characteristics this study investigates how conversely the pumping capacity of a well depends on hydrogeological and operational conditions the analysis is based on an analytical solution that considers wellbore storage and skin effects the solution depends on aquifer transmissivity aquifer storativity well radius well surface casing radius skin layer transmissivity pumping duration and maximum allowable head change we first conduct a sensitivity analysis of dimensionless pumping capacity to the three dimensionless parameters on which it depends the results show strongly nonlinear relationships and an important effect of wellbore storage for small dimensionless pumping durations since the primary dimensional parameters are the ones that one ultimately needs to characterize or engineer in practice we also conduct a sensitivity analysis of the primary system the results show that besides being trivially linearly related with the maximum allowable head change pumping capacity defined as a volume is almost linearly related with aquifer transmissivity and pumping duration given the broad natural range of transmissivity values transmissivity is the most critical parameter to determine for the estimation of pumping capacity in contrast pumping capacity is little sensitive to aquifer storativity and well radius and so the precise determination of these parameters is less critical finally we investigate the relationship between pumping capacity and specific capacity the latter being a commonly used indicator of the productivity of wells our analysis confirms the previously acknowledged limitation of specific capacity for predicting pumping capacity when the duration of the specific capacity test is much smaller than the operational pumping duration the theoretical insights gained from this study will assist groundwater scientists and

solution such as well losses barker and herbert 1992 houben 2015a houben 2015b houben et al 2018 jacob 1947 parsons 1994 skin layer agarwal et al 1970 bourdet and gringarten 1980 van everdingen 1953 inter aquifer leakage hantush 1960 hantush and jacob 1955 partial well penetration feng et al 2021 hantush 1964 neuman 1974 wellbore storage agarwal et al 1970 bourdet and gringarten 1980 papadopulos and cooper 1967 van everdingen and hurst 1949 unconfined conditions neuman 1972 neuman 1974 fractures barker 1988 bourdet and gringarten 1980 dewandel et al 2018 gringarten et al 1974 hamm and bidaux 1996 kazemi 1969 and random heterogeneity neuman et al 2007 zech et al 2016 by investigating the factors that control how groundwater levels respond to pumping all these studies have provided implicitly some insights about the factors controlling pumping capacity however to facilitate the understanding of pumping capacity we argue that it is useful to investigate how pumping capacity depends on the controlling parameters explicitly and not only implicitly explicit analytical solutions for pumping capacity were presented by dupuit 1863 under steady state and simple boundary conditions a few studies also employed numerical solutions to investigate the influence of complex boundary conditions or geological characteristics on steady state or quasi steady state pumping capacity e g bianchi et al 2020 leray et al 2013 however it usually takes a long time for a stressed system to reach steady state in this study we focus on cases where steady state conditions are not satisfied during the pumping period analytical solutions for pumping capacity under transient conditions can be derived based on existing transient drawdown solutions for example the injection capacity was estimated based on the theis solution in aquifer storage and recovery studies dudding et al 2006 gibson et al 2018 jennings et al 2021 neumann 2012 however the above cited publications focused on case studies and as such they did not thoroughly explore the influence of the controlling parameters in summary the literature currently lacks a comprehensive study of pumping capacity under transient conditions in this work we propose a generic framework to investigate pumping capacity based on transient analytical solutions this framework is generic in that it applies to various aquifer and well configurations we then focus on the case of a fully penetrating well in a confined homogeneous aquifer and accounting for wellbore storage and skin effects in this case the solution for pumping capacity is derived from the agarwal et al 1970 solution for drawdown based on this solution we conduct both dimensionless and dimensional sensitivity analyses of pumping capacity to the controlling parameters the results highlight which parameters are the most influential and which are the least thereby revealing where most efforts should be put in terms of aquifer characterization well design and well operation a common way of characterizing the productivity of existing wells in practice is to refer to their specific capacity defined as the pumping rate divided by the observed head change at the end of a pumping test lohman et al 1970 todd and mays 2005 this quantity has the units of a flow rate per unit head change suggesting that one can estimate the maximum achievable pumping rate by multiplying the specific capacity by the maximum allowable head change ballard 2017 however as the specific capacity depends on pumping duration jacob 1950 the result may be inaccurate if the operational pumping duration is larger than the test pumping duration which is often the case in the final part of this paper we expose the difference between pumping capacity defined herein and specific capacity and investigate the error made with the simple multiplication approach described above 2 methods 2 1 definition of pumping capacity in this work we define pumping capacity as the maximum volume of water that can be extracted or injected from into an aquifer using a well pumped at a constant rate for given operational parameters i e pumping duration and well characteristics under the constraint of a maximum allowable head change an upper limit for the allowable head change always exists for various reasons in the case of extraction this may be to avoid dry wells to prevent confined aquifers from becoming unconfined which could induce clogging through oxygenation in reducing aquifers to reduce land subsidence to minimize ecological impacts etc fig 1 a in the case of injection this may be to prevent fracturing of the confining unit in confined aquifers to avoid artesian conditions in nearby wells to avoid waterlogging or flooding etc fig 1b the time available for pumping i e the pumping duration is also an important controlling parameter because in the absence of a time constraint any large volume of water could be accommodated by pumping over a long time even in a poor aquifer note that we defined pumping capacity as a volume and not as a pumping rate this choice is motivated by our belief that focusing on a volume makes it clearer that pumping duration is part of the controlling parameters than focusing on a rate in any case the two variables are easily related volume rate duration 2 2 generic solution we consider a pumping well in an aquifer where the boundaries are sufficiently far to have a negligible influence on the head change at the well numerous analytical solutions for calculating the head change as a function of time have been developed in this context starting with the theis 1935 solution that assumes a homogeneous confined aquifer an infinitely small well radius and a fully penetrating well later other authors refined this solution by considering the effects of a skin layer van everdingen 1953 partial well penetration hantush 1964 wellbore storage papadopulos and cooper 1967 etc see introduction many of these solutions can be expressed in the form of 1 s q 2 π t w where q is assumed constant and w represents a generic function that depends on one or several parameters depending on which specific conceptual model is adopted all the variables used in this paper are defined in the nomenclature at the beginning of the article here we assume that w does not depend on q thereby neglecting potential nonlinear head losses i e head losses nonlinearly related with q that may occur near or inside the well although not always negligible such head losses are often small relative to other components responsible for the head change at the well houben 2015b a notable exception is the case of ageing wells where clogging frequently occurs and can increase inertial head losses in the gravel pack houben et al 2018 regardless of the specific conceptual model used the head change is always larger at the well than anywhere else therefore it is at the well that the maximum allowable head change will first be reached furthermore the head change is positively correlated with both pumping rate and time therefore the optimal pumping rate that maximizes pumping capacity must be such that the head change at the well at the end of pumping s w end is equal to the maximum allowable head change s max fig 2 this statement provides an equation for the maximum pumping rate as 2 s w end s max using eq 1 we get 3 q max 2 π t s max w r r w t t end the pumping capacity i e the maximum volume of water that can be extracted or injected in the available time is then given by 4 v max q max t end i e 5 v max 2 π t t end s max w r r w t t end this equation is generic to any solution for which the head change can be expressed by eq 1 we define the dimensionless pumping capacity v maxd as 6 v maxd v max v 0 where v 0 2 π t t end s max the dimensionless pumping capacity is thus given by eq 5 7 v maxd 1 w r r w t t end this quantity will be analyzed in the results section 2 3 solution with wellbore storage and skin effect we now focus on the case of a confined homogeneous aquifer without leakage and assume that the well is fully penetrating however we consider the effects of wellbore storage and a potential skin layer fig 3 we include wellbore storage because we aim to investigate a broad range of configurations including cases where wellbore storage cannot be neglected such as in the case of little productive large radius wells pumped over a short period the conditions under which wellbore storage may be neglected are discussed in details in papadopulos and cooper 1967 we also consider a skin layer i e a restricted area immediately beyond the well casing that potentially has a different hydraulic conductivity to that of the aquifer which can have a significant impact on the head change at the well barrash et al 2006 houben 2015b van everdingen 1953 in this study the term skin layer is used generically to represent an area where the hydraulic conductivity is different to that of the aquifer regardless of the underlying cause i e we do not restrict its meaning to the case of a thin layer of low conductivity material deposited along the borehole wall during drilling houben et al 2016 the hydraulic conductivity around the well may be different to that of the aquifer for various reasons this includes for lower conductivity cases particle accumulation at the wellbore wall during or after drilling presence of remnants of fluid additives used for stabilization during drilling and mechanical or biological clogging of the gravel pack or screen slots and for higher conductivity cases presence of a clean coarse grained gravel pack and aquifer permeability increase provoked by fracturing or acidizing all these cases can be effectively conceptualized as an infinitely small skin layer along the well casing agarwal et al 1970 kruseman and de ridder 1991 van everdingen 1953 while the model used here is relatively simple it includes key processes that can also occur in more complex conditions thus our analysis can form a base line for future studies incorporating other effects e g partial well penetration and inter aquifer leakage the potential influence of several effects neglected here is discussed in section 4 3 using the laplace transform agarwal et al 1970 derived a solution for the head change in the well under the conditions described above in this case the function w r r w t t end depends on three dimensionless parameters dimensionless time at the end of pumping wellbore storage coefficient and skin factor defined by 8 t d end t t end r w 2 s 9 c d r c 2 2 r w 2 s 10 σ 1 β 1 ln r s r w where β t s t the nomenclature used here is based on renard 2006 except for β which is introduced here while agarwal et al 1970 presented an analytical expression of the solution its evaluation is challenging in practice it is easier to calculate numerically the inverse laplace transform of the laplace domain solution using a dedicated algorithm such as the stefhest algorithm renard 2020 stefhest 1970 the laplace domain solution is given by agarwal et al 1970 11 l w r r w t d p k 0 p σ p k 1 p p c d p k 0 p 1 σ c d p p k 1 p here the results were produced using this approach i e the stefhest algorithm with the help of the python package hypy renard 2017 in which we implemented the agarwal et al solution 3 results we aim to explore the sensitivity of pumping capacity to the controlling parameters this can be done either in a dimensionless form where v maxd is studied as a function of the dimensionless parameters t d end c d and σ or in a dimensional form where v max is studied as a function of the primary parameters s max t t end s r w r c r s and β the main advantage of the dimensionless analysis is a significant reduction of the number of parameters from eight to three which greatly simplifies the analysis and facilitates comparisons between different systems on the downside the dimensionless analysis fails to provide direct information about the role and importance of the primary parameters which are yet the ones that need to be characterized in the field or engineered appreciating the influence of the primary parameters is indeed not obvious from the results of the dimensionless analysis because most of the primary parameters appear in the definition of several dimensionless parameters eqs 8 10 some also appear in the definition of dimensionless pumping capacity eq 5 for example when s varies both t d end and c d vary and so it would be impossible to appreciate the influence of s from a graph showing the influence of t d end since both types of analyses have their advantage here we present both of them one based on the dimensionless parameters and another one based on the primary parameters 3 1 dimensionless sensitivity analysis before presenting the results we offer physical interpretations of the four dimensionless quantities involved i e v maxd and the three dimensionless parameters the concept of radius of influence is useful for this purpose the radius of influence of a pumping well is the maximum distance from the well up to which the influence of pumping is significant it can be estimated by bresciani et al 2020 lee 1982 vela and mckinley 1970 12 r infl 2 tt s at time t t end 13 r infl end 2 t t end s it follows that the volume v 0 used in the definition of v maxd eq 6 can be expressed as 14 v 0 s max s 2 π r infl end 2 thus v 0 represents the volume of water that would be extracted from or stored into the aquifer if the hydraulic head was uniformly lowered by or raised by s max 2 within the radius of influence at the end of pumping and v maxd is v max normalized by this volume besides t d end eq 8 can be expressed as 15 t d end r infl end 2 r w 2 thus t d end is equal to the square of the ratio of the radius of influence at the end of pumping to twice the well radius c d is equal to the square of the ratio of the surface casing radius to the well radius normalized by 2 s eq 9 thus c d relates in some way to the importance of wellbore storage in comparison with aquifer storage however nonintuitive is the fact that the effect of wellbore storage is independent of the well radius when r c r w eq 9 finally σ eq 10 is an estimation of the normalized head drop across the skin layer under the steady state flow assumption agarwal et al 1970 renard 2020 below section 3 1 1 we first present a local sensitivity analysis where each dimensionless parameter is varied while the other parameters remain fixed at a base case value and the resulting effect on pumping capacity is observed next section 3 1 2 we present a close to global sensitivity analysis where we explore different parameter combinations across the entire parameter space the ranges of values used for t d end c d and σ as well as their base case values are indicated in table 1 these ranges of values encompass a broad spectrum of realistic situations including both favorable and unfavorable conditions for well productivity appendix a 3 1 1 local sensitivity analysis in this section we study the sensitivity of v maxd to the three dimensionless parameters t d end c d and σ individually around a base case defined in table 1 fig 4 the results show that v maxd is negatively correlated with t d end initially decreasing at a linear pace up to about t d end 10 5 and then at a much lower pace following approximately a power law of exponent 0 01 when t d end 10 6 the sensitivity of v maxd to c d is almost opposite v maxd is essentially insensitive to c d for small values of c d c d 10 3 but then it increases with c d for large values of c d c d 10 4 this increase is about linear the high sensitivity of v maxd to t d end for small values of t d end and c d for large values of c d is linked to the wellbore storage effect see section 3 1 2 below the low sensitivity of v maxd to t d end when t d end is relatively large can be related to the well known fact that the well function which gives the normalized drawdown in the absence of wellbore storage and skin layer is approximately equal to a logarithmic function of t d when t d is relatively large cooper and jacob 1946 theis 1935 v maxd is negatively correlated with σ the sensitivity of v maxd to σ is significantly lower than to the other two parameters and it decreases as σ increases in particular v maxd is quite sensitive to σ when σ 0 which correspond to negative skin layers this result may be explained by the fact that the multiplying term 1 β 1 in eq 10 which defines σ is theoretically bounded by 1 in the negative values whereas it does not have any theoretical bound in the positive values this implies that small variations in the negative values of σ correspond to large variations of the skin layer transmissivity and or skin layer external radius for example the lower bound of the range used here σ 5 is only possible when the external radius of the skin layer is more than one hundred times larger than the well radius assuming an infinitely high skin layer transmissivity such a situation can result from the use of aggressive well development methods such as rock fracturing or acidizing hawkins 1956 horne 1995 3 1 2 global sensitivity analysis in this section we analyze the combined influence of t d end and c d on dimensionless pumping capacity using contour plots of v maxd while σ is set to 0 fig 5 in the upper left part of the plot i e when t d end is small and c d is large v maxd displays a uniform sensitivity to t d end and c d decreasing with the former and increasing with the latter the sensitivity of v maxd to c d means that wellbore storage has a significant effect in this region of the parameter space a finer analysis reveals that v maxd c d t d end in this region this result is in line with analytical approximations of the early time behavior in wells with wellbore storage papadopulos and cooper 1967 renard 2020 when t d end is large relative to c d t d end 500 c d the effect of wellbore storage can be neglected papadopulos and cooper 1967 this can be verified in fig 5 from the fact that the contour line v maxd 10 1 is mostly vertical in this region lower right part of the figure implying a lack of sensitivity to c d the influence of t d end on v maxd is visible in this region but it is much lower than in the upper left part of the plot the sensitivity of v maxd to t d end and c d is not much different in the presence of a skin layer not shown 3 2 dimensional sensitivity analysis in this section we aim to present a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of pumping capacity to the primary i e dimensional parameters however the large number of parameters eight makes this task challenging to keep the number of parameters tractable we opt for fixing r c r w and r s 2 r w thereby reducing the number of parameters by two shallow wells typically have a single casing in which case r c would be indeed equal to r w however for deep wells with telescoping casings this assumption would not hold we keep r s fixed because the skin effect also depends on the ratio of skin transmissivity to aquifer transmissivity β which is believed to have more influence although the choice r s 2 r w is subjective it is meaningful since clogging often occurs around the gravel pack houben 2015b houben et al 2016 the ranges of values used for the remaining six parameters s max t t end s r w and β as well as their base case values are indicated in table 2 as in the dimensionless analysis these ranges of values encompass a broad spectrum of realistic situations including both favorable and unfavorable conditions for well productivity appendix a 3 2 1 local sensitivity analysis we first analyze the influence of the controlling parameters on pumping capacity by varying them individually while keeping the other ones fixed at their base case value fig 6 to better understand the relative importance of each parameter the pumping capacity has been normalized by the pumping capacity obtained for the base case furthermore for easier comparison all the results except for t are shown in a single plot fig 6a the influence of t is shown independently because it yields a much broader range of pumping capacity values fig 6b v max is linearly related with s max as can also be directly seen from eq 5 the influence of the other five parameters is a priori less obvious the results show that v max is almost linearly related with both t and t end these relationships are only slightly sublinear the influence of s and r w is more markedly nonlinear however the overall influence of these parameters is much smaller than that of the other parameters this result can be related to the well known approximation of the theis solution for drawdown by a logarithmic function of s and r w at relatively large times cooper and jacob 1946 theis 1935 the influence of β is strongly nonlinear and it causes a significant change in v max especially in the lower half of the tested range of values positive skin layers v max is almost 9 times smaller when β 10 2 as compared to the base case β 1 no skin layer in the upper half of the range the rate of increase in v max is much less where v max increases only by 8 when β increases from 1 to 10 2 of all the parameters t has by far the most influence on v max whereas r w has the least this result can be explained by the facts that t admits a broad range of realistic values covering five orders of magnitude and that it is present at two places in eq 5 once inside the function w and once outside as a multiplying factor the fact that v max is almost proportional to t fig 6b shows that the presence of t as a multiplying factor dominates the overall response to a change in t in contrast r w is only present inside the function w and its range of variations is much smaller hence it is coherent that it only has a small influence 3 2 2 global sensitivity analysis we now study the combined influence of the parameters on pumping capacity through a close to global sensitivity analysis fig 7 the influence of s max is always trivially linear and so to simplify the visualization this parameter is not varied here it is fixed at its base case value we also focus on the case β 1 no skin layer in general the observations made in the local sensitivity analysis are valid regardless of the base case considered the most notable difference occurs when t and t end are small t 10 m2 day and t end 1 day in which case the overall influence of s is more substantial fig 7 however even under these conditions increasing s by more than four orders of magnitude only implies an increase in v max of less than one order of magnitude in contrast pumping capacity is much more sensitive to variations in t and t end mathematically t end and t have equivalent roles see eqs 5 and 8 however as the range of values of t end is smaller than that of t overall t end yields less variations in pumping capacity than t does overall pumping capacity ranges between 1 and 10 8 m3 across the parameter space explored in fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 controlling factors of pumping capacity the dimensionless sensitivity analysis shows that wellbore storage has a critical influence across about half of the dimensionless parameter space fig 5 however a direct extrapolation of this conclusion to the primary dimensional parameters would be somewhat misleading namely the required conditions i e both large t d end and small c d will not be so common because both t d end and c d are similarly correlated to s which implies that they cannot reach the largest and smallest values of their range both at the same time this partly explains why despite the results of the dimensionless sensitivity analysis s and r w do not display much influence across a large part of the parameter space in the dimensional sensitivity analysis fig 7 as already mentioned above the conditions for wellbore storage to be influential write t d end 500 c d i e t end 250 r c 2 t papadopulos and cooper 1967 assuming mid range values for r c and t r c 0 25 m and t 10 1 5 m2 day this gives t end 0 5 days thus under median aquifer and wellbore conditions the influence of wellbore storage will be negligible as soon as the pumping lasts more than half a day in good aquifers t 10 2 m2 day wellbore storage effects will be insignificant for most purposes when the influence of wellbore storage is negligible v maxd varies little with t d end figs 4 and 5 this result is in line with the fact that v max is linearly related with s max and almost linearly related with t and t end figs 6 and 7 this implies that the maximum achievable pumping rate depends little on the time available for pumping indeed q max v max t end eq 4 this outcome may seem surprising at first since according to the theory the head change increases with time the explanation rests in that despite increasing the head change at the well varies at an ever lower pace as time increases fig 2 in fact in the absence of wellbore storage and skin effects the head change varies about logarithmically with time as soon as t d 12 5 cooper and jacob 1946 which includes a large portion of the parameter space table 1 as a practical consequence of this v max may be conveniently considered as being linearly related with t and t end in first approximation i e when carrying out back of the envelope calculations furthermore due to the broad natural range of t values this result implies that v max can vary tremendously depending on t transmissivity was also shown to be the main contributor to well drawdown under steady state conditions barker and herbert 1992 houben 2015a houben 2015b parsons 1994 hence determination of t is critical for pumping capacity estimation in all cases the fact that v max is linearly related with s max also shows that s max is a significant controlling factor of pumping capacity as one could have expected in contrast s has relatively little influence on pumping capacity this result implies that in practice errors in estimates of s are not critical thus in cases where no site specific values of s are available it may be reasonable to simply use literature values based on lithological information notwithstanding this outcome we know that s controls the radius of investigation of a well bourdet and cubitt 2002 bresciani et al 2020 therefore s may also influence pumping capacity by controlling how fast aquifer boundaries neglected in this study would be reached of all the considered parameters r w is the one to which pumping capacity is the least sensitive increasing r w from 0 1 m to 0 4 m only causes 16 increase in the pumping capacity for other parameters fixed at their base case values fig 6a a low influence of r w on pumping capacity was already noted by previous authors under the assumption of steady state flow which implies neglecting wellbore storage effects bear 1979 dupuit 1863 our analysis suggests that this is also valid under transient conditions this is even true in the presence of wellbore storage effects if the well surface casing radius r c is viewed as a parameter that is independent of r w since these effects are controlled by c d t d end r c 2 t t end section 3 1 2 which is independent of r w finally the results show that the presence of a skin layer can significantly affect pumping capacity for a given skin layer external radius a positive skin layer can greatly reduce pumping capacity whereas a negative skin layer does not yield much increase fig 6a also noted by renard 2020 this result reinforces the idea that taking preventive measures against positive skin layers is critically important hawkins 1956 houben 2015b kroening et al 1996 in theory a negative skin layer can greatly enhance pumping capacity but this is only possible when the skin layer external radius is very large relative to the well this can only be achieved through aggressive well development practices such as fracturing and acidizing which are mostly used in the petroleum industry and not water resources applications 4 2 relation between pumping capacity and specific capacity in this section we establish the relationship between pumping capacity and specific capacity and discuss the merits of both concepts with respect to the topic tackled here specific capacity is calculated at the end of a well test as lohman et al 1970 16 γ q test s w test in other words it is a pumping rate per unit head change which suggests that the achievable pumping rate for a given available head change could be estimated by ballard 2017 17 q max approx γ s max however this idea is only accurate if γ is independent of the parameters of the test i e test duration and pumping rate in reality γ depends on test duration lohman et al 1970 but this dependence is probably small since we have found that the maximum achievable pumping rate depends little on the time available for pumping section 4 1 to investigate this question more precisely we replace s w test in eq 16 by its exact expression based on eq 1 to obtain 18 γ 2 π t w r r w t t test this shows that γ is independent of the test pumping rate but not of the test duration the relationship between γ and the exact achievable pumping rate q max can be expressed as combining eqs 18 and 3 19 q max γ s max w r r w t t test w r r w t t end the fraction term on the right hand side is thus representative of the error made on the achievable pumping rate when using eq 17 more rigorously this error can be expressed as 20 q max approx q max q max w r r w t t end w r r w t t test 1 evidently there is no error if the well test duration is the same as the production pumping duration i e if t test t end however any t test value other than t end will imply errors fig 8 illustrates this error for t test ranging between 30 min and 90 days t end all parameter values being those of the base case table 2 specific capacity tests are often conducted for short duration and 30 min is not uncommon richard et al 2016 the error is significant when t test is orders of magnitude lower than t end for t test 30 min and t end 90 days q max approx overestimates q max by 101 however the error decreases rapidly over the first portion of the graph when t test is of the same order of magnitude as t end i e when t test 0 1 t end the error is less than 15 which may be considered acceptable in practice 4 3 relevance and limitations of the proposed framework the framework used in this study is relatively simple thus enabling the derivation of an analytical solution for pumping capacity that only depends on a few parameters this approach is useful for studying the influence of the main controlling factors as shown in this study in addition the solution can be easily implemented for carrying out first order estimations of well pumping capacity in practice this information can be used for site selection purposes when planning the installation of new wells or for evaluating the effect of a change in the operation of existing wells e g increasing pumping duration or performing well redevelopment the limitations of this solution linked to the underlying simplifying assumptions are briefly discussed below the solution used in this study is based on agarwal et al 1970 head change solution which is only strictly valid for homogeneous confined aquifers of infinite extent constant rate pumping fully penetrating well and negligible nonlinear head losses near or inside the well heterogeneities in storativity will cause relatively small differences in the results since even in a homogeneous conceptualization varying s over a broad range of relevant values only imply relatively small variations in pumping capacity section 3 2 1 in principle heterogeneities in transmissivity may cause larger differences in the results however if t is an equivalent homogeneous transmissivity obtained from a pumping test of a duration similar to t end the impact of heterogeneity on pumping capacity calculations will be minimal meier et al 1998 besides nonlinear head losses near or inside the well can also contribute to the drawdown in a well and so ideally they should be accounted for in practice these head losses can be estimated from step drawdown tests jacob 1947 kruseman and de ridder 1991 nonetheless the overall contribution of well losses are often small relative to other head loss components and it can be minimized by the choice of materials and engineering techniques during well construction houben 2015b therefore it will not often dramatically affect the results in contrast the effects of partial well penetration leakage from an upper or lower aquifer and aquifer boundaries when they arise can often be significant in cases where these effects are deemed too important to be neglected the generic framework presented herein section 2 2 may still be used with a more advanced head change solution one could also use numerical modeling and optimization techniques to honor site specific details such as more realistic boundary conditions and subsurface heterogeneities however this approach limits the generic understanding of the influence of the main hydrogeological and operational parameters on well pumping capacity which was the objective in this work although eq 5 is only strictly valid for confined aquifers it also constitutes a reasonable approximation for unconfined aquifers when the hydraulic head change is small relative to the initial saturated thickness of the aquifer bear 1979 one may thus decide whether this solution is reasonable or not for a given unconfined aquifer on the basis of the ratio of the maximum allowable head change to the initial saturated thickness the relative error in transmissivity will be at most equal to this ratio since it will only be reached at the end of the well operation and as a rule of thumb this error can be considered to propagate linearly to the pumping capacity estimate section 4 1 to deal with cases where changes in saturated thickness are significant an alternative solution could also be derived using the jacob 1944 correction that approximately accounts for these changes finally while our analysis is based on constant rate pumping conditions analytical solutions have also been developed for constant head pumping conditions feng and zhan 2019 jacob and lohman 1952 lin and yeh 2020 yang and yeh 2006 in this case the pumping rate is time dependent and the total pumped volume can be found by integration of the pumping rate with time however due to technical difficulties for maintaining a constant head as compared to a constant flow rate in the field constant head pumping is relatively uncommon in practice mishra and guyonnet 1992 rice 1998 for this reason this approach was not retained for this work 5 conclusions this study establishes a fundamental basis for understanding well pumping capacity based on an existing analytical solution for the head change with time an analytical solution for pumping capacity accounting for wellbore storage and skin effects was derived despite its intrinsic limitations this solution is suitable for carrying out a first order assessment of pumping capacity and for obtaining insight on the influence of key controlling parameters within this framework we conducted both dimensionless and dimensional analyses through the dimensionless analysis we found that dimensionless pumping capacity is non linearly related with the three dimensionless parameters t d end c d and σ the influence of t d end and c d on dimensionless pumping capacity is strong in the presence of wellbore storage effects when these effects can be neglected the influence of c d vanishes while t d end retains some influence albeit much lower the skin factor σ causes less change in the dimensionless pumping capacity overall but it has more influence than the other two parameters in the absence of wellbore storage effects through the dimensional analysis we found that pumping capacity is linearly related with s max and almost linearly related with t and t end and thus that the maximum achievable pumping rate depends little on the time available for pumping as the natural variability of t is large determining t is critical for the accurate estimation of pumping capacity in contrast pumping capacity is little sensitive to s and r w thus errors on s and r w may not substantially affect the estimation of pumping capacity the results also show that for a mid range skin layer external radius a positive skin layer can significantly reduce pumping capacity whereas a negative skin layer can only slightly increase pumping capacity therefore it is critically important to take measures against the development of a positive skin layer i e well development and redevelopment at regular intervals water filtration before injection in the case of injection etc to maintain or enhance pumping capacity finally a close look at the concept of specific capacity highlighted the limitations of the latter for predicting pumping capacity when the operational pumping duration is significantly larger than the test duration aside from this limitation specific capacity is a meaningful and practical concept especially when used to compare the relative performance of different wells since pumping tests typically have a similar duration the analytical solution and sensitivity analysis presented in this study can be used for guiding site selection when planning the installation of new wells for example an aquifer scale pumping capacity map can be produced by applying the solution across a target aquifer the results of the sensitivity analysis can also help predicting the relative change in pumping capacity when a change in parameter e g a change in s max t end or β occurs in

here we present relevant ranges of values that the parameters can take in practice starting with the primary i e dimensional parameters and followed by the dimensionless parameters a summary of the parameters values is presented in tables 1 and 2 maximum allowable head change in the case of extraction drawdown at the well is physically limited by the bottom of the well beyond which the well goes dry additional requirements may also be considered to avoid or at least minimize adverse effects such as interference with nearby wells land subsidence ecological impacts etc in which case the maximum allowable head change may be significantly smaller than the bottom of the well consequently we consider that the maximum allowable head change may be between zero and the difference between initial hydraulic head and the bottom of the well perrone and jasechko 2017 reported that 96 of wells in the western united states have a total construction depth of less than 200 m below the land surface as the initial hydraulic head is typically lower than the land surface as a rule of thumb the maximum allowable head change may not often exceed 100 m other types of constraints apply in the case of injection in unconfined aquifers the head build up is essentially constrained by the land surface the water table depth is less than 100 m over most of the globe fan et al 2013 hence the allowable head change in unconfined aquifers will rarely be larger than 100 m in confined aquifers the head build up is essentially constrained by the fracture pressure limit of the upper confining layer which can be estimated from the bulk material density of the layer s present above the aquifer zoback 2007 as a rule of thumb dillon et al 2009 proposed that the pressure head at the base of the confining layer should not exceed 1 5 times the depth of the base of the confining layer below the land surface referring once more to the study by perrone and jasechko 2017 the depth of the base of the confining layer may not often be larger than 100 m since it is necessarily less than the well construction depth hence the maximum allowable pressure head will not often be larger than 150 m as the allowable head change is the difference between maximum allowable pressure head and initial pressure head the allowable head change will often be substantially less than 150 m the above discussion shows that overall the maximum allowable head change will rarely exceed 100 m for both extraction and injection thus in this study we consider maximum allowable head change values in the range 0 100 m transmissivity a relevant range of transmissivity values can be estimated from relevant ranges of values for hydraulic conductivity and saturated thickness hydraulic conductivity may vary over 13 orders of magnitude in nature from 10 9 to 10 4 m day freeze and cherry 1979 however the lower half of this range 10 2 m day has little significance for the purpose of this study because a geologic formation with such a hydraulic conductivity will generally not be considered as forming an aquifer freeze and cherry 1979 hence we discard the lower half we also discard the highest values 10 2 m day because these correspond to formations in which water flow is often non laminar and darcy s law is not valid a reasonable range of aquifer thicknesses is given by freeze and cherry 1979 as 5 100 m sticking to integer orders of magnitude for simplicity we consider saturated thickness values in the range 10 100 m combining the two parameters through t k b we obtain transmissivity values in the range 10 1 10 4 m2 day storativity in confined aquifers storativities are in the range 5 10 5 5 10 3 while in unconfined aquifers they are in the range 10 2 0 3 freeze and cherry 1979 combining these two ranges in a simple continuous range in this study we consider storativity values in the range 10 5 0 3 pumping duration the duration of a continuous well extraction or injection operation may be highly variable depending on the context and objective but it may rarely be under one hour nor will it exceed six months due to weather seasonality thus we consider pumping duration values in the range 0 04 180 days well radius the well radius should be large enough to allow an adequate pump to be installed sterrett 2007 indicated that well radii between 0 1 and 0 4 m are adequate for a wide range of pumping rates i e between 409 and 32 700 m3 day therefore we consider well radius values in this range ratio of skin transmissivity to aquifer transmissivity the skin layer is called a positive skin layer when the material around the wellbore has a lower hydraulic conductivity than the aquifer and negative skin layer otherwise in reference to the sign of σ in both cases eq 10 the presence of a positive skin layer is often due to the detachment of fine aquifer materials such as clay and silt particles and their deposition around the wellbore screen and gravel pack barrash et al 2006 houben 2015b the remnants of drilling fluid additives used for well stabilization during well construction if not removed properly before well operation can also cause a positive skin layer barrash et al 2006 houben 2015b as a result the hydraulic conductivity of the skin layer can be orders of magnitude lower than that of the aquifer on the other hand a negative skin layer develops around the well screen when the well is properly developed well development methods including jetting with water or air mechanical surging etc can remove aggregates around the wellbore thereby enhancing hydraulic conductivity houben 2015b sterrett 2007 in turn the hydraulic conductivity of the skin layer can be orders of magnitude higher than that of the aquifer thus in this study we vary β in the range of 10 2 10 2 dimensionless time recalling eq 8 we see that t d end depends on four parameters t t end r w and s thus we use the range of these four parameters stated above to calculate the range of t d end this calculation gives t d end values between 10 1 10 13 after rounding off to the closest order of magnitude which is used in this study wellbore storage coefficient we calculate the range of values of c d based on eq 9 where c d is seen to depend on s r c and r w the ranges of values for s is discussed above the minimum r c value is taken equal to r w since the well surface casing radius is generally larger than the well radius the maximum value of r c is taken equal to 10 r w considering that a larger value may not be common due to the large cost involved in the construction of large diameter wells under these considerations we obtain c d in the range 1 6 5 10 6 skin factor we calculate the range of values of σ based on eq 10 where σ is seen to depend on β r s and r w the range of values for β is discussed above given that σ varies between negative and positive values the sign being controlled by 1 β 1 the two extreme values of σ are reached when the ratio r s r w is maximal for a positive skin layer this ratio is probably never much larger than the well drilling radius since clogging often occurs around the gravel pack houben 2015b thus r s r w 2 is probably a reasonable maximum value for positive skin layers for a negative skin layer this ratio may be significantly larger when aggressive well development is performed values of the order of r s r w 100 have even been reported hawkins 1956 horne 1995 altogether we obtain σ in the range 5 70 
3483,numerous studies have analyzed how groundwater levels respond to pumping depending on aquifer and well characteristics this study investigates how conversely the pumping capacity of a well depends on hydrogeological and operational conditions the analysis is based on an analytical solution that considers wellbore storage and skin effects the solution depends on aquifer transmissivity aquifer storativity well radius well surface casing radius skin layer transmissivity pumping duration and maximum allowable head change we first conduct a sensitivity analysis of dimensionless pumping capacity to the three dimensionless parameters on which it depends the results show strongly nonlinear relationships and an important effect of wellbore storage for small dimensionless pumping durations since the primary dimensional parameters are the ones that one ultimately needs to characterize or engineer in practice we also conduct a sensitivity analysis of the primary system the results show that besides being trivially linearly related with the maximum allowable head change pumping capacity defined as a volume is almost linearly related with aquifer transmissivity and pumping duration given the broad natural range of transmissivity values transmissivity is the most critical parameter to determine for the estimation of pumping capacity in contrast pumping capacity is little sensitive to aquifer storativity and well radius and so the precise determination of these parameters is less critical finally we investigate the relationship between pumping capacity and specific capacity the latter being a commonly used indicator of the productivity of wells our analysis confirms the previously acknowledged limitation of specific capacity for predicting pumping capacity when the duration of the specific capacity test is much smaller than the operational pumping duration the theoretical insights gained from this study will assist groundwater scientists and

wells are used in a broad range of applications that require extraction and or injection of fluids from into the subsurface activities requiring fluid extraction include irrigation drinking water supply mining and construction i e dewatering groundwater remediation etc ayvaz and karahan 2008 davies et al 2020 johansen et al 2011 lu et al 2019 activities requiring fluid injection include managed aquifer recharge seawater intrusion control wastewater disposal in situ groundwater remediation enhanced oil recovery etc dillon et al 2003 dillon et al 2019 luyun et al 2011 sharma et al 2000 zuurbier et al 2014 in these applications one often needs to make decisions about drilling location and well operation modalities this requires a good understanding of the various factors that control well extraction or injection capacity generically pumping capacity numerous studies analyzed the influence of aquifer and well characteristics on groundwater levels response to pumping dupuit 1863 derived a steady state solution to this problem later theis 1935 presented the first transient solution from this work followed many others that considered various aspects neglected in the theis solution such as well losses barker and herbert 1992 houben 2015a houben 2015b houben et al 2018 jacob 1947 parsons 1994 skin layer agarwal et al 1970 bourdet and gringarten 1980 van everdingen 1953 inter aquifer leakage hantush 1960 hantush and jacob 1955 partial well penetration feng et al 2021 hantush 1964 neuman 1974 wellbore storage agarwal et al 1970 bourdet and gringarten 1980 papadopulos and cooper 1967 van everdingen and hurst 1949 unconfined conditions neuman 1972 neuman 1974 fractures barker 1988 bourdet and gringarten 1980 dewandel et al 2018 gringarten et al 1974 hamm and bidaux 1996 kazemi 1969 and random heterogeneity neuman et al 2007 zech et al 2016 by investigating the factors that control how groundwater levels respond to pumping all these studies have provided implicitly some insights about the factors controlling pumping capacity however to facilitate the understanding of pumping capacity we argue that it is useful to investigate how pumping capacity depends on the controlling parameters explicitly and not only implicitly explicit analytical solutions for pumping capacity were presented by dupuit 1863 under steady state and simple boundary conditions a few studies also employed numerical solutions to investigate the influence of complex boundary conditions or geological characteristics on steady state or quasi steady state pumping capacity e g bianchi et al 2020 leray et al 2013 however it usually takes a long time for a stressed system to reach steady state in this study we focus on cases where steady state conditions are not satisfied during the pumping period analytical solutions for pumping capacity under transient conditions can be derived based on existing transient drawdown solutions for example the injection capacity was estimated based on the theis solution in aquifer storage and recovery studies dudding et al 2006 gibson et al 2018 jennings et al 2021 neumann 2012 however the above cited publications focused on case studies and as such they did not thoroughly explore the influence of the controlling parameters in summary the literature currently lacks a comprehensive study of pumping capacity under transient conditions in this work we propose a generic framework to investigate pumping capacity based on transient analytical solutions this framework is generic in that it applies to various aquifer and well configurations we then focus on the case of a fully penetrating well in a confined homogeneous aquifer and accounting for wellbore storage and skin effects in this case the solution for pumping capacity is derived from the agarwal et al 1970 solution for drawdown based on this solution we conduct both dimensionless and dimensional sensitivity analyses of pumping capacity to the controlling parameters the results highlight which parameters are the most influential and which are the least thereby revealing where most efforts should be put in terms of aquifer characterization well design and well operation a common way of characterizing the productivity of existing wells in practice is to refer to their specific capacity defined as the pumping rate divided by the observed head change at the end of a pumping test lohman et al 1970 todd and mays 2005 this quantity has the units of a flow rate per unit head change suggesting that one can estimate the maximum achievable pumping rate by multiplying the specific capacity by the maximum allowable head change ballard 2017 however as the specific capacity depends on pumping duration jacob 1950 the result may be inaccurate if the operational pumping duration is larger than the test pumping duration which is often the case in the final part of this paper we expose the difference between pumping capacity defined herein and specific capacity and investigate the error made with the simple multiplication approach described above 2 methods 2 1 definition of pumping capacity in this work we define pumping capacity as the maximum volume of water that can be extracted or injected from into an aquifer using a well pumped at a constant rate for given operational parameters i e pumping duration and well characteristics under the constraint of a maximum allowable head change an upper limit for the allowable head change always exists for various reasons in the case of extraction this may be to avoid dry wells to prevent confined aquifers from becoming unconfined which could induce clogging through oxygenation in reducing aquifers to reduce land subsidence to minimize ecological impacts etc fig 1 a in the case of injection this may be to prevent fracturing of the confining unit in confined aquifers to avoid artesian conditions in nearby wells to avoid waterlogging or flooding etc fig 1b the time available for pumping i e the pumping duration is also an important controlling parameter because in the absence of a time constraint any large volume of water could be accommodated by pumping over a long time even in a poor aquifer note that we defined pumping capacity as a volume and not as a pumping rate this choice is motivated by our belief that focusing on a volume makes it clearer that pumping duration is part of the controlling parameters than focusing on a rate in any case the two variables are easily related volume rate duration 2 2 generic solution we consider a pumping well in an aquifer where the boundaries are sufficiently far to have a negligible influence on the head change at the well numerous analytical solutions for calculating the head change as a function of time have been developed in this context starting with the theis 1935 solution that assumes a homogeneous confined aquifer an infinitely small well radius and a fully penetrating well later other authors refined this solution by considering the effects of a skin layer van everdingen 1953 partial well penetration hantush 1964 wellbore storage papadopulos and cooper 1967 etc see introduction many of these solutions can be expressed in the form of 1 s q 2 π t w where q is assumed constant and w represents a generic function that depends on one or several parameters depending on which specific conceptual model is adopted all the variables used in this paper are defined in the nomenclature at the beginning of the article here we assume that w does not depend on q thereby neglecting potential nonlinear head losses i e head losses nonlinearly related with q that may occur near or inside the well although not always negligible such head losses are often small relative to other components responsible for the head change at the well houben 2015b a notable exception is the case of ageing wells where clogging frequently occurs and can increase inertial head losses in the gravel pack houben et al 2018 regardless of the specific conceptual model used the head change is always larger at the well than anywhere else therefore it is at the well that the maximum allowable head change will first be reached furthermore the head change is positively correlated with both pumping rate and time therefore the optimal pumping rate that maximizes pumping capacity must be such that the head change at the well at the end of pumping s w end is equal to the maximum allowable head change s max fig 2 this statement provides an equation for the maximum pumping rate as 2 s w end s max using eq 1 we get 3 q max 2 π t s max w r r w t t end the pumping capacity i e the maximum volume of water that can be extracted or injected in the available time is then given by 4 v max q max t end i e 5 v max 2 π t t end s max w r r w t t end this equation is generic to any solution for which the head change can be expressed by eq 1 we define the dimensionless pumping capacity v maxd as 6 v maxd v max v 0 where v 0 2 π t t end s max the dimensionless pumping capacity is thus given by eq 5 7 v maxd 1 w r r w t t end this quantity will be analyzed in the results section 2 3 solution with wellbore storage and skin effect we now focus on the case of a confined homogeneous aquifer without leakage and assume that the well is fully penetrating however we consider the effects of wellbore storage and a potential skin layer fig 3 we include wellbore storage because we aim to investigate a broad range of configurations including cases where wellbore storage cannot be neglected such as in the case of little productive large radius wells pumped over a short period the conditions under which wellbore storage may be neglected are discussed in details in papadopulos and cooper 1967 we also consider a skin layer i e a restricted area immediately beyond the well casing that potentially has a different hydraulic conductivity to that of the aquifer which can have a significant impact on the head change at the well barrash et al 2006 houben 2015b van everdingen 1953 in this study the term skin layer is used generically to represent an area where the hydraulic conductivity is different to that of the aquifer regardless of the underlying cause i e we do not restrict its meaning to the case of a thin layer of low conductivity material deposited along the borehole wall during drilling houben et al 2016 the hydraulic conductivity around the well may be different to that of the aquifer for various reasons this includes for lower conductivity cases particle accumulation at the wellbore wall during or after drilling presence of remnants of fluid additives used for stabilization during drilling and mechanical or biological clogging of the gravel pack or screen slots and for higher conductivity cases presence of a clean coarse grained gravel pack and aquifer permeability increase provoked by fracturing or acidizing all these cases can be effectively conceptualized as an infinitely small skin layer along the well casing agarwal et al 1970 kruseman and de ridder 1991 van everdingen 1953 while the model used here is relatively simple it includes key processes that can also occur in more complex conditions thus our analysis can form a base line for future studies incorporating other effects e g partial well penetration and inter aquifer leakage the potential influence of several effects neglected here is discussed in section 4 3 using the laplace transform agarwal et al 1970 derived a solution for the head change in the well under the conditions described above in this case the function w r r w t t end depends on three dimensionless parameters dimensionless time at the end of pumping wellbore storage coefficient and skin factor defined by 8 t d end t t end r w 2 s 9 c d r c 2 2 r w 2 s 10 σ 1 β 1 ln r s r w where β t s t the nomenclature used here is based on renard 2006 except for β which is introduced here while agarwal et al 1970 presented an analytical expression of the solution its evaluation is challenging in practice it is easier to calculate numerically the inverse laplace transform of the laplace domain solution using a dedicated algorithm such as the stefhest algorithm renard 2020 stefhest 1970 the laplace domain solution is given by agarwal et al 1970 11 l w r r w t d p k 0 p σ p k 1 p p c d p k 0 p 1 σ c d p p k 1 p here the results were produced using this approach i e the stefhest algorithm with the help of the python package hypy renard 2017 in which we implemented the agarwal et al solution 3 results we aim to explore the sensitivity of pumping capacity to the controlling parameters this can be done either in a dimensionless form where v maxd is studied as a function of the dimensionless parameters t d end c d and σ or in a dimensional form where v max is studied as a function of the primary parameters s max t t end s r w r c r s and β the main advantage of the dimensionless analysis is a significant reduction of the number of parameters from eight to three which greatly simplifies the analysis and facilitates comparisons between different systems on the downside the dimensionless analysis fails to provide direct information about the role and importance of the primary parameters which are yet the ones that need to be characterized in the field or engineered appreciating the influence of the primary parameters is indeed not obvious from the results of the dimensionless analysis because most of the primary parameters appear in the definition of several dimensionless parameters eqs 8 10 some also appear in the definition of dimensionless pumping capacity eq 5 for example when s varies both t d end and c d vary and so it would be impossible to appreciate the influence of s from a graph showing the influence of t d end since both types of analyses have their advantage here we present both of them one based on the dimensionless parameters and another one based on the primary parameters 3 1 dimensionless sensitivity analysis before presenting the results we offer physical interpretations of the four dimensionless quantities involved i e v maxd and the three dimensionless parameters the concept of radius of influence is useful for this purpose the radius of influence of a pumping well is the maximum distance from the well up to which the influence of pumping is significant it can be estimated by bresciani et al 2020 lee 1982 vela and mckinley 1970 12 r infl 2 tt s at time t t end 13 r infl end 2 t t end s it follows that the volume v 0 used in the definition of v maxd eq 6 can be expressed as 14 v 0 s max s 2 π r infl end 2 thus v 0 represents the volume of water that would be extracted from or stored into the aquifer if the hydraulic head was uniformly lowered by or raised by s max 2 within the radius of influence at the end of pumping and v maxd is v max normalized by this volume besides t d end eq 8 can be expressed as 15 t d end r infl end 2 r w 2 thus t d end is equal to the square of the ratio of the radius of influence at the end of pumping to twice the well radius c d is equal to the square of the ratio of the surface casing radius to the well radius normalized by 2 s eq 9 thus c d relates in some way to the importance of wellbore storage in comparison with aquifer storage however nonintuitive is the fact that the effect of wellbore storage is independent of the well radius when r c r w eq 9 finally σ eq 10 is an estimation of the normalized head drop across the skin layer under the steady state flow assumption agarwal et al 1970 renard 2020 below section 3 1 1 we first present a local sensitivity analysis where each dimensionless parameter is varied while the other parameters remain fixed at a base case value and the resulting effect on pumping capacity is observed next section 3 1 2 we present a close to global sensitivity analysis where we explore different parameter combinations across the entire parameter space the ranges of values used for t d end c d and σ as well as their base case values are indicated in table 1 these ranges of values encompass a broad spectrum of realistic situations including both favorable and unfavorable conditions for well productivity appendix a 3 1 1 local sensitivity analysis in this section we study the sensitivity of v maxd to the three dimensionless parameters t d end c d and σ individually around a base case defined in table 1 fig 4 the results show that v maxd is negatively correlated with t d end initially decreasing at a linear pace up to about t d end 10 5 and then at a much lower pace following approximately a power law of exponent 0 01 when t d end 10 6 the sensitivity of v maxd to c d is almost opposite v maxd is essentially insensitive to c d for small values of c d c d 10 3 but then it increases with c d for large values of c d c d 10 4 this increase is about linear the high sensitivity of v maxd to t d end for small values of t d end and c d for large values of c d is linked to the wellbore storage effect see section 3 1 2 below the low sensitivity of v maxd to t d end when t d end is relatively large can be related to the well known fact that the well function which gives the normalized drawdown in the absence of wellbore storage and skin layer is approximately equal to a logarithmic function of t d when t d is relatively large cooper and jacob 1946 theis 1935 v maxd is negatively correlated with σ the sensitivity of v maxd to σ is significantly lower than to the other two parameters and it decreases as σ increases in particular v maxd is quite sensitive to σ when σ 0 which correspond to negative skin layers this result may be explained by the fact that the multiplying term 1 β 1 in eq 10 which defines σ is theoretically bounded by 1 in the negative values whereas it does not have any theoretical bound in the positive values this implies that small variations in the negative values of σ correspond to large variations of the skin layer transmissivity and or skin layer external radius for example the lower bound of the range used here σ 5 is only possible when the external radius of the skin layer is more than one hundred times larger than the well radius assuming an infinitely high skin layer transmissivity such a situation can result from the use of aggressive well development methods such as rock fracturing or acidizing hawkins 1956 horne 1995 3 1 2 global sensitivity analysis in this section we analyze the combined influence of t d end and c d on dimensionless pumping capacity using contour plots of v maxd while σ is set to 0 fig 5 in the upper left part of the plot i e when t d end is small and c d is large v maxd displays a uniform sensitivity to t d end and c d decreasing with the former and increasing with the latter the sensitivity of v maxd to c d means that wellbore storage has a significant effect in this region of the parameter space a finer analysis reveals that v maxd c d t d end in this region this result is in line with analytical approximations of the early time behavior in wells with wellbore storage papadopulos and cooper 1967 renard 2020 when t d end is large relative to c d t d end 500 c d the effect of wellbore storage can be neglected papadopulos and cooper 1967 this can be verified in fig 5 from the fact that the contour line v maxd 10 1 is mostly vertical in this region lower right part of the figure implying a lack of sensitivity to c d the influence of t d end on v maxd is visible in this region but it is much lower than in the upper left part of the plot the sensitivity of v maxd to t d end and c d is not much different in the presence of a skin layer not shown 3 2 dimensional sensitivity analysis in this section we aim to present a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of pumping capacity to the primary i e dimensional parameters however the large number of parameters eight makes this task challenging to keep the number of parameters tractable we opt for fixing r c r w and r s 2 r w thereby reducing the number of parameters by two shallow wells typically have a single casing in which case r c would be indeed equal to r w however for deep wells with telescoping casings this assumption would not hold we keep r s fixed because the skin effect also depends on the ratio of skin transmissivity to aquifer transmissivity β which is believed to have more influence although the choice r s 2 r w is subjective it is meaningful since clogging often occurs around the gravel pack houben 2015b houben et al 2016 the ranges of values used for the remaining six parameters s max t t end s r w and β as well as their base case values are indicated in table 2 as in the dimensionless analysis these ranges of values encompass a broad spectrum of realistic situations including both favorable and unfavorable conditions for well productivity appendix a 3 2 1 local sensitivity analysis we first analyze the influence of the controlling parameters on pumping capacity by varying them individually while keeping the other ones fixed at their base case value fig 6 to better understand the relative importance of each parameter the pumping capacity has been normalized by the pumping capacity obtained for the base case furthermore for easier comparison all the results except for t are shown in a single plot fig 6a the influence of t is shown independently because it yields a much broader range of pumping capacity values fig 6b v max is linearly related with s max as can also be directly seen from eq 5 the influence of the other five parameters is a priori less obvious the results show that v max is almost linearly related with both t and t end these relationships are only slightly sublinear the influence of s and r w is more markedly nonlinear however the overall influence of these parameters is much smaller than that of the other parameters this result can be related to the well known approximation of the theis solution for drawdown by a logarithmic function of s and r w at relatively large times cooper and jacob 1946 theis 1935 the influence of β is strongly nonlinear and it causes a significant change in v max especially in the lower half of the tested range of values positive skin layers v max is almost 9 times smaller when β 10 2 as compared to the base case β 1 no skin layer in the upper half of the range the rate of increase in v max is much less where v max increases only by 8 when β increases from 1 to 10 2 of all the parameters t has by far the most influence on v max whereas r w has the least this result can be explained by the facts that t admits a broad range of realistic values covering five orders of magnitude and that it is present at two places in eq 5 once inside the function w and once outside as a multiplying factor the fact that v max is almost proportional to t fig 6b shows that the presence of t as a multiplying factor dominates the overall response to a change in t in contrast r w is only present inside the function w and its range of variations is much smaller hence it is coherent that it only has a small influence 3 2 2 global sensitivity analysis we now study the combined influence of the parameters on pumping capacity through a close to global sensitivity analysis fig 7 the influence of s max is always trivially linear and so to simplify the visualization this parameter is not varied here it is fixed at its base case value we also focus on the case β 1 no skin layer in general the observations made in the local sensitivity analysis are valid regardless of the base case considered the most notable difference occurs when t and t end are small t 10 m2 day and t end 1 day in which case the overall influence of s is more substantial fig 7 however even under these conditions increasing s by more than four orders of magnitude only implies an increase in v max of less than one order of magnitude in contrast pumping capacity is much more sensitive to variations in t and t end mathematically t end and t have equivalent roles see eqs 5 and 8 however as the range of values of t end is smaller than that of t overall t end yields less variations in pumping capacity than t does overall pumping capacity ranges between 1 and 10 8 m3 across the parameter space explored in fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 controlling factors of pumping capacity the dimensionless sensitivity analysis shows that wellbore storage has a critical influence across about half of the dimensionless parameter space fig 5 however a direct extrapolation of this conclusion to the primary dimensional parameters would be somewhat misleading namely the required conditions i e both large t d end and small c d will not be so common because both t d end and c d are similarly correlated to s which implies that they cannot reach the largest and smallest values of their range both at the same time this partly explains why despite the results of the dimensionless sensitivity analysis s and r w do not display much influence across a large part of the parameter space in the dimensional sensitivity analysis fig 7 as already mentioned above the conditions for wellbore storage to be influential write t d end 500 c d i e t end 250 r c 2 t papadopulos and cooper 1967 assuming mid range values for r c and t r c 0 25 m and t 10 1 5 m2 day this gives t end 0 5 days thus under median aquifer and wellbore conditions the influence of wellbore storage will be negligible as soon as the pumping lasts more than half a day in good aquifers t 10 2 m2 day wellbore storage effects will be insignificant for most purposes when the influence of wellbore storage is negligible v maxd varies little with t d end figs 4 and 5 this result is in line with the fact that v max is linearly related with s max and almost linearly related with t and t end figs 6 and 7 this implies that the maximum achievable pumping rate depends little on the time available for pumping indeed q max v max t end eq 4 this outcome may seem surprising at first since according to the theory the head change increases with time the explanation rests in that despite increasing the head change at the well varies at an ever lower pace as time increases fig 2 in fact in the absence of wellbore storage and skin effects the head change varies about logarithmically with time as soon as t d 12 5 cooper and jacob 1946 which includes a large portion of the parameter space table 1 as a practical consequence of this v max may be conveniently considered as being linearly related with t and t end in first approximation i e when carrying out back of the envelope calculations furthermore due to the broad natural range of t values this result implies that v max can vary tremendously depending on t transmissivity was also shown to be the main contributor to well drawdown under steady state conditions barker and herbert 1992 houben 2015a houben 2015b parsons 1994 hence determination of t is critical for pumping capacity estimation in all cases the fact that v max is linearly related with s max also shows that s max is a significant controlling factor of pumping capacity as one could have expected in contrast s has relatively little influence on pumping capacity this result implies that in practice errors in estimates of s are not critical thus in cases where no site specific values of s are available it may be reasonable to simply use literature values based on lithological information notwithstanding this outcome we know that s controls the radius of investigation of a well bourdet and cubitt 2002 bresciani et al 2020 therefore s may also influence pumping capacity by controlling how fast aquifer boundaries neglected in this study would be reached of all the considered parameters r w is the one to which pumping capacity is the least sensitive increasing r w from 0 1 m to 0 4 m only causes 16 increase in the pumping capacity for other parameters fixed at their base case values fig 6a a low influence of r w on pumping capacity was already noted by previous authors under the assumption of steady state flow which implies neglecting wellbore storage effects bear 1979 dupuit 1863 our analysis suggests that this is also valid under transient conditions this is even true in the presence of wellbore storage effects if the well surface casing radius r c is viewed as a parameter that is independent of r w since these effects are controlled by c d t d end r c 2 t t end section 3 1 2 which is independent of r w finally the results show that the presence of a skin layer can significantly affect pumping capacity for a given skin layer external radius a positive skin layer can greatly reduce pumping capacity whereas a negative skin layer does not yield much increase fig 6a also noted by renard 2020 this result reinforces the idea that taking preventive measures against positive skin layers is critically important hawkins 1956 houben 2015b kroening et al 1996 in theory a negative skin layer can greatly enhance pumping capacity but this is only possible when the skin layer external radius is very large relative to the well this can only be achieved through aggressive well development practices such as fracturing and acidizing which are mostly used in the petroleum industry and not water resources applications 4 2 relation between pumping capacity and specific capacity in this section we establish the relationship between pumping capacity and specific capacity and discuss the merits of both concepts with respect to the topic tackled here specific capacity is calculated at the end of a well test as lohman et al 1970 16 γ q test s w test in other words it is a pumping rate per unit head change which suggests that the achievable pumping rate for a given available head change could be estimated by ballard 2017 17 q max approx γ s max however this idea is only accurate if γ is independent of the parameters of the test i e test duration and pumping rate in reality γ depends on test duration lohman et al 1970 but this dependence is probably small since we have found that the maximum achievable pumping rate depends little on the time available for pumping section 4 1 to investigate this question more precisely we replace s w test in eq 16 by its exact expression based on eq 1 to obtain 18 γ 2 π t w r r w t t test this shows that γ is independent of the test pumping rate but not of the test duration the relationship between γ and the exact achievable pumping rate q max can be expressed as combining eqs 18 and 3 19 q max γ s max w r r w t t test w r r w t t end the fraction term on the right hand side is thus representative of the error made on the achievable pumping rate when using eq 17 more rigorously this error can be expressed as 20 q max approx q max q max w r r w t t end w r r w t t test 1 evidently there is no error if the well test duration is the same as the production pumping duration i e if t test t end however any t test value other than t end will imply errors fig 8 illustrates this error for t test ranging between 30 min and 90 days t end all parameter values being those of the base case table 2 specific capacity tests are often conducted for short duration and 30 min is not uncommon richard et al 2016 the error is significant when t test is orders of magnitude lower than t end for t test 30 min and t end 90 days q max approx overestimates q max by 101 however the error decreases rapidly over the first portion of the graph when t test is of the same order of magnitude as t end i e when t test 0 1 t end the error is less than 15 which may be considered acceptable in practice 4 3 relevance and limitations of the proposed framework the framework used in this study is relatively simple thus enabling the derivation of an analytical solution for pumping capacity that only depends on a few parameters this approach is useful for studying the influence of the main controlling factors as shown in this study in addition the solution can be easily implemented for carrying out first order estimations of well pumping capacity in practice this information can be used for site selection purposes when planning the installation of new wells or for evaluating the effect of a change in the operation of existing wells e g increasing pumping duration or performing well redevelopment the limitations of this solution linked to the underlying simplifying assumptions are briefly discussed below the solution used in this study is based on agarwal et al 1970 head change solution which is only strictly valid for homogeneous confined aquifers of infinite extent constant rate pumping fully penetrating well and negligible nonlinear head losses near or inside the well heterogeneities in storativity will cause relatively small differences in the results since even in a homogeneous conceptualization varying s over a broad range of relevant values only imply relatively small variations in pumping capacity section 3 2 1 in principle heterogeneities in transmissivity may cause larger differences in the results however if t is an equivalent homogeneous transmissivity obtained from a pumping test of a duration similar to t end the impact of heterogeneity on pumping capacity calculations will be minimal meier et al 1998 besides nonlinear head losses near or inside the well can also contribute to the drawdown in a well and so ideally they should be accounted for in practice these head losses can be estimated from step drawdown tests jacob 1947 kruseman and de ridder 1991 nonetheless the overall contribution of well losses are often small relative to other head loss components and it can be minimized by the choice of materials and engineering techniques during well construction houben 2015b therefore it will not often dramatically affect the results in contrast the effects of partial well penetration leakage from an upper or lower aquifer and aquifer boundaries when they arise can often be significant in cases where these effects are deemed too important to be neglected the generic framework presented herein section 2 2 may still be used with a more advanced head change solution one could also use numerical modeling and optimization techniques to honor site specific details such as more realistic boundary conditions and subsurface heterogeneities however this approach limits the generic understanding of the influence of the main hydrogeological and operational parameters on well pumping capacity which was the objective in this work although eq 5 is only strictly valid for confined aquifers it also constitutes a reasonable approximation for unconfined aquifers when the hydraulic head change is small relative to the initial saturated thickness of the aquifer bear 1979 one may thus decide whether this solution is reasonable or not for a given unconfined aquifer on the basis of the ratio of the maximum allowable head change to the initial saturated thickness the relative error in transmissivity will be at most equal to this ratio since it will only be reached at the end of the well operation and as a rule of thumb this error can be considered to propagate linearly to the pumping capacity estimate section 4 1 to deal with cases where changes in saturated thickness are significant an alternative solution could also be derived using the jacob 1944 correction that approximately accounts for these changes finally while our analysis is based on constant rate pumping conditions analytical solutions have also been developed for constant head pumping conditions feng and zhan 2019 jacob and lohman 1952 lin and yeh 2020 yang and yeh 2006 in this case the pumping rate is time dependent and the total pumped volume can be found by integration of the pumping rate with time however due to technical difficulties for maintaining a constant head as compared to a constant flow rate in the field constant head pumping is relatively uncommon in practice mishra and guyonnet 1992 rice 1998 for this reason this approach was not retained for this work 5 conclusions this study establishes a fundamental basis for understanding well pumping capacity based on an existing analytical solution for the head change with time an analytical solution for pumping capacity accounting for wellbore storage and skin effects was derived despite its intrinsic limitations this solution is suitable for carrying out a first order assessment of pumping capacity and for obtaining insight on the influence of key controlling parameters within this framework we conducted both dimensionless and dimensional analyses through the dimensionless analysis we found that dimensionless pumping capacity is non linearly related with the three dimensionless parameters t d end c d and σ the influence of t d end and c d on dimensionless pumping capacity is strong in the presence of wellbore storage effects when these effects can be neglected the influence of c d vanishes while t d end retains some influence albeit much lower the skin factor σ causes less change in the dimensionless pumping capacity overall but it has more influence than the other two parameters in the absence of wellbore storage effects through the dimensional analysis we found that pumping capacity is linearly related with s max and almost linearly related with t and t end and thus that the maximum achievable pumping rate depends little on the time available for pumping as the natural variability of t is large determining t is critical for the accurate estimation of pumping capacity in contrast pumping capacity is little sensitive to s and r w thus errors on s and r w may not substantially affect the estimation of pumping capacity the results also show that for a mid range skin layer external radius a positive skin layer can significantly reduce pumping capacity whereas a negative skin layer can only slightly increase pumping capacity therefore it is critically important to take measures against the development of a positive skin layer i e well development and redevelopment at regular intervals water filtration before injection in the case of injection etc to maintain or enhance pumping capacity finally a close look at the concept of specific capacity highlighted the limitations of the latter for predicting pumping capacity when the operational pumping duration is significantly larger than the test duration aside from this limitation specific capacity is a meaningful and practical concept especially when used to compare the relative performance of different wells since pumping tests typically have a similar duration the analytical solution and sensitivity analysis presented in this study can be used for guiding site selection when planning the installation of new wells for example an aquifer scale pumping capacity map can be produced by applying the solution across a target aquifer the results of the sensitivity analysis can also help predicting the relative change in pumping capacity when a change in parameter e g a change in s max t end or β occurs in existing wells some of which can be controlled thus the knowledge gained from this study can assist decision making in applications that require pumping from wells which is important for most

project and the minnesota environment and natural resources trust fund as recommended by the legislative citizen commission on minnesota resources lccmr appendix a relevant ranges of parameter values here we present relevant ranges of values that the parameters can take in practice starting with the primary i e dimensional parameters and followed by the dimensionless parameters a summary of the parameters values is presented in tables 1 and 2 maximum allowable head change in the case of extraction drawdown at the well is physically limited by the bottom of the well beyond which the well goes dry additional requirements may also be considered to avoid or at least minimize adverse effects such as interference with nearby wells land subsidence ecological impacts etc in which case the maximum allowable head change may be significantly smaller than the bottom of the well consequently we consider that the maximum allowable head change may be between zero and the difference between initial hydraulic head and the bottom of the well perrone and jasechko 2017 reported that 96 of wells in the western united states have a total construction depth of less than 200 m below the land surface as the initial hydraulic head is typically lower than the land surface as a rule of thumb the maximum allowable head change may not often exceed 100 m other types of constraints apply in the case of injection in unconfined aquifers the head build up is essentially constrained by the land surface the water table depth is less than 100 m over most of the globe fan et al 2013 hence the allowable head change in unconfined aquifers will rarely be larger than 100 m in confined aquifers the head build up is essentially constrained by the fracture pressure limit of the upper confining layer which can be estimated from the bulk material density of the layer s present above the aquifer zoback 2007 as a rule of thumb dillon et al 2009 proposed that the pressure head at the base of the confining layer should not exceed 1 5 times the depth of the base of the confining layer below the land surface referring once more to the study by perrone and jasechko 2017 the depth of the base of the confining layer may not often be larger than 100 m since it is necessarily less than the well construction depth hence the maximum allowable pressure head will not often be larger than 150 m as the allowable head change is the difference between maximum allowable pressure head and initial pressure head the allowable head change will often be substantially less than 150 m the above discussion shows that overall the maximum allowable head change will rarely exceed 100 m for both extraction and injection thus in this study we consider maximum allowable head change values in the range 0 100 m transmissivity a relevant range of transmissivity values can be estimated from relevant ranges of values for hydraulic conductivity and saturated thickness hydraulic conductivity may vary over 13 orders of magnitude in nature from 10 9 to 10 4 m day freeze and cherry 1979 however the lower half of this range 10 2 m day has little significance for the purpose of this study because a geologic formation with such a hydraulic conductivity will generally not be considered as forming an aquifer freeze and cherry 1979 hence we discard the lower half we also discard the highest values 10 2 m day because these correspond to formations in which water flow is often non laminar and darcy s law is not valid a reasonable range of aquifer thicknesses is given by freeze and cherry 1979 as 5 100 m sticking to integer orders of magnitude for simplicity we consider saturated thickness values in the range 10 100 m combining the two parameters through t k b we obtain transmissivity values in the range 10 1 10 4 m2 day storativity in confined aquifers storativities are in the range 5 10 5 5 10 3 while in unconfined aquifers they are in the range 10 2 0 3 freeze and cherry 1979 combining these two ranges in a simple continuous range in this study we consider storativity values in the range 10 5 0 3 pumping duration the duration of a continuous well extraction or injection operation may be highly variable depending on the context and objective but it may rarely be under one hour nor will it exceed six months due to weather seasonality thus we consider pumping duration values in the range 0 04 180 days well radius the well radius should be large enough to allow an adequate pump to be installed sterrett 2007 indicated that well radii between 0 1 and 0 4 m are adequate for a wide range of pumping rates i e between 409 and 32 700 m3 day therefore we consider well radius values in this range ratio of skin transmissivity to aquifer transmissivity the skin layer is called a positive skin layer when the material around the wellbore has a lower hydraulic conductivity than the aquifer and negative skin layer otherwise in reference to the sign of σ in both cases eq 10 the presence of a positive skin layer is often due to the detachment of fine aquifer materials such as clay and silt particles and their deposition around the wellbore screen and gravel pack barrash et al 2006 houben 2015b the remnants of drilling fluid additives used for well stabilization during well construction if not removed properly before well operation can also cause a positive skin layer barrash et al 2006 houben 2015b as a result the hydraulic conductivity of the skin layer can be orders of magnitude lower than that of the aquifer on the other hand a negative skin layer develops around the well screen when the well is properly developed well development methods including jetting with water or air mechanical surging etc can remove aggregates around the wellbore thereby enhancing hydraulic conductivity houben 2015b sterrett 2007 in turn the hydraulic conductivity of the skin layer can be orders of magnitude higher than that of the aquifer thus in this study we vary β in the range of 10 2 10 2 dimensionless time recalling eq 8 we see that t d end depends on four parameters t t end r w and s thus we use the range of these four parameters stated above to calculate the range of t d end this calculation gives t d end values between 10 1 10 13 after rounding off to the closest order of magnitude which is used in this study wellbore storage coefficient we calculate the range of values of c d based on eq 9 where c d is seen to depend on s r c and r w the ranges of values for s is discussed above the minimum r c value is taken equal to r w since the well surface casing radius is generally larger than the well radius the maximum value of r c is taken equal to 10 r w considering that a larger value may not be common due to the large cost involved in the construction of large diameter wells under these considerations we obtain c d in the range 1 6 5 10 6 skin factor we calculate the range of values of σ based on eq 10 where σ is seen to depend on β r s and r w the range of values for β is discussed above given that σ varies between negative and positive values the sign being controlled by 1 β 1 the two extreme values of σ are reached when the ratio r s r w is maximal for a positive skin layer this ratio is probably never much larger than the well drilling radius since clogging often occurs around the gravel pack houben 2015b thus r s r w 2 is probably a reasonable maximum value for positive skin layers for a negative skin layer this ratio may be significantly larger when aggressive well development is performed values of the order of r s r w 100 have even been reported hawkins 1956 horne 1995 altogether we obtain σ in the range 5 70 
3484,a semi analytical solution is developed for drawdown of transient confined unconfined flow towards a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer the proposed solution considers the aquifer anisotropy and the drainage from the unsaturated zone above the water table in the transient unconfined region based on the work by moench 1995 the parameter of γ related to vertical hydraulic conductivity aquifer thickness specific yield and a delayed coefficient is introduced to investigate the delayed responses of flow behaviours i e drawdown and development of the transient unconfined region the results indicate that the flow behaviours simulations by the proposed solution are identical to that by visual modflow flex and finite difference method the drawdown delayed responses occur in the early and intermediate segments and disappear at the late segment during the transient confined unconfined conversion the increasing of the vertical hydraulic conductivity and the delayed coefficient can decrease the drawdown and limit the development of transient unconfined region thus and postpone the time of transient confined unconfined conversion in a radial distance the release of water by gravity storage nearby the piezometer surface is quick resulting in an obvious log log s shaped drawdown time curve as buried depth increases the effect of artesian storage is more

useful field experiments to determine the confined aquifer properties the hydraulic head is declined as pumping starts when the pumping rate or pumping time is sufficiently large or the aquifer transmissivity is sufficiently small the water level in the confined aquifer can drop below the overlaying aquitard and an unconfined region instantaneously develops nearby the pumping well such transient confined unconfined conversion has been concerned by the hydrogeologists since 1980 s and many investigations have been done for numerical and analytical modelling of the flow mechanism in the transient confined unconfined aquifer e g moench and prickett 1972 wang and zhan 2009 xiao et al 2018 however it is noted that the former researches are all done on the basis of dupuit s assumption it considers the water in the unconfined region is only released by gravity storage and the slope of the phreatic surface is negligibly small the equipotential lines are vertical and the pumping induced flow is essentially horizontal in two dimensions thus the existing solutions based on dupuit s assumption are found to be invalid when the drawdown is sufficiently large by comparing with the thickness of the unconfined region xiao et al 2018 and are fail to account for the delayed response of the drawdown behaviours in the unconfined region although the pumping induced unconfined flow problems with drawdown delayed responses due to effect of different storages have been investigated extensively in the last five decades e g boulton 1954 kroszynski and dagan 1975 moench 1995 neuman 1972 1973 it appears that none of the solutions take consideration of the effect of drawdown delayed responses on transient confined unconfined flow different from the infinite unconfined aquifer flow mechanism of drawdown delayed responses during the transient confined unconfined conversion is assumed to be more complicated due to the transient unconfined region is finite and is developed as pumping continues hence a further investigation of drawdown delayed effect on transient confined unconfined flow is crucial for accurate assessment of aquifer properties by drawdown in case of heavy pumping in reality physically speaking the drawdown time curve of an infinite unconfined flow in the log log scale can be divided into three segments in the early segment the water is released from artesian compressible storage instantaneously due to head drops after pumping starts in intermediate segment a delayed drawdown response can be observed suggesting an additional water source storage following some time delay in the late segment the combined effect of both storage mechanisms controls the drawdown behaviours moench 2004 it makes that the drawdown time curve is generally presented with s shape in the unconfined aquifer to our knowledge the most popular classical mechanistic models of such drawdown delayed responses are those of boulton 1954 boulton 1955 kroszynski and dagan 1975 moench 1995 neuman 1972 1973 the pioneering mechanistic model was developed by boulton 1954 for fully penetrated unconfined aquifer the work assumed the water table was a moving material boundary in the saturated flow domain under combined actions of differential pressure and gravity storage the flow can include both horizontally and vertically components dagan 1967 further investigated the effect of partially penetrating well based on the work of boulton 1954 however tartakovsky and neuman 2007 pointed out that the boulton 1954 model neglected the compressibility of the saturated zone below the water table and considered the artesian storage through inclusion of the compressive storativity it leaded that the boulton 1954 model could not be used to account for the drawdown in the early segment boulton 1955 proposed a semi empirical mathematical modelling of delayed yield based on conceptually and mathematically equivalent to that of a dual porosity model for flow through fractured rocks the boulton s 1955 solution considered that the flow occurred horizontally and the water due to the drop of hydraulic head was released from both artesian and gravity storage components the volume of water from compressible storage was released instantaneously at time whereas the water released from gravity storage was delayed in time an empirical parameter of σ was introduced as delayed coefficient of drainage from gravity storage however the physical mean of σ have been unclear so far similar models were also reported by boulton 1970 and boulton and pontin 1971 the flow in boulton s 1955 solution was depicted by a 2d governing equation with a constant horizontal transmissivity hence it was fail to determine the vertical conductivity neuman 1972 1973 proposed another mechanistic model for analysis of the drawdown delayed response similar to the work of boulton 1954 neuman s model contained both horizontal and vertical flow components otherwise neuman s mechanistic model also included the effect of compressibility and assumed that the drainage from the zone above the water table took place instantaneously responding to the drawdown the approach based on neuman s mechanistic model could characterize the early stage with gradual increasing drawdown moench 1993 noticed that the neuman 1972 1973 model requested large amount of computation time and may produce inaccurate results for selected combinations of parameters kroszynski and dagan 1975 recognized that the flow in the unconfined aquifer was conditioned by the saturated flow below the water table and the unsaturated flow above it in the unsaturated zone the flow was governed by a linearized richards equation and the volumetric soil moisture and the relative hydraulic conductivity were represented by exponential functions of pressure head above the top of capillary fringe based on the unsaturated model by kroszynski and dagan 1975 mathias and butler 2006 proposed a related solution for one dimensional vertical flow through the unsaturated zone tartakovsky and neuman 2007 and mishra and neuman 2010 further investigated the effect of three dimensional unsaturated flow during crt towards the fully and partially penetrating pumping well respectively after then some studies have been done for investigation of such effect of unsaturated zone on the pumping induced flow in the unconfined aquifer in recent years e g chang et al 2018 liang et al 2017 liang et al 2018 moench 1995 combined the boulton 1954 convolution integral for delayed drainage with the neuman 1972 1974 model to improve the match between theoretical type curves and drawdown time curve from fieldwork by moench 1995 model the parameter of σ was re defined as a property of the aquifer rather than an empirical one moench 1995 model have been proved to be fitted to simulate well the drawdowns measured from pumping tests in mildly heterogeneous aquifers however moench 1995 noticed that the theoretical basis of his work was weak due to the ambiguous definition of σ parameter after then moench et al 2001 used a finite series of m exponential terms of σ i e σ m to replace only one of moench 1995 model to further improve the theoretical type curves to fitting the drawdown data from the aquifer at on cape cod massachusetts usa to investigate acceptability of the above mentioned delayed flow mechanics in the reality moench 2008 presented analytical and numerical analyses of an unconfined aquifer test at canadian forces base borden in ontario canada and pointed out that the estimations of hydraulic parameters at borden site were accepted by both the solutions based on moench 1995 model and kroszynski and dagan 1975 model however moench 2008 argued the assumption that the moisture retention exponent was equal to the relative hydraulic conductivity exponent by the solutions based on kroszynski and dagan 1975 model mathias and butler 2006 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 mishra and neuman 2010 and suggested that the relative hydraulic conductivity function must contain a fitting parameter that was different from the fitting parameter used in the soil moisture distribution function the purpose of this paper is to present an exact solution for the drawdown delayed problem during the transient confined unconfined conversion in a fully penetrated confined aquifer rendering the aquifer anisotropy a linear diffusion equation with vertical flow component is introduced to replace the boussinesq equation to depict the transient flow in the unconfined region whereas the transient flow in confined region without vertical flow component is governed by a two dimensional linear diffusion equation considering the drainage released from gravity storage is delayed in time the exponentially decaying rate introduced by moench 1995 model is proved to simulate the drawdown delayed response well during infinite unconfined flow thus it is used to depict the upper boundary condition at piezometer surface in the transient unconfined region in the paper the initial value problem of modelling of the transient confined unconfined flow is solved by laplace transform the delayed responses of drawdown simulation and development of transient unconfined region are investigated 2 mathematical model for easy comparisons the assumptions required for mathematical modelling are similar to those given by moench 1995 as follows 1 the aquifer has a uniform thickness and extents homogeneously and infinitely in the horizontal direction 2 the aquifer is anisotropic and the principal directions of the hydraulic conductivity tensor are parallel to the coordinate axes 3 the confined aquifer is fully penetrated by the pumping and observation wells with infinitesimal in diameter 4 vertical flow across the lower boundary of the aquifer is negligible and the confined aquifer is discharged at a constant rate from a specified zone below an initially horizontal water table the schematic diagram of transient confined unconfined flow towards a fully penetrating well in a nonleaky confined aquifer is shown in fig 1 as the pumping starts the well flow is fully confined and the hydraulic head keeps decreasing with time when the hydraulic head in the pumping well hw falls below the top of confined aquifer which can be expressed as 0 h w b where b is the thickness of the confined aquifer l an unconfined flow immediately develops in the area with a radial distance of 0 r r where r is the radial distance from the pumping well l and r is the radial distance of transient conversion interface from the pumping well l the transient confined unconfined flow can be depicted by following mathematical models in the unconfined region

b r h 1 r z t r q where q is the constant pumping rate l3 t based on the work by moench 1995 it is assumed that the zone above the water table is incompressible and the drainage from the unsaturated zone is released gradually the flow through the piezometer surface is equal to the delayed drainage from the fine grained unsaturated zone above the water table the boundary condition at the upper surfaces can be expressed as 4 k z h 1 r b t z α 1 s y 0 t h 1 r b t t e α 1 t t d t where α 1 is the empirical constant for drainage from the unsaturated zone when the value of α 1 is large the amount of water released in the time period from 0 to t is large s y is the specific yield of the unconfined region the theoretical justification of equation 4 for analysis of unconfined flow with drawdown delayed responses have been provided by moench 1995 2001 2008 the boundary condition at the lower surface is 5 h 1 r 0 t z 0 in the confined region h 0 h 2 b r r the transient flow is

head due to the unknown r d value in the paper r d value is used to characterize the dynamic development of the transient unconfined region with time hence the r d value at each given time point of interest is essential to be determined according to equation 8 the flow continuity at the transient confined unconfined conversion interface in laplace domain is dimensionless expressed as 31 s d 1 r

towards the observation well with a given r d 1 distance fig 1 can be simulated by the following procedures as 1 based on given parameters one can evaluate the r d time curve by using equations 24 and 32 2 if r d r d 1 the transient flow is under the confined condition and s d is simulated by equation 30 i e s d s d 1 3 if r d r d 1 the flow toward the observation well is unconfined the average drawdown over all the observation screen is assessed by equation 23 and the drawdown at a given vertical point z d can be evaluated by equation 26 i e s d s d 2 it is noted that equations 23 26 30 and 32 can be numerically inversed by de hoog et al 1982 method to obtain the dimensionless drawdown in normal time domain 5 verification and discussion in the section the acceptability of the proposed solution of drawdown simulation are verified by comparison with the numerical solutions by finite difference method fdm and visual modflow flex via a hypothetical case study moreover the effect of delayed responses on drawdown and development of transient unconfined the region is especially discussed the derivation of the fdm solution is given in supporting information c a matlab program is developed to perform the proposed and fdm solutions automatically 5 1 verification the variably saturated flow modelling is one of the most effective methods to investigate the gravity delayed drainage from the unsaturated zone in the unconfined aquifer chang et al 2018 in the paper the variably saturated flow modelling is performed by the variably saturated flow vsf process of visual modflow flex harbaugh and others 2000 with richards equation thoms et al 2006 the parameters of the hypothetical case are listed in table 2 it is noted that the α v β v and s wr are the parameters of van genuchten model 1980 the parameter α v is a measure of the first moment of pore size density function β v is an inverse measure of the second moment of the pore size density function with a positive value greater than 1 and s wr is defined as 1 1 β v to represent the degree of saturation of water the hypothetical case study is assumed to occupy a domain size of 100 m 100 m 30 m with twenty layers each layer is refined by 50 rows and 50 columns the pumping well is situated at the point with the coordinate of x 45 and y 50 and the two observation wells with r 1 10 m and r 2 8 m are locating in the points with the coordinate of x 55 and y 50 obs 1 and the coordinate of x 53 and y 50 obs 2 respectively otherwise it is considered that the hydraulic gradients change substantially over a short distance in the region nearby the pumping and observation wells hence to improve simulation accuracy a higher resolution block shaped child grid is created within the parent grid nearby the pumping and observation wells by running local grid refinement lgr package the simulation results of dimensionless r d and s d values are given as shown in fig 2 a and b respectively by the proposed solution the γ value relating to α 1 parameter is used to represent the degree of drainage from the unsaturated zone table 1 which is necessary to be determined before drawdown simulation in the case study a series of γ values are firstly assessed by the proposed solution with the s d t d curve in obs 1 and then the dimensionless drawdown at the t d point of interest in obs 2 can be evaluated by both the proposed semi analytical and fdm solutions it is noted that the flow towards the obs 1 with r d r 1 b 0 33 is confined if r d 0 33 and s d 4 π t h 0 b q 2 61 after then the flow becomes unconfined by the proposed solution the γ value at each t d point of interest in the transient confined and unconfined regions can be calculated by curve fitting method with eqs 26 and 30 respectively as shown in fig 3 the γ t d curve is presented as a straight line with slope of 0 suggesting that the γ α 1 value is constant during the pumping period the average γ value is given as 3300 in the case study with γ 3300 the dimensionless drawdown in obs 2 is simulated by proposed solution and fdm as shown in fig 4 the results indicate that the dimensionless drawdown curve by the proposed solution is almost matched with those by the fdm and visual modflow flex suggesting the variability of the proposed solution for use of drawdown simulation 5 2 theorical response different from the former studies based on dupuit s assumptions xiao et al 2018 the paper especially concerns with the effect of the aquifer anisotropy and the drainage from the unsaturated zone above the water table they are represented by the parameters of β k z h d 0 2 k r and γ α 1 b s y k z of the proposed solution to investigate the manner in which β and γ impacts flow behaviours drawdown and development of unconfined region we start by taking consideration of an aquifer with σ 0 01 r d 0 7 h d 0 1 5 and 4 π t h 0 b q 2 the flow towards the observation well with r d 0 7 is under the confined condition if r d 0 7 and s d 1 2 if not the flow is unconfined the dimensionless drawdown s d and r d values are simulated in the following cases for comparison purpose the theis solutions with t d 3 t d 1 and t d 2 are given to represent the confined flow with artesian storage unconfined flow with artesian storage and unconfined flow with gravity storage respectively otherwise the dimensionless drawdown time curve in a pure unconfined aquifer with h d 0 1 β 0 01 γ 10 and r d 0 7 is also presented to investigate the effect of transient confined flow patterns limiting β 0 01 γ value is assumed to be varied with α 1 fig 5 a and b show the r d and dimensionless average drawdown responses with different γ value of 0 1 10 and it is demonstrated that at the early pumping time impact of the change of γ value on flow behaviours in the confined region is insignificant the transient confined unconfined conversion occurs at 0 45 0 53 and 0 56 in case of γ value of 0 1 10 and respectively suggesting a delayed conversion time with increasing γ value when the flow is under the unconfined condition the change of γ value can lead to apparent deviations of both r d and dimensionless average drawdown simulation at any given time during the intermediate stage at the late time the impact of the change of γ value is disappeared otherwise increase of γ value can lead decrease of dimensionless average drawdown values at the early and intermediate stages the dimensionless average drawdown time curves in cases of γ 10 a n d are apparently approached to each other it is noted that the case of γ is used to represent the neuman condition moench 1995 physically speaking it is understandable a greater γ means a larger α 1 value suggesting a quick drainage from the unsaturated zone or the water released by gravity storage at the early pumping time before the confined unconfined conversion happens the water volume is released from the artesian storage under the confined condition it makes that the dimensionless drawdown time curve agrees well with theis solution with t d 3 when s d 2 the flow is under the unconfined condition and the pumped water can be released from both artesian and gravity storages at the intermediate stage the s d t d curve is almost matched with theis solution with t d 1 suggesting the domination of artesian storage and the release of gravity storage is small as pumping continues the water from the gravity storage increases and a greater α 1 results in a more obvious delayed responses of flow behaviours at the late time the pumped water is mainly controlled by the gravity storage leading the dimensionless average drawdown time curve is nearly matched with that by theis s solution with t d 2 hence small responses of flow behaviours can be observed with a great γ value at the early and intermediate stages otherwise in case of γ 10 the release of drainage from the unsaturated zone would is assumed to be almost instantaneous which makes that the flow behaviours are similar to that of the work by neuman condition with γ such observation is the same as that in a pure unconfined aquifer by moench 1995 since holding γ 10 β value is assumed to vary with vertical conductivity k z the transient flow behaviours in the cases of β values of 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 are simulated to investigate the effect of aquifer anisotropy the r d t d and dimensionless average drawdown time curves with different β values are presented in fig 6 a and b respectively it is noted that the increasing β value can lead a smaller average drawdown at a given time during the early and intermediate segment the time of transient confined unconfined conversion in cases of β 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 are 0 52 0 56 and 0 62 respectively indicating a delay of conversion time the reason is that the β values increase with k z values the greater k z indicates that the flow can be more easily transported in the vertical dimension leading more water released by gravity storage can be reached the piezometer surface the great vertical recharge could refer to slow down the decline of the water level in the aquifer therefore limit the development of the unconfined region fig 7 gives comparisons of the dimensionless drawdown time behaviours with β 0 01 and γ 10 at the vertical point with z d of 0 01 0 5 0 95 and 1 the results demonstrate that the delayed response is most apparent at piezometer surface suggesting the significant effect of drainage from unsaturated zone as buried depth increases the effect of drainage from unsaturated zone is obviously decreased in the intermediate segment drawdown time behaviour is characterised by distinct s shaped curve in cases of z d 1 and 0 95 during the transient unconfined region as shown in fig 7 the slope of drawdown time curve is changed slightly at the early time point during the intermediate segment as pumping continues the slope is apparently increased it makes the dimensionless drawdown time curve is firmly matched with that of theis solution with t d 2 in cases of z d 0 01 a n d 0 5 the drawdown time curve is monotonic which is closed to that of theis solution with t d 1 it may suggest that the delayed drainage from gravity storage nearby the piezometer surface releases more rapidly and dominates the drawdown behaviours more quickly at the bottom of the aquifer the drainage from unsaturated zone reaches more slowly and the water is mainly released from compressible storage in fig 5 b 6 b and 7 the dimensionless drawdown time curve in the pure unconfined aquifer is simulated by the solution of moench 1995 via aqtesolv compared with the pure unconfined aquifer with the same parameters of β 0 01 and γ 10 the drawdown during the confined unconfined conversion at each time point of interest is generally greater in the early segment as pumping continuous such deviation is gradually decreased in intermediate segment and is finally disappeared in the late segment it is indicated that the confined parts of the aquifer system mainly affect the drawdown time behaviours in the early and intermediate stages it can be explained as following in the early segment the pumping flow towards the observation well is under the confined condition the water is mainly released from artesian storage which is obviously smaller than that released by the gravity storage in the pure unconfined aquifer it results in a great drawdown deviation between the transient confined unconfined flow and pure unconfined flow in the intermediate segment the dominate of gravity storage have been enhanced as the development of transient unconfined region it further decreases the drawdown deviation in the late segment the pumping flow towards the observation well is under the unconfined condition and the water is mainly released by the gravity storage that is the same as the pure unconfined aquifer it makes the deviation finally disappears 6 conclusion a semi analytical solution is developed for drawdown of the transient confined unconfined flow towards a fully penetrating well in a nonleaky confined aquifer the parameters of γ and β are introduced to account for effect of drainage from unsaturated zone and aquifer anisotropy a hypothetical case is given to compare simulation result from the proposed solution and the numerical solution by fdm and visual modflow flex the delayed responses of drawdown and development of transient unconfined region are investigated the main conclusion is highlighted as follows 1 the drainage from the gravity storage impacts the flow behaviours at the early and intermediate stage as pumping starts small responses of expansion of unconfined region and drawdown can be observed with a great α 1 value at late time the water in the unconfined region is mainly released from gravity storage 2 the drainage from the gravity storage is more pronounced at the piezometer surface due to the quicker release of gravity storage as buried depth increases the recharge from gravity storage becomes slowly and artesian effect of aquifer compressible becomes more apparent 3 as vertical hydraulic conductivity increases the effect of gravity storage becomes more significant and conversion of transient confined unconfined flow becomes later due to the enhancement of vertical fluxes the proposed solution provides an effective method for drawdown simulation of transient confined unconfined flow with delayed response of water level credit authorship contribution statement liang xiao

3484,a semi analytical solution is developed for drawdown of transient confined unconfined flow towards a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer the proposed solution considers the aquifer anisotropy and the drainage from the unsaturated zone above the water table in the transient unconfined region based on the work by moench 1995 the parameter of γ related to vertical hydraulic conductivity aquifer thickness specific yield and a delayed coefficient is introduced to investigate the delayed responses of flow behaviours i e drawdown and development of the transient unconfined region the results indicate that the flow behaviours simulations by the proposed solution are identical to that by visual modflow flex and finite difference method the drawdown delayed responses occur in the early and intermediate segments and disappear at the late segment during the transient confined unconfined conversion the increasing of the vertical hydraulic conductivity and the delayed coefficient can decrease the drawdown and limit the development of transient unconfined region thus and postpone the time of transient confined unconfined conversion in a radial distance the release of water by gravity storage nearby the piezometer surface is quick resulting in an obvious log log s shaped drawdown time curve as buried depth increases the effect of artesian storage is more

useful field experiments to determine the confined aquifer properties the hydraulic head is declined as pumping starts when the pumping rate or pumping time is sufficiently large or the aquifer transmissivity is sufficiently small the water level in the confined aquifer can drop below the overlaying aquitard and an unconfined region instantaneously develops nearby the pumping well such transient confined unconfined conversion has been concerned by the hydrogeologists since 1980 s and many investigations have been done for numerical and analytical modelling of the flow mechanism in the transient confined unconfined aquifer e g moench and prickett 1972 wang and zhan 2009 xiao et al 2018 however it is noted that the former researches are all done on the basis of dupuit s assumption it considers the water in the unconfined region is only released by gravity storage and the slope of the phreatic surface is negligibly small the equipotential lines are vertical and the pumping induced flow is essentially horizontal in two dimensions thus the existing solutions based on dupuit s assumption are found to be invalid when the drawdown is sufficiently large by comparing with the thickness of the unconfined region xiao et al 2018 and are fail to account for the delayed response of the drawdown behaviours in the unconfined region although the pumping induced unconfined flow problems with drawdown delayed responses due to effect of different storages have been investigated extensively in the last five decades e g boulton 1954 kroszynski and dagan 1975 moench 1995 neuman 1972 1973 it appears that none of the solutions take consideration of the effect of drawdown delayed responses on transient confined unconfined flow different from the infinite unconfined aquifer flow mechanism of drawdown delayed responses during the transient confined unconfined conversion is assumed to be more complicated due to the transient unconfined region is finite and is developed as pumping continues hence a further investigation of drawdown delayed effect on transient confined unconfined flow is crucial for accurate assessment of aquifer properties by drawdown in case of heavy pumping in reality physically speaking the drawdown time curve of an infinite unconfined flow in the log log scale can be divided into three segments in the early segment the water is released from artesian compressible storage instantaneously due to head drops after pumping starts in intermediate segment a delayed drawdown response can be observed suggesting an additional water source storage following some time delay in the late segment the combined effect of both storage mechanisms controls the drawdown behaviours moench 2004 it makes that the drawdown time curve is generally presented with s shape in the unconfined aquifer to our knowledge the most popular classical mechanistic models of such drawdown delayed responses are those of boulton 1954 boulton 1955 kroszynski and dagan 1975 moench 1995 neuman 1972 1973 the pioneering mechanistic model was developed by boulton 1954 for fully penetrated unconfined aquifer the work assumed the water table was a moving material boundary in the saturated flow domain under combined actions of differential pressure and gravity storage the flow can include both horizontally and vertically components dagan 1967 further investigated the effect of partially penetrating well based on the work of boulton 1954 however tartakovsky and neuman 2007 pointed out that the boulton 1954 model neglected the compressibility of the saturated zone below the water table and considered the artesian storage through inclusion of the compressive storativity it leaded that the boulton 1954 model could not be used to account for the drawdown in the early segment boulton 1955 proposed a semi empirical mathematical modelling of delayed yield based on conceptually and mathematically equivalent to that of a dual porosity model for flow through fractured rocks the boulton s 1955 solution considered that the flow occurred horizontally and the water due to the drop of hydraulic head was released from both artesian and gravity storage components the volume of water from compressible storage was released instantaneously at time whereas the water released from gravity storage was delayed in time an empirical parameter of σ was introduced as delayed coefficient of drainage from gravity storage however the physical mean of σ have been unclear so far similar models were also reported by boulton 1970 and boulton and pontin 1971 the flow in boulton s 1955 solution was depicted by a 2d governing equation with a constant horizontal transmissivity hence it was fail to determine the vertical conductivity neuman 1972 1973 proposed another mechanistic model for analysis of the drawdown delayed response similar to the work of boulton 1954 neuman s model contained both horizontal and vertical flow components otherwise neuman s mechanistic model also included the effect of compressibility and assumed that the drainage from the zone above the water table took place instantaneously responding to the drawdown the approach based on neuman s mechanistic model could characterize the early stage with gradual increasing drawdown moench 1993 noticed that the neuman 1972 1973 model requested large amount of computation time and may produce inaccurate results for selected combinations of parameters kroszynski and dagan 1975 recognized that the flow in the unconfined aquifer was conditioned by the saturated flow below the water table and the unsaturated flow above it in the unsaturated zone the flow was governed by a linearized richards equation and the volumetric soil moisture and the relative hydraulic conductivity were represented by exponential functions of pressure head above the top of capillary fringe based on the unsaturated model by kroszynski and dagan 1975 mathias and butler 2006 proposed a related solution for one dimensional vertical flow through the unsaturated zone tartakovsky and neuman 2007 and mishra and neuman 2010 further investigated the effect of three dimensional unsaturated flow during crt towards the fully and partially penetrating pumping well respectively after then some studies have been done for investigation of such effect of unsaturated zone on the pumping induced flow in the unconfined aquifer in recent years e g chang et al 2018 liang et al 2017 liang et al 2018 moench 1995 combined the boulton 1954 convolution integral for delayed drainage with the neuman 1972 1974 model to improve the match between theoretical type curves and drawdown time curve from fieldwork by moench 1995 model the parameter of σ was re defined as a property of the aquifer rather than an empirical one moench 1995 model have been proved to be fitted to simulate well the drawdowns measured from pumping tests in mildly heterogeneous aquifers however moench 1995 noticed that the theoretical basis of his work was weak due to the ambiguous definition of σ parameter after then moench et al 2001 used a finite series of m exponential terms of σ i e σ m to replace only one of moench 1995 model to further improve the theoretical type curves to fitting the drawdown data from the aquifer at on cape cod massachusetts usa to investigate acceptability of the above mentioned delayed flow mechanics in the reality moench 2008 presented analytical and numerical analyses of an unconfined aquifer test at canadian forces base borden in ontario canada and pointed out that the estimations of hydraulic parameters at borden site were accepted by both the solutions based on moench 1995 model and kroszynski and dagan 1975 model however moench 2008 argued the assumption that the moisture retention exponent was equal to the relative hydraulic conductivity exponent by the solutions based on kroszynski and dagan 1975 model mathias and butler 2006 tartakovsky and neuman 2007 mishra and neuman 2010 and suggested that the relative hydraulic conductivity function must contain a fitting parameter that was different from the fitting parameter used in the soil moisture distribution function the purpose of this paper is to present an exact solution for the drawdown delayed problem during the transient confined unconfined conversion in a fully penetrated confined aquifer rendering the aquifer anisotropy a linear diffusion equation with vertical flow component is introduced to replace the boussinesq equation to depict the transient flow in the unconfined region whereas the transient flow in confined region without vertical flow component is governed by a two dimensional linear diffusion equation considering the drainage released from gravity storage is delayed in time the exponentially decaying rate introduced by moench 1995 model is proved to simulate the drawdown delayed response well during infinite unconfined flow thus it is used to depict the upper boundary condition at piezometer surface in the transient unconfined region in the paper the initial value problem of modelling of the transient confined unconfined flow is solved by laplace transform the delayed responses of drawdown simulation and development of transient unconfined region are investigated 2 mathematical model for easy comparisons the assumptions required for mathematical modelling are similar to those given by moench 1995 as follows 1 the aquifer has a uniform thickness and extents homogeneously and infinitely in the horizontal direction 2 the aquifer is anisotropic and the principal directions of the hydraulic conductivity tensor are parallel to the coordinate axes 3 the confined aquifer is fully penetrated by the pumping and observation wells with infinitesimal in diameter 4 vertical flow across the lower boundary of the aquifer is negligible and the confined aquifer is discharged at a constant rate from a specified zone below an initially horizontal water table the schematic diagram of transient confined unconfined flow towards a fully penetrating well in a nonleaky confined aquifer is shown in fig 1 as the pumping starts the well flow is fully confined and the hydraulic head keeps decreasing with time when the hydraulic head in the pumping well hw falls below the top of confined aquifer which can be expressed as 0 h w b where b is the thickness of the confined aquifer l an unconfined flow immediately develops in the area with a radial distance of 0 r r where r is the radial distance from the pumping well l and r is the radial distance of transient conversion interface from the pumping well l the transient confined unconfined flow can be depicted by following mathematical models in the unconfined region 0 h 1 b 0 r r the flow with vertical component is governed by the 3d linear diffusion equation as 1 2 h 1 r 2 1 r h 1 r k z k r 2 h 1 z 2 s s k r h 1 t where h 1 is the hydraulic head in the transient unconfined region l k r and k z are the horizontal and vertical conductivity respectively l2 t s s is the specific storativity of the confined aquifer l 1 t is the pumping duration t z is the vertical distance measured from the bottom of the confined aquifer l the initial boundary condition is 2 h 1 r z 0 b the boundary conditions towards the well with an infinitesimal wellbore is 3 lim r 0 2 π k r b r h 1 r z t r q where q is the constant pumping rate l3 t based on the work by moench 1995 it is assumed that the zone above the water table is incompressible and the drainage from the unsaturated zone is released gradually the flow through the piezometer surface is equal to the delayed drainage from the fine grained unsaturated zone above the water table the boundary condition at the upper surfaces can be expressed as 4 k z h 1 r b t z α 1 s y 0 t h 1 r b t t e α 1 t t d t where α 1 is the empirical constant for drainage from the unsaturated zone when the value of α 1 is large the amount of water released in the time period from 0 to t is large s y is the specific yield of the unconfined region the theoretical justification of equation 4 for analysis of unconfined flow with drawdown delayed responses have been provided by moench 1995 2001 2008 the boundary condition at the lower surface is 5 h 1 r 0 t z 0 in the confined region h 0 h 2 b r r the transient flow is described by the following 2d linear diffusion equation as 6 2 h 2 r 2 1 r h 2 r s t h 2 t where h 2 is the hydraulic head in the transient confined region l s is the storativity of the confined aquifer t is the horizontal transmissivity of the confined aquifer l2 t the far field boundary condition is 7 h 2 r t h 0 where h 0 is the initial hydraulic head of the confined aquifer l additionally

head due to the unknown r d value in the paper r d value is used to characterize the dynamic development of the transient unconfined region with time hence the r d value at each given time point of interest is essential to be determined according to equation 8 the flow continuity at the transient confined unconfined conversion interface in laplace domain is dimensionless expressed as 31 s d 1 r

towards the observation well with a given r d 1 distance fig 1 can be simulated by the following procedures as 1 based on given parameters one can evaluate the r d time curve by using equations 24 and 32 2 if r d r d 1 the transient flow is under the confined condition and s d is simulated by equation 30 i e s d s d 1 3 if r d r d 1 the flow toward the observation well is unconfined the average drawdown over all the observation screen is assessed by equation 23 and the drawdown at a given vertical point z d can be evaluated by equation 26 i e s d s d 2 it is noted that equations 23 26 30 and 32 can be numerically inversed by de hoog et al 1982 method to obtain the dimensionless drawdown in normal time domain 5 verification and discussion in the section the acceptability of the proposed solution of drawdown simulation are verified by comparison with the numerical solutions by finite difference method fdm and visual modflow flex via a hypothetical case study moreover the effect of delayed responses on drawdown and development of transient unconfined the region is especially discussed the derivation of the fdm solution is given in supporting information c a matlab program is developed to perform the proposed and fdm solutions automatically 5 1 verification the variably saturated flow modelling is one of the most effective methods to investigate the gravity delayed drainage from the unsaturated zone in the unconfined aquifer chang et al 2018 in the paper the variably saturated flow modelling is performed by the variably saturated flow vsf process of visual modflow flex harbaugh and others 2000 with richards equation thoms et al 2006 the parameters of the hypothetical case are listed in table 2 it is noted that the α v β v and s wr are the parameters of van genuchten model 1980 the parameter α v is a measure of the first moment of pore size density function β v is an inverse measure of the second moment of the pore size density function with a positive value greater than 1 and s wr is defined as 1 1 β v to represent the degree of saturation of water the hypothetical case study is assumed to occupy a domain size of 100 m 100 m 30 m with twenty layers each layer is refined by 50 rows and 50 columns the pumping well is situated at the point with the coordinate of x 45 and y 50 and the two observation wells with r 1 10 m and r 2 8 m are locating in the points with the coordinate of x 55 and y 50 obs 1 and the coordinate of x 53 and y 50 obs 2 respectively otherwise it is considered that the hydraulic gradients change substantially over a short distance in the region nearby the pumping and observation wells hence to improve simulation accuracy a higher resolution block shaped child grid is created within the parent grid nearby the pumping and observation wells by running local grid refinement lgr package the simulation results of dimensionless r d and s d values are given as shown in fig 2 a and b respectively by the proposed solution the γ value relating to α 1 parameter is used to represent the degree of drainage from the unsaturated zone table 1 which is necessary to be determined before drawdown simulation in the case study a series of γ values are firstly assessed by the proposed solution with the s d t d curve in obs 1 and then the dimensionless drawdown at the t d point of interest in obs 2 can be evaluated by both the proposed semi analytical and fdm solutions it is noted that the flow towards the obs 1 with r d r 1 b 0 33 is confined if r d 0 33 and s d 4 π t h 0 b q 2 61 after then the flow becomes unconfined by the proposed solution the γ value at each t d point of interest in the transient confined and unconfined regions can be calculated by curve fitting method with eqs 26 and 30 respectively as shown in fig 3 the γ t d curve is presented as a straight line with slope of 0 suggesting that the γ α 1 value is constant during the pumping period the average γ value is given as 3300 in the case study with γ 3300 the dimensionless drawdown in obs 2 is simulated by proposed solution and fdm as shown in fig 4 the results indicate that the dimensionless drawdown curve by the proposed solution is almost matched with those by the fdm and visual modflow flex suggesting the variability of the proposed solution for use of drawdown simulation 5 2 theorical response different from the former studies based on dupuit s assumptions xiao et al 2018 the paper especially concerns with the effect of the aquifer anisotropy and the drainage from the unsaturated zone above the water table they are represented by the parameters of β k z h d 0 2 k r and γ α 1 b s y k z of the proposed solution to investigate the manner in which β and γ impacts flow behaviours drawdown and development of unconfined region we start by taking consideration of an aquifer with σ 0 01 r d 0 7 h d 0 1 5 and 4 π t h 0 b q 2 the flow towards the observation well with r d 0 7 is under the confined condition if r d 0 7 and s d 1 2 if not the flow is unconfined the dimensionless drawdown s d and r d values are simulated in the following cases for comparison purpose the theis solutions with t d 3 t d 1 and t d 2 are given to represent the confined flow with artesian storage unconfined flow with artesian storage and unconfined flow with gravity storage respectively otherwise the dimensionless drawdown time curve in a pure unconfined aquifer with h d 0 1 β 0 01 γ 10 and r d 0 7 is also presented to investigate the effect of transient confined flow patterns limiting β 0 01 γ value is assumed to be varied with α 1 fig 5 a and b show the r d and dimensionless average drawdown responses with different γ value of 0 1 10 and it is demonstrated that at the early pumping time impact of the change of γ value on flow behaviours in the confined region is insignificant the transient confined unconfined conversion occurs at 0 45 0 53 and 0 56 in case of γ value of 0 1 10 and respectively suggesting a delayed conversion time with increasing γ value when the flow is under the unconfined condition the change of γ value can lead to apparent deviations of both r d and dimensionless average drawdown simulation at any given time during the intermediate stage at the late time the impact of the change of γ value is disappeared otherwise increase of γ value can lead decrease of dimensionless average drawdown values at the early and intermediate stages the dimensionless average drawdown time curves in cases of γ 10 a n d are apparently approached to each other it is noted that the case of γ is used to represent the neuman condition moench 1995 physically speaking it is understandable a greater γ means a larger α 1 value suggesting a quick drainage from the unsaturated zone or the water released by gravity storage at the early pumping time before the confined unconfined conversion happens the water volume is released from the artesian storage under the confined condition it makes that the dimensionless drawdown time curve agrees well with theis solution with t d 3 when s d 2 the flow is under the unconfined condition and the pumped water can be released from both artesian and gravity storages at the intermediate stage the s d t d curve is almost matched with theis solution with t d 1 suggesting the domination of artesian storage and the release of gravity storage is small as pumping continues the water from the gravity storage increases and a greater α 1 results in a more obvious delayed responses of flow behaviours at the late time the pumped water is mainly controlled by the gravity storage leading the dimensionless average drawdown time curve is nearly matched with that by theis s solution with t d 2 hence small responses of flow behaviours can be observed with a great γ value at the early and intermediate stages otherwise in case of γ 10 the release of drainage from the unsaturated zone would is assumed to be almost instantaneous which makes that the flow behaviours are similar to that of the work by neuman condition with γ such observation is the same as that in a pure unconfined aquifer by moench 1995 since holding γ 10 β value is assumed to vary with vertical conductivity k z the transient flow behaviours in the cases of β values of 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 are simulated to investigate the effect of aquifer anisotropy the r d t d and dimensionless average drawdown time curves with different β values are presented in fig 6 a and b respectively it is noted that the increasing β value can lead a smaller average drawdown at a given time during the early and intermediate segment the time of transient confined unconfined conversion in cases of β 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 are 0 52 0 56 and 0 62 respectively indicating a delay of conversion time the reason is that the β values increase with k z values the greater k z indicates that the flow can be more easily transported in the vertical dimension leading more water released by gravity storage can be reached the piezometer surface the great vertical recharge could refer to slow down the decline of the water level in the aquifer therefore limit the development of the unconfined region fig 7 gives comparisons of the dimensionless drawdown time behaviours with β 0 01 and γ 10 at the vertical point with z d of 0 01 0 5 0 95 and 1 the results demonstrate that the delayed response is most apparent at piezometer surface suggesting the significant effect of drainage from unsaturated zone as buried depth increases the effect of drainage from unsaturated zone is obviously decreased in the intermediate segment drawdown time behaviour is characterised by distinct s shaped curve in cases of z d 1 and 0 95 during the transient unconfined region as shown in fig 7 the slope of drawdown time curve is changed slightly at the early time point during the intermediate segment as pumping continues the slope is apparently increased it makes the dimensionless drawdown time curve is firmly matched with that of theis solution with t d 2 in cases of z d 0 01 a n d 0 5 the drawdown time curve is monotonic which is closed to that of theis solution with t d 1 it may suggest that the delayed drainage from gravity storage nearby the piezometer surface releases more rapidly and dominates the drawdown behaviours more quickly at the bottom of the aquifer the drainage from unsaturated zone reaches more slowly and the water is mainly released from compressible storage in fig 5 b 6 b and 7 the dimensionless drawdown time curve in the pure unconfined aquifer is simulated by the solution of moench 1995 via aqtesolv compared with the pure unconfined aquifer with the same parameters of β 0 01 and γ 10 the drawdown during the confined unconfined conversion at each time point of interest is generally greater in the early segment as pumping continuous such deviation is gradually decreased in intermediate segment and is finally disappeared in the late segment it is indicated that the confined parts of the aquifer system mainly affect the drawdown time behaviours in the early and intermediate stages it can be explained as following in the early segment the pumping flow towards the observation well is under the confined condition the water is mainly released from artesian storage which is obviously smaller than that released by the gravity storage in the pure unconfined aquifer it results in a great drawdown deviation between the transient confined unconfined flow and pure unconfined flow in the intermediate segment the dominate of gravity storage have been enhanced as the development of transient unconfined region it further decreases the drawdown deviation in the late segment the pumping flow towards the observation well is under the unconfined condition and the water is mainly released by the gravity storage that is the same as the pure unconfined aquifer it makes the deviation finally disappears 6 conclusion a semi analytical solution is developed for drawdown of the transient confined unconfined flow towards a fully penetrating well in a nonleaky confined aquifer the parameters of γ and β are introduced to account for effect of drainage from unsaturated zone and aquifer anisotropy a hypothetical case is given to compare simulation result from the proposed solution and the numerical solution by fdm and visual modflow flex the delayed responses of drawdown and development of transient unconfined region are investigated the main conclusion is highlighted as follows 1 the drainage from the gravity storage impacts the flow behaviours at the early and intermediate stage as pumping starts small responses of expansion of unconfined region and drawdown can be observed with a great α 1 value at late time the water in the unconfined region is mainly released from gravity storage 2 the drainage from the gravity storage is more pronounced at the piezometer surface due to the quicker release of gravity storage as buried depth increases the recharge from gravity storage becomes slowly and artesian effect of aquifer compressible becomes more apparent 3 as vertical hydraulic conductivity increases the effect of gravity storage becomes more significant and conversion of transient confined unconfined flow becomes later due to the enhancement of vertical fluxes the proposed solution provides an effective method for drawdown simulation of transient confined unconfined flow with delayed response of water level credit authorship contribution statement liang xiao
