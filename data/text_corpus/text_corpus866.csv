4330,groundwater extraction causes significant land subsidence in many parts of the world with compressible sediments insar data have been used to estimate the magnitude of this subsidence and derive hydrologic and geomechanical properties in these areas in spite of recent advances in insar processing methods several challenges remain in relating surface deformation to hydrologic systems the relationship between deformation and groundwater levels is non linear and existing groundwater level data are often sparsely sampled so that it is challenging to relate them to insar derived deformation in addition historical insar datasets are sparsely sampled in time leaving many gaps in existing deformation estimates in this study we present an approach to improve the temporal density of groundwater level and deformation estimates the study area for this demonstration is parowan valley utah a region dependent on groundwater for agricultural use that has seen significant declines in head over the past 70 years in our approach we use theis curves to interpolate seasonal fluctuations in head and a subsidence model to extend deformation estimates we find that with this approach we are able to closely match long term and seasonal estimates of deformation estimate seasonal fluctuations in head and characterize the elastic and inelastic response to changes in head keywords insar subsidence groundwater groundwater modeling mcmc 1 introduction as groundwater demand increases due to changing land use patterns and population growth vörösmarty et al 2000 foley et al 2005 as well as warming climates which cause increasingly irregular patterns of surface water availability due to drought and flooding mann and gleick 2015 methods to improve our understanding of groundwater availability are crucial in spite of its importance monitoring groundwater systems is challenging the standard monitoring approach is to measure groundwater levels periodically at wells dispersed throughout the aquifer of interest but this approach is time and labor intensive requires drilling monitoring wells or re purposing irrigation wells and leaves both temporal and spatial gaps in groundwater measurements one promising technology to improve monitoring of groundwater systems is interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar satellite derived insar data provide estimates of ground deformation with an accuracy of 1 cm or better zebker et al 1997 emardson et al 2003 which can be related to changes in groundwater levels that cause aquifer materials with sufficient compressibility and thickness to expand and contract due to changing pore pressure insar data have been used for over two decades to improve understanding of hydrologic systems amelung et al 1999 boni et al 2020 chaussard et al 2014 hoffmann et al 2001 2003a reeves et al 2011 tomas et al 2014 smith and knight 2019 applications of insar data include estimating geomechanical parameters of deforming sediments bell et al 2008 reeves et al 2011 chen et al 2016 separating elastic and inelastic components of deformation chaussard and farr 2019 smith et al 2017 calibrating groundwater models with vertical deformation estimates hoffmann et al 2003a zhang and burbey 2016 with full 3 dimensional deformation estimates boni et al 2020 alghamdi et al 2020 and estimating large scale subsidence or subsidence risk with machine learning or other statistical methods herrera garcia et al 2021 smith and majumdar 2020 while many advances have been made in deformation modeling over this time period it remains a challenge to relate groundwater levels or head to insar data in regions with high withdrawal rates as these areas often have a complex non linear relationship between deformation and changes in head thus in these regions it is challenging to estimate head using insar data without a robust process based model of head changes three dimensional groundwater models have been used to estimate head in these circumstances but are time consuming and computationally expensive to implement they also require extensive hydrological data to calibrate again raising issues in basins with sparse groundwater monitoring although insar data have been used successfully in many regions the challenges described limit their use in regions with sparse groundwater level data which is often not available with sufficient temporal or spatial density even in the most water stressed regions in this study we present a new method to model aquifer deformation that is straightforward to implement even in regions with complex inelastic deformation patterns with limited head data and without requiring a full groundwater model the method makes use of pumping response functions using the well known theis drawdown solution as an interpolation function to fill in missing head data for the aquifer this can then be used to solve for the head throughout the clay layers or aquitards within the aquifer system and model deformation this approach allows us to combine incomplete water level data with an incomplete record of surface deformation from insar to model deformation this method makes use of theory from previous deformation modeling studies hoffmann et al 2003b while adding the ability to model deformation and estimate head in regions without temporally dense head measurements the markov chain monte carlo inversion procedure is chosen to solve for the parameters necessary to simulate deformation thus providing a robust estimate of uncertainty 2 study area our study area is in parowan valley southwest utah fig 1 this area is part of the basin and range province and is composed of roughly 600 m of unconsolidated basin fill deposits of alternating fine and coarse grained materials brooks 2017 shah and boyd 2018 marston 2017 the aquifer system is bounded on the southeast by the paragonah fault system and red cliffs and on the northwest by the black mountains marston 2017 most of the recharge to the basin comes from the red cliffs either from infiltration of mountain streams on alluvial fans at the foot of the red cliffs or from groundwater flow from the mountain aquifer marston 2017 brooks 2017 the lowest point of the valley little salt lake is a historic lake that has evaporated due to diminished recharge caused by groundwater pumping groundwater flows to this location from the red cliffs and from the aquifer to the northeast fig 1 parowan valley is predominantly a closed basin and has coarse grained alluvial fan deposits along the southeast that fine towards the central and northwest portions of the valley marston 2017 in and near the little salt lake the sediments are primarily fine grained lacustrine deposits the portion of the valley that is irrigated lies primarily along the northwestern side of the valley where more fine grained deposits are located marston 2017 bjorklund et al 1978 compiled information from eight aquifer tests performed in the valley the specific storage values determined from these tests ranged from 9 4 10 7 to 2 2 10 4 m 1 with a geometric mean of 8 6 10 6 m 1 these specific storage values are well within the range for confined aquifers fetter 2001 the hydraulic conductivity determined from these tests ranged from 4 0 to 145 m day with a geometric mean of 12 m day which lies in the range of values for clean sands freeze and cherry 1979 thus in spite of containing enough aquitards to confine the main aquifer system permeable permeable sandy units cause significant horizontal flow within the aquifer system this aquifer has been pumped extensively for over 70 years to support agricultural development which the local economy is reliant upon with long term drawdowns exceed 30 m over that time period duross and kirby 2004 marston 2017 3 materials and methods in this study we developed a model to simulate total surface deformation at one location the model location shown in yellow in fig 1 with co located yearly head measurements from usgs well 375 344 112 521 601 https groundwaterwatch usgs gov awlsites asp s 375344112521601 ncd and insar data processed from the sentinel 1 satellites we assumed that the aquifer system was bounded by a thick low permeability clay layer at the top this assumption is consistent with the confined nature of the aquifer marston 2017 we also assumed the aquifer system was composed of a number of interbedded clay layers within a permeable aquifer material a common condition in regions with alternating fine grained and coarse grained deposits and similar to what is modeled by hoffmann et al 2003b and smith and knight 2019 the total thickness of the aquifer system and the number of clay layers within the aquifer system were unknowns that we solved for our model required estimates of heads both within the permeable aquifer material where horizontal groundwater flow dominates as well as within less permeable clay layers that are responsible for most of the deformation where vertical flow dominates the head in the permeable aquifer was assumed to not vary with depth and to be represented by measurements taken at the well the head in the less permeable clays were assumed to vary with distance from the boundary top and bottom of the clay layer the head estimates for the aquifer were used as a boundary condition to solve for the heads in the clay layers fig 2 shows a visual representation of the aquifer and clay layer flow systems as well as the equations that are used to estimate heads in each system section 3 1 describes the general theory behind deformation due to changes in pore pressure as well as our approach to solve for the heads within clay layers given some boundary head values for the main aquifer section 3 2 describes our approach to estimate seasonal heads in the main aquifer given yearly head estimates section 3 3 describes our insar data processing workflow section 3 4 describes the full inversion procedure which uses heads from 3 1 and 3 2 to model deformation then calibrates model parameters to match insar data derived from 3 3 3 1 modeling inelastic and elastic deformation caused by changing heads in this paper we describe a novel approach to deal with sparse head measurements once these are estimated deformation can be modeled the model we used to simulate deformation as a function of head was based on the model described in smith and knight 2019 for a more detailed treatment of the deformation model the reader is referred to that paper there are two fundamental principles our model uses to simulate deformation the first relates changing groundwater levels δ h to deformation δ b of subsurface layers riley 1969 1 δ b δ h s k where s k s sk b 0 is the skeletal storage coefficient s sk is the skeletal specific storage and b 0 is the thickness of the compacting material the assumption of this equation is that for any change in pore pressure there is an equivalent change in effective stress on the aquifer skeleton terzaghi 1925 which is valid when the compressibility of the pore water is negligible compared to the compressibility of the skeleton this assumption is usually valid in regions with compressible sedimentary materials hoffmann et al 2003b the skeletal specific storage which can also be defined as the product of the specific weight of water and the compressibility of the compacting material changes based on the stress history of the material that is compacting when the stress of the material exceeds the preconsolidation stress which is the highest stress that the material has previously experienced inelastic or permanent deformation occurs and the constant s skv is used because the effective stress in aquifers is the difference between the total stress of the overlying material which typically does not change significantly and the pore pressure which is a function of the groundwater level and changes due to pumping or recharge aquifers reach this stress state when the groundwater level in the compacting material drops below what was previously the lowest experienced level or the preconsolidation head in all other cases elastic or recoverable deformation occurs and the constant s ske is used field studies compiled by sneed 2001 indicate that s skv is 10 to 100 times larger than s ske and for this reason inelastic deformation typically dominates the deformation signal clay sediments are the only major source of inelastic deformation as sandy or consolidated deposits do not deform elastically at the stresses that most aquifer systems are subjected to smith et al 2017 the second fundamental principle our model is the simulation of groundwater levels throughout deforming clay layers which have a delayed reaction to changing groundwater levels in the main aquifer it is assumed that measurements taken from wells are indicative of the groundwater level in the main aquifer not clay layers within the aquifer that typically make up most of the deformation signal due to their higher s sk values especially during inelastic deformation to solve for the groundwater level in these clay layers it is assumed that clays are extensive enough laterally that groundwater flow is effectively one dimensional we also assume that the clay layers are bounded at the top and bottom by a permeable aquifer the head in the aquifer estimated in this paper using the theis method detailed in section 3 2 forms the boundary condition on the top and bottom of this layer we model the heads of the clay layer with the one dimensional groundwater flow equation given below fetter 2001 2 z k v h z s s h t the parameters needed to solve this equation are the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the clay layer k v the specific storage of the clay layer s s the vertical location in the clay layer z and time t in this study we assume that s s of clay is equal to s sk of clay a reasonable approximation for clays since the specific storage of water is negligible compared to the skeletal specific storage of clays smith et al 2017 we implemented the one dimensional groundwater flow equation using a finite difference solution to the mathematically equivalent heat diffusion equation recktenwald 2004 as shown in fig 2 the aquifer system we modeled contains multiple clay layers in this study we followed the implementation of hoffmann et al 2003b and smith and knight 2019 who solved for the heads and deformation of a single clay layer with a thickness that is representative of the true thickness distribution of the system effective thickness or b e and multiplied the deformation of this clay layer by the number of clay layers the parameter b e is given by the equation b e 1 n i n b i 2 where n is the total number of layers and b i is the thickness of an individual clay layer the drillers log for the well at the location that is modeled in this study is given in supplementary table 1 solving for b e with this information is not straightforward since lithology data from drillers logs is not highly precise or accurate e g faunt et al 2010 and because many of the intervals are classified as having both sand and clay we assume that layers classified as having sand and clay are 50 sand and 50 clay by volume with this assumption the fraction of the drillers log profile that is clay is 43 and the fraction that is sand is 57 if we further assume that all layers with sand and clay have two sub layers of clay that are one fourth the total thickness of that layer then b e is computed to be 7 3 m if we instead assume that all layers with sand and clay have one sub layer of clay that is one half the total thickness of that layer then b e is 11 1 m we chose a value for b e of 10 m which lies between these ranges we kept this value constant since solving for the clay thickness causes stability issues in the inversion procedure however we do note that an inaccurate b e estimate would lead to biases in the other parameter estimates of our model 3 1 estimating aquifer head time series with theis functions to model deformation as a function of changing pore pressure or changing head we need an estimate of the head over time the heads in the clay layers can be solved for with eq 2 but this requires knowledge of the heads in the aquifer which forms the boundary for the clay layers yearly head measurements are taken by the usgs throughout the parowan valley providing a robust long term estimate of changes in head within the aquifer the site of our model is usgs well 375344112521601 a well drilled to a depth of 193 m which has yearly head measurements from 1984 to 2020 the insar data show a strong seasonal pattern indicating that heads vary significantly during the season as well in order to model this seasonal pattern a dataset of head values with higher temporal resolution is needed in this study we develop a new approach to solve for seasonal variation in head with limited prior knowledge of head values seasonal groundwater levels are driven by either pumping at a well or recharge from the surrounding aquifer and can be approximated using the analytical solution developed by theis 1935 3 δ h q 2 π t w r 2 s s 4 k h t where δ h is the change in aquifer head q is pumping volume k h is the aquifer hydraulic conductivity t is the aquifer transmissivity hydraulic conductivity multiplied by the thickness r is the distance from the well being pumped s s is the aquifer storage coefficient t is time and w u is the well function w u u e y y d y where in this instance u r 2 s s 4 k h t the theis equation has been widely used to model changes in groundwater levels as a function of external fluxes jacob 1940 randolph et al 1985 wu et al 2005 both pumping and recharge and estimate aquifer parameters of k h and s s the theis solution makes several assumptions notably that the aquifer is confined homogenous and infinite laterally and that there is negligible leakage from surrounding aquitards theis 1935 aquifer tests in our study area indicate the aquifer is confined bjorklund et al 1978 marston 2017 while no aquifer is homogenous or infinite laterally this is often a reasonable assumption in sedimentary basins such as our study site there is likely leakage from surrounding aquitards and clays within the aquifer assuming no leakage could result in biased parameter estimates particularly s s rather than use the theis solution to estimate aquifer parameters some studies have used it as a function to approximate the response of heads to pumping or recharge harp and vesselinov 2011 shapoori et al 2015 particularly over long multi month time scales copty and findikakis 2004 this second approach is the aim of our study we use the theis function to develop hydrologically realistic drawdown and recovery curves and not to estimate k h or s s for this reason if assumptions of the theis equation are not correct in our study area this may result in biased k h or s s parameter estimates but the head time series should still resemble a realistic drawdown and recovery curve since we are not attempting to accurately characterize those parameters but rather to produce realistic head time series we consider this approach appropriate for this study since we are not interested in estimating k h or s s we can simplify the inputs to eq 3 the theis curve can be described as having an amplitude component 4 c 1 q 2 π t and a time decay component 5 c 2 r 2 s s 4 k h using these components we can then re write eq 3 as 6 δ h c 1 w c 2 t thus to estimate seasonal fluctuations in head we must estimate c 1 and c 2 while both parameters could be inverted for c 1 is highly correlated with estimates of s ske which relates seasonal changes in head to seasonal deformation since s ske is not well characterized in this area we only solved for c 2 which is less correlated with other parameters that we solve for and estimated c 1 from existing well data in parowan and neighboring regions example seasonal head time series derived from varying the c 2 parameter are shown in fig 3 most head measurements are taken in march when head levels are near their highest levels the usgs collected some fall head measurements in november of 2012 and 2013 which provide an estimate of seasonal drawdown at the well site of our study area usgs well 375344112521601 the seasonal drawdown in 2012 was 3 2 m and 7 5 m in 2013 two nearby sites usgs wells 375 338 112 502 801 and 375303112495102 see table 1 had much less year over year variation in seasonal drawdowns with average seasonal drawdowns of 5 9 m and 5 1 m in 2012 and 2013 respectively the spatial variation in drawdown is a function of distance from r s s k h and q as shown in eq 3 of these parameters the only one that changes year over year is q or the volume of water withdrawn thus the water demand is likely the cause for year over year variation in seasonal drawdown at our study site growers in this region rotate crops and based on the usda nass cropland data layer the well at our study site was next to a field that used lower water intensity crops oats in 2012 and alfalfa in most other years thus it is likely that less water was pumped near the well site for this study in 2012 than in a typical year based on these lines of evidence we estimate that the 7 5 m drawdown in 2013 is due to irrigation of more water intensive crops and is more representative of the yearly drawdown rate although the groundwater levels are taken when they are near their highest levels in march and near their lowest levels in november these measurements are taken roughly one month before groundwater pumping has started and one month after pumping has finished respectively for this reason they do not provide a true estimate of the maximum seasonal drawdown experienced at a well in eq 6 the parameter c 1 controls the seasonal amplitude of head variations the c 1 parameter value can be specified for both the drawdown and recovery periods we use this equation to make an initial estimate of the change in head with c 1 7 5 for both the drawdown and recovery period then compare the seasonal difference in head from march to november 2013 the ratio of observed change in head over this time period 7 5 m divided by the modeled change in head over the same time period is used to scale c 1 so that the difference between march and november levels for 2013 is 7 5 m in addition to constraining c 1 to match the seasonal drawdown observed in 2013 we also scaled c 1 each year for the drawdown period only to match yearly march to march water level changes for example there was a 1 5 m drop in head from march 2018 to march 2019 see supplementary fig 2 to match this we increased the drawdown in 2018 by scaling c 1 for the drawdown period only so that a 1 5 m overall drop in head for the year was modeled we did this for all years of the study period to match the year over year changes in head the observed and modeled changes in head are shown in fig 5a table 2 3 2 processing insar data single look complex slc images acquired by the sentinel 1a and b satellites spanning the time period from 2015 to 2020 were downloaded from the alaska satellite facility https search asf alaska edu images along the orbital path 100 frames 464 and 465 were downloaded supplementary fig 2 they were subsequently processed using the gmtsar code sandwell et al 2011 the processing workflow was to first co register the slcs using a digital elevation model dem then process interferograms and unwrap them using the snaphu method chen and zebker 2002 we processed all interferograms that had a temporal baseline time between acquisitions of less than 50 days and a spatial baseline distance between orbits of 100 m this resulted in a total of 330 interferograms we removed pixels from the analysis that had a coherence less than 0 15 following the unwrapping we used the small baseline subset sbas berardino et al 2002 approach to estimate deformation at each acquisition time for the sbas method we used deformation at the pixel of interest model location shown in fig 1 relative to a reference pixel also shown in fig 1 the reference pixel was selected in the city of parowan where scatterers are stable and little deformation is expected due to surface water supply and its location on an alluvial fan where geomechancially stronger sands are the dominant sediment the incidence angle of the sar imagery over our study area was 39 0 degrees insar velocity data were converted from line of sight to vertical by dividing the line of sight velocity by the cosine of the incidence angle this assumes that there is no significant relative horizontal deformation since there is no significant tectonic motion in the region mapped faults have estimates slip rates of 1 mm yr or less olig et al 2004 and pumping occurs at a regional scale where vertical deformation tends to dominate e g galloway and burbey 2011 rather than from one individual well we consider this a reasonable approximation the fit between sbas estimated phase change for each acquisition pair and observed phase change from the unwrapped interferograms is very good supplementary fig 3 and the residuals had a standard deviation of 0 21 cm this is an indication that the interferograms have relatively good agreement with each other but is not an absolute measure of insar uncertainty since there are no nearby gps stations with long term records we are unable to quantify the true uncertainty in the insar data however the time series produced from the insar data at our study site shown in fig 5b shows a clear seasonal and long term hydrologic pattern and appears visually to have little noise or random variation we assume a 1 cm error in the sbas derived time series which is consistent with work from previous studies zebker et al 1997 emardson et al 2003 the resulting insar velocity map is shown in fig 4 and the time series at our model location is shown in fig 5 b 3 3 inversion procedure parameters to solve for in our simulation were k v to solve for heads within the clay using eq 2 the time at which groundwater levels peaked lag s skv s ske c 2 and total sediment thickness since many different combinations of these parameters may result in a reasonable model fit we elected to use a markov chain monte carlo mcmc a parameter estimation method that provides a robust estimate of uncertainty for each parameter estimate the mcmc procedure randomly selects parameters from a prior distribution and computes the model misfit relative to the measurement error with a function known as the log likelihood defined below 7 l x y σ 2 n 2 log 2 π t 1 n log σ t 1 2 t 1 n y y t x σ t 2 where y is a vector composed of measurements y in our case the deformation measured with insar σ is the standard deviation of the measurements and y are the values modeled in our case the deformation modeled using eq 1 eq 2 and eq 6 using parameter values x in our case k v s skv s ske c 2 sediment thickness and lag see table 1 after each iteration the parameters are randomly modified the log likelihood is used to determine whether a new model model proposal is accepted or discarded if the prior distribution of the parameters being estimated are uniform then the model proposal is accepted if it meets the criteria given in eq 8 8 l proposal l current r a n d 0 1 where rand 0 1 is a random number drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 the accepted parameters make up the posterior distribution to sufficiently sample the posterior vrugt 2016 found that between 5000 and 10 000 samples are needed to estimate between 5 and 10 parameters vrugt 2016 also recommend running multiple independent chains by comparing the parameter distributions between chains one can determine the convergence of the parameter estimates we ran 50 000 models on each chain for five different chains the parameter distribution for each chain is shown in supplementary fig 4 each parameter has similar distributions across the five chains indicating that convergence of our model has been achieved we chose to use the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream implementation of mcmc developed by vrugt 2016 this implementation runs multiple parameter estimations called chains in parallel these chains are used to modify the sampler of the posterior distribution and improves performance on complex highly non linear models in our model we assumed uniform prior distributions for all estimated parameters table 1 shows the bounds we defined for the parameters we set the bounds for k v s skv and s ske based on the ranges found by sneed 2001 divided and multiplied by a factor of two for the lower and upper bounds respectively as discussed in 3 3 c 2 r 2 s s 4 k h we used a range of estimates from bjorklund et al 1978 to capture high and low end members for c 2 since pumping from multiple wells at a range of distances likely contribute to the head decline we set a wide range of values for r as well the range of values for r k and s s was 500 to 10000 m 1000 m yr to 50 000 m yr and 1 10 6 m 1 to 2 10 3 m 1 for the high and low values respectively the sediment thickness that experienced a head change equivalent to the head change observed at our monitoring well either in the sediment itself for sands or at the upper and lower boundary for clay layers was assumed to lie between 213 m and 366 m the lower bound 213 m was equivalent to the thickness from 30 m below the land surface to the bottom of the monitoring well depth the upper bound of sediment thickness was estimated by taking the same estimate for the deepest well within 5 km 274 m multiplied by 1 5 this upper bound reflects what has been observed by galloway et al 1998 who found that up to 50 of compaction happened below the depth of wells with extensometers installed while it is possible that a greater sediment thickness experienced a change in head we consider this to be a reasonable physical constraint and that it is unlikely that the sediment thickness is greater than our upper bound 4 results and discussion our parameter estimation procedure resulted in a distribution of values that fit the observed data referred to as the posterior distribution summary statistics for this distribution are shown in table 3 the full distribution of values for each parameter is shown in supplementary figs 4 and 5 we took the 5th and 95th percentiles of the posterior distribution for each parameter to determine the uncertainty of each parameter as well as the mean and median values to determine a best estimate for each parameter each parameter has a fairly narrow range the parameter k v whose prior bounds varied by 5 orders of magnitude had 90 of its posterior values within a factor of 5 a similar trend is seen with c 2 whose prior bounds varied by 8 orders of magnitude and had 90 of its posterior values within a factor of 6 specific skeletal storage parameters s skv and s ske both had prior bounds that varied by more than one order of magnitude with 90 of the posterior within a factor of 6 and 1 respectively the posterior distribution for sediment thickness and lag narrowed relative to the prior bounds but not as significantly while c 2 and lag are unique parameters to this study and sediment thickness is study area dependent the estimates for k v s skv and s ske have been estimated in other regions with similar geologic environments the estimates for k v and s kv fall within the range of values estimated by sneed 2001 for the central valley in california which has a similar depositional environment however our estimate for s ske is a factor of 2 higher than the highest value reported by sneed 2001 in the central valley chen et al 2016 studied elastic deformation in the san luis valley of colorado another similar depositional environment this region may be even more similar to ours as both have significant amounts of volcanic deposits mccalpin 1996 marston 2017 chen et al 2016 did not report s ske values but did report s ke values which can be estimated from our parameters by multiplying s ske by the sediment thickness hoffmann et al 2003a if we use this approach to estimate s ke from our estimated parameters our s ke estimate is 0 015 which falls within the range of s ke values reported by chen et al 2016 our posterior parameter distribution resulted in a posterior distribution of modeled head fig 5a and deformation black lines in fig 5b the magnitude of seasonal head change and the rate at which the head decline occurred was controlled by c 2 the c 2 values had a fairly narrow range that resulted in an average seasonal fluctuation in head of 20 m this is a fairly typical seasonal decline for a confined aquifer in a heavily pumped area butler et al 2012 the modeled and insar derived observed deformation are shown in fig 3b we calibrated our model with insar data from 2015 to march 2019 and held out the remaining insar data to validate our model calibration and validation insar data are shown in green and purple respectively our modeled deformation fits the calibration and validation data remarkably well the good model fit as well as the sensitivity of the model to the estimated parameters gives us additional confidence in our head estimates the maximum a posteriori map or the mode of the posterior distribution defined here as the most common set of parameters rounded to three significant figures is shown as a dashed yellow line in fig 3 the posterior deformation estimates are distributed fairly tightly around the map deformation model demonstrating that the uncertainty in modeled deformation is low although the seasonal head fluctuations appear to dominate the head signal there are year over year changes in head that appear subtle but can have a significant effect on the deformation pattern fig 4 shows the yearly change in modeled head a and yearly modeled deformation b note that in 2014 and 2018 there were significant declines in head of 1 2 and 1 5 m respectively in those years the deformation rate also increased from an average of 4 2 cm yr to 4 9 and 5 1 cm yr respectively fig 6 long term permanent deformation occurs even in years with very little or no year over year head decline because each year the head seasonally drops to a point that it is at or very near the lowest head experienced in the aquifer the clay layers that are deforming do not have a spatially uniform preconsolidation head the preconsolidation head varies at each point in a clay layer because the head in any given clay layer does not immediately equilibrate with that experienced in the aquifer thus when the head becomes close to the preconsolidation head of the aquifer it begins to drop below the preconsolidation head for some intervals of deforming clay layers when this happens inelastic deformation occurs fig 7 demonstrates this concept the modeled head is shown in fig 7a colored blue when elastic deformation is the principal deformation signal i e when it accounts for more than 50 of the deformation occurring at a given time and colored red when inelastic deformation is the principal deformation signal note that although both elastic and inelastic deformation are occurring during the entire period the red and blue lines only indicate which one accounts for the majority of the deformation at any given time fig 7b shows the modeled elastic blue and inelastic red deformation note that inelastic deformation becomes the dominant signal each year during the late summer early fall months when head is close to its lowest value note also that the inelastic deformation has an overall negative trend while the elastic deformation is mainly seasonal with no long term trend while elastic deformation could have a long term negative trend if there is a long term drop in groundwater levels while the head remains above the preconsolidation head in this location the groundwater levels consistently drop below the preconsolidation head during periods of drawdown i e there have been no periods of significant recovery above the preconsolidation head fig 8 in addition to producing estimates of seasonal head change and hydrologic parameters our model can be used to estimate long term deformation patterns fig 6a and b show the long term head and deformation at our model location respectively our model estimates that roughly 1 5 m of deformation have occurred over our study area since 1985 this assumes that the hydrologic parameters driving sediment deformation and changes in head have not changed significantly over the period of our study some of the hydrologic parameters in our model have been shown to change over time in other studies galloway and burbey 2011 reviewed deformation studies showing that s sk and k v can both decrease over time as the aquifer compacts higher values for both of these parameters results in a greater magnitude of deformation thus if this is the case in our study area then the historic deformation would have been greater than what is estimated by our model an additional model consideration is that prior to development aquifer systems often have preconsolidation stresses that are higher than the initial effective stress when pumping begins galloway and burbey 2011 if that is the case then inelastic deformation would not initially occur and the deformation experienced in the early periods of our model would be less than what our model estimates although it is difficult to assess to what extent changing hydrologic parameters and the initial state of preconsolidation stress may alter the deformation experienced at this site during earlier time periods we consider this model as an appropriate first order approximation of historic deformation while the parameters are constrained to fall within the bounds set where they lie relative to our prior range can tell us something about the groundwater system the parameters for k v and s skv are on the lower end of the prior bounds while s ske and sediment thickness are on the upper end this indicates lower than average permeability clays that have a significant seasonal elastic component of deformation relative to inelastic deformation this finding is somewhat surprising as other basins with significant levels of clay have had a less significant seasonal deformation pattern smith and knight 2019 chaussard and farr 2019 the significant seasonal variations in head observed here are similar to what was observed by chen et al 2016 in the san luis valley colorado but here we observe inelastic deformation where the signal in the san luis valley was elastic the coupling of strong elastic and inelastic signals is likely a result of high amplitude seasonal variations in head a decades long trend in declining heads as well as higher than average elastic skeletal specific storage as stated in section 3 3 and eq 5 the c 2 parameter is a function of the distance from pumping wells the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and the specific storage bjorklund et al 1978 provided estimates from aquifer tests for horizontal hydraulic conductivity and specific storage which we use here to compare with our estimate of c 2 due to their log normal distribution we take the geometric mean of each arriving at 14 9 m day and 1 49 10 5 m 1 respectively marston 2017 estimated pumping from the surrounding wells in our study area the distance from our well with the highest density of pumping is the interval from 3 km to 4 km from the well since theis curves from each pumping well are summed to estimate the total effect on drawdown harp and vesselinov 2011 a distance of 3 5 km would likely cause the dominant signal in drawdown at our study location inserting these parameter values into eq 5 we arrive at an estimate of 3 0 for c 2 slightly below the map value of 5 26 but above the 5th percentile value of 1 77 while our estimate for c 2 is on the higher end of our range multiple variables could be modified to explain this in addition the theis method makes several assumptions that may not be valid in our study area particularly that storage from aquitards is negligible and that the aquifer does not have lateral boundaries theis 1935 for these reasons we do not interpret the values estimated from the c 2 parameter we do consider the agreement between field observed c 2 values and our model estimates as an indication that the theis assumption can be a reasonable approximation for head time series in this study area additionally the good fit of our model with the insar observeddeformation further validates this method for estimating the head time series 5 conclusion as water scarcity increases globally methods to estimate changes in groundwater systems are becoming more important in this study we have presented a method that makes use of incomplete records of deformation from satellite derived insar data and groundwater levels from in situ measurements to model deformation interpolate seasonal patterns in groundwater level data and estimate hydrologic parameters this method can be implemented with sparsely sampled measurements of deformation and groundwater levels and has a robust estimate of uncertainty our method performed well when compared with a validation dataset of deformation we found that at our study site in parowan valley utah deformation is driven by a combination of large 20 m seasonal fluctuations in head as well as continued year over year drawdown this results in a significant elastic and inelastic deformation signal even during years when there was no year over year drawdown significant inelastic deformation of clays occurred during the highest groundwater pumping months in summer and early fall when intervals of the deforming clay layers that had not yet equilibrated with drawdowns from previous years reached their lowest groundwater levels we used this method to estimate that 1 6 m of subsidence has occurred at our study area since 1985 the method developed here can be implemented in other regions with sparse groundwater level and deformation data to both fill gaps in the temporal record of each dataset and estimate hydrologic

4330,groundwater extraction causes significant land subsidence in many parts of the world with compressible sediments insar data have been used to estimate the magnitude of this subsidence and derive hydrologic and geomechanical properties in these areas in spite of recent advances in insar processing methods several challenges remain in relating surface deformation to hydrologic systems the relationship between deformation and groundwater levels is non linear and existing groundwater level data are often sparsely sampled so that it is challenging to relate them to insar derived deformation in addition historical insar datasets are sparsely sampled in time leaving many gaps in existing deformation estimates in this study we present an approach to improve the temporal density of groundwater level and deformation estimates the study area for this demonstration is parowan valley utah a region dependent on groundwater for agricultural use that has seen significant declines in head over the past 70 years in our approach we use theis curves to interpolate seasonal fluctuations in head and a subsidence model to extend deformation estimates we find that with this approach we are able to closely match long term and seasonal estimates of deformation estimate seasonal fluctuations in head and characterize the elastic and inelastic response to changes in head keywords insar subsidence groundwater groundwater modeling mcmc 1 introduction as groundwater demand increases due to changing land use patterns and population growth vörösmarty et al 2000 foley et al 2005 as well as warming climates which cause increasingly irregular patterns of surface water availability due to drought and flooding mann and gleick 2015 methods to improve our understanding of groundwater availability are crucial in spite of its importance monitoring groundwater systems is challenging the standard monitoring approach is to measure groundwater levels periodically at wells dispersed throughout the aquifer of interest but this approach is time and labor intensive requires drilling monitoring wells or re purposing irrigation wells and leaves both temporal and spatial gaps in groundwater measurements one promising technology to improve monitoring of groundwater systems is interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar satellite derived insar data provide estimates of ground deformation with an accuracy of 1 cm or better zebker et al 1997 emardson et al 2003 which can be related to changes in groundwater levels that cause aquifer materials with sufficient compressibility and thickness to expand and contract due to changing pore pressure insar data have been used for over two decades to improve understanding of hydrologic systems amelung et al 1999 boni et al 2020 chaussard et al 2014 hoffmann et al 2001 2003a reeves et al 2011 tomas et al 2014 smith and knight 2019 applications of insar data include estimating geomechanical parameters of deforming sediments bell et al 2008 reeves et al 2011 chen et al 2016 separating elastic and inelastic components of deformation chaussard and farr 2019 smith et al 2017 calibrating groundwater models with vertical deformation estimates hoffmann et al 2003a zhang and burbey 2016 with full 3 dimensional deformation estimates boni et al 2020 alghamdi et al 2020 and estimating large scale subsidence or subsidence risk with machine learning or other statistical methods herrera garcia et al 2021 smith and majumdar 2020 while many advances have been made in deformation modeling over this time period it remains a challenge to relate groundwater levels or head to insar data in regions with high withdrawal rates as these areas often have a complex non linear relationship between deformation and changes in head thus in these regions it is challenging to estimate head using insar data without a robust process based model of head changes three dimensional groundwater models have been used to estimate head in these circumstances but are time consuming and computationally expensive to implement they also require extensive hydrological data to calibrate again raising issues in basins with sparse groundwater monitoring although insar data have been used successfully in many regions the challenges described limit their use in regions with sparse groundwater level data which is often not available with sufficient temporal or spatial density even in the most water stressed regions in this study we present a new method to model aquifer deformation that is straightforward to implement even in regions with complex inelastic deformation patterns with limited head data and without requiring a full groundwater model the method makes use of pumping response functions using the well known theis drawdown solution as an interpolation function to fill in missing head data for the aquifer this can then be used to solve for the head throughout the clay layers or aquitards within the aquifer system and model deformation this approach allows us to combine incomplete water level data with an incomplete record of surface deformation from insar to model deformation this method makes use of theory from previous deformation modeling studies hoffmann et al 2003b while adding the ability to model deformation and estimate head in regions without temporally dense head measurements the markov chain monte carlo inversion procedure is chosen to solve for the parameters necessary to simulate deformation thus providing a robust estimate of uncertainty 2 study area our study area is in parowan valley southwest utah fig 1 this area is part of the basin and range province and is composed of roughly 600 m of unconsolidated basin fill deposits of alternating fine and coarse grained materials brooks 2017 shah and boyd 2018 marston 2017 the aquifer system is bounded on the southeast by the paragonah fault system and red cliffs and on the northwest by the black mountains marston 2017 most of the recharge to the basin comes from the red cliffs either from infiltration of mountain streams on alluvial fans at the foot of the red cliffs or from groundwater flow from the mountain aquifer marston 2017 brooks 2017 the lowest point of the valley little salt lake is a historic lake that has evaporated due to diminished recharge caused by groundwater pumping groundwater flows to this location from the red cliffs and from the aquifer to the northeast fig 1 parowan valley is predominantly a closed basin and has coarse grained alluvial fan deposits along the southeast that fine towards the central and northwest portions of the valley marston 2017 in and near the little salt lake the sediments are primarily fine grained lacustrine deposits the portion of the valley that is irrigated lies primarily along the northwestern side of the valley where more fine grained deposits are located marston 2017 bjorklund et al 1978 compiled information from eight aquifer tests performed in the valley the specific storage values determined from these tests ranged from 9 4 10 7 to 2 2 10 4 m 1 with a geometric mean of 8 6 10 6 m 1 these specific storage values are well within the range for confined aquifers fetter 2001 the hydraulic conductivity determined from these tests ranged from 4 0 to 145 m day with a geometric mean of 12 m day which lies in the range of values for clean sands freeze and cherry 1979 thus in spite of containing enough aquitards to confine the main aquifer system permeable permeable sandy units cause significant horizontal flow within the aquifer system this aquifer has been pumped extensively for over 70 years to support agricultural development which the local economy is reliant upon with long term drawdowns exceed 30 m over that time period duross and kirby 2004 marston 2017 3 materials and methods in this study we developed a model to simulate total surface deformation at one location the model location shown in yellow in fig 1 with co located yearly head measurements from usgs well 375 344 112 521 601 https groundwaterwatch usgs gov awlsites asp s 375344112521601 ncd and insar data processed from the sentinel 1 satellites we assumed that the aquifer system was bounded by a thick low permeability clay layer at the top this assumption is consistent with the confined nature of the aquifer marston 2017 we also assumed the aquifer system was composed of a number of interbedded clay layers within a permeable aquifer material a common condition in regions with alternating fine grained and coarse grained deposits and similar to what is modeled by hoffmann et al 2003b and smith and knight 2019 the total thickness of the aquifer system and the number of clay layers within the aquifer system were unknowns that we solved for our model required estimates of heads both within the permeable aquifer material where horizontal groundwater flow dominates as well as within less permeable clay layers that are responsible for most of the deformation where vertical flow dominates the head in the permeable aquifer was assumed to not vary with depth and to be represented by measurements taken at the well the head in the less permeable clays were assumed to vary with distance from the boundary top and bottom of the clay layer the head estimates for the aquifer were used as a boundary condition to solve for the heads in the clay layers fig 2 shows a visual representation of the aquifer and clay layer flow systems as well as the equations that are used to estimate heads in each system section 3 1 describes the general theory behind deformation due to changes in pore pressure as well as our approach to solve for the heads within clay layers given some boundary head values for the main aquifer section 3 2 describes our approach to estimate seasonal heads in the main aquifer given yearly head estimates section 3 3 describes our insar data processing workflow section 3 4 describes the full inversion procedure which uses heads from 3 1 and 3 2 to model deformation then calibrates model parameters to match insar data derived from 3 3 3 1 modeling inelastic and elastic deformation caused by changing heads in this paper we describe a novel approach to deal with sparse head measurements once these are estimated deformation can be modeled the model we used to simulate deformation as a function of head was based on the model described in smith and knight 2019 for a more detailed treatment of the deformation model the reader is referred to that paper there are two fundamental principles our model uses to simulate deformation the first relates changing groundwater levels δ h to deformation δ b of subsurface layers riley 1969 1 δ b δ h s k where s k s sk b 0 is the skeletal storage coefficient s sk is the skeletal specific storage and b 0 is the thickness of the compacting material the assumption of this equation is that for any change in pore pressure there is an equivalent change in effective stress on the aquifer skeleton terzaghi 1925 which is valid when the compressibility of the pore water is negligible compared to the compressibility of the skeleton this assumption is usually valid in regions with compressible sedimentary materials hoffmann et al 2003b the skeletal specific storage which can also be defined as the product of the specific weight of water and the compressibility of the compacting material changes based on the stress history of the material that is compacting when the stress of the material exceeds the preconsolidation stress which is the highest stress that the material has previously experienced inelastic or permanent deformation occurs and the constant s skv is used because the effective stress in aquifers is the difference between the total stress of the overlying material which typically does not change significantly and the pore pressure which is a function of the groundwater level and changes due to pumping or recharge aquifers reach this stress state when the groundwater level in the compacting material drops below what was previously the lowest experienced level or the preconsolidation head in all other cases elastic or recoverable deformation occurs and the constant s ske is used field studies compiled by sneed 2001 indicate that s skv is 10 to 100 times larger than s ske and for this reason inelastic deformation typically dominates the deformation signal clay sediments are the only major source of inelastic deformation as sandy or consolidated deposits do not deform elastically at the stresses that most aquifer systems are subjected to smith et al 2017 the second fundamental principle our model is the simulation of groundwater levels throughout deforming clay layers which have a delayed reaction to changing groundwater levels in the main aquifer it is assumed that measurements taken from wells are indicative of the groundwater level in the main aquifer not clay layers within the aquifer that typically make up most of the deformation signal due to their higher s sk values especially during inelastic deformation to solve for the groundwater level in these clay layers it is assumed that clays are extensive enough laterally that groundwater flow is effectively one dimensional we also assume that the clay layers are bounded at the top and bottom by a permeable aquifer the head in the aquifer estimated in this paper using the theis method detailed in section 3 2 forms the boundary condition on the top and bottom of this layer we model the heads of the clay layer with the one dimensional groundwater flow equation given below fetter 2001 2 z k v h z s s h t the parameters needed to solve this equation are the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the clay layer k v the specific storage of the clay layer s s the vertical location in the clay layer z and time t in this study we assume that s s of clay is equal to s sk of clay a reasonable approximation for clays since the specific storage of water is negligible compared to the skeletal specific storage of clays smith et al 2017 we implemented the one dimensional groundwater flow equation using a finite difference solution to the mathematically equivalent heat diffusion equation recktenwald 2004 as shown in fig 2 the aquifer system we modeled contains multiple clay layers in this study we followed the implementation of hoffmann et al 2003b and smith and knight 2019 who solved for the heads and deformation of a single clay layer with a thickness that is representative of the true thickness distribution of the system effective thickness or b e and multiplied the deformation of this clay layer by the number of clay layers the parameter b e is given by the equation b e 1 n i n b i 2 where n is the total number of layers and b i is the thickness of an individual clay layer the drillers log for the well at the location that is modeled in this study is given in supplementary table 1 solving for b e with this information is not straightforward since lithology data from drillers logs is not highly precise or accurate e g faunt et al 2010 and because many of the intervals are classified as having both sand and clay we assume that layers classified as having sand and clay are 50 sand and 50 clay by volume with this assumption the fraction of the drillers log profile that is clay is 43 and the fraction that is sand is 57 if we further assume that all layers with sand and clay have two sub layers of clay that are one fourth the total thickness of that layer then b e is computed to be 7 3 m if we instead assume that all layers with sand and clay have one sub layer of clay that is one half the total thickness of that layer then b e is 11 1 m we chose a value for b e of 10 m which lies between these ranges we kept this value constant since solving for the clay thickness causes stability issues in the inversion procedure however we do note that an inaccurate b e estimate would lead to biases in the other parameter estimates of our model 3 1 estimating aquifer head time series with theis functions to model deformation as a function of changing pore pressure or changing head we need an estimate of the head over time the heads in the clay layers can be solved for with eq 2 but this requires knowledge of the heads in the aquifer which forms the boundary for the clay layers yearly head measurements are taken by the usgs throughout the parowan valley providing a robust long term estimate of changes in head within the aquifer the site of our model is usgs well 375344112521601 a well drilled to a depth of 193 m which has yearly head measurements from 1984 to 2020 the insar data show a strong seasonal pattern indicating that heads vary significantly during the season as well in order to model this seasonal pattern a dataset of head values with higher temporal resolution is needed in this study we develop a new approach to solve for seasonal variation in head with limited prior knowledge of head values seasonal groundwater levels are driven by either pumping at a well or recharge from the surrounding aquifer and can be approximated using the analytical solution developed by theis 1935 3 δ h q 2 π t w r 2 s s 4 k h t where δ h is the change in aquifer head q is pumping volume k h is the aquifer hydraulic conductivity t is the aquifer transmissivity hydraulic conductivity multiplied by the thickness r is the distance from the well being pumped s s is the aquifer storage coefficient t is time and w u is the well function w u u e y y d y where in this instance u r 2 s s 4 k h t the theis equation has been widely used to model changes in groundwater levels as a function of external fluxes jacob 1940 randolph et al 1985 wu et al 2005 both pumping and recharge and estimate aquifer parameters of k h and s s the theis solution makes several assumptions notably that the aquifer is confined homogenous and infinite laterally and that there is negligible leakage from surrounding aquitards theis 1935 aquifer tests in our study area indicate the aquifer is confined bjorklund et al 1978 marston 2017 while no aquifer is homogenous or infinite laterally this is often a reasonable assumption in sedimentary basins such as our study site there is likely leakage from surrounding aquitards and clays within the aquifer assuming no leakage could result in biased parameter estimates particularly s s rather than use the theis solution to estimate aquifer parameters some studies have used it as a function to approximate the response of heads to pumping or recharge harp and vesselinov 2011 shapoori et al 2015 particularly over long multi month time scales copty and findikakis 2004 this second approach is the aim of our study we use the theis function to develop hydrologically realistic drawdown and recovery curves and not to estimate k h or s s for this reason if assumptions of the theis equation are not correct in our study area this may result in biased k h or s s parameter estimates but the head time series should still resemble a realistic drawdown and recovery curve since we are not attempting to accurately characterize those parameters but rather to produce realistic head time series we consider this approach appropriate for this study since we are not interested in estimating k h or s s we can simplify the inputs to eq 3 the theis curve can be described as having an amplitude component 4 c 1 q 2 π t and a time decay component 5 c 2 r 2 s s 4 k h using these components we can then re write eq 3 as 6 δ h c 1 w c 2 t thus to estimate seasonal fluctuations in head we must estimate c 1 and c 2 while both parameters could be inverted for c 1 is highly correlated with estimates of s ske which relates seasonal changes in head to seasonal deformation since s ske is not well characterized in this area we only solved for c 2 which is less correlated with other parameters that we solve for and estimated c 1 from existing well data in parowan and neighboring regions example seasonal head time series derived from varying the c 2 parameter are shown in fig 3 most head measurements are taken in march when head levels are near their highest levels the usgs collected some fall head measurements in november of 2012 and 2013 which provide an estimate of seasonal drawdown at the well site of our study area usgs well 375344112521601 the seasonal drawdown in 2012 was 3 2 m and 7 5 m in 2013 two nearby sites usgs wells 375 338 112 502 801 and 375303112495102 see table 1 had much less year over year variation in seasonal drawdowns with average seasonal drawdowns of 5 9 m and 5 1 m in 2012 and 2013 respectively the spatial variation in drawdown is a function of distance from r s s k h and q as shown in eq 3 of these parameters the only one that changes year over year is q or the volume of water withdrawn thus the water demand is likely the cause for year over year variation in seasonal drawdown at our study site growers in this region rotate crops and based on the usda nass cropland data layer the well at our study site was next to a field that used lower water intensity crops oats in 2012 and alfalfa in most other years thus it is likely that less water was pumped near the well site for this study in 2012 than in a typical year based on these lines of evidence we estimate that the 7 5 m drawdown in 2013 is due to irrigation of more water intensive crops and is more representative of the yearly drawdown rate although the groundwater levels are taken when they are near their highest levels in march and near their lowest levels in november these measurements are taken roughly one month before groundwater pumping has started and one month after pumping has finished respectively for this reason they do not provide a true estimate of the maximum seasonal drawdown experienced at a well in eq 6 the parameter c 1 controls the seasonal amplitude of head variations the c 1 parameter value can be specified for both the drawdown and recovery periods we use this equation to make an initial estimate of the change in head with c 1 7 5 for both the drawdown and recovery period then compare the seasonal difference in head from march to november 2013 the ratio of observed change in head over this time period 7 5 m divided by the modeled change in head over the same time period is used to scale c 1 so that the difference between march and november levels for 2013 is 7 5 m in addition to constraining c 1 to match the seasonal drawdown observed in 2013 we also scaled c 1 each year for the drawdown period only to match yearly march to march water level changes for example there was a 1 5 m drop in head from march 2018 to march 2019 see supplementary fig 2 to match this we increased the drawdown in 2018 by scaling c 1 for the drawdown period only so that a 1 5 m overall drop in head for the year was modeled we did this for all years of the study period to match the year over year changes in head the observed and modeled changes in head are shown in fig 5a table 2 3 2 processing insar data single look complex slc images acquired by the sentinel 1a and b satellites spanning the time period from 2015 to 2020 were downloaded from the alaska satellite facility https search asf alaska edu images along the orbital path 100 frames 464 and 465 were downloaded supplementary fig 2 they were subsequently processed using the gmtsar code sandwell et al 2011 the processing workflow was to first co register the slcs using a digital elevation model dem then process interferograms and unwrap them using the snaphu method chen and zebker 2002 we processed all interferograms that had a temporal baseline time between acquisitions of less than 50 days and a spatial baseline distance between orbits of 100 m this resulted in a total of 330 interferograms we removed pixels from the analysis that had a coherence less than 0 15 following the unwrapping we used the small baseline subset sbas berardino et al 2002 approach to estimate deformation at each acquisition time for the sbas method we used deformation at the pixel of interest model location shown in fig 1 relative to a reference pixel also shown in fig 1 the reference pixel was selected in the city of parowan where scatterers are stable and little deformation is expected due to surface water supply and its location on an alluvial fan where geomechancially stronger sands are the dominant sediment the incidence angle of the sar imagery over our study area was 39 0 degrees insar velocity data were converted from line of sight to vertical by dividing the line of sight velocity by the cosine of the incidence angle this assumes that there is no significant relative horizontal deformation since there is no significant tectonic motion in the region mapped faults have estimates slip rates of 1 mm yr or less olig et al 2004 and pumping occurs at a regional scale where vertical deformation tends to dominate e g galloway and burbey 2011 rather than from one individual well we consider this a reasonable approximation the fit between sbas estimated phase change for each acquisition pair and observed phase change from the unwrapped interferograms is very good supplementary fig 3 and the residuals had a standard deviation of 0 21 cm this is an indication that the interferograms have relatively good agreement with each other but is not an absolute measure of insar uncertainty since there are no nearby gps stations with long term records we are unable to quantify the true uncertainty in the insar data however the time series produced from the insar data at our study site shown in fig 5b shows a clear seasonal and long term hydrologic pattern and appears visually to have little noise or random variation we assume a 1 cm error in the sbas derived time series which is consistent with work from previous studies zebker et al 1997 emardson et al 2003 the resulting insar velocity map is shown in fig 4 and the time series at our model location is shown in fig 5 b 3 3 inversion procedure parameters to solve for in our simulation were k v to solve for heads within the clay using eq 2 the time at which groundwater levels peaked lag s skv s ske c 2 and total sediment thickness since many different combinations of these parameters may result in a reasonable model fit we elected to use a markov chain monte carlo mcmc a parameter estimation method that provides a robust estimate of uncertainty for each parameter estimate the mcmc procedure randomly selects parameters from a prior distribution and computes the model misfit relative to the measurement error with a function known as the log likelihood defined below 7 l x y σ 2 n 2 log 2 π t 1 n log σ t 1 2 t 1 n y y t x σ t 2 where y is a vector composed of measurements y in our case the deformation measured with insar σ is the standard deviation of the measurements and y are the values modeled in our case the deformation modeled using eq 1 eq 2 and eq 6 using parameter values x in our case k v s skv s ske c 2 sediment thickness and lag see table 1 after each iteration the parameters are randomly modified the log likelihood is used to determine whether a new model model proposal is accepted or discarded if the prior distribution of the parameters being estimated are uniform then the model proposal is accepted if it meets the criteria given in eq 8 8 l proposal l current r a n d 0 1 where rand 0 1 is a random number drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 the accepted parameters make up the posterior distribution to sufficiently sample the posterior vrugt 2016 found that between 5000 and 10 000 samples are needed to estimate between 5 and 10 parameters vrugt 2016 also recommend running multiple independent chains by comparing the parameter distributions between chains one can determine the convergence of the parameter estimates we ran 50 000 models on each chain for five different chains the parameter distribution for each chain is shown in supplementary fig 4 each parameter has similar distributions across the five chains indicating that convergence of our model has been achieved we chose to use the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream implementation of mcmc developed by vrugt 2016 this implementation runs multiple parameter estimations called chains in parallel these chains are used to modify the sampler of the posterior distribution and improves performance on complex highly non linear models in our model we assumed uniform prior distributions for all estimated parameters table 1 shows the bounds we defined for the parameters we set the bounds for k v s skv and s ske based on the ranges found by sneed 2001 divided and multiplied by a factor of two for the lower and upper bounds respectively as discussed in 3 3 c 2 r 2 s s 4 k h we used a range of estimates from bjorklund et al 1978 to capture high and low end members for c 2 since pumping from multiple wells at a range of distances likely contribute to the head decline we set a wide range of values for r as well the range of values for r k and s s was 500 to 10000 m 1000 m yr to 50 000 m yr and 1 10 6 m 1 to 2 10 3 m 1 for the high and low values respectively the sediment thickness that experienced a head change equivalent to the head change observed at our monitoring well either in the sediment itself for sands or at the upper and lower boundary for clay layers was assumed to lie between 213 m and 366 m the lower bound 213 m was equivalent to the thickness from 30 m below the land surface to the bottom of the monitoring well depth the upper bound of sediment thickness was estimated by taking the same estimate for the deepest well within 5 km 274 m multiplied by 1 5 this upper bound reflects what has been observed by galloway et al 1998 who found that up to 50 of compaction happened below the depth of wells with extensometers installed while it is possible that a greater sediment thickness experienced a change in head we consider this to be a reasonable physical constraint and that it is unlikely that the sediment thickness is greater than our upper bound 4 results and discussion our parameter estimation procedure resulted in a distribution of values that fit the observed data referred to as the posterior distribution summary statistics for this distribution are shown in table 3 the full distribution of values for each parameter is shown in supplementary figs 4 and 5 we took the 5th and 95th percentiles of the posterior distribution for each parameter to determine the uncertainty of each parameter as well as the mean and median values to determine a best estimate for each parameter each parameter has a fairly narrow range the parameter k v whose prior bounds varied by 5 orders of magnitude had 90 of its posterior values within a factor of 5 a similar trend is seen with c 2 whose prior bounds varied by 8 orders of magnitude and had 90 of its posterior values within a factor of 6 specific skeletal storage parameters s skv and s ske both had prior bounds that varied by more than one order of magnitude with 90 of the posterior within a factor of 6 and 1 respectively the posterior distribution for sediment thickness and lag narrowed relative to the prior bounds but not as significantly while c 2 and lag are unique parameters to this study and sediment thickness is study area dependent the estimates for k v s skv and s ske have been estimated in other regions with similar geologic environments the estimates for k v and s kv fall within the range of values estimated by sneed 2001 for the central valley in california which has a similar depositional environment however our estimate for s ske is a factor of 2 higher than the highest value reported by sneed 2001 in the central valley chen et al 2016 studied elastic deformation in the san luis valley of colorado another similar depositional environment this region may be even more similar to ours as both have significant amounts of volcanic deposits mccalpin 1996 marston 2017 chen et al 2016 did not report s ske values but did report s ke values which can be estimated from our parameters by multiplying s ske by the sediment thickness hoffmann et al 2003a if we use this approach to estimate s ke from our estimated parameters our s ke estimate is 0 015 which falls within the range of s ke values reported by chen et al 2016 our posterior parameter distribution resulted in a posterior distribution of modeled head fig 5a and deformation black lines in fig 5b the magnitude of seasonal head change and the rate at which the head decline occurred was controlled by c 2 the c 2 values had a fairly narrow range that resulted in an average seasonal fluctuation in head of 20 m this is a fairly typical seasonal decline for a confined aquifer in a heavily pumped area butler et al 2012 the modeled and insar derived observed deformation are shown in fig 3b we calibrated our model with insar data from 2015 to march 2019 and held out the remaining insar data to validate our model calibration and validation insar data are shown in green and purple respectively our modeled deformation fits the calibration and validation data remarkably well the good model fit as well as the sensitivity of the model to the estimated parameters gives us additional confidence in our head estimates the maximum a posteriori map or the mode of the posterior distribution defined here as the most common set of parameters rounded to three significant figures is shown as a dashed yellow line in fig 3 the posterior deformation estimates are distributed fairly tightly around the map deformation model demonstrating that the uncertainty in modeled deformation is low although the seasonal head fluctuations appear to dominate the head signal there are year over year changes in head that appear subtle but can have a significant effect on the deformation pattern fig 4 shows the yearly change in modeled head a and yearly modeled deformation b note that in 2014 and 2018 there were significant declines in head of 1 2 and 1 5 m respectively in those years the deformation rate also increased from an average of 4 2 cm yr to 4 9 and 5 1 cm yr respectively fig 6 long term permanent deformation occurs even in years with very little or no year over year head decline because each year the head seasonally drops to a point that it is at or very near the lowest head experienced in the aquifer the clay layers that are deforming do not have a spatially uniform preconsolidation head the preconsolidation head varies at each point in a clay layer because the head in any given clay layer does not immediately equilibrate with that experienced in the aquifer thus when the head becomes close to the preconsolidation head of the aquifer it begins to drop below the preconsolidation head for some intervals of deforming clay layers when this happens inelastic deformation occurs fig 7 demonstrates this concept the modeled head is shown in fig 7a colored blue when elastic deformation is the principal deformation signal i e when it accounts for more than 50 of the deformation occurring at a given time and colored red when inelastic deformation is the principal deformation signal note that although both elastic and inelastic deformation are occurring during the entire period the red and blue lines only indicate which one accounts for the majority of the deformation at any given time fig 7b shows the modeled elastic blue and inelastic red deformation note that inelastic deformation becomes the dominant signal each year during the late summer early fall months when head is close to its lowest value note also that the inelastic deformation has an overall negative trend while the elastic deformation is mainly seasonal with no long term trend while elastic deformation could have a long term negative trend if there is a long term drop in groundwater levels while the head remains above the preconsolidation head in this location the groundwater levels consistently drop below the preconsolidation head during periods of drawdown i e there have been no periods of significant recovery above the preconsolidation head fig 8 in addition to producing estimates of seasonal head change and hydrologic parameters our model can be used to estimate long term deformation patterns fig 6a and b show the long term head and deformation at our model location respectively our model estimates that roughly 1 5 m of deformation have occurred over our study area since 1985 this assumes that the hydrologic parameters driving sediment deformation and changes in head have not changed significantly over the period of our study some of the hydrologic parameters in our model have been shown to change over time in other studies galloway and burbey 2011 reviewed deformation studies showing that s sk and k v can both decrease over time as the aquifer compacts higher values for both of these parameters results in a greater magnitude of deformation thus if this is the case in our study area then the historic deformation would have been greater than what is estimated by our model an additional model consideration is that prior to development aquifer systems often have preconsolidation stresses that are higher than the initial effective stress when pumping begins galloway and burbey 2011 if that is the case then inelastic deformation would not initially occur and the deformation experienced in the early periods of our model would be less than what our model estimates although it is difficult to assess to what extent changing hydrologic parameters and the initial state of preconsolidation stress may alter the deformation experienced at this site during earlier time periods we consider this model as an appropriate first order approximation of historic deformation while the parameters are constrained to fall within the bounds set where they lie relative to our prior range can tell us something about the groundwater system the parameters for k v and s skv are on the lower end of the prior bounds while s ske and sediment thickness are on the upper end this indicates lower than average permeability clays that have a significant seasonal elastic component of deformation relative to inelastic deformation this finding is somewhat surprising as other basins with significant levels of clay have had a less significant seasonal deformation pattern smith and knight 2019 chaussard and farr 2019 the significant seasonal variations in head observed here are similar to what was observed by chen et al 2016 in the san luis valley colorado but here we observe inelastic deformation where the signal in the san luis valley was elastic the coupling of strong elastic and inelastic signals is likely a result of high amplitude seasonal variations in head a decades long trend in declining heads as well as higher than average elastic skeletal specific storage as stated in section 3 3 and eq 5 the c 2 parameter is a function of the distance from pumping wells the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and the specific storage bjorklund et al 1978 provided estimates from aquifer tests for horizontal hydraulic conductivity and specific storage which we use here to compare with our estimate of c 2 due to their log normal distribution we take the geometric mean of each arriving at 14 9 m day and 1 49 10 5 m 1 respectively marston 2017 estimated pumping from the surrounding wells in our study area the distance from our well with the highest density of pumping is the interval from 3 km to 4 km from the well since theis curves from each pumping well are summed to estimate the total effect on drawdown harp and vesselinov 2011 a distance of 3 5 km would likely cause the dominant signal in drawdown at our study location inserting these parameter values into eq 5 we arrive at an estimate of 3 0 for c 2 slightly below the map value of 5 26 but above the 5th percentile value of 1 77 while our estimate for c 2 is on the higher end of our range multiple variables could be modified to explain this in addition the theis method makes several assumptions that may not be valid in our study area particularly that storage from aquitards is negligible and that the aquifer does not have lateral boundaries theis 1935 for these reasons we do not interpret the values estimated from the c 2 parameter we do consider the agreement between field observed c 2 values and our model estimates as an indication that the theis assumption can be a reasonable approximation for head time series in this study area additionally the good fit of our model with the insar observeddeformation further validates this method for estimating the head time series 5 conclusion as water scarcity increases globally methods to estimate changes in groundwater systems are becoming more important in this study we have presented a method that makes use of incomplete records of deformation from satellite derived insar data and groundwater levels from in situ measurements to model deformation interpolate seasonal patterns in groundwater level data and estimate hydrologic parameters this method can be implemented with sparsely sampled measurements of deformation and groundwater levels and has a robust estimate of uncertainty our method performed well when compared with a validation dataset of deformation we found that at our study site in parowan valley utah deformation is driven by a combination of large 20 m seasonal fluctuations in head as well as continued year over year drawdown this results in a significant elastic and inelastic deformation signal even during years when there was no year over year drawdown significant inelastic deformation of clays occurred during the highest groundwater pumping months in summer and early fall when intervals of the deforming clay layers that had not yet equilibrated with drawdowns from previous years reached their lowest groundwater levels we used this method to estimate that 1 6 m of subsidence has occurred at our study area since 1985 the method developed here can be implemented in other regions with sparse groundwater level and deformation data to both fill gaps in the temporal record of each dataset and estimate hydrologic

newtonian effects chevalier et al 2014 fadili et al 2002 fayed et al 2016 indeed many studies have investigated either non newtonian effects i e fluid rheology di federico et al 2010 fadili et al 2002

dynamic viscosity μ with increasing shear rate di federico et al 2010 fadili et al 2002 where fluid flux is related to the pressure gradient via a power law function recent research proposed that at the low reynolds number re regime when inertial effects are negligible the velocity field is essentially controlled by the morphology i e geometry of a porous medium rather than fluid rheology chevalier et al 2014 zami pierre et al 2016 therefore the apparent permeability k re curves which are calculated based on flux pressure gradient relationship by using a constant viscosity can be condensed for power law fluids with a variety of fluid rheology in heterogeneous porous media morais et al 2009 zami pierre et al 2016 on the other hand for newtonian fluids inertial effects that cause nonlinear flow have been extensively studied in a variety of porous bear 1972 chaudhary et al 2011 fourar et al 2005 and fractured zhou et al 2019 zimmerman et al 2004 media yet the mechanisms of nonlinear flow considering the coupled non newtonian and inertial effects remain underexplored to address this coupling effect previous studies experimentally examined the nonlinear flow behavior through packed porous beads and rough fractures for shear thinning fluids rodríguez de castro and radilla 2016 2017b zhang et al 2019 these studies proposed forchheimer s law or ergun s equation to describe the relationship between fluid flux and pressure gradient specifically a previous study used pore scale simulations to determine the physical parameters in the extended darcy forchheimer law tosco et al 2013 to describe fluid flow with non negligible non newtonian and inertial effects in porous media zhang et al 2019 revealed the critical reynolds number over which inertia dominated flow occurs only depends on pore geometry for fractures by using porous media viscosity however the threshold for distinguishing flow nonlinearity caused by appreciable inertial effects for non newtonian fluids in matrix pores with more pronounced pore body to throat aspect ratios remains unclear this is attributed to a lack of mechanistic understanding of nonlinear flow for shear thinning fluids at a high re regime and thereby puts a question mark on when the modified darcy s law e g the darcy forchheimer equation tosco et al 2013 zami pierre et al 2016 should be used as inertial effects are significant to fill this knowledge gap and identify the onset of inertia driven nonlinear flow for non newtonian fluid flows in porous media this study addresses a set of questions how and why does nonlinear flow occur for non newtonian fluids with increasing inertial effects how do fluid rheology and inter pore geometries affect critical re re c for identifying the transition from rheology to inertia dominated flow regimes can we predict re c based on the measurable properties i e fluid rheology and pore shape property we address the above mentioned questions through direct numerical simulations by solving the navier stokes equations nse in a variety of idealized diverging converging pore geometries this treatment avoids the flow complexity induced by heterogeneous pore network as further discussed below 2 methods 2 1 governing equation for non newtonian fluids flow the flow of incompressible power law fluids through porous media is essentially governed by the nse 1 ρ u u p μ 2 u 2 u 0 where ρ is fluid density 1000 kg m3 p is total pressure p indicates pressure gradient u is velocity vector and apparent viscosity μ pa s depends on the local shear rate within the flowing domain and thus varies from point to point as we further explained below 2 2 viscosity of power law fluids following previous study zami pierre et al 2016 power law fluids i e shear thinning fluids with cutoff were considered here for mimicking polymer solutions such as xanthan seright et al 2011 where μ pa s scales as a power law against shear rate γ 1 s with a low limit cutoff fig 1 3 μ μ 0 γ

was forced to flow through a two dimensional 2d axis symmetric diverging converging pore geometry fig 2 a 2b that mimicked fluid flow through three dimensional 3d pores fig 2c via a 2d modelling method chaudhary et al 2011 following chaudhary et al 2013 we used a variety of idealized diverging converging pore geometries which are characterized by a non dimensional hydraulic shape factor β 5 β s a l v where sa is the total surface area of axis symmetric pores l is the domain length in the x direction and v is the pore volume fig 2c we chose geometries with a broad range of β β 5 5 5 6 7 5 8 5 12 5 16 5 21 5 fig 2a and 2c because β is related to apparent permeability and the growth of recirculation zone rz i e rotating eddies induced by inertial effects within intra pores chaudhary et al 2013 2 4 implementation of simulating power law fluids flow we implemented periodic boundary condition across the inlet outlet using pressure gradient p to simulate flow in x direction fig 2b the periodic boundary implements a standard periodicity so that u x 0 u x 1 where subscripts 0 and 1 denote inlet and outlet boundaries respectively this means that the flows across two opposite planes across an inlet or outlet boundary are identical shahidul huqe muzemder and singh 2021 all other boundaries were set as a no slip boundary except that the bottom was a symmetric boundary fig 2b a triangular element mesh was used with refined meshes around all boundaries with mesh size ranging from 1 μm to 3 μm fig 3 b the total element number increased from 2 5 104 to 6 5 104 for β decreasing from 21 5 down to 5 6 respectively with number of elements approaching on the order of 104 numerical results are insensitive to a further mesh refinement which ensure accuracy of zero velocity at the no slip boundaries unlike previous studies that employed openfoam or lattice boltzmann model hauswirth et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 all simulations were implemented via comsol multiphysics a finite element method based software using the pardiso solver with a maximum iteration of 100 and relative tolerance of 1 10 5 to ensure inertial effects were significant that could result in a fully developed recirculation zone fig 3a and 4 p was incrementally increased to cover a broad range of γ and thus μ fig 1 where each run used previous simulation s results as an initial guess to avoid converging issue when inertial effects were significant each run took about a few minutes with computational time generally increasing with p the numerical integral of local velocity at the outlet yielded fluid flux q 2 5 calculation of bulk viscosity and critical reynolds number following previous studies hauswirth et al 2020 tosco et al 2013 the resultant p q curves were used to estimate bulk viscosity μbk and re 6 μ bk k p q 7 re ρ u l s μ bk ρ q μ bk where k is darcian permeability that was estimated when p was tiny u is the mean flow velocity ls is the characteristic length that was set as the radius of the pore throat fig 2b and q is fluid discharge at the outlet this treatment of computing μbk and re added value in analyzing numerical results of non newtonian fluid flows because the main flow path controls the flow transition morais et al 2009 zami pierre et al 2016 to analyze the evolution of μbk with increasing p and re μbk was further normalized 8 μ μ bk μ b k 0 k p q k p 0 q 0 p q 0 p 0 q where μ is dimensionless bulk viscosity subscript 0 indicates the values corresponding to the miniscule i e initial pressure gradient p 0 since μ scales as a power law with shear rate and thus re with a low cutoff we expected that non newtonian effects on μ were initially negligible i e μ remains constant with increasing re and then reflected as a straight line with a slope depending on n when plotting μ re at a log log scale this was demonstrated in tosco et al 2013 and in fig 4 the deviation from this line with a further increase in re was attributed to inertial effects that led to the growth of rz figs 4 and 5 the automatic quantification of rz s volume and location was done via a matlab algorithm and the detailed method and associated matlab code can be found in a recent study zhou et al 2019 the re c was defined in a manner such that there was an obvious deviation from the linear fitting line in terms of log10 μ i e the deviation was quantified when the fitting error e fitting value log10 μ log10μ 1 as demonstrated in figs 4 and 6 where the linear fitting line was determined using the least square method a broad range of fluid rheology and pore geometries i e defined by parameters n and β was considered to examine the nonlinear flow characteristics and to determine re c we conducted a total of 6 n 7 β 100 computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations where 100 corresponded to one hundred increments in the pressure gradient that varied for a given combination of n and β the numerically derived p q curves were then used to estimate re c as described above consequently 6 7 re c can be determined and correlated to n and β where newtonian fluid was also considered and analyzed since n 1 was included 3 results and discussion on nonlinear flow for power law fluids 3 1 nonlinear flow regimes and characteristics the nonlinear flow behavior of power law fluids is attributed to non newtonian effects and inertial effects rodríguez de castro and radilla 2016 2017a these effects dominate at different re ranges fig 4 which are discussed in details below based on power law fluids flow through heterogeneous 3d porous media zami pierre et al 2016 proposed that over the course of the transition from the linear to early nonlinear flow regime the flow field is geometry dependent consistent with this argument we found that the velocity field and flow behavior was controlled by pore geometry for the case demonstrated in fig 4 with β 16 and n 0 7 where the flat line indicated the linear flow regime holds when re 3 10 5 i e fluids were newtonian where non newtonian effects were trivial since μ approached its lower limit fig 1 as re further increased re 3 10 5 non newtonian effects were non negligible that led to a straight line with a given slope at the log log scale in terms of μ re curves fig 6 signifying that μ scales as a power law function of re this suggests that the nonlinear flow regime is essentially driven by the non newtonian effects with a power law relationship between μ and γ where μ and γ are reflected by μ and re respectively this tilted line additionally suggests that inertial effects are much smaller than non newtonian effects thus we propose that the flow regime is rheology dominated within the re range 3 10 5 re 30 where the tilted line holds fig 4 above re c re c 30 the nonlinear flow behavior was further complicated by inertial effects in addition to non newtonian effects that eventually resulted in an obvious nonlinear μ re curve at the log log scale therefore we propose that the flow regime is inertia dominated when re surpasses re c since inertial forces start to play a critical role in changing μ and the growth of rz figs 4 5 note that the transition in flow regimes i e transitioning from linear flow to rheology dominated and inertial dominated nonlinear flow in fig 4 is presentative for all the cases studied here with a wide range of n and β 3 2 growth of recirculation zone results in inertia driven nonlinear flow the increasing inertial effects with re are visually demonstrated by the development and growth of rz within diverging converging pores chaudhary et al 2011 and rough fractures wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 inertial effects and the growth of rz are intrinsically connected by increasing velocity and re figs 4 5 it suggests that rz might be present as the viscous moffatt eddy cardenas et al 2009 even though re is small however rz will grow due to enlarging inertial effects the growth of rz shrinks the main flow channel and consequently reduces k chaudhary et al 2011 all aforementioned studies focused on inertial effects for newtonian fluids for power law fluids consistent with previous study xie and balhoff 2021 inertial effects are also represented by the growth of rz figs 4 and 5 where non newtonian effects also increase with re as inertial effects do unlike newtonian fluids non newtonian effects might compete with inertial effects and thus delay the deviation from the linear μ re line at the log log scale fig 4 when inertial effects dominate over non newtonian effects with increasing re i e re re c yet sustaining a certain rz volume the μ re curve obviously deviates from the tilted line in the log log space fig 4 3 3 effects of hydraulic shape factor and fluid rheology on re c the shape of pore geometry modulates the flow field and thus affects the growth of rz chaudhary et al 2013 where rz is directly related to nonlinear flow behavior as discussed above in this study the idealized diverging converging pore geometry with varying β ranging from 5 5 to 21 5 serves as a prototype to understand how geological heterogeneity impacts non newtonian fluid flows consistent with previous study chaudhary et al 2013 pore geometries with small β values provide more room for the potential growth of rz than those with large β values with increasing re fig 5 this is partly because it is more likely to have viscous moffatt eddies for large β cases than that for small β cases when re is small fig 5 and viscous moffatt eddies do not contribute to the nonlinear flow behavior cardenas et al 2009 consequently the degree of nonlinear flow caused by inertial effects is larger for small β cases than that for large β cases this further implies that re c increases with β fig 6a for a given power law fluid because small β cases need relatively less inertial forces to result in inertia driven nonlinear flow than large β cases fluid rheology n is directly connected to the growth of rz and thus nonlinear flow for both non newtonian n 1 and newtonian n 1 fluids with a further increase in re μ decreases more quickly for power law fluids with a small n than that with a large n fig 1 this results in the slope of μ re curves decreases with n fig 6b leading to the decrease of re c with n fig 7 b unlike previous study zhang et al 2019 that found re c only depends on pore geometry for fractures our study reveals that re c is a function of pore geometry i e hydraulic shape factor and fluid rheology the difference is not surprising due to following three aspects 1 the definitions of viscosity in re are different where zhang et al 2019 used porous media viscosity such that non newtonian and inertial effects could be potentially separated in contrast we used bulk or equivalent viscosity eqn 6 following hauswirth et al 2020 because non newtonian and inertial effects are intertwined and coupled as we discussed above 2 the pore scale geometries are very different between fractures and matrix pores in terms of pore body to throat aspect ratio 3 the slight difference in fluid rheology for charactering shear thinning fluids 3 4 predictive function for re c and its implications for 6 7 cfd simulation scenarios with a given n and β the increasing p yielded enlarged inertial effects and thus the growth of rz figs 4 5 the resultant μ re curves based on numerically derived p q was used to estimate re c based on the simplified diverging and converging pore geometries with a broad range of n and β figs 1 2 we found that re c is below 100 fig 7 the total 6 7 re c values were further correlated with n and β fig 7a and 7b to accurately predict re c considering a fact that re c increases with β but decreases with n fig 6a 6b and 7b the best fitting function was determined via a polynomial function in matlab 9 log 10 re c a b log 10 β c n where the fitting coefficients with 95 confidence bounds are a 0 41 0 24 0 59 b 1 46 1 34 1 59 and c 1 26 1 42 1 11 moreover the root mean square error in estimating re c is 4 91 suggesting a fairly good performance of fitting function in matching numerically derived re c besides equation 9 demonstrates that re c scales with β to the power of 1 46 while it decreases exponentially with n fig 7 the established function between re c and a broad range of β n is useful to predict re c based on the measurable properties i e β and n with the knowledge of re c one can safely model power law fluid flows and relevant pressure distribution using the modified darcy s law morais et al 2009 zami pierre et al 2016 as long as re is below re c for cases with non negligible inertial effects when re re c one might consider forchheimer s law or ergun s equation to accurately describe fluid flow in porous media rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017b 3 5 limitations and potential applications to heterogeneous pore network fluid rheological properties for non newtonian fluids are diverse in nature and the power law is one of rheological models that was used here to investigate the coupling effects of non newtonian and inertia on the flow process we also did not consider shear thickening fluids which are beyond the scope of this study that provides the foundation for future investigations while this study is one of the first attempts to predict the onset of inertia driven nonlinear flow caused by the growth of rz for non newtonian fluids at the mechanistic level the numerical simulations were implemented in idealized diverging converging pores following previous study chaudhary et al 2013 rather than in natural heterogeneous porous medium it is worth noting that the idealized pore geometries studied here not only serve as prototypes of porous medium to unravel the pore scale fluid flow characteristics but also bear significance for fundamentally understanding the flow process occurring at the continuum scale chaudhary et al 2013 where the porous medium can be treated as hydraulically connected diverging converging pores raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 given a fact that the complex pore geometries or pore networks including the pore size distribution and pore morphology characterization are not straightforward rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017b zami pierre et al 2016 but they can be possibly made by the state of art high resolution imaging techniques bijeljic et al 2004 varloteaux et al 2013 in any case to validate the applicability of predictive function developed based on idealized pores to complex pore network we further simulated shear thinning fluids flow with n 0 7 through heterogeneous pore network domain size 640 μm 320 μm with increasing pressures fig 8 where the pore network was imaged by the previous work sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 and was also used as a showcase in comsol multiphysics the inlet and outlet boundaries were set as prescribed pressure boundary condition whereas the rest were no flux boundaries fig 8a the exemplified pressure and velocity distributions were shown in fig 8a 8b the numerically derived μ re curve was used to estimate re c as demonstrated above fig 8b not surprisingly the estimated re c 12 1 fig 8b for heterogeneous pore network which is within the predictive re c range 4 2 re c 28 7 according to the equation 9 when n 0 7 fig 7 therefore the knowledge learned here can be effectively considered in the large scale models i e pore network models balhoff et al 2008 lopez et al 2003 perrin et al 2006 by properly describing microscopic non newtonian fluid flows in diverse diverging converging pores which can eventually represent the macroscopic characteristics of non newtonian fluid flow through complex heterogeneous porous medium 4 conclusions understanding and predicting nonlinear flow for shear thinning fluids is of importance for many geophysical and hydrological problems the onset of nonlinear flow due to significant inertial effects can be used to inform large scale models in terms of appropriately applying the modified darcy s law or extensional nonlinear laws e g forchheimer s law however we know little about the onset of nonlinear flow caused by inertial effects for non newtonian fluids to fill this knowledge gap we determine the critical reynolds number re c for identifying the onset of inertia driven nonlinear flow by simulating power law fluids with a wide range of fluid rheology n through a variety of idealized diverging converging pore geometries characterized by a non dimensional hydraulic shape factor β moreover we propose that the nonlinear flow regime is sequentially dominated by fluid rheology and inertial effects with increasing re which is evident based on the growth of recirculation zones finally the newly established relationship between re c and β n allows for the prediction of re c based on measurable properties β n which was further validated by simulating shear shinning fluid flow through heterogeneous pore network credit authorship contribution statement lizhi zheng

newtonian effects chevalier et al 2014 fadili et al 2002 fayed et al 2016 indeed many studies have investigated either non newtonian effects i e fluid rheology di federico et al 2010 fadili et al 2002 zami pierre et al 2016 or inertial effects chaudhary et al 2011 2013 on fluid flow in porous media for power law non newtonian fluids darcy s law is modified to accommodate the power law scaling of dynamic viscosity μ with increasing shear rate di federico et al 2010 fadili et al 2002 where fluid flux is related to the pressure gradient via a power law function recent research proposed that at the low reynolds number re regime when inertial effects are negligible the velocity field is essentially controlled by the morphology i e geometry of a porous medium rather than fluid rheology chevalier et al 2014 zami pierre et al 2016 therefore the apparent permeability k re curves which are calculated based on flux pressure gradient relationship by using a constant viscosity can be condensed for power law fluids with a variety of fluid rheology in heterogeneous porous media morais et al 2009 zami pierre et al 2016 on the other hand for newtonian fluids inertial effects that cause nonlinear flow have been extensively studied in a variety of porous bear 1972 chaudhary et al 2011 fourar et al 2005 and fractured zhou et al 2019 zimmerman et al 2004 media yet the mechanisms of nonlinear flow considering the coupled non newtonian and inertial effects remain underexplored to address this coupling effect previous studies experimentally examined the nonlinear flow behavior through packed porous beads and rough fractures for shear thinning fluids rodríguez de castro and radilla 2016 2017b zhang et al 2019 these studies proposed forchheimer s law or ergun s equation to describe the relationship between fluid flux and pressure gradient specifically a previous study used pore scale simulations to determine the physical parameters in the extended darcy forchheimer law tosco et al 2013 to describe fluid flow with non negligible non newtonian and inertial effects in porous media zhang et al 2019 revealed the critical reynolds number over which inertia dominated flow occurs only depends on pore geometry for fractures by using porous media viscosity however the threshold for distinguishing flow nonlinearity caused by appreciable inertial effects for non newtonian fluids in matrix pores with more pronounced pore body to throat aspect ratios remains unclear this is attributed to a lack of mechanistic understanding of nonlinear flow for shear thinning fluids at a high re regime and thereby puts a question mark on when the modified darcy s law e g the darcy forchheimer equation tosco et al 2013 zami pierre et al 2016 should be used as inertial effects are significant to fill this knowledge gap and identify the onset of inertia driven nonlinear flow for non newtonian fluid flows in porous media this study addresses a set of questions how and why does nonlinear flow occur for non newtonian fluids with increasing inertial effects how do fluid rheology and inter pore geometries affect critical re re c for identifying the transition from rheology to inertia dominated flow regimes can we predict re c based on the measurable properties i e fluid rheology and pore shape property we address the above mentioned questions through direct numerical simulations by solving the navier stokes equations nse in a variety of idealized diverging converging pore geometries this treatment avoids the flow complexity induced by heterogeneous pore network as further discussed below 2 methods 2 1 governing equation for non newtonian fluids flow the flow of incompressible power law fluids through porous media is essentially governed by the nse 1 ρ u u p μ 2 u 2 u 0 where ρ is fluid density 1000 kg m3 p is total pressure p indicates pressure gradient u is velocity vector and apparent viscosity μ pa s depends on the local shear rate within the flowing domain and thus varies from point to point as we further explained below 2 2 viscosity of power law fluids following previous study zami pierre et al 2016 power law fluids i e shear thinning fluids with cutoff were considered here for mimicking polymer solutions such as xanthan seright et al 2011 where μ pa s scales as a power law against shear rate γ 1 s with a low limit cutoff fig 1 3 μ μ 0 γ c γ 0 n 1 if γ γ c μ 0 γ γ 0 n 1 otherwise where μ 0 1 10 3 pa s is the reference viscosity corresponding to water the low limit of shear rate γ c 0 001 1 s following lavrov 2015 indicates the threshold above which non newtonian effects are dominant γ 0 1 1 s is the reference shear rate the power law exponent n indicates the response of μ to γ with n 1 corresponding to shear thinning fluids n 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 in this study and n 1 was also considered here to represent newtonian fluids and γ is defined as 4 γ 0 5 u u t u u t 2 3 simplified diverging converging pore geometries the fluid was forced to flow through a two dimensional 2d axis symmetric diverging converging pore geometry fig 2 a 2b that mimicked fluid flow through three dimensional 3d pores fig 2c via a 2d modelling method chaudhary et al 2011 following chaudhary et al 2013 we used a variety of idealized diverging converging pore geometries which are characterized by a non dimensional hydraulic shape factor β 5 β s a l v where sa is the total surface area of axis symmetric pores l is the domain length in the x direction and v is the pore volume fig 2c we chose geometries with a broad range of β β 5 5 5 6 7 5 8 5 12 5 16 5 21 5 fig 2a and 2c because β is related to apparent permeability and the growth of recirculation zone rz i e rotating eddies induced by inertial effects within intra pores chaudhary et al 2013 2 4 implementation of simulating power law fluids flow we implemented periodic boundary condition across the inlet outlet using pressure gradient p to simulate flow in x direction fig 2b the periodic boundary implements a standard periodicity so that u x 0 u x 1 where subscripts 0 and 1 denote inlet and outlet boundaries respectively this means that the flows across two opposite planes across an inlet or outlet boundary are identical shahidul huqe muzemder and singh 2021 all other boundaries were set as a no slip boundary except that the bottom was a symmetric boundary fig 2b a triangular element mesh was used with refined meshes around all boundaries with mesh size ranging from 1 μm to 3 μm fig 3 b the total element number increased from 2 5 104 to 6 5 104 for β decreasing from 21 5 down to 5 6 respectively with number of elements approaching on the order of 104 numerical results are insensitive to a further mesh refinement which ensure accuracy of zero velocity at the no slip boundaries unlike previous studies that employed openfoam or lattice boltzmann model hauswirth et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 all simulations were implemented via comsol multiphysics a finite element method based software using the pardiso solver with a maximum iteration of 100 and relative tolerance of 1 10 5 to ensure inertial effects were significant that could result in a fully developed recirculation zone fig 3a and 4 p was incrementally increased to cover a broad range of γ and thus μ fig 1 where each run used previous simulation s results as an initial guess to avoid converging issue when inertial effects were significant each run took about a few minutes with computational time generally increasing with p the numerical integral of local velocity at the outlet yielded fluid flux q 2 5 calculation of bulk viscosity and critical reynolds number following previous studies hauswirth et al 2020 tosco et al 2013 the resultant p q curves were used to estimate bulk viscosity μbk and re 6 μ bk k p q 7 re ρ u l s μ bk ρ q μ bk where k is darcian permeability that was estimated when p was tiny u is the mean flow velocity ls is the characteristic length that was set as the radius of the pore throat fig 2b and q is fluid discharge at the outlet this treatment of computing μbk and re added value in analyzing numerical results of non newtonian fluid flows because the main flow path controls the flow transition morais et al 2009 zami pierre et al 2016 to analyze the evolution of μbk with increasing p and re μbk was further normalized 8 μ μ bk μ b k 0 k p q k p 0 q 0 p q 0 p 0 q where μ is dimensionless bulk viscosity subscript 0 indicates the values corresponding to the miniscule i e initial pressure gradient p 0 since μ scales as a power law with shear rate and thus re with a low cutoff we expected that non newtonian effects on μ were initially negligible i e μ remains constant with increasing re and then reflected as a straight line with a slope depending on n when plotting μ re at a log log scale this was demonstrated in tosco et al 2013 and in fig 4 the deviation from this line with a further increase in re was attributed to inertial effects that led to the growth of rz figs 4 and 5 the automatic quantification of rz s volume and location was done via a matlab algorithm and the detailed method and associated matlab code can be found in a recent study zhou et al 2019 the re c was defined in a manner such that there was an obvious deviation from the linear fitting line in terms of log10 μ i e the deviation was quantified when the fitting error e fitting value log10 μ log10μ 1 as demonstrated in figs 4 and 6 where the linear fitting line was determined using the least square method a broad range of fluid rheology and pore geometries i e defined by parameters n and β was considered to examine the nonlinear flow characteristics and to determine re c we conducted a total of 6 n 7 β 100 computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations where 100 corresponded to one hundred increments in the pressure gradient that varied for a given combination of n and β the numerically derived p q curves were then used to estimate re c as described above consequently 6 7 re c can be determined and correlated to n and β where newtonian fluid was also considered and analyzed since n 1 was included 3 results and discussion on nonlinear flow for power law fluids 3 1 nonlinear flow regimes and characteristics the nonlinear flow behavior of power law fluids is attributed to non newtonian effects and inertial effects rodríguez de castro and radilla 2016 2017a these effects dominate at different re ranges fig 4 which are discussed in details below based on power law fluids flow through heterogeneous 3d porous media zami pierre et al 2016 proposed that over the course of the transition from the linear to early nonlinear flow regime the flow field is geometry dependent consistent with this argument we found that the velocity field and flow behavior was controlled by pore geometry for the case demonstrated in fig 4 with β 16 and n 0 7 where the flat line indicated the linear flow regime holds when re 3 10 5 i e fluids were newtonian where non newtonian effects were trivial since μ approached its lower limit fig 1 as re further increased re 3 10 5 non newtonian effects were non negligible that led to a straight line with a given slope at the log log scale in terms of μ re curves fig 6 signifying that μ scales as a power law function of re this suggests that the nonlinear flow regime is essentially driven by the non newtonian effects with a power law relationship between μ and γ where μ and γ are reflected by μ and re respectively this tilted line additionally suggests that inertial effects are much smaller than non newtonian effects thus we propose that the flow regime is rheology dominated within the re range 3 10 5 re 30 where the tilted line holds fig 4 above re c re c 30 the nonlinear flow behavior was further complicated by inertial effects in addition to non newtonian effects that eventually resulted in an obvious nonlinear μ re curve at the log log scale therefore we propose that the flow regime is inertia dominated when re surpasses re c since inertial forces start to play a critical role in changing μ and the growth of rz figs 4 5 note that the transition in flow regimes i e transitioning from linear flow to rheology dominated and inertial dominated nonlinear flow in fig 4 is presentative for all the cases studied here with a wide range of n and β 3 2 growth of recirculation zone results in inertia driven nonlinear flow the increasing inertial effects with re are visually demonstrated by the development and growth of rz within diverging converging pores chaudhary et al 2011 and rough fractures wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 inertial effects and the growth of rz are intrinsically connected by increasing velocity and re figs 4 5 it suggests that rz might be present as the viscous moffatt eddy cardenas et al 2009 even though re is small however rz will grow due to enlarging inertial effects the growth of rz shrinks the main flow channel and consequently reduces k chaudhary et al 2011 all aforementioned studies focused on inertial effects for newtonian fluids for power law fluids consistent with previous study xie and balhoff 2021 inertial effects are also represented by the growth of rz figs 4 and 5 where non newtonian effects also increase with re as inertial effects do unlike newtonian fluids non newtonian effects might compete with inertial effects and thus delay the deviation from the linear μ re line at the log log scale fig 4 when inertial effects dominate over non newtonian effects with increasing re i e re re c yet sustaining a certain rz volume the μ re curve obviously deviates from the tilted line in the log log space fig 4 3 3 effects of hydraulic shape factor and fluid rheology on re c the shape of pore geometry modulates the flow field and thus affects the growth of rz chaudhary et al 2013 where rz is directly related to nonlinear flow behavior as discussed above in this study the idealized diverging converging pore geometry with varying β ranging from 5 5 to 21 5 serves as a prototype to understand how geological heterogeneity impacts non newtonian fluid flows consistent with previous study chaudhary et al 2013 pore geometries with small β values provide more room for the potential growth of rz than those with large β values with increasing re fig 5 this is partly because it is more likely to have viscous moffatt eddies for large β cases than that for small β cases when re is small fig 5 and viscous moffatt eddies do not contribute to the nonlinear flow behavior cardenas et al 2009 consequently the degree of nonlinear flow caused by inertial effects is larger for small β cases than that for large β cases this further implies that re c increases with β fig 6a for a given power law fluid because small β cases need relatively less inertial forces to result in inertia driven nonlinear flow than large β cases fluid rheology n is directly connected to the growth of rz and thus nonlinear flow for both non newtonian n 1 and newtonian n 1 fluids with a further increase in re μ decreases more quickly for power law fluids with a small n than that with a large n fig 1 this results in the slope of μ re curves decreases with n fig 6b leading to the decrease of re c with n fig 7 b unlike previous study zhang et al 2019 that found re c only depends on pore geometry for fractures our study reveals that re c is a function of pore geometry i e hydraulic shape factor and fluid rheology the difference is not surprising due to following three aspects 1 the definitions of viscosity in re are different where zhang et al 2019 used porous media viscosity such that non newtonian and inertial effects could be potentially separated in contrast we used bulk or equivalent viscosity eqn 6 following hauswirth et al 2020 because non newtonian and inertial effects are intertwined and coupled as we discussed above 2 the pore scale geometries are very different between fractures and matrix pores in terms of pore body to throat aspect ratio 3 the slight difference in fluid rheology for charactering shear thinning fluids 3 4 predictive function for re c and its implications for 6 7 cfd simulation scenarios with a given n and β the increasing p yielded enlarged inertial effects and thus the growth of rz figs 4 5 the resultant μ re curves based on numerically derived p q was used to estimate re c based on the simplified diverging and converging pore geometries with a broad range of n and β figs 1 2 we found that re c is below 100 fig 7 the total 6 7 re c values were further correlated with n and β fig 7a and 7b to accurately predict re c considering a fact that re c increases with β but decreases with n fig 6a 6b and 7b the best fitting function was determined via a polynomial function in matlab 9 log 10 re c a b log 10 β c n where the fitting coefficients with 95 confidence bounds are a 0 41 0 24 0 59 b 1 46 1 34 1 59 and c 1 26 1 42 1 11 moreover the root mean square error in estimating re c is 4 91 suggesting a fairly good performance of fitting function in matching numerically derived re c besides equation 9 demonstrates that re c scales with β to the power of 1 46 while it decreases exponentially with n fig 7 the established function between re c and a broad range of β n is useful to predict re c based on the measurable properties i e β and n with the knowledge of re c one can safely model power law fluid flows and relevant pressure distribution using the modified darcy s law morais et al 2009 zami pierre et al 2016 as long as re is below re c for cases with non negligible inertial effects when re re c one might consider forchheimer s law or ergun s equation to accurately describe fluid flow in porous media rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017b 3 5 limitations and potential applications to heterogeneous pore network fluid rheological properties for non newtonian fluids are diverse in nature and the power law is one of rheological models that was used here to investigate the coupling effects of non newtonian and inertia on the flow process we also did not consider shear thickening fluids which are beyond the scope of this study that provides the foundation for future investigations while this study is one of the first attempts to predict the onset of inertia driven nonlinear flow caused by the growth of rz for non newtonian fluids at the mechanistic level the numerical simulations were implemented in idealized diverging converging pores following previous study chaudhary et al 2013 rather than in natural heterogeneous porous medium it is worth noting that the idealized pore geometries studied here not only serve as prototypes of porous medium to unravel the pore scale fluid flow characteristics but also bear significance for fundamentally understanding the flow process occurring at the continuum scale chaudhary et al 2013 where the porous medium can be treated as hydraulically connected diverging converging pores raoof and hassanizadeh 2013 given a fact that the complex pore geometries or pore networks including the pore size distribution and pore morphology characterization are not straightforward rodríguez de castro and radilla 2017b zami pierre et al 2016 but they can be possibly made by the state of art high resolution imaging techniques bijeljic et al 2004 varloteaux et al 2013 in any case to validate the applicability of predictive function developed based on idealized pores to complex pore network we further simulated shear thinning fluids flow with n 0 7 through heterogeneous pore network domain size 640 μm 320 μm with increasing pressures fig 8 where the pore network was imaged by the previous work sirivithayapakorn and keller 2003 and was also used as a showcase in comsol multiphysics the inlet and outlet boundaries were set as prescribed pressure boundary condition whereas the rest were no flux boundaries fig 8a the exemplified pressure and velocity distributions were shown in fig 8a 8b the numerically derived μ re curve was used to estimate re c as demonstrated above fig 8b not surprisingly the estimated re c 12 1 fig 8b for heterogeneous pore network which is within the predictive re c range 4 2 re c 28 7 according to the equation 9 when n 0 7 fig 7 therefore the knowledge learned here can be effectively considered in the large scale models i e pore network models balhoff et al 2008 lopez et al 2003 perrin et al 2006 by properly describing microscopic non newtonian fluid flows in diverse diverging converging pores which can eventually represent the macroscopic characteristics of non newtonian fluid flow through complex heterogeneous porous medium 4 conclusions understanding and predicting nonlinear flow for shear thinning fluids is of importance for many geophysical and hydrological problems the onset of nonlinear flow due to significant inertial effects can be used to inform large scale models in terms of appropriately applying the modified darcy s law or extensional nonlinear laws e g forchheimer s law however we know little about the onset of nonlinear flow caused by inertial effects for non newtonian fluids to fill this knowledge gap we determine the critical reynolds number re c for identifying the onset of inertia driven nonlinear flow by simulating power law fluids with a wide range of fluid rheology n through a variety of idealized diverging converging pore geometries characterized by a non dimensional hydraulic shape factor β moreover we propose that the nonlinear flow regime is sequentially dominated by fluid rheology and inertial effects with increasing re which is evident based on the growth of recirculation zones finally the newly established relationship between re c and β n allows for the prediction of re c based on measurable properties β n which was further validated by simulating shear shinning fluid flow through heterogeneous pore network credit authorship contribution statement lizhi zheng

4332,the yangtze river and the huang river are the two largest rivers in china annual runoff ratios runoff precipitation denoted as rr of the head regions of these two basins hyr and hhr respectively have significantly decreased over the past several decades closely related to changes in water storage capacity wsc and terrestrial water storage tws however such effects have rarely been quantified due to limitations associated with complicated arctic hydrological processes and the absence of long term reliable tws data in this study a tws reconstruction dataset twsrec was validated and demonstrated good performance in capturing tws variations derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and in the terrestrial water budget for these two head regions long term 1980 2015 changes in tws and wsc were then detected and their effects on rr were quantified through trend detection change point analysis and path analysis results showed that tws increased significantly with a rate of 27 6 mm 10 yr and 19 8 mm 10 yr at hyr and hhr respectively these increases were mainly caused by wetting increases in precipitation or soil moisture increases from the tws component perspective wsc represented as the ratio of tws to precipitation gradually enlarged in response to continuous climate warming rr decreased significantly with rates of 2 0 10 yr at hyr and 3 6 10 yr at hhr attributed to the increased evaporation ratio 80 and increased wsc 20 in both head regions further analysis suggested that permafrost degradation under climate warming could increase wsc these results demonstrate that climate change has resulted in unstable terrestrial water storage at hyr and hhr and that increases in wsc due to permafrost degradation play an important role in accurately simulating runoff in the tibetan plateau and other permafrost degradation regions keywords permafrost degradation regions runoff ratio change long term changes of terrestrial water storage water storage capacity path analysis grace 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws is the sum of water stored on and below the land surface and includes glacier ice snow water equivalent surface water in lakes and rivers soil moisture groundwater and water contained in biomass rodell and famiglietti 1999 deng et al 2020 it is a fundamental component of the terrestrial hydrological cycle and change in tws can significantly affect catchment runoff and evaporation güntner 2008 syed et al 2009 over a long period of time e g decades change in tws is usually assumed to be zero or negligible choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 based on this assumption the budyko framework has been widely applied to quantify the impacts of human interference lei et al 2018 vegetation greening troch et al 2013 ning et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 and snow ratio decrease zhang et al 2015 on annual streamflow or on regional water budgets however this assumption is facing challenges in some places where a significant trend signal in tws caused by human interference or climate change has been detected for example tws in the hai river basin of china and in the indian brahmaputra basin has experienced a dramatic decrease due to groundwater over use mo et al 2016 scanlon et al 2018 noticeable increases and decreases in tws have been found in the northern and southern tibetan plateau tp respectively under long term climate change wang et al 2020 detecting and quantifying such change in tws on the local hydrological cycle is of critical importance for hydrological model simulation and water resource management e g development of renewable energy kuriqi et al 2020 kuriqi et al 2021 xu et al 2021 especially in tp as asian water tower immerzeel et al 2010 whose water resources feed over a billion people in the downstream region the yangtze river and the huang river are the two largest rivers in china their head regions hyr and hhr respectively are located in the east central region of tp over the past decade i e 2003 2014 tws from the data of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace increased linearly in both hyr and hhr meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020 expanded the time series of tws variation in tp over the period of 1992 2015 by developing an empirical formula between tws summed from multiple tws components e g soil moisture from a 1992 2015 data source and tws derived from grace data for 2003 2015 they argued that tws in these two head regions increased continuously during 1992 2015 a result that was possibly caused by increases in soil moisture and lake storage cuo et al 2015 suggested that such an increase in soil moisture possibly started in 1962 and ran to 2009 based on observed data and hydrological simulations using the variable infiltration capacity vic model zhang et al 2017 extracted lake area changes from satellite based land surface observations i e landsat program data and claimed that there were new lakes and extensive lake expansion in these two head regions during the last four decades these studies suggested an increase in tws for these two head regions during the past few decades however the impacts of such tws increases on local hydrological processes have seldom been considered and quantified previous studies have also reported that changes in annual runoff and precipitation at hyr and hhr were inconsistent over the past several decades du et al 2017 feng et al 2017 wang et al 2018a significant increases in annual precipitation were detected from both meteorological stations and remote sensing records but annual runoff changed only slightly and even decreased at hhr resulting in a decrease in runoff ratio rr i e annual runoff precipitation in both basins regarding this issue meng et al 2016 argued that decreased streamflow after 2000 at hhr was nearly all a result of increased evaporation based on the vic model han et al 2019 demonstrated the effects of snow and glacier meltwater changes on runoff variation at hyr via the coupled routing and excess storage crest model by using a budyko framework climate warming yang et al 2011 cheng et al 2017b frozen soil degradation wang et al 2018a and vegetation greening feng et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 were also regarded as having critical roles in decreasing streamflow in these two head regions results from these studies have improved our knowledge of runoff decrease in these two head regions however few of these studies have considered the impacts of change in tws also studies based on the budyko framework assumed change in tws was negligible which were contradictory to the reports of increasing tws mentioned above in fact some studies regarding permafrost have indicated that permafrost degradation under climate warming has increased the water storage capacity wsc and increased tws played an important or even dominant role in streamflow decrease in the north tp including the hyr and hhr niu et al 2016 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b shi et al 2020 exploring changes in wsc will likely enhance our understanding of rr changes and improve hydrological simulations in the tp where wide permafrost degradation has been reported cheng and jin 2013 ran et al 2020 however increased wsc and its impact on streamflow decreases are still rarely detected and quantified and are limited by complex hydrological processes and modeling in arctic regions walvoord and kurylyk 2016 li et al 2019a gao et al 2021 grace can provide regional to continental scale observations of tws anomalies after april 2002 wahr et al 2006 prior to the grace satellite mission detecting change in tws and quantifying its impacts were accompanied with great uncertainties grace data has shown promising performance in detecting seasonal and inter annual variations in water storage changes compared with in situ hydrological observations such as groundwater and soil moisture observations strassberg et al 2007 cao et al 2019 and calibrated by water balance in 23 worldwide large river basins syed et al 2008 unfortunately the time series of currently available grace data is considered relatively short 15 yr for performing a contribution analysis of rr changes as such studies typically require long term observations e g 30 yr to obtain statistically meaningful conclusions brutsaert 2010 many efforts have been made to estimate longer term change in tws or to retrieve grace data generally there are three approaches for this purpose including summation of the major components of tws water balance and numerical modelling summing the major components is the most direct way and can be well applied in data rich areas such as in illinois usa cao et al 2019 but in ungauged areas hyr and hhr for example the major components e g lake water mass groundwater storage and glacier stored water are difficult to be obtained for estimating change in tws water balance approaches include terrestrial and atmospheric water balance twb and awb respectively change in tws in twb is determined by the difference between precipitation and summation of evaporation and runoff given traditional evaporation monitoring is generally restricted to point scale li et al 2014 cheng et al 2016 li et al 2019 for larger scales over thousands of square kilometers change in tws can be estimated through the combined twb and awb method by determining the difference between atmospheric vapor changes and runoff hirschi et al 2006 mueller et al 2011 numerical modelling such as with a land surface model scanlon et al 2018 and a statistical model humphrey et al 2017 is another approach for reliable tws change estimation in some regions humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 reconstructed past tws twsrec data from grace and meteorological datasets by using a statistical model this twsrec data performed better than products of previous hydrological models compared with grace observations and other independent datasets such as a water balance of 341 large scale basins and sea level humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 this method thus possibly provides an opportunity for investigating long term change in tws but is still required to validate the performance of this twsrec data at hyr and hhr in summary inconsistent changes between annual runoff and precipitation have previously been reported at hyr and hhr and were possibly closely related to changes in wsc and tws however such effects have rarely been quantified due to complicated hydrological modelling and the lack of long term reliable tws based on a recently developed high quality tws reconstruction dataset this study investigated long term changes in tws and wsc the main objectives of this study were to 1 validate the performance of the twsrec data at hyr and hhr 2 detect long term changes in tws and wsc 3 quantify the effects of wsc change on rr changes and 4 determine the possible mechanisms of change in tws and rr 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area in this study the head regions of the yangtze river hyr and the huang river hhr refer to the upstream basins above the zhimada and tangnaihai hydrological stations respectively fig 1 hyr covers 14 2 104 km2 and hhr covers 12 1 104 km2 average elevation of both basins is over 3500 m above sea level climate in this region is characterized as cold plateau mountain climate with intense solar radiation and low air temperature precipitation over this study area is mostly affected by the indian monsoon meng et al 2019 and falls mostly over 80 during the monsoon period may september when humid airflow from the indian ocean brings a substantial quantity of moisture to hyr and hhr during 1980 2015 mean annual precipitation values were 400 mm yr and 525 mm yr annual mean streamflow depths were 97 mm yr and 163 mm yr and runoff ratios were 0 24 and 0 31 at hyr and hhr respectively annual mean air temperatures over this period were 4 9 c at hyr and 2 2 c at hhr hyr has a higher snow ratio and snow amount for about 30 of annual precipitation ding et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 permafrost is distributed widely across the region found in approximately 95 and 40 of the areas of hyr and hhr respectively as

description of this technique is given by humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the data source for this twsrec was derived from a statistical model this model relied on the assumption of basin tws loss as a linear reservoir specifically water output e g runoff and evaporation is proportional to tws and to water storage residence time that also commonly referred to as the storage coefficient and reflects the characteristic timescale of the catchment drainage process brutsaert 2005 beven 2011 coupled with precipitation input basin tws at a certain moment tws t can be thus derived from tws at the previous moment tws t 1 and precipitation p during the period as shown below 1 tws t tws t 1 e 1 k t p where k t is residence time of water storage as a periodic time varying parameter k t is calibrated in each grid by using markov chain monte carlo mcmc to minimize the sum of squares of the residuals ε between constructed tws and grace observations initial tws tws 0 is assumed to be the ratio between the mean rate of water input and the mean rate of water loss the residuals ε include measurement errors from grace statistical model errors and errors introduced by the imperfect climate forcing data for a single grid the results after the above procedures are reliable as this ε is normally distributed but the ε estimated in a multi cell scale basin scale for example is not trivial because ε is spatially and temporally correlated and such covariance of ε can be propagated during the aggregation to overcome this problem a distribution of equally acceptable model parameter k t is generated by using a spatial autoregressive noise model a model that aims at random realizations of adjusted ε and each parameter provides one ensemble member the means of hundreds of ensemble members were used to estimate basin scale tws and had reliable performance over 90 large river basins humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 daily streamflow records for hyr and hhr during 1980 2015 were collected

capture water vapor flux changes at the basin boundary of hyr and hhr moreover datasets of air temperature lake area and soil moisture were used for contribution analysis because of climate warming increases in lake water mass and in soil moisture were considered as the critical factors affecting tws increase during the most recent decade at hyr and hhr phan et al 2012 zhang et al 2014a meng et

is part of both twb and awb et estimated from twb ettwb and from awb etawb have previously been compared for validation and estimating more reliable evaporation marengo 2005 syed et al 2014 builes jaramillo and poveda 2018 li et al 2019 in this study area it was reported that ettwb agreed closely with etatw during the period of 2003 2012 meaning that etatw can be regarded as a baseline for evaluating ettwb li et al 2019 therefore twsrec was not only validated by the grace observation record but its derived evaporation in twb ettwb was compared with etatw for validating performance in the water budget in twb ettwb is expressed as the difference between incoming precipitation flux and outgoing runoff flux and change in tws i e 2 et twb p r δ s δ t 3 δ s δ t tws t tws t 1 where r is basin runoff δ s δ t is change in tws calculated by the difference between two successive tws values i e tws t and tws t 1 from twsrec data the time interval δ t is one month in awb etatw as incoming flux of atmospheric water vapor can be derived from the sum of precipitation and water vapor loss 4 et awb p d i v q δ w δ t 5 δ w δ t w t w t 1 where divq is the horizontal divergence of the vapor flux positive divq represents a divergent source where water vapor flows out while negative divq refers to a convergent source δ w δ t is the change in the column storage of water vapor estimated between two successive total column water vapor values i e w t and w t 1 both divq and w were aggregated vertically over a number of pressure levels from the top of the atmosphere to the land surface 3 2 trend detection and change point analysis possible trend signal and single change point of variables were detected by using the mann kendell sen s test mann 1945 sen 1968 kendall 1975 and pettitt statistic pettitt 1979 respectively a temporal trend appears when the value of a variable increases or decreases significantly over time during a study period a change point stands for statistically significant difference between the average value of a variable before and after a certain time change point the significance level for this study was set to 0 05 in other words statistical significance represents the probability that the null hypothesis no trend signal or change point acceptance is less than 0 05 the mann kendall sen s trend and pettitt change point test have been commonly used in hydro meteorological studies because both of them are nonparametric methods and are less sensitive to outliers and skewed data cheng et al 2017a cheng et al 2017b xu et al 2020 according to trend detection and change point analysis in long term tws change in tws was investigated and its impacts on runoff ratio were quantified from the perspective of variable stationarity change 3 3 path analysis the sensitivity of runoff ratio to change in tws and other possible drivers was estimated using path analysis from the perspective of correlation path analysis is an extension of the regression method that can be used to describe dependencies among a set of variables lleras 2005 compared with common linear regression analysis path analysis can be used to understand the causal structure of variables to quantify the standard contribution of different variables and to partition correlations into direct and indirect effects zhang et al 2014b kormos et al 2016 the path analysis was performed using the package lavaan in r 4 0 5 rosseel 2012 in our structural model fig 2 the ratios of tws to precipitation twsp and evaporation ratio ep are assumed as intermediate factors through which climate forcing indirectly affects runoff ratio rr changes twsp is used to reflect changes in wsc an increasing twsp occurs when the rate of tws increase is greater than precipitation s and more water is stored in the basin rather than flowing out a higher value of ep indicates more water being consumed by evaporation temperature temp and precipitation p as main climate forcing parameters are exogenous variables that are not affected by other variables rr was set as an endogenous variable affected by the exogenous variables causal links between the exogenous and endogenous variables as shown in fig 2 are referred to as paths path directions as indicated by the single head arrows point from the exogenous variable to the endogenous variable in particular the double head arrow between temp and p represents a correlation but not a causal relationship the path with only one edge such as the effect of p on twsp stands for a direct effect while those paths over one edge such as the paths from temp to rr are representative of indirect effects the effect e tot of an exogenous variable on an endogenous variable is equal to the summation of the direct effect e dir and all of the indirect effects e ind p on the path between them 6 e tot e dir p 1 n e ind p e dir p 1 n e 1 nv 1 e ind e where n is the number of paths from exogenous variable to endogenous variable except the direct one e ind p is the effect of the p th indirect path calculated by the product of a sequence of all the edges on this path nv is the number of variables and e ind e is the effect of e th edge on the p th path for example the total effect of temp on twsp in fig 2 is equal to the summation of the direct effect temp twsp and the indirect effect temp ep twsp the latter of which is equal to the product by temp ep and ep twsp 3 4 evaluation indexes three evaluation indexes were used in this study they are correlation coefficient r normalized root mean square error nrmse moriasi et al 2007 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 calculated as 7 r t 1 n x t e x t e x t b x t b t 1 n x t e x t e 2 t 1 n x t b x t b 2 8 nse 1 t 1 n x t e x t b 2 t 1 n x t b x t b 2 9 nrmse rmse σ b t 1 n x t e x t b 2 t 1 n x t b x t b 2 where x t e represents the variable to be evaluated x t b is the corresponding baseline variable overbar x t e and x t b means average value σ b is standard deviation of baseline variable and n is data length correlation coefficient r reflects timing consistency between a variable and its baseline nash sutcliffe efficiency nse ranges from to 1 and has been widely used to assess the goodness of fit for hydrological and statistical models a nse value of 1 indicates a perfect match between a variable and its baseline normalized root mean square error nrmse incorporate the benefits of root mean square error rmse that can describe bias between a variable and its baseline and includes a normalization factor σ b so that it is not sensitive to the order of data magnitude nrmse varies from the optimal value of 0 to a large positive value and a value less than 0 5 means very good performance moriasi et al 2007 4 results 4 1 validation of twsrec fig 3 shows comparisons of twsrec and ettwb with their baselines in fig 3a and b twsrec values were compared with the grace observation record twsobs during 2003 2014 twsrec well captured the magnitude and variation of twsobs with r greater than 0 92 nse greater than 0 84 and nrmse less than 0 40 in both study basins in addition trend analysis using the mann kendell test indicated an increasing trend in twsrec with a rate of 0 45 mm month at hyr and 0 41 mm month at hhr these values are comparable to twsobs changes of 0 49 mm month and 0 46 mm month at hyr and hhr respectively to assess the performance of twsrec in the terrestrial water budget monthly variations of ettwb estimated from twsrec in twb were compared with etawb from april 2000 to december 2015 fig 3c and d although etawb generally fluctuated more than ettwb the three evaluation indices indicated good agreement between them in both basins with r greater than 0 95 nse greater than 0 89 and nrmse less than 0 32 the annual mean ettwb values were 351 mm at hyr and 412 mm at hhr and these values were very close to the annual mean etawb values of 358 mm and 431 mm respectively the high level of consistency between ettwb and etawb indicated the good performance of twsrec in the terrestrial water budget in the study area the above evaluation of twsrec and ettwb demonstrated that reconstructed tws was able to simulate the tws changes and provide reliable values of the terrestrial water budget in the following sections twsrec was thus used to reflect variation in tws and to estimate the annual evaporation at hyr and hhr during 1980 2015 4 2 changes in rr and tws fig 4 shows annual variations of rr ep and the ratio of annual change in tws to precipitation sp from 1980 to 2015 there were similar patterns of rr changes in both study basins where rr clearly decreased over the first 15 years then increased around 2010 and finally declined during the last period during the entire period statistically significant p 0 05 negative trends were detected in rr with a rate of 2 0 10 yr at hyr and 3 6 10 yr at hhr expectedly trend analysis for ep indicated that evaporation ratio increased over time however the increase of ep 1 6 10 yr at hyr and 3 1 10 yr at hhr failed to cover the decrease of rr suggesting that sp possibly affected rr changes although there were slight increasing trends for sp at both hyr and hhr with ratios of 0 3 10 yr and 0 6 10 yr respectively fig 5 shows the variations of tws and twsp at an annual scale from 1980 to 2015 in both of the study basins annual tws experienced significantly p 0 05 positive trends with rates of 27 6 mm 10 yr at hyr fig 5a and 19 8 mm 10 yr at hhr fig 5b by using the pettitt test statistically significant p 0 05 change points were detected at 2002 for hyr and at 2004 for hhr at hyr the mean value of tws was 8 9 mm before 2002 and 68 9 mm after that year at hhr those values were 21 4 mm and 25 5 mm before and after 2004 respectively this result demonstrated that tws had dramatically increased during 1980 2015 in the study area moreover there were significant upward trends in twsp with rates of 6 2 10 yr at hyr fig 5c and 3 6 10 yr at hhr fig 5d indicating that more water would be stored rather than flowing out if there were the same precipitation and an enlarged wsc 4 3 quantifying and attributing the impacts of tws on rr attribution of increasing tws on rr decrease was quantified from the perspective of change point analysis and correlation analysis the mean values of rr ep and sp before and after change points are shown in table 2 at hyr sp increased 0 80 from 0 38 to 0 42 before and after 2002 thereby explaining 40 4 of rr changes 1 99 from 25 41 to 23 42 at hhr sp increased 0 81 from 0 38 to 0 43 before and after 2004 resulting in 19 0 decrease of rr 4 27 from 32 61 to 28 34 ep grew 1 08 at hyr and 3 46 at hhr before and after change points contributing 59 6 and 81 of the changes in rr at the two study basins respectively correlation analysis for attribution fig 6 was conducted based on the path model built in section 3 3 at both hyr and hhr the path model passed the statistical t test at the 0 01 level presenting statistical significance for the model output more detailed results are presented in table 3 we found that two of the three endogenous variables rr and twsp showed good performance in regression for both study basins correlation coefficients r were both over 0 73 for rr and about 0 80 for twsp regressions of ep had a lower r but the values for both basins were over 0 53 all of the regressions for the three endogenous variables had statistical significance at the level of 0 05 these results suggest that the path model used in this study was acceptable for analyzing the impacts of different variables on rr decrease effects of different variables in fig 6 or table 3 are standard output of the path model that permits the quantification and comparison of contributions of different variables causing rr decrease this analysis indicates that both ep and twsp produced negative effects on rr change among them increasing ep played a major role in rr decrease explaining about 80 in both study basins while the effects of twsp should not be ignored it contributed 24 and 20 for rr decrease in hyr and hhr respectively 5 discussion 5 1 mechanisms of rr decrease in the study area the simple path model constructed in this study was used to quantify the impacts of climate forcing ep and wsc on rr decrease among these driving factor the climate forcing precipitation and temperature were assumed to be the fundamental driving factors a possible shortcoming of this subjective assumption is that other important factors are likely ignored for example snow ratio the proportion of precipitation falling as snow tends to decrease under climate warming and such switch can reduce annual runoff berghuijs et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 similarly wang et al 2018a quantified the impacts of permafrost degradation by using the air freezing index ddf a proxy that can well reflect observational variation of maximum active layer thickness they found that permafrost degradation partly explained the runoff decrease vegetation changes can play a negative role in rr cheng et al 2017a cheng et al 2017b zhang et al 2018 and vegetation greening has indeed been found at hhr by using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi zheng et al 2018 but changes in snow ratio permafrost and vegetation were ultimately not added into the path model this was because their improvements to the path analysis performance were slight r increase was less than 0 08 at both hyr and hhr possibly a result of their close relationship with temperature and precipitation see table s1 in other words their effects on rr largely originated from changes in climate forcing on the other hand more complex complicated path diagrams tend to be used in studies that try to discover more complex relationships and generally result in greater uncertainties sun et al 2013 luo et al 2017 therefore temperature and precipitation both of which explained the majority of the variation of rr over 72 twsp about 80 and ep over 52 were used as the major driving factors the results of the path analysis fig 6 and table 3 provide a basis for determining the possible mechanism of rr decrease in the study area in both basins increasing ep and wsc produced a direct negative effect on rr as mentioned in the section 4 3 evaporation ratio played a dominant role while impacts of increasing capacity of water storage were noticeable this is somewhat similar to the result found at hhr by wang et al 2018a who indicated that increases in evaporation and water storage were the main reasons for annual streamflow decrease although the water storage caused by frozen soil degradation had a larger contribution 33 in their research in hyr shi et al 2020 simulated runoff using a geomorphology based eco hydrological model a model that can estimate changes in frozen ground and indicated that evaporation increase and frozen ground degradation had caused rr decrease they explained the negative effect of frozen ground degradation on rr as the enlarged wsc climate forcing precipitation and temperature produced an indirect effect on rr changes but with opposite directions precipitation increases had totally positive effects on rr changes at both hyr 0 35 and hhr 0 45 and temperature increases had totally negative effects at both hyr 0 39 and hhr 0 66 it seems that the stronger negative effects caused by increasing temperature led to the decrease of rr from a climate perspective most climate models project temperature increases of over 1 5 c by the end of the century in the study area kraaijenbrink et al 2017 resulting in rising concerns regarding water resource shortages in these head regions and downstream 5 2 possible causes for tws increase previous studies have systematically investigated possible mechanisms for the increase in tws at hyr and hhr the majority of these studies have focused on the grace observation period about 15 years beginning in 2002 in this study it was demonstrated that twsrec captured the tws variation in the two study basins thereby providing the opportunity to investigate the causes that might be responsible for the longer term 1980 2015 variation of tws the following investigation focused on the effects of climate forcing and the critical components of tws based on the previous studies precipitation and temperature largely represent water supply and available energy that drive regional hydrological processes rouholahnejad freund and kirchner 2017 there have been a number of studies illustrating the dominant effects of precipitation on tws variation at hyr and hhr for example meng et al 2019 found that positive trends of precipitation estimated from both meteorological stations and a gridded record could well cover tws trends at both hyr and hhr during 2003 2015 the expanded time series of annual tws during the period of 1992 2014 simulated by the summation of tws components had the highest correlation coefficient with precipitation compared with other forcing factors in the north tp where the study area was located wang et al 2020 fig 7 shows annual precipitation in the study area during 1980 2015 precipitation experienced a significant increase over time with a ratio of 48 mm 10 yr at hyr and of 28 mm 10 yr at hhr the increase in precipitation agreed with the positive tws signals with significant r over 0 7 in both basins indicating a dominant role of precipitation on tws variation dramatic temperature increases have been detected at hyr and hhr with ratios of 0 60 c 10 yr and of 0 68 c 10 yr respectively especially during the period from 1990 s to 2000 s fig 7 significant climate warming has been considered an important driving factor of tws variation but both negative and positive effects have been reported in previous research negatively rising temperatures can enhance basin evaporation to deplete tws li et al 2019 a warmer environment can produce a positive effect on tws in the tp because permafrost degradation has thickened the active layer jin et al 2009 cheng and jin 2013 niu et al 2016 thereby producing greater capacity to store water xu et al 2013 bring et al 2016 wang et al 2018a fig 8 illustrates a strongly negative correlation between twsp and ddf with r of 0 62 at hyr and 0 53 at hhr meaning a greater wsc due to permafrost degradation this was also demonstrated in the hinterland of the tp where widely distributed permafrost degradation was generally consistent with the regions of tws increase xu et al 2018 from the path analysis fig 6 and table 3 it was noticed that the positive and direct path temp twsp contributed 0 67 at hyr and 0 80 at hhr defeating the effects from the negative and indirect path with contributions of 0 21 and 0 41 producing totally positive effects 0 46 and 0 39 on twsp variation tws variation has been divided into several components including lake water mass phan et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 snow water equivalent glaciers and soil moisture xiang et al 2016 meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020 changes in lake water and soil moisture have been considered as having the most important effects on tws trend signals at hyr and hhr lake area and soil moisture were thus compared with long term tws as shown in the fig 9 multi year changes in the main lake area 10 km2 over the basins were assumed as an indicator that referred to the variation in lake water mass due to lack of lake water mass observations and were normalized to compare with tws fig 9a and 9b the results indicated that the normalized lake area la had similar variation with the median of tws with r of 0 73 at hyr while at hhr there were some discrepancies between them with r of 0 48 good agreement between monthly tws and soil moisture sm during 1980 2014 was found at hyr with r of 0 84 fig 9c and at hhr with r of 0 58 fig 9d this closer relation with the finer time scale suggested that changes in soil moisture dominated the variation of tws followed by the lake water changes 5 3 influence of changes in tws and wsc substantial climate change and intensive anthropogenic activities can alter the regional water cycle especially the streamflow process by assuming a stable tws at a multiyear scale the budyko framework has been successfully used to quantify and partitioning the impacts of different factors such as climate warming milly et al 2018 vegetation greening zhang et al 2016 permafrost degradation wang et al 2018a and so on on streamflow around the world including at hyr and hhr in this study the budyko framework indicated that tws had experienced a significant increase during 1980 2015 36 years at hyr and hhr and this increase could play a non negligible role in rr decrease suggesting that it would be careful to assume a stable tws at decade or even less than decade timescales when using the budyko framework in these head regions wsc is one of the key parameters in many hydrological models for both the lumped model e g the xinanjiang model and the distributed model e g the variable infiltration capacity model and is generally set as a constant however a gradually enlarged wsc represented by increases in twsp was found at both hyr and hhr a permafrost degradation region this phenomenon is possibly caused by continuous increases in the active layer thickness that provides greater water storage volume see fig 10 thereby decreasing runoff ratio this suggests the importance of considering such changes in hydrological simulations in permafrost degradation regions such as the tibetan plateau where permafrost has been depleted under climate warming cheng and jin 2013 ran et al 2020 in this study we observed similar patterns at hyr and hhr during 1980 2015 in response to climate change that is the wetter and warming climate strengthened ep and basin wsc resulting in further reduced rr but the contribution of increased wsc on rr at hyr was greater than at hhr calculated by both the change point analysis 40 at hyr and 19 at hhr and path analysis 24 at hyr and 20 at hhr and these results are possibly related to permafrost area there was wider distribution of permafrost at hyr than at hhr and permafrost degradation under climate warming might provide greater water storage volume wang et al 2018a divided hhr into three sub regions with different permafrost areas they found that the contribution of permafrost degradation on streamflow decrease increased along with permafrost area up to 71 in the permafrost dominated region however shi et al 2020 argued a greater effect on runoff decrease in seasonally frozen ground regions than in the permafrost region presumably this result implied a higher contribution at hhr due to higher seasonally frozen ground regions ran et al 2020 in addition more dramatic climate warming could possibly increase the wsc to a greater degree at hhr unfortunately there were only two basins considered in this study and it is difficult determine a more reliable relationship between basin characteristics climate forcing and geomorphological factors and capacity of basin water storage more permafrost developmental basins are required for refining this relationship in the future given that variables in the twb and atb were collected from independent data sources estimated et both ettwb and etawb may have uncertainties which could have an impact on contribution analysis for this issue li et al 2019b systematically discussed the potential uncertainties their results indicated that uncertainties of ettwb and etawb were low and acceptable in both hyr and hhr especially in etawb with uncertainty less than 10 and that uncertainty of precipitation is the main source of uncertainty similarly the same products of total column water vapor and horizontal divergence of vapor flux were selected for estimating etawb differently the cmfd precipitation generated by merging meteorology station and satellite data was used rather than complete interpolation of precipitation from meteorology stations because all the meteorology stations in this study area are located at elevation below 4700 m inspiringly perfect performance of comparison between ettwb and etawb fig 3 stated that cmfd precipitation is reliable for ettwb estimation besides there may be some uncertainties of twsrec application before 2000 when seldom other independent data sources are available for twsrec validation but in general the good performance indicates that twsrec can be applied for possibly investigating long term changes in hydrological processes at hyr and hhr 6 conclusions in this study it was validated that a long term tws reconstruction product was able to capture tws variation and to calculate the terrestrial water budget at hyr and hhr from 1980 to 2015 decades increase in tws and wsc is detected in both catchments the increasing tws was mainly caused by precipitation increase while dramatic increases in temperature had a positive effect on the increase of tws by increasing wsc from the viewpoint of tws components increased tws dominantly contributed to changes of soil moisture followed by extensive lake expansion besides the enlarged wsc was closely related to permafrost degradation and had caused significant decrease in local runoff ratio under the condition of climate warming these results highlight an unstable terrestrial water storage at hyr and hhr that has generally been neglected and demonstrate that an increase in wsc due to climate warming that could critically affect accurate runoff simulation in permafrost degradation regions such as the tibetan plateau credit authorship contribution statement zhicheng xu conceptualization formal analysis methodology writing original

4332,the yangtze river and the huang river are the two largest rivers in china annual runoff ratios runoff precipitation denoted as rr of the head regions of these two basins hyr and hhr respectively have significantly decreased over the past several decades closely related to changes in water storage capacity wsc and terrestrial water storage tws however such effects have rarely been quantified due to limitations associated with complicated arctic hydrological processes and the absence of long term reliable tws data in this study a tws reconstruction dataset twsrec was validated and demonstrated good performance in capturing tws variations derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and in the terrestrial water budget for these two head regions long term 1980 2015 changes in tws and wsc were then detected and their effects on rr were quantified through trend detection change point analysis and path analysis results showed that tws increased significantly with a rate of 27 6 mm 10 yr and 19 8 mm 10 yr at hyr and hhr respectively these increases were mainly caused by wetting increases in precipitation or soil moisture increases from the tws component perspective wsc represented as the ratio of tws to precipitation gradually enlarged in response to continuous climate warming rr decreased significantly with rates of 2 0 10 yr at hyr and 3 6 10 yr at hhr attributed to the increased evaporation ratio 80 and increased wsc 20 in both head regions further analysis suggested that permafrost degradation under climate warming could increase wsc these results demonstrate that climate change has resulted in unstable terrestrial water storage at hyr and hhr and that increases in wsc due to permafrost degradation play an important role in accurately simulating runoff in the tibetan plateau and other permafrost degradation regions keywords permafrost degradation regions runoff ratio change long term changes of terrestrial water storage water storage capacity path analysis grace 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws is the sum of water stored on and below the land surface and includes glacier ice snow water equivalent surface water in lakes and rivers soil moisture groundwater and water contained in biomass rodell and famiglietti 1999 deng et al 2020 it is a fundamental component of the terrestrial hydrological cycle and change in tws can significantly affect catchment runoff and evaporation güntner 2008 syed et al 2009 over a long period of time e g decades change in tws is usually assumed to be zero or negligible choudhury 1999 zhang et al 2001 based on this assumption the budyko framework has been widely applied to quantify the impacts of human interference lei et al 2018 vegetation greening troch et al 2013 ning et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 and snow ratio decrease zhang et al 2015 on annual streamflow or on regional water budgets however this assumption is facing challenges in some places where a significant trend signal in tws caused by human interference or climate change has been detected for example tws in the hai river basin of china and in the indian brahmaputra basin has experienced a dramatic decrease due to groundwater over use mo et al 2016 scanlon et al 2018 noticeable increases and decreases in tws have been found in the northern and southern tibetan plateau tp respectively under long term climate change wang et al 2020 detecting and quantifying such change in tws on the local hydrological cycle is of critical importance for hydrological model simulation and water resource management e g development of renewable energy kuriqi et al 2020 kuriqi et al 2021 xu et al 2021 especially in tp as asian water tower immerzeel et al 2010 whose water resources feed over a billion people in the downstream region the yangtze river and the huang river are the two largest rivers in china their head regions hyr and hhr respectively are located in the east central region of tp over the past decade i e 2003 2014 tws from the data of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace increased linearly in both hyr and hhr meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020 expanded the time series of tws variation in tp over the period of 1992 2015 by developing an empirical formula between tws summed from multiple tws components e g soil moisture from a 1992 2015 data source and tws derived from grace data for 2003 2015 they argued that tws in these two head regions increased continuously during 1992 2015 a result that was possibly caused by increases in soil moisture and lake storage cuo et al 2015 suggested that such an increase in soil moisture possibly started in 1962 and ran to 2009 based on observed data and hydrological simulations using the variable infiltration capacity vic model zhang et al 2017 extracted lake area changes from satellite based land surface observations i e landsat program data and claimed that there were new lakes and extensive lake expansion in these two head regions during the last four decades these studies suggested an increase in tws for these two head regions during the past few decades however the impacts of such tws increases on local hydrological processes have seldom been considered and quantified previous studies have also reported that changes in annual runoff and precipitation at hyr and hhr were inconsistent over the past several decades du et al 2017 feng et al 2017 wang et al 2018a significant increases in annual precipitation were detected from both meteorological stations and remote sensing records but annual runoff changed only slightly and even decreased at hhr resulting in a decrease in runoff ratio rr i e annual runoff precipitation in both basins regarding this issue meng et al 2016 argued that decreased streamflow after 2000 at hhr was nearly all a result of increased evaporation based on the vic model han et al 2019 demonstrated the effects of snow and glacier meltwater changes on runoff variation at hyr via the coupled routing and excess storage crest model by using a budyko framework climate warming yang et al 2011 cheng et al 2017b frozen soil degradation wang et al 2018a and vegetation greening feng et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 were also regarded as having critical roles in decreasing streamflow in these two head regions results from these studies have improved our knowledge of runoff decrease in these two head regions however few of these studies have considered the impacts of change in tws also studies based on the budyko framework assumed change in tws was negligible which were contradictory to the reports of increasing tws mentioned above in fact some studies regarding permafrost have indicated that permafrost degradation under climate warming has increased the water storage capacity wsc and increased tws played an important or even dominant role in streamflow decrease in the north tp including the hyr and hhr niu et al 2016 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b shi et al 2020 exploring changes in wsc will likely enhance our understanding of rr changes and improve hydrological simulations in the tp where wide permafrost degradation has been reported cheng and jin 2013 ran et al 2020 however increased wsc and its impact on streamflow decreases are still rarely detected and quantified and are limited by complex hydrological processes and modeling in arctic regions walvoord and kurylyk 2016 li et al 2019a gao et al 2021 grace can provide regional to continental scale observations of tws anomalies after april 2002 wahr et al 2006 prior to the grace satellite mission detecting change in tws and quantifying its impacts were accompanied with great uncertainties grace data has shown promising performance in detecting seasonal and inter annual variations in water storage changes compared with in situ hydrological observations such as groundwater and soil moisture observations strassberg et al 2007 cao et al 2019 and calibrated by water balance in 23 worldwide large river basins syed et al 2008 unfortunately the time series of currently available grace data is considered relatively short 15 yr for performing a contribution analysis of rr changes as such studies typically require long term observations e g 30 yr to obtain statistically meaningful conclusions brutsaert 2010 many efforts have been made to estimate longer term change in tws or to retrieve grace data generally there are three approaches for this purpose including summation of the major components of tws water balance and numerical modelling summing the major components is the most direct way and can be well applied in data rich areas such as in illinois usa cao et al 2019 but in ungauged areas hyr and hhr for example the major components e g lake water mass groundwater storage and glacier stored water are difficult to be obtained for estimating change in tws water balance approaches include terrestrial and atmospheric water balance twb and awb respectively change in tws in twb is determined by the difference between precipitation and summation of evaporation and runoff given traditional evaporation monitoring is generally restricted to point scale li et al 2014 cheng et al 2016 li et al 2019 for larger scales over thousands of square kilometers change in tws can be estimated through the combined twb and awb method by determining the difference between atmospheric vapor changes and runoff hirschi et al 2006 mueller et al 2011 numerical modelling such as with a land surface model scanlon et al 2018 and a statistical model humphrey et al 2017 is another approach for reliable tws change estimation in some regions humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 reconstructed past tws twsrec data from grace and meteorological datasets by using a statistical model this twsrec data performed better than products of previous hydrological models compared with grace observations and other independent datasets such as a water balance of 341 large scale basins and sea level humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 this method thus possibly provides an opportunity for investigating long term change in tws but is still required to validate the performance of this twsrec data at hyr and hhr in summary inconsistent changes between annual runoff and precipitation have previously been reported at hyr and hhr and were possibly closely related to changes in wsc and tws however such effects have rarely been quantified due to complicated hydrological modelling and the lack of long term reliable tws based on a recently developed high quality tws reconstruction dataset this study investigated long term changes in tws and wsc the main objectives of this study were to 1 validate the performance of the twsrec data at hyr and hhr 2 detect long term changes in tws and wsc 3 quantify the effects of wsc change on rr changes and 4 determine the possible mechanisms of change in tws and rr 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area in this study the head regions of the yangtze river hyr and the huang river hhr refer to the upstream basins above the zhimada and tangnaihai hydrological stations respectively fig 1 hyr covers 14 2 104 km2 and hhr covers 12 1 104 km2 average elevation of both basins is over 3500 m above sea level climate in this region is characterized as cold plateau mountain climate with intense solar radiation and low air temperature precipitation over this study area is mostly affected by the indian monsoon meng et al 2019 and falls mostly over 80 during the monsoon period may september when humid airflow from the indian ocean brings a substantial quantity of moisture to hyr and hhr during 1980 2015 mean annual precipitation values were 400 mm yr and 525 mm yr annual mean streamflow depths were 97 mm yr and 163 mm yr and runoff ratios were 0 24 and 0 31 at hyr and hhr respectively annual mean air temperatures over this period were 4 9 c at hyr and 2 2 c at hhr hyr has a higher snow ratio and snow amount for about 30 of annual precipitation ding et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 permafrost is distributed widely across the region found in approximately 95 and 40 of the areas of hyr and hhr respectively as estimated by a validated and widely used empirical statistical model proposed by wu et al 2000 according to the randolph glacier inventory rgi 6 0 glacier area accounts for about 0 8 of hyr and 0 09 of hhr consortium 2017 2 2 datasets multisource datasets were jointly used in this study and are listed in table 1 grace observation data were used to directly validate the performance of twsrec

interpolated averages of adjacent months ramillien et al 2006 the gridded tws was then aggregated to basin scale as a baseline for twsrec validation long term monthly tws was available from twsrec with a resolution of 0 5 0 5 from 1979 to 2017 https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 7670849 the following is only a short description of the tws reconstruction procedures a thorough and complete description of this technique is given by humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the data source for this twsrec was derived from a statistical model this model relied on the assumption of basin tws loss as a linear reservoir specifically water output e g runoff and evaporation is proportional to tws and to water storage residence time that also commonly referred to as the storage coefficient and reflects the characteristic timescale of the catchment drainage process brutsaert 2005 beven 2011 coupled with precipitation input basin tws at a certain moment tws t can be thus derived from tws at the previous moment tws t 1 and precipitation p during the period as shown below 1 tws t tws t 1 e 1 k t p where k t is residence time of water storage as a periodic time varying parameter k t is calibrated in each grid by using markov chain monte carlo mcmc to minimize the sum of squares of the residuals ε between constructed tws and grace observations initial tws tws 0 is assumed to be the ratio between the mean rate of water input and the mean rate of water loss the residuals ε include measurement errors from grace statistical model errors and errors introduced by the imperfect climate forcing data for a single grid the results after the above procedures are reliable as this ε is normally distributed but the ε estimated in a multi cell scale basin scale for example is not trivial because ε is spatially and temporally correlated and such covariance of ε can be propagated during the aggregation to overcome this problem a distribution of equally acceptable model parameter k t is generated by using a spatial autoregressive noise model a model that aims at random realizations of adjusted ε and each parameter provides one ensemble member the means of hundreds of ensemble members were used to estimate basin scale tws and had reliable performance over 90 large river basins humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 daily streamflow records for hyr and hhr during 1980 2015 were collected from zhimada and tangnaihai hydrological observation stations respectively and then averaged to monthly streamflow depth given that the human interference is small flows in these two catchments are

capture water vapor flux changes at the basin boundary of hyr and hhr moreover datasets of air temperature lake area and soil moisture were used for contribution analysis because of climate warming increases in lake water mass and in soil moisture were considered as the critical factors affecting tws increase during the most recent decade at hyr and hhr phan et al 2012 zhang et al 2014a meng et

is part of both twb and awb et estimated from twb ettwb and from awb etawb have previously been compared for validation and estimating more reliable evaporation marengo 2005 syed et al 2014 builes jaramillo and poveda 2018 li et al 2019 in this study area it was reported that ettwb agreed closely with etatw during the period of 2003 2012 meaning that etatw can be regarded as a baseline for evaluating ettwb li et al 2019 therefore twsrec was not only validated by the grace observation record but its derived evaporation in twb ettwb was compared with etatw for validating performance in the water budget in twb ettwb is expressed as the difference between incoming precipitation flux and outgoing runoff flux and change in tws i e 2 et twb p r δ s δ t 3 δ s δ t tws t tws t 1 where r is basin runoff δ s δ t is change in tws calculated by the difference between two successive tws values i e tws t and tws t 1 from twsrec data the time interval δ t is one month in awb etatw as incoming flux of atmospheric water vapor can be derived from the sum of precipitation and water vapor loss 4 et awb p d i v q δ w δ t 5 δ w δ t w t w t 1 where divq is the horizontal divergence of the vapor flux positive divq represents a divergent source where water vapor flows out while negative divq refers to a convergent source δ w δ t is the change in the column storage of water vapor estimated between two successive total column water vapor values i e w t and w t 1 both divq and w were aggregated vertically over a number of pressure levels from the top of the atmosphere to the land surface 3 2 trend detection and change point analysis possible trend signal and single change point of variables were detected by using the mann kendell sen s test mann 1945 sen 1968 kendall 1975 and pettitt statistic pettitt 1979 respectively a temporal trend appears when the value of a variable increases or decreases significantly over time during a study period a change point stands for statistically significant difference between the average value of a variable before and after a certain time change point the significance level for this study was set to 0 05 in other words statistical significance represents the probability that the null hypothesis no trend signal or change point acceptance is less than 0 05 the mann kendall sen s trend and pettitt change point test have been commonly used in hydro meteorological studies because both of them are nonparametric methods and are less sensitive to outliers and skewed data cheng et al 2017a cheng et al 2017b xu et al 2020 according to trend detection and change point analysis in long term tws change in tws was investigated and its impacts on runoff ratio were quantified from the perspective of variable stationarity change 3 3 path analysis the sensitivity of runoff ratio to change in tws and other possible drivers was estimated using path analysis from the perspective of correlation path analysis is an extension of the regression method that can be used to describe dependencies among a set of variables lleras 2005 compared with common linear regression analysis path analysis can be used to understand the causal structure of variables to quantify the standard contribution of different variables and to partition correlations into direct and indirect effects zhang et al 2014b kormos et al 2016 the path analysis was performed using the package lavaan in r 4 0 5 rosseel 2012 in our structural model fig 2 the ratios of tws to precipitation twsp and evaporation ratio ep are assumed as intermediate factors through which climate forcing indirectly affects runoff ratio rr changes twsp is used to reflect changes in wsc an increasing twsp occurs when the rate of tws increase is greater than precipitation s and more water is stored in the basin rather than flowing out a higher value of ep indicates more water being consumed by evaporation temperature temp and precipitation p as main climate forcing parameters are exogenous variables that are not affected by other variables rr was set as an endogenous variable affected by the exogenous variables causal links between the exogenous and endogenous variables as shown in fig 2 are referred to as paths path directions as indicated by the single head arrows point from the exogenous variable to the endogenous variable in particular the double head arrow between temp and p represents a correlation but not a causal relationship the path with only one edge such as the effect of p on twsp stands for a direct effect while those paths over one edge such as the paths from temp to rr are representative of indirect effects the effect e tot of an exogenous variable on an endogenous variable is equal to the summation of the direct effect e dir and all of the indirect effects e ind p on the path between them 6 e tot e dir p 1 n e ind p e dir p 1 n e 1 nv 1 e ind e where n is the number of paths from exogenous variable to endogenous variable except the direct one e ind p is the effect of the p th indirect path calculated by the product of a sequence of all the edges on this path nv is the number of variables and e ind e is the effect of e th edge on the p th path for example the total effect of temp on twsp in fig 2 is equal to the summation of the direct effect temp twsp and the indirect effect temp ep twsp the latter of which is equal to the product by temp ep and ep twsp 3 4 evaluation indexes three evaluation indexes were used in this study they are correlation coefficient r normalized root mean square error nrmse moriasi et al 2007 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 calculated as 7 r t 1 n x t e x t e x t b x t b t 1 n x t e x t e 2 t 1 n x t b x t b 2 8 nse 1 t 1 n x t e x t b 2 t 1 n x t b x t b 2 9 nrmse rmse σ b t 1 n x t e x t b 2 t 1 n x t b x t b 2 where x t e represents the variable to be evaluated x t b is the corresponding baseline variable overbar x t e and x t b means average value σ b is standard deviation of baseline variable and n is data length correlation coefficient r reflects timing consistency between a variable and its baseline nash sutcliffe efficiency nse ranges from to 1 and has been widely used to assess the goodness of fit for hydrological and statistical models a nse value of 1 indicates a perfect match between a variable and its baseline normalized root mean square error nrmse incorporate the benefits of root mean square error rmse that can describe bias between a variable and its baseline and includes a normalization factor σ b so that it is not sensitive to the order of data magnitude nrmse varies from the optimal value of 0 to a large positive value and a value less than 0 5 means very good performance moriasi et al 2007 4 results 4 1 validation of twsrec fig 3 shows comparisons of twsrec and ettwb with their baselines in fig 3a and b twsrec values were compared with the grace observation record twsobs during 2003 2014 twsrec well captured the magnitude and variation of twsobs with r greater than 0 92 nse greater than 0 84 and nrmse less than 0 40 in both study basins in addition trend analysis using the mann kendell test indicated an increasing trend in twsrec with a rate of 0 45 mm month at hyr and 0 41 mm month at hhr these values are comparable to twsobs changes of 0 49 mm month and 0 46 mm month at hyr and hhr respectively to assess the performance of twsrec in the terrestrial water budget monthly variations of ettwb estimated from twsrec in twb were compared with etawb from april 2000 to december 2015 fig 3c and d although etawb generally fluctuated more than ettwb the three evaluation indices indicated good agreement between them in both basins with r greater than 0 95 nse greater than 0 89 and nrmse less than 0 32 the annual mean ettwb values were 351 mm at hyr and 412 mm at hhr and these values were very close to the annual mean etawb values of 358 mm and 431 mm respectively the high level of consistency between ettwb and etawb indicated the good performance of twsrec in the terrestrial water budget in the study area the above evaluation of twsrec and ettwb demonstrated that reconstructed tws was able to simulate the tws changes and provide reliable values of the terrestrial water budget in the following sections twsrec was thus used to reflect variation in tws and to estimate the annual evaporation at hyr and hhr during 1980 2015 4 2 changes in rr and tws fig 4 shows annual variations of rr ep and the ratio of annual change in tws to precipitation sp from 1980 to 2015 there were similar patterns of rr changes in both study basins where rr clearly decreased over the first 15 years then increased around 2010 and finally declined during the last period during the entire period statistically significant p 0 05 negative trends were detected in rr with a rate of 2 0 10 yr at hyr and 3 6 10 yr at hhr expectedly trend analysis for ep indicated that evaporation ratio increased over time however the increase of ep 1 6 10 yr at hyr and 3 1 10 yr at hhr failed to cover the decrease of rr suggesting that sp possibly affected rr changes although there were slight increasing trends for sp at both hyr and hhr with ratios of 0 3 10 yr and 0 6 10 yr respectively fig 5 shows the variations of tws and twsp at an annual scale from 1980 to 2015 in both of the study basins annual tws experienced significantly p 0 05 positive trends with rates of 27 6 mm 10 yr at hyr fig 5a and 19 8 mm 10 yr at hhr fig 5b by using the pettitt test statistically significant p 0 05 change points were detected at 2002 for hyr and at 2004 for hhr at hyr the mean value of tws was 8 9 mm before 2002 and 68 9 mm after that year at hhr those values were 21 4 mm and 25 5 mm before and after 2004 respectively this result demonstrated that tws had dramatically increased during 1980 2015 in the study area moreover there were significant upward trends in twsp with rates of 6 2 10 yr at hyr fig 5c and 3 6 10 yr at hhr fig 5d indicating that more water would be stored rather than flowing out if there were the same precipitation and an enlarged wsc 4 3 quantifying and attributing the impacts of tws on rr attribution of increasing tws on rr decrease was quantified from the perspective of change point analysis and correlation analysis the mean values of rr ep and sp before and after change points are shown in table 2 at hyr sp increased 0 80 from 0 38 to 0 42 before and after 2002 thereby explaining 40 4 of rr changes 1 99 from 25 41 to 23 42 at hhr sp increased 0 81 from 0 38 to 0 43 before and after 2004 resulting in 19 0 decrease of rr 4 27 from 32 61 to 28 34 ep grew 1 08 at hyr and 3 46 at hhr before and after change points contributing 59 6 and 81 of the changes in rr at the two study basins respectively correlation analysis for attribution fig 6 was conducted based on the path model built in section 3 3 at both hyr and hhr the path model passed the statistical t test at the 0 01 level presenting statistical significance for the model output more detailed results are presented in table 3 we found that two of the three endogenous variables rr and twsp showed good performance in regression for both study basins correlation coefficients r were both over 0 73 for rr and about 0 80 for twsp regressions of ep had a lower r but the values for both basins were over 0 53 all of the regressions for the three endogenous variables had statistical significance at the level of 0 05 these results suggest that the path model used in this study was acceptable for analyzing the impacts of different variables on rr decrease effects of different variables in fig 6 or table 3 are standard output of the path model that permits the quantification and comparison of contributions of different variables causing rr decrease this analysis indicates that both ep and twsp produced negative effects on rr change among them increasing ep played a major role in rr decrease explaining about 80 in both study basins while the effects of twsp should not be ignored it contributed 24 and 20 for rr decrease in hyr and hhr respectively 5 discussion 5 1 mechanisms of rr decrease in the study area the simple path model constructed in this study was used to quantify the impacts of climate forcing ep and wsc on rr decrease among these driving factor the climate forcing precipitation and temperature were assumed to be the fundamental driving factors a possible shortcoming of this subjective assumption is that other important factors are likely ignored for example snow ratio the proportion of precipitation falling as snow tends to decrease under climate warming and such switch can reduce annual runoff berghuijs et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 similarly wang et al 2018a quantified the impacts of permafrost degradation by using the air freezing index ddf a proxy that can well reflect observational variation of maximum active layer thickness they found that permafrost degradation partly explained the runoff decrease vegetation changes can play a negative role in rr cheng et al 2017a cheng et al 2017b zhang et al 2018 and vegetation greening has indeed been found at hhr by using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi zheng et al 2018 but changes in snow ratio permafrost and vegetation were ultimately not added into the path model this was because their improvements to the path analysis performance were slight r increase was less than 0 08 at both hyr and hhr possibly a result of their close relationship with temperature and precipitation see table s1 in other words their effects on rr largely originated from changes in climate forcing on the other hand more complex complicated path diagrams tend to be used in studies that try to discover more complex relationships and generally result in greater uncertainties sun et al 2013 luo et al 2017 therefore temperature and precipitation both of which explained the majority of the variation of rr over 72 twsp about 80 and ep over 52 were used as the major driving factors the results of the path analysis fig 6 and table 3 provide a basis for determining the possible mechanism of rr decrease in the study area in both basins increasing ep and wsc produced a direct negative effect on rr as mentioned in the section 4 3 evaporation ratio played a dominant role while impacts of increasing capacity of water storage were noticeable this is somewhat similar to the result found at hhr by wang et al 2018a who indicated that increases in evaporation and water storage were the main reasons for annual streamflow decrease although the water storage caused by frozen soil degradation had a larger contribution 33 in their research in hyr shi et al 2020 simulated runoff using a geomorphology based eco hydrological model a model that can estimate changes in frozen ground and indicated that evaporation increase and frozen ground degradation had caused rr decrease they explained the negative effect of frozen ground degradation on rr as the enlarged wsc climate forcing precipitation and temperature produced an indirect effect on rr changes but with opposite directions precipitation increases had totally positive effects on rr changes at both hyr 0 35 and hhr 0 45 and temperature increases had totally negative effects at both hyr 0 39 and hhr 0 66 it seems that the stronger negative effects caused by increasing temperature led to the decrease of rr from a climate perspective most climate models project temperature increases of over 1 5 c by the end of the century in the study area kraaijenbrink et al 2017 resulting in rising concerns regarding water resource shortages in these head regions and downstream 5 2 possible causes for tws increase previous studies have systematically investigated possible mechanisms for the increase in tws at hyr and hhr the majority of these studies have focused on the grace observation period about 15 years beginning in 2002 in this study it was demonstrated that twsrec captured the tws variation in the two study basins thereby providing the opportunity to investigate the causes that might be responsible for the longer term 1980 2015 variation of tws the following investigation focused on the effects of climate forcing and the critical components of tws based on the previous studies precipitation and temperature largely represent water supply and available energy that drive regional hydrological processes rouholahnejad freund and kirchner 2017 there have been a number of studies illustrating the dominant effects of precipitation on tws variation at hyr and hhr for example meng et al 2019 found that positive trends of precipitation estimated from both meteorological stations and a gridded record could well cover tws trends at both hyr and hhr during 2003 2015 the expanded time series of annual tws during the period of 1992 2014 simulated by the summation of tws components had the highest correlation coefficient with precipitation compared with other forcing factors in the north tp where the study area was located wang et al 2020 fig 7 shows annual precipitation in the study area during 1980 2015 precipitation experienced a significant increase over time with a ratio of 48 mm 10 yr at hyr and of 28 mm 10 yr at hhr the increase in precipitation agreed with the positive tws signals with significant r over 0 7 in both basins indicating a dominant role of precipitation on tws variation dramatic temperature increases have been detected at hyr and hhr with ratios of 0 60 c 10 yr and of 0 68 c 10 yr respectively especially during the period from 1990 s to 2000 s fig 7 significant climate warming has been considered an important driving factor of tws variation but both negative and positive effects have been reported in previous research negatively rising temperatures can enhance basin evaporation to deplete tws li et al 2019 a warmer environment can produce a positive effect on tws in the tp because permafrost degradation has thickened the active layer jin et al 2009 cheng and jin 2013 niu et al 2016 thereby producing greater capacity to store water xu et al 2013 bring et al 2016 wang et al 2018a fig 8 illustrates a strongly negative correlation between twsp and ddf with r of 0 62 at hyr and 0 53 at hhr meaning a greater wsc due to permafrost degradation this was also demonstrated in the hinterland of the tp where widely distributed permafrost degradation was generally consistent with the regions of tws increase xu et al 2018 from the path analysis fig 6 and table 3 it was noticed that the positive and direct path temp twsp contributed 0 67 at hyr and 0 80 at hhr defeating the effects from the negative and indirect path with contributions of 0 21 and 0 41 producing totally positive effects 0 46 and 0 39 on twsp variation tws variation has been divided into several components including lake water mass phan et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 snow water equivalent glaciers and soil moisture xiang et al 2016 meng et al 2019 wang et al 2020 changes in lake water and soil moisture have been considered as having the most important effects on tws trend signals at hyr and hhr lake area and soil moisture were thus compared with long term tws as shown in the fig 9 multi year changes in the main lake area 10 km2 over the basins were assumed as an indicator that referred to the variation in lake water mass due to lack of lake water mass observations and were normalized to compare with tws fig 9a and 9b the results indicated that the normalized lake area la had similar variation with the median of tws with r of 0 73 at hyr while at hhr there were some discrepancies between them with r of 0 48 good agreement between monthly tws and soil moisture sm during 1980 2014 was found at hyr with r of 0 84 fig 9c and at hhr with r of 0 58 fig 9d this closer relation with the finer time scale suggested that changes in soil moisture dominated the variation of tws followed by the lake water changes 5 3 influence of changes in tws and wsc substantial climate change and intensive anthropogenic activities can alter the regional water cycle especially the streamflow process by assuming a stable tws at a multiyear scale the budyko framework has been successfully used to quantify and partitioning the impacts of different factors such as climate warming milly et al 2018 vegetation greening zhang et al 2016 permafrost degradation wang et al 2018a and so on on streamflow around the world including at hyr and hhr in this study the budyko framework indicated that tws had experienced a significant increase during 1980 2015 36 years at hyr and hhr and this increase could play a non negligible role in rr decrease suggesting that it would be careful to assume a stable tws at decade or even less than decade timescales when using the budyko framework in these head regions wsc is one of the key parameters in many hydrological models for both the lumped model e g the xinanjiang model and the distributed model e g the variable infiltration capacity model and is generally set as a constant however a gradually enlarged wsc represented by increases in twsp was found at both hyr and hhr a permafrost degradation region this phenomenon is possibly caused by continuous increases in the active layer thickness that provides greater water storage volume see fig 10 thereby decreasing runoff ratio this suggests the importance of considering such changes in hydrological simulations in permafrost degradation regions such as the tibetan plateau where permafrost has been depleted under climate warming cheng and jin 2013 ran et al 2020 in this study we observed similar patterns at hyr and hhr during 1980 2015 in response to climate change that is the wetter and warming climate strengthened ep and basin wsc resulting in further reduced rr but the contribution of increased wsc on rr at hyr was greater than at hhr calculated by both the change point analysis 40 at hyr and 19 at hhr and path analysis 24 at hyr and 20 at hhr and these results are possibly related to permafrost area there was wider distribution of permafrost at hyr than at hhr and permafrost degradation under climate warming might provide greater water storage volume wang et al 2018a divided hhr into three sub regions with different permafrost areas they found that the contribution of permafrost degradation on streamflow decrease increased along with permafrost area up to 71 in the permafrost dominated region however shi et al 2020 argued a greater effect on runoff decrease in seasonally frozen ground regions than in the permafrost region presumably this result implied a higher contribution at hhr due to higher seasonally frozen ground regions ran et al 2020 in addition more dramatic climate warming could possibly increase the wsc to a greater degree at hhr unfortunately there were only two basins considered in this study and it is difficult determine a more reliable relationship between basin characteristics climate forcing and geomorphological factors and capacity of basin water storage more permafrost developmental basins are required for refining this relationship in the future given that variables in the twb and atb were collected from independent data sources estimated et both ettwb and etawb may have uncertainties which could have an impact on contribution analysis for this issue li et al 2019b systematically discussed the potential uncertainties their results indicated that uncertainties of ettwb and etawb were low and acceptable in both hyr and hhr especially in etawb with uncertainty less than 10 and that uncertainty of precipitation is the main source of uncertainty similarly the same products of total column water vapor and horizontal divergence of vapor flux were selected for estimating etawb differently the cmfd precipitation generated by merging meteorology station and satellite data was used rather than complete interpolation of precipitation from meteorology stations because all the meteorology stations in this study area are located at elevation below 4700 m inspiringly perfect performance of comparison between ettwb and etawb fig 3 stated that cmfd precipitation is reliable for ettwb estimation besides there may be some uncertainties of twsrec application before 2000 when seldom other independent data sources are available for twsrec validation but in general the good performance indicates that twsrec can be applied for possibly investigating long term changes in hydrological processes at hyr and hhr 6 conclusions in this study it was validated that a long term tws reconstruction product was able to capture tws variation and to calculate the terrestrial water budget at hyr and hhr from 1980 to 2015 decades increase in tws and wsc is detected in both catchments the increasing tws was mainly caused by precipitation increase while dramatic increases in temperature had a positive effect on the increase of tws by increasing wsc from the viewpoint of tws components increased tws dominantly contributed to changes of soil moisture followed by extensive lake expansion besides the enlarged wsc was closely related to permafrost degradation and had caused significant decrease in local runoff ratio under the condition of climate warming these results highlight an unstable terrestrial water storage at hyr and hhr that has generally been neglected and demonstrate that an increase in wsc due to climate warming that could critically affect accurate runoff simulation in permafrost degradation regions such as the tibetan plateau credit authorship contribution statement zhicheng xu conceptualization formal analysis methodology writing original

4333,taditionally watershed scale hydrology is simulated by distributed hydrological models with offline meteorological forcing data or by regional regional climate models that link atmospheric and land hydrology interactions global climate model gcms are rarely used to study watershed scale hydrology due to the relatively coarse grid resolution computationally expensive downscaling and simplified physical processes recently however watershed scale hydrology analysis has become possible in gcms due to the development of variable resolution gcms that dynamically couple the hydrological processes between atmospheric and land systems at fine resolutions in selected regions and coarse resolution elsewhere in this study we used the variable resolution community earth system model vr cesm with refined resolution 14 km in the western u s and eastern china to evaluate smaller watershed scale hydrology we compared the historical vr cesm outputs with gauge measurements and other hydrological models e g national water model in the u s and calibrated the subsurface runoff capacities in four mountainous watersheds an rcp8 5 projection from 2007 to 2050 is used to estimate the impact of changing precipitation and snow climatology on watershed hydrology we also analyzed the long term runoff variability and the possibility of extreme runoff events as simulated by the vr cesm although calibration is not possible in larger scale watersheds vr cesm simulates the long term annual variability of watersheds and provides insights on climate change impacts on hydrology we conclude that refined resolution vr cesm can be used for watershed scale hydrology analysis to understand water resources and water balance in addition to traditional watershed scale hydrological models it enables hydrological analysis at multiple watersheds in one simulation and can help understand the two way dynamics between land surface hydrology and atmospheric processes and is especially practical for projecting climate change impacts however it is challenging to apply vr cesm for hydrologic analysis in regulated watersheds as human factors e g pumping irrigation water diversion have not been fully addressed in vr cesm keywords watersheds runoff climate change global climate model water budget 1 introduction multiple distributed hydrological models have been developed e g parflow maxwell et al 2009 modflow harbaugh 2005 swat arnold et al 2012 with numerous applications at the watershed level these distributed hydrological models solve physically based equations for subsurface and surface flow as well as other hydrological processes over the domain the distributed hydrological models usually require significant efforts to set up with high resolution input datasets particularly for the subsurface geology and soil parameters which may need to come from intensively instrumented regions the heterogeneity of data uncertainties and coverage coming from different data sources across the large scale domain could affect the performance of hydrologic models significantly archfield et al 2015 as a result it is also structurally and computationally challenging to upscale the distributed hydrology models to larger continental or global scales the governing equations and assumptions that are valid at fine scales may not be valid at coarser scales blöschl and sivapalan 1995 while running fine resolution hydrological models over large regions is computationally expensive in addition this method captures only one way interactions from the atmosphere to the land global climate models gcms have been developed to simulate earth system processes and study various climate science questions for example projecting the changing climate e g massoud et al 2019 gettelman et al 2018 rhoades et al 2018 investigating the large scale teleconnection patterns e g gettelman et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 and quantifying the effects of radiation on evapotranspiration et e g lian et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the applications of global climate models to evaluating watershed level hydrology are limited and usually require additional model development downscaling and or postprocessing e g voisin et al 2013 zhou et al 2020 the coupling of atmospheric models and lumped land surface models in gcms generally requires simplified mechanistic hydrological processes and most of these coupling do not include lateral flow most gcm simulations at present are performed at relatively coarse horizontal resolutions 1 due to the tremendous computational cost required to run them at finer resolutions while hydrological processes have been widely investigated and have significant impacts on other earth system processes gcms are seldom applied to study hydrological processes because their coarse resolution inhibits reliable watershed scale analyses although some statistical downscaling methods have been developed and applied these methods still have limitations such as ignoring physical principles or not being able to project novel future conditions maraun and widmann 2018 nyunt et al 2016 velasquez et al 2020 regional climate models rcms are an alternative to statistical downscaling and have been developed to run at resolutions of less than 1 km with the flexibility of multiple nested domains at different resolutions rcms are driven by either coarser resolution gcms or reanalysis climate datasets at the outer domain with the limitations of not simulating large scale global circulation and the introduction of large scale error at the rcm boundary xu et al 2018 ullrich et al 2018 nonetheless simplified hydrologic processes including runoff generation snow accumulation and snowmelt evaporation and transpiration and infiltration are simulated by the land surface models in both gcms and rcms in order to evaluate feedbacks with the atmosphere given these limitations distributed watershed scale models are usually the preferred tools for hydrological analyses over various climate model approaches offline land surface models with meteorological forcing datasets at fine resolution have also been used for hydrological analysis but they have their limitations for example li et al 2011 evaluated the fine resolution clm hydrology outputs with in situ observations from the american river watershed and concluded that the surface and subsurface runoff can appropriately simulate the monthly runoff and water budget with calibration at the watershed scale du et al 2016 evaluated the hydrologic components in the clm4 forced by both reanalysis and coupled model outputs and reported that runoff was generally overestimated and the predictability of hydrology could be improved by addressing the compensating errors associated with precipitation and temperature the uncertainty of this approach is partially determined by the resolution of meteorological forcing datasets and the topography and surface datasets applied in the land surface model with additional limitations associated with coarser resolution parameterizations being applied at finer scales furthermore this approach applies to only one way interactions from the meteorological forcing datasets to the land surface model this means that some important feedbacks of water budgets such as the effects of et on vapor pressure deficit are not simulated and may lead to uncertainties in the watershed scale water budget computation mountainous headwater watersheds are critical to water resources management in the western u s and the above approaches are all challenged by the complexity of this high gradient region the sierra nevada and cascade mountains on the west coast act as natural barriers to the dominant moisture transport pathway coming from the pacific ocean and as such force condensation and store this moisture as mountain snowpack the mountains of the sierra nevada provide 72 additional surface storage for irrigation and municipal use during seasonally dry summers dettinger and anderson 2015 and provide more than 60 of california s water consumption bales et al 2011 similarly the rocky mountain snowpack is a primary source of water for the colorado river basin and inland western u s serreze et al 1999 the hydrological processes in these in forested mountainous watersheds are usually snow dominated and topography driven understanding the interactions among forest structure snow accumulation snowmelt and streamflow generation is therefore an integral component of effective water resources management ahl et al 2008 particularly climate change will challenge current water resource management strategies due to changing resource availability in the western u s mountains hayhoe et al 2004 foster et al 2016 pointed out that in snow dominated mountain regions climate is expected to alter two drivers of hydrology by decreasing the fraction of precipitation falling as snow and also increasing surface energy available to drive et in such complex regions improving the characterization and modeling of hydrological processes is essential to better understand the hydrologic dynamics under a changing climate he et al 2019 garousi nejad et al 2017 daly et al 2017 in this study we demonstrate that refined solution gcms are applicable to perform watershed scale hydrological analysis and alleviate some of the limitations described above this approach is particularly novel and well suited in projecting climate change impacts on hydrological processes and extreme events by using a gcm with regionally refined resolution we leverage the two way interactions between the atmospheric and land surface models while simulating the hydrological processes at a refined resolution in this paper we analyze and evaluate hydrological simulations in four representative unmanaged headwater watersheds in the western u s using the variable resolution community earth system model vr cesm the methods applied in this study are described in section 2 including the climate model experiment section 2 1 the runoff generation schemes and calibration approach section 2 2 a brief introduction of the four watersheds studied in this paper section 2 3 and the reference hydrological models and data section 2 4 the runoff calibration results are evaluated against reference models and data in section 3 1 the application of vr cesm to assessing climate change impacts on mean runoff is presented in section 3 2 and the assessment of changing patterns of extreme hydrological events is presented in section section 3 3 vr cesm simulations are also used to quantify the water budget in larger scale watersheds in the western u s and eastern china where grid resolution is refined at 14 km in the vr cesm section 3 4 2 methods 2 1 variable resolution global climate model the technical details of vr cesm and model evaluation were demonstrated in xu et al 2021 and only briefly introduced here the vr cesm utilizes a variable resolution cubed sphere grid generated by squadgen ullrich 2014 and implemented in the community earth system model with the community atmospheric model version 5 using the spectral element dynamical core cam5 se and the community land model with satellite phenology version 4 0 clm oleson et al 2010 lawrence et al 2011 this study uses the famipc5 f atmospheric model intercomparison project component component set which bounds atmosphere land coupled simulations with observationally derived estimates of sea surface temperature and sea ice and employs well established atmosphere model intercomparison project amip protocols with full atmospheric land coupling and monthly prescribed ocean conditions ackerley et al 2018 the monthly prescribed sea ice and sea surface temperatures sst are derived from a merging of the hadisst1 hadley centre sea ice and sea surface temperature dataset and noaa oi national oceanic and atmospheric administration optimum interpolation sst datasets hurrell et al 2008 the vr cesm land topography is derived from a resolution dependent smoothing of a global 30 arc second elevation us geological survey gtopo30 dataset using methods outlined in zarzycki et al 2015 the highest resolution surface cover dataset in clm4 0 sp approximately 5 km resolution was used and regridded at the same variable resolution to produce the surface characteristics needed by vr cesm this particular surface cover dataset is fixed in time derived from a composite of several satellite products and representative of the year 2000 supported by an u s china joint research project the focus regions for the variable resolution refinement include 3 12 million km 2 in the five major watersheds in the western u s and 4 04 million km 2 in the four major river basins in eastern china the finest grid resolution is 14 km and covers one region in the western u s and one in eastern china fig 1 the refined grid includes transitional buffers from 111 km grid spacing to 55 km 28 km and finally 14 km over both the western u s and eastern china the vr cesm simulations span january 1969 to december 2006 for the historical simulation and january 2007 to december 2050 for the future rcp 8 5 simulation the first year is discarded as a spin up period to ensure the land surface model is in equilibrium with cam5 se particularly for soil moisture the clm initial conditions for the vr cesm simulation are from the average of historical 1850 2006 cesm simulations and are at reasonably balanced states therefore one year spin up is generally sufficient lee et al 2015 montavez et al 2017 and is followed by many previous vr cesm studies wu et al 2017 huang et al 2016 the simulations were conducted on the department of energy s national energy research scientific computing center nersc cori supercomputing system with 75 nodes 2 400 processors the computational hour cost is 43 300 h per simulation year with 1 33 simulation years per day on cori haswell 2 2 hydrology in clm clm is the land surface model used in our vr cesm simulation for computing runoff generation and other hydrological flux components oleson et al 2010 the hydrologic cycle over land includes interception of water by plant foliage and wood throughfall streamflow infiltration runoff soil water and snow these are directly linked to the biogeophysics and also affect temperature precipitation and runoff total runoff surface and subsurface runoff are routed downstream to oceans using a river transport model rtm generally the hydrological processes in most land surface models are over simplified particularly missing the lateral flow between two columns of the land surface model and do not necessarily work best at the watershed level however this approach is still used in most climate models thus the assessment of its application in hydrological analyses are critical in vr cesm the rtm enables the hydrologic cycle to be closed because it is synchronously coupled to clm and routes total runoff from the land surface model to either the active ocean or marginal seas branstetter and famiglietti 1999 however in this study the watersheds evaluated are small enough that we can use the clm hydrology variables directly for comparison of observed and simulated streamflows on daily time scales in addition many other global climate models do not use rtm or have different rtm structures to route runoff through the terrain as such the rtm outputs are not evaluated in this paper this also allows for more detailed analysis of surface and subsurface contributions to total streamflow and wider applicability in other models the runoff generation scheme in clm is based on a simplified topmodel based representation niu et al 2005 and the detailed introduction of the hydrological scheme can be found in the clm manual oleson et al 2010 and is only briefly introduced here both surface and subsurface runoff are parameterized as exponential functions of the water table depth the rate of surface runoff generation is given by r surf f sat p 1 f sat max 0 p i where f sat is the fraction of saturated area within a grid cell p is the effective rainfall intensity in mm s 1 i e equivalent to kg m 2 s 1 in common clm applications which is estimated as the sum of throughfall rainfall and dewfall after canopy interception and snowmelt i is the soil infiltration capacity in mm s 1 which is controlled by soil properties and soil moisture within the top soil layer the fractional saturation area is a function of soil moisture calculated by f sat f max exp 0 5 f over z δ where f max is the maximum possible saturated area fraction f over is a decay factor m 1 and z δ is the water table depth m f max is computed at 14 km resolution using the methods introduced in tesfa et al 2014 and the decay factor f over was determined through sensitivity analysis and comparison with observed runoff to be 0 5 m 1 oleson et al 2010 the rate of subsurface runoff generation is given by r sub r sb max exp f drai z where r sb max is the maximum subsurface runoff when the whole grid cell is saturated in mm s 1 and f drai is a decay factor m 1 that represents the distribution of saturated hydraulic conductivity with depth the total soil column in clm is divided into 10 layers with the thickness of each layer increasing from top to bottom the total soil depth for hydrologic simulation is prescribed a uniform constant value of 3 802 m the maximum subsurface runoff values used in clm are constant at 5 5 10 3 mm s 1 which is derived from a sensitivity analysis of global extent in other words the constant values set in the model implementation are applied generally to watersheds with different actual subsurface permeability and surface conditions li et al 2011 pointed out that this may lead to significant impacts on water table depth and soil moisture profile and thus influence the temporal variation of runoff generation li et al 2011 performed sensitivity analysis and manual trial and error calibration to the default parameters in clm including f sat and r sb max in the american river watershed and found that r sb max is the major factor contributing to the unrealistically high peaks of runoff following li et al 2011 we applied the same calibration approach to r sb max using usgs gauged streamflow data measured at the outlet of each watershed within each watershed r sb max is assumed to be constant and calibrated against the streamflow gauge measurements at the watershed outlets the calibration period is 1970 2006 monthly average streamflow measurements over the calibration period 1970 2006 are used in the trial and error manual calibration the calibration range of the maximum subsurface runoff r sb max determined for our watersheds is set between 0 and 1 1 10 2 mm s 1 or 0 200 of the default maximum subsurface runoff specified in clm since the calibrations are carried out independently in each of the four watersheds evaluated in this study the resulting r sb max values differ across watersheds likely due to differing hydrogeological and surface conditions we also calibrated f sat and r sb max simultaneously and found that their difference is negligible in total runoff which is similar to the results in li et al 2011 however the allocation to surface and subsurface runoff can be different see supplementary material 1 as data are not available to validate this allocation we take the more parsimonious approach here of calibrating only r sb max 2 3 watersheds in the western u s four unmanaged mountainous watersheds have been selected to analyze the vr cesm hydrological simulation fig 1 to represent a wide range of geographic conditions in the western u s unmanaged watersheds ideally do not have human activities such as dams direct withdrawls or water diversion that affect hydrological processes and are essential for evaluation here because vr cesm is not able to simulate these human factors it turns out that unmanaged watersheds are usually mountainous regions with relatively small area these four watersheds represent diverse climate and topography in the western u s the american river and east taylor river are snow dominated watersheds and the cosumnes river and smith river are rain dominated watersheds watershed locations include the pacific coast smith the sierra nevada mountains cosumnes the cascade mountains american and the rocky mountains east taylor furthermore the american river li et al 2011 and the east taylor river https watershed lbl gov are well studied watersheds with ample data for evaluation the american river watershed is a mountainous watershed located along the leeward side of mt rainier in the pacific northwest region of the u s the total drainage area of the american river watershed is 205 km 2 which is mainly covered by evergreen forest and shrub and underlaid by sandy soil the elevation ranges from 850 to 2100 m annual precipitation in the watershed is about 1850 mm mostly occurring in the winter season november to january as snowfall li et al 2011 the cosumnes river is one of the last rivers in the sierra nevada region without a major dam thus it offers a rare opportunity to study natural flow conditions we should note that only the part of cosumnes river watershed upstream of the michigan bar usgs station is considered here which includes only 3500 km 2 of the total 7000 km 2 of the watershed above about 900 m the northern sierra nevada mountains are predominately covered by a mixed evergreen forest spatial patterns of precipitation are highly heterogeneous across the watershed the regional climate is considered mediterranean with average precipitation of 1500 mm yr wet and cold winters with a watershed average temperature equal to 0 c and hot and dry summers with a watershed average temperature reaching 25 c maina et al 2020a b the east taylor river watershed is representative of headwater catchments in the upper colorado basin markstrom et al 2009 with nearly 2000 km 2 the east river and taylor river form the gunnison river which in turn accounts for just under half of the colorado river s discharge at the colorado utah border the watershed has an average elevation of 3266 m with 1420 m of topographic relief and pronounced gradients in hydrology geomorphology vegetation and weather the area is defined as having a continental subarctic climate with long cold winters and short cool summers the watershed has a mean annual temperature of 0 c with average minimum and maximum temperatures of 9 2 and 9 8 c respectively in winter and summer seasons the east taylor watershed receives an average of 1200 mm yr 1 of precipitation the majority of which falls as snow hubbard et al 2018 the smith river is the only coastal river that is evaluated in this study it flows from the klamath mountains to the pacific ocean in del norte county in extreme northwestern california on the west coast of the united states the river is 40 4 km long its watershed catchment area is 1 860 km 2 without no major dams or human activities the climate in smith river is a typical mediterranean regime with most precipitation falling in winter and approximately 60 of the year s total average precipitation occurring in the four month period from november to march smith river is the wettest human inhabited spot in the state of california with the average annual precipitation amount of 1873 mm however very little snow falls as its daily mean temperature is moderate and ranges from 9 0 c in february and 16 0 c in july 2 4 reference hydrological models and reference datasets the national water model nwm is a hydrologic modeling framework that simulates and forecast streamflow over the entire continental united states conus the core of the nwm system is the national center for atmospheric research ncar supported community weather research and forecasting hydrologic model wrf hydro it uses global forcing from a variety of sources and is configured to use the noah mp land surface model lsm to simulate land surface processes separate water routing modules perform diffusive wave surface routing and saturated subsurface flow routing on a 250 m grid and routing downstream along the nriver network and output streamflow simulation at the stream reaches of the national hydrography dataset nhdplusv2 united states geological survey usgs streamflow observations are assimilated into each of the four nwm analysis and assimilation configurations and all analysis and forecast configurations benefit from the inclusion of over 5 000 reservoirs in this study we use the national water model reanalysis dataset which archives the model historical outputs for 25 years from 1993 to 2017 and is publicly available at https registry opendata aws nwm archive nwm reanalysis dataset is selected as the reference hydrological modeling dataset in this study for model assessment because it is one of the most widely used operational streamflow model for at large continental scale for example the western u s it also incorporates regional climate simulation in its hydrological analyses and assimilates observations which has the similar atmosphere land coupling model framework compared to vr cesm usgs streamflow measurements at the outlets of the four focal watersheds were used to calibrate and validate the runoff simulation in this study the four usgs streamflow stations maintained long term daily river discharge measurements since the beginning of our vr cesm simulations january 1 1970 the usgs streamflow measurements are publicly available to be downloaded online 3 results 3 1 calibration and assessments the calibrated mean absolute errors maes of runoff simulations are significantly smaller than the uncalibrated runoff in comparison against usgs gauge measurements and the maximum subsurface runoff parameter varies across watersheds table 1 presents the mae of calibration and the calibrated values of r sb max for each watershed calibration of the maximum subsurface runoff parameter indicates that each watershed has unique geographical and climate conditions that dictate unique parameters the maes at watersheds in table 1 also indicate that the runoff calibration works better in the east taylor and cosumnes river watersheds than the smith river and american river watersheds fig 2 presents the monthly calibration results for most recent 10 year period 1996 2006 in our historical simulation and for the 37 year monthly average of calibrated and uncalibrated runoff simulations the uncalibrated results consistently overestimate the peak of discharge whether it occurs in the winter or summer at these watersheds while the uncalibrated and calibrated runoff are similar in the low runoff periods the calibration particularly improves projections of peak runoff in all four watersheds regardless of seasonal timing in the snow dominated american river and east taylor watersheds most precipitation falls in winter as snowfall that accumulates as snowpack while the runoff peak occurs in late spring because they are high elevation mountain watersheds significantly controlled by snow processes such as timing of snowmelt on the other hand runoff peaks are observed in winter in the smith river and cosumnes river as they are both rain dominated watersheds located in relatively low elevation mountains with more immediate responses to precipitation in both cases calibration reduces the original overestimates of these peaks the calibrated maximum subsurface runoff values r sb max are smaller than the prescribed uniform value 5 5 10 3 mm s 1 that was determined from global data and used in the cesm simulation although the value of maximum subsurface runoff r sb max depends on various factors this is consistent with physics and intuition that maximum subsurface runoff r sb max is generally smaller in the mountainous regions with steeper topographical gradient than the smooth topographical regions li et al 2014 we used vr cesm to evaluate the partition of surface and subsurface runoff in the calibrated total runoff that contributes to streamflow and found that surface runoff is nearly 30 of the total runoff in the peak runoff season indicating that approximately 70 of the peak runoff comes from the subsurface groundwater discharge however this allocation changes if f sat is also calibrated against streamflow measurement supplementary material 1 but we are not able to determine which presents the physical processes due to lack of data of surface and subsurface runoff partition we validated the calibration by comparing with usgs station measurements in the validation period 2007 2019 and the national water model during the period that nwm reanalysis datasets are available 2007 2017 the vr cesm biases of the monthly fraction of annual runoff vary geographically and seasonally as shown in fig 3 in the snow dominated watersheds american river and east taylor river vr cesm consistently overestimates the peak runoff in the snowmelt season with greater annual variability over the historical period the peak monthly runoff in vr cesm is nearly 5 of the total annual runoff or higher while simulated baseflow runoff is relatively low compared to the national water model and usgs station measurements this indicates that quantifying the uncertainties in snow processes and understanding its impacts on runoff generation are the key for hydrological analysis in these snow dominated watersheds on the other hand vr cesm runoff simulation has less difference in the rain dominated cosumnes river and smith river watersheds the peak runoff in vr cesm is similar to that of the national water model and the usgs measurement at about 2 3 of the total annual runoff overall vr cesm biases generally decrease as the amount of monthly runoff decreases in general the timing and magnitude of runoff are appropriately simulated in vr cesm with the assessment of nwm and usgs station measurements further analyses presented in this paper are based on our calibrated version of the model unless otherwise noted overall the calibrated runoff matches reasonably well with the usgs station measurements in the validation period particularly in the baseflow estimation we also observed that the runoff spikes have larger uncertainties and are overestimated in the snow dominated watersheds 3 2 assessments of climate change impacts on total runoff through 2050 the potential impacts of climate change on hydrology vary across watersheds likely due to their varied geographies and climate patterns table 2 indicates that the mean annual runoff in the american and smith rivers remains stable during all periods but 7 15 and 25 increases are observed in the east taylor and cosumnes river watersheds respectively when comparing the projection 2020 2050 and validation 2007 2019 periods against the historical period 1970 2006 in addition to the increasing trend of mean annual average runoff the timing and magnitude of peak monthly average daily runoff in these watersheds can also vary over time for example peak runoff increases in the rain dominated cosumnes and smith river watersheds and decreases or stays similar in snow dominated american and east taylor river watersheds fig 4 in contrast to the historical period projection period peak runoff in the rain dominated watersheds increases approximately 20 in smith river and as high as 60 in the cosumnes river suggesting that the increasing runoff in the projection period is mostly added in the peak and thus increases risk of flooding in the future these peaks are also more pronounced in the future and shift forward one month in the smith river on the other hand the peak runoff is observed in late spring and decreases nearly 30 in the snow dominated american river while winter baseflow increases significantly in the projection period potentially due to smaller snow rain ratios and higher snowmelt compared to other watersheds a smaller increase in peak runoff is simulated in the east taylor watershed between the historical and projection periods as a result of changing temperature impacts on precipitation and snow to better understand the differences in runoff generation across these watersheds we further evaluate potential climate change impacts on precipitation and snow correlation coefficients between calibrated runoff simulation and meteorological variables precipitation snow water equivalent and daily average temperature with lags from 0 to 11 months are computed to help quantitative analysis of the causes of runoff changes supplementary material 2 the change of precipitation between the historical and projection periods varies among watersheds table 2 shows that daily average precipitation slightly decreases 7 in american river and remains the same in smith river but increases approximately 6 in the east taylor watershed and 16 in the cosumnes river watershed fig 5 shows the simulated accumulated precipitation in the four watersheds during the historical validation and projection periods although the detailed discussion of changing precipitation is beyond the scope of this paper these annual changes are due mainly to seasonally dependent changes in the magnitude of monthly precipitation and vary among watersheds precipitation increases mostly during summer in the east taylor watershed in colorado likely due to summer thunderstorms hubbard et al 2018 carroll et al 2020 as a result increasing precipitation does not change the magnitude of runoff peaks in the late spring and early summer in the east taylor watershed uniquely east taylor watershed in the upper colorado river has similar average monthly precipitation year round because it is jointly affected by water vapor from the pacific and the summer monsoon coming from the gulf of mexico hubbard et al 2018 carroll et al 2020 on the other hand significantly increasing precipitation in the winter and spring rainy season is found in the cosumnes river that partially contributes to the higher simulated runoff from january to april in the projection period in the american watershed the decrease in precipitation also occurs in winter which may contribute to less snowpack less summer snowmelt and a lower peak spring runoff temperature plays an important role in the amount and type of precipitation the ratios between rain and snow and can significantly affect the magnitude and timing of runoff at different geographical locations different from most hydrological modeling and analysis studies where temperature is a forcing dataset temperature is simulated in vr cesm in the coupled atmosphere and land surface models increasing temperature in the projection period compared to the historical period is consistently observed in all four watersheds throughout the year fig 6 the difference from the historical period is similar across seasons with an average increase of 1 degree in the recent validation period and an average increase of more than 2 degrees in the projection period future changes in simulated snow water equivalent swe fig 7 are related to both the temperature increases and changes in precipitation this leads to more dramatic swe changes than for total precipitation and also contributes to the projected changes in runoff fig 4 the average peak historical swe in the american river watershed is 700 mm in march and is nearly 50 of the accumulated precipitation since the beginning of water year during the future period this peak diminishes to only 400 mm or 28 of the accumulated precipitation and this peak is shifted one month sooner to february this nearly 40 swe decrease in winter and one month earlier start of snowmelt contribute to changes in magnitude and timing of runoff in the american watershed fig 4 this indicates that climate change has significant impacts on the snow and hydrological process in the cascade mountain regions where the majority of precipitation falls in winter and changing snowpack accumulation and snowmelt in spring play an important roles in runoff generation surprisingly swe is projected to be similar between the historical and future periods in the east taylor watershed under climate change which has the highest elevation among all four watersheds this has been reported by several climate projection studies e g ullrich et al 2018 wu et al 2017 showing little change or even increasing swe in high elevations because of increasing precipitation and water vapor transported from the ocean these studies report that although temperature increases in the mountains in the projection the daily maximum temperature still remains below freezing point so that snowpack does not melt in winter although swe is not projected to decrease warming temperatures and increased precipitation could lead to early snowmelt and thus higher runoff in the spring fig 4 in the two rain dominated watersheds the cosumnes and smith rivers swe is small compared to the other two watersheds and thus has less influence on streamflow but 50 60 swe decreases in the cosumnes river and 80 decreases in the smith river may still contribute to higher winter runoff peaks as precipitation may be falling as rain rather than snow figs 4 and 7 the swe peaks also shift earlier in the year for these two watersheds which may influence runoff timing 3 3 extreme events fig 8 shows the monthly distribution and changing temporal pattern of the 95th percentile of daily runoff r95 a widely used indicator of flood risk khomsi et al 2016 allen et al 2011 mishra and shah 2018 in the comparison to usgs streamflow measurements total runoff is generally overestimated by vr cesm during peak flow seasons across the watersheds the season of highest r95 almost always coincides with the season of peak flow for both vr cesm and the gauge measurements refgroupfig reffig monthlytestingprojection during non peak flow seasons vr cesm better estimates the r95 value but the model doesn t always agree with the measurements on the month of peak flow as the uncertainties can be higher for example 95th percentile runoff at the snowmelt season from april to june are nearly 80 higher than the usgs station measurements in the american river watershed while their differences are small during late summer and fall dry seasons corresponding with potential changes in runoff associated with the changing of snowfall and early snowmelt in these watersheds future monthly r95 can be either higher or lower than the during the historical period in both american river and cosumnes river watersheds the projected r95 increases approximately 30 from december to march indicating that increasing precipitation and higher rain snow ratio in winter could potentially amplify the risk of flooding events in winter in american river watershed the projected r95 decreases in may and june due to earlier snowmelt the future r95 in east taylor watershed is higher than in the historical period from april to june as east taylor is located at higher elevation with later snowmelt thus shifting the risk of extreme runoff in spring the smith river r95 does not change much between historical and future periods likely because projected precipitation does not change significantly and it is a rain dominated watershed with little impact from snow this implies that the extreme analysis of climate model and hydrological outputs are complicated and challenging with many conditions to be considered higher interannual variability of annual average daily runoff is also indicative of increases in both wet and dry extreme events table 2 shows that the standard deviation of annual average daily runoff increases over time in all four watersheds with future values ranging from 14 in the american river to as great as 71 in the cosumnes river with respect to the historical period similarly the 95th percentile of annual average daily runoff is projected to be higher in the future than during the historical period in all four watersheds fig 10 presents the annual time series of the watershed budgets interannual variability in runoff is driven by precipitation with et being more stable over time residual values computed as precipitation minus total runoff minus et indicate incomplete budget closure due to simplified model processes that do not fully account for things such as changing levels of ground water storage for the rain dominated watersheds more years with extreme runoff are projected to occur during the future the counts of extreme runoff years defined as the annual average runoff beyond the mean standard deviation extreme wet or mean standard deviation extreme dry of the 37 year historical period 1970 2006 are computed in the projection period with the same 37 year interval 2014 2050 to evaluate the climate change impacts on extremes table 5 in the cosumnes river watershed the frequency of extreme wet dry years was estimated to be higher lower in the projection period compared to historical period similarly in the east taylor river watershed there are 7 extreme wet years in the historical period but 11 years in the projection period in smith river the counts of extreme wet and dry years both increased in the projection indicating grater interannual variability due to climate change in these two watersheds greater interannual variability and more years with extremely high annual average daily runoff are mostly relative to the similar changes in the precipitation patterns as total runoff subsurface runoff surface runoff is as large as 70 80 of the total precipitation in the water budget on the other hand the number of extremely high annual average daily runoff years does not change significantly in the american river watershed the count of extreme wet dry years in this watershed decreases increases in the projection period partially due to less precipitation overall daily runoff generally shows greater future variability at monthly and annual temporal scales with changing precipitation and snow indicating the potential for increased occurrence of extreme events and dry and wet years 3 4 regional scale watersheds water budget to assess more regional scale hydrological projects we looked at the annual average daily water budget components fig 9 of the four usgs huc hydrological unit code 2 level watersheds in the western u s the california pacific northwest upper colorado and lower colorado river watersheds fig 1 these larger scale watersheds are highly managed with dams canals and pumping activities that are not simulated by vr cesm as a result station measurements are not applicable for calibrating the subsurface runoff as for the smaller mountainous watersheds nor can the previously calibrated maximum subsurface runoff values can be appropriately applied in the larger scale due to the heterogeneity of topography and soil characteristics therefore the uncalibrated simulations are used in this regional scale water budget analysis although runoff is overestimated vr cesm model outputs are still able to provide a relative estimation of each component in the water budget and evaluate climate change impacts table 3 shows increasing annual average daily runoff over time in most of the western u s except for relatively little change in the pacific northwest a majority of precipitation becomes et in the upper and lower colorado river watersheds while et is only approximately 30 in the pacific northwest and california watersheds overall as more precipitation goes to runoff in the california and pacific northwest watersheds and the precipitation variability increases in the future these two watersheds show greater variability in runoff in the future with the standard deviation of annual average daily runoff increasing 82 and 16 respectively in between the historical and projection periods table 3 with respect to the 95th percentile annual average daily runoff there is a 47 increase in california and 32 increase in the lower colorado between the historical and future periods but little chanege in the other two watersheds between these periods table 3 similarly to the extreme analysis in the small four watersheds in the western u s the counts of wet and dry extreme runoff years were computed to evaluate the frequency of extreme events table 6 in watersheds other than the pacific northwest counts of the extreme wet years are double in the projection period while the numbers of extreme dry years are significantly decreased compared to the historical period increasing frequency of extremely high annual average runoff is related to higher precipitation for example in the california watershed where 18 years in the projection period are extreme wet years based on the threshold defined in the historical period with only 7 extreme wet years in the pacific northwest however there are only slight decreases in the number of extreme wet and dry years likely because the average annual precipitation does not change much between historical and projection periods but the variability does this is consistent with the extreme analysis in the previous subsection and implies that the possibility of climate and hydrological extremes increases in the future in most watersheds these increases in extremes may lead to increases in floods or droughts a similar analysis in four usgs huc2 scale regions in china china coastal hai river yangtze river and yellow river shows different impacts across watersheds of projected climate change on the annual average daily water budget similar to the coastal watersheds in the western u s table 4 indicates that annual average daily runoff increases by 33 and 18 in the china coastal and yangtze river watersheds respectively between the historical and projection periods the annual water budget presented in fig 11 clearly indicates that the china coastal region and yangtze river also have higher precipitation and et in the projection period in comparison with the historical period the china coastal region shows 91 higher standard deviation and 47 higher 95th percentile annual average daily runoff in the projection period table 4 indicating greater variability and higher possibility of extreme runoff events under a changing climate similarly to the extreme analysis in the western u s the china coastal yangzte river and yellow river watersheds have 19 16 and 9 extreme wet years in the projection respectively compared to the 6 5 and 5 years in the historical period table 6 the counts of extreme dry years in these watersheds are also smaller in the projection period indicating less potential for drought but higher possibility of flooding hazards under a changing climate the annual variability of each water component particularly the runoff also increases with time in those three watersheds both the mean and standard deviation of annual average daily runoff and precipitation in the hai river watershed which has an arid climate do not vary much with time and et is water limited and does not increase as much as in the yangtze river and china coastal regions in general most of the watersheds in china also exhibit changes in the annual water budget due to projected climate change 4 conclusion in this study we evaluated an application of a variable resolution global climate model vr cesm in varied size watersheds in the western u s the simulated runoffs for four unmanaged watersheds are calibrated against discharge measurements and compared to another hydrological model the impacts of climate change on precipitation snowpack and runoff as well as extreme runoff events in those watersheds are evaluated based on historical and rcp8 5 simulations furthermore we quantified the water budget components in larger scale watersheds in the western u s and china and evaluated their annual variability and potential climate change impacts our major conclusions are listed as follows 1 this study demonstrates the viability of applying fine resolution gcms for unmanaged watershed scale hydrological analysis with careful calibration this is promising for future hydrological analyses that include two way feedbacks between the atmosphere and the surface the implication is that this approach can be used by other climate model and land surface model applications at similar resolution and scales to evaluate the hydrological response to atmospheric forcing particularly for addressing impacts under climate change 2 this study used uggs streamflow gauge measurements to quantify the uncertainties of parameterizations in the runoff generation schemes while the uncertainties of meteorological variables were evaluated in a previous study xu et al 2021 for vr cesm the uncertainty in total runoff was considerably reduced by calibrating the maximum subsurface runoff parameter r sb max against usgs gauge measurements 3 the impacts of climate change on hydrology vary in snow dominated and rain dominated watersheds this is largely due to the interacting effects of changes in precipitation and temperature in snow dominated watersheds decreasing snowpack and early snowmelt shifts runoff peaks earlier and reduces their magnitude supplementary material 2 in the rain dominated watersheds with increasing precipitation in the projection period peak runoff increases in the wet season 4 potential climate change also affects the magnitude of extreme runoff events in snow dominated watersheds early snowmelt increases the potential for high runoff events in spring while in rain dominated watersheds more intense precipitation in winter increases the potential for high runoff events in winter increased variation of annual average runoff and increasing precipitation in the water budget over time also indicates the potential for more extremely dry and extremely wet periods 5 in regional scale watersheds in the western u s and china vr cesm generally projects increasing precipitation and runoff through the middle of this century particularly in the coastal watersheds that receive more moisture from the ocean larger interannual variability and higher frequency of wet and dry years are projected for the future for most of the watersheds indicating that climate change could affect the occurrence of extreme hydrological events thus potentially increase the risks of arising geohazards the increasing number of refined resolution and or variable resolution gcm applications provide significant amounts of data for evaluating the hydrological processes and investigating water budgets in watersheds with careful calibration against observation and assessment of the uncertainties in

4333,taditionally watershed scale hydrology is simulated by distributed hydrological models with offline meteorological forcing data or by regional regional climate models that link atmospheric and land hydrology interactions global climate model gcms are rarely used to study watershed scale hydrology due to the relatively coarse grid resolution computationally expensive downscaling and simplified physical processes recently however watershed scale hydrology analysis has become possible in gcms due to the development of variable resolution gcms that dynamically couple the hydrological processes between atmospheric and land systems at fine resolutions in selected regions and coarse resolution elsewhere in this study we used the variable resolution community earth system model vr cesm with refined resolution 14 km in the western u s and eastern china to evaluate smaller watershed scale hydrology we compared the historical vr cesm outputs with gauge measurements and other hydrological models e g national water model in the u s and calibrated the subsurface runoff capacities in four mountainous watersheds an rcp8 5 projection from 2007 to 2050 is used to estimate the impact of changing precipitation and snow climatology on watershed hydrology we also analyzed the long term runoff variability and the possibility of extreme runoff events as simulated by the vr cesm although calibration is not possible in larger scale watersheds vr cesm simulates the long term annual variability of watersheds and provides insights on climate change impacts on hydrology we conclude that refined resolution vr cesm can be used for watershed scale hydrology analysis to understand water resources and water balance in addition to traditional watershed scale hydrological models it enables hydrological analysis at multiple watersheds in one simulation and can help understand the two way dynamics between land surface hydrology and atmospheric processes and is especially practical for projecting climate change impacts however it is challenging to apply vr cesm for hydrologic analysis in regulated watersheds as human factors e g pumping irrigation water diversion have not been fully addressed in vr cesm keywords watersheds runoff climate change global climate model water budget 1 introduction multiple distributed hydrological models have been developed e g parflow maxwell et al 2009 modflow harbaugh 2005 swat arnold et al 2012 with numerous applications at the watershed level these distributed hydrological models solve physically based equations for subsurface and surface flow as well as other hydrological processes over the domain the distributed hydrological models usually require significant efforts to set up with high resolution input datasets particularly for the subsurface geology and soil parameters which may need to come from intensively instrumented regions the heterogeneity of data uncertainties and coverage coming from different data sources across the large scale domain could affect the performance of hydrologic models significantly archfield et al 2015 as a result it is also structurally and computationally challenging to upscale the distributed hydrology models to larger continental or global scales the governing equations and assumptions that are valid at fine scales may not be valid at coarser scales blöschl and sivapalan 1995 while running fine resolution hydrological models over large regions is computationally expensive in addition this method captures only one way interactions from the atmosphere to the land global climate models gcms have been developed to simulate earth system processes and study various climate science questions for example projecting the changing climate e g massoud et al 2019 gettelman et al 2018 rhoades et al 2018 investigating the large scale teleconnection patterns e g gettelman et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 and quantifying the effects of radiation on evapotranspiration et e g lian et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the applications of global climate models to evaluating watershed level hydrology are limited and usually require additional model development downscaling and or postprocessing e g voisin et al 2013 zhou et al 2020 the coupling of atmospheric models and lumped land surface models in gcms generally requires simplified mechanistic hydrological processes and most of these coupling do not include lateral flow most gcm simulations at present are performed at relatively coarse horizontal resolutions 1 due to the tremendous computational cost required to run them at finer resolutions while hydrological processes have been widely investigated and have significant impacts on other earth system processes gcms are seldom applied to study hydrological processes because their coarse resolution inhibits reliable watershed scale analyses although some statistical downscaling methods have been developed and applied these methods still have limitations such as ignoring physical principles or not being able to project novel future conditions maraun and widmann 2018 nyunt et al 2016 velasquez et al 2020 regional climate models rcms are an alternative to statistical downscaling and have been developed to run at resolutions of less than 1 km with the flexibility of multiple nested domains at different resolutions rcms are driven by either coarser resolution gcms or reanalysis climate datasets at the outer domain with the limitations of not simulating large scale global circulation and the introduction of large scale error at the rcm boundary xu et al 2018 ullrich et al 2018 nonetheless simplified hydrologic processes including runoff generation snow accumulation and snowmelt evaporation and transpiration and infiltration are simulated by the land surface models in both gcms and rcms in order to evaluate feedbacks with the atmosphere given these limitations distributed watershed scale models are usually the preferred tools for hydrological analyses over various climate model approaches offline land surface models with meteorological forcing datasets at fine resolution have also been used for hydrological analysis but they have their limitations for example li et al 2011 evaluated the fine resolution clm hydrology outputs with in situ observations from the american river watershed and concluded that the surface and subsurface runoff can appropriately simulate the monthly runoff and water budget with calibration at the watershed scale du et al 2016 evaluated the hydrologic components in the clm4 forced by both reanalysis and coupled model outputs and reported that runoff was generally overestimated and the predictability of hydrology could be improved by addressing the compensating errors associated with precipitation and temperature the uncertainty of this approach is partially determined by the resolution of meteorological forcing datasets and the topography and surface datasets applied in the land surface model with additional limitations associated with coarser resolution parameterizations being applied at finer scales furthermore this approach applies to only one way interactions from the meteorological forcing datasets to the land surface model this means that some important feedbacks of water budgets such as the effects of et on vapor pressure deficit are not simulated and may lead to uncertainties in the watershed scale water budget computation mountainous headwater watersheds are critical to water resources management in the western u s and the above approaches are all challenged by the complexity of this high gradient region the sierra nevada and cascade mountains on the west coast act as natural barriers to the dominant moisture transport pathway coming from the pacific ocean and as such force condensation and store this moisture as mountain snowpack the mountains of the sierra nevada provide 72 additional surface storage for irrigation and municipal use during seasonally dry summers dettinger and anderson 2015 and provide more than 60 of california s water consumption bales et al 2011 similarly the rocky mountain snowpack is a primary source of water for the colorado river basin and inland western u s serreze et al 1999 the hydrological processes in these in forested mountainous watersheds are usually snow dominated and topography driven understanding the interactions among forest structure snow accumulation snowmelt and streamflow generation is therefore an integral component of effective water resources management ahl et al 2008 particularly climate change will challenge current water resource management strategies due to changing resource availability in the western u s mountains hayhoe et al 2004 foster et al 2016 pointed out that in snow dominated mountain regions climate is expected to alter two drivers of hydrology by decreasing the fraction of precipitation falling as snow and also increasing surface energy available to drive et in such complex regions improving the characterization and modeling of hydrological processes is essential to better understand the hydrologic dynamics under a changing climate he et al 2019 garousi nejad et al 2017 daly et al 2017 in this study we demonstrate that refined solution gcms are applicable to perform watershed scale hydrological analysis and alleviate some of the limitations described above this approach is particularly novel and well suited in projecting climate change impacts on hydrological processes and extreme events by using a gcm with regionally refined resolution we leverage the two way interactions between the atmospheric and land surface models while simulating the hydrological processes at a refined resolution in this paper we analyze and evaluate hydrological simulations in four representative unmanaged headwater watersheds in the western u s using the variable resolution community earth system model vr cesm the methods applied in this study are described in section 2 including the climate model experiment section 2 1 the runoff generation schemes and calibration approach section 2 2 a brief introduction of the four watersheds studied in this paper section 2 3 and the reference hydrological models and data section 2 4 the runoff calibration results are evaluated against reference models and data in section 3 1 the application of vr cesm to assessing climate change impacts on mean runoff is presented in section 3 2 and the assessment of changing patterns of extreme hydrological events is presented in section section 3 3 vr cesm simulations are also used to quantify the water budget in larger scale watersheds in the western u s and eastern china where grid resolution is refined at 14 km in the vr cesm section 3 4 2 methods 2 1 variable resolution global climate model the technical details of vr cesm and model evaluation were demonstrated in xu et al 2021 and only briefly introduced here the vr cesm utilizes a variable resolution cubed sphere grid generated by squadgen ullrich 2014 and implemented in the community earth system model with the community atmospheric model version 5 using the spectral element dynamical core cam5 se and the community land model with satellite phenology version 4 0 clm oleson et al 2010 lawrence et al 2011 this study uses the famipc5 f atmospheric model intercomparison project component component set which bounds atmosphere land coupled simulations with observationally derived estimates of sea surface temperature and sea ice and employs well established atmosphere model intercomparison project amip protocols with full atmospheric land coupling and monthly prescribed ocean conditions ackerley et al 2018 the monthly prescribed sea ice and sea surface temperatures sst are derived from a merging of the hadisst1 hadley centre sea ice and sea surface temperature dataset and noaa oi national oceanic and atmospheric administration optimum interpolation sst datasets hurrell et al 2008 the vr cesm land topography is derived from a resolution dependent smoothing of a global 30 arc second elevation us geological survey gtopo30 dataset using methods outlined in zarzycki et al 2015 the highest resolution surface cover dataset in clm4 0 sp approximately 5 km resolution was used and regridded at the same variable resolution to produce the surface characteristics needed by vr cesm this particular surface cover dataset is fixed in time derived from a composite of several satellite products and representative of the year 2000 supported by an u s china joint research project the focus regions for the variable resolution refinement include 3 12 million km 2 in the five major watersheds in the western u s and 4 04 million km 2 in the four major river basins in eastern china the finest grid resolution is 14 km and covers one region in the western u s and one in eastern china fig 1 the refined grid includes transitional buffers from 111 km grid spacing to 55 km 28 km and finally 14 km over both the western u s and eastern china the vr cesm simulations span january 1969 to december 2006 for the historical simulation and january 2007 to december 2050 for the future rcp 8 5 simulation the first year is discarded as a spin up period to ensure the land surface model is in equilibrium with cam5 se particularly for soil moisture the clm initial conditions for the vr cesm simulation are from the average of historical 1850 2006 cesm simulations and are at reasonably balanced states therefore one year spin up is generally sufficient lee et al 2015 montavez et al 2017 and is followed by many previous vr cesm studies wu et al 2017 huang et al 2016 the simulations were conducted on the department of energy s national energy research scientific computing center nersc cori supercomputing system with 75 nodes 2 400 processors the computational hour cost is 43 300 h per simulation year with 1 33 simulation years per day on cori haswell 2 2 hydrology in clm clm is the land surface model used in our vr cesm simulation for computing runoff generation and other hydrological flux components oleson et al 2010 the hydrologic cycle over land includes interception of water by plant foliage and wood throughfall streamflow infiltration runoff soil water and snow these are directly linked to the biogeophysics and also affect temperature precipitation and runoff total runoff surface and subsurface runoff are routed downstream to oceans using a river transport model rtm generally the hydrological processes in most land surface models are over simplified particularly missing the lateral flow between two columns of the land surface model and do not necessarily work best at the watershed level however this approach is still used in most climate models thus the assessment of its application in hydrological analyses are critical in vr cesm the rtm enables the hydrologic cycle to be closed because it is synchronously coupled to clm and routes total runoff from the land surface model to either the active ocean or marginal seas branstetter and famiglietti 1999 however in this study the watersheds evaluated are small enough that we can use the clm hydrology variables directly for comparison of observed and simulated streamflows on daily time scales in addition many other global climate models do not use rtm or have different rtm structures to route runoff through the terrain as such the rtm outputs are not evaluated in this paper this also allows for more detailed analysis of surface and subsurface contributions to total streamflow and wider applicability in other models the runoff generation scheme in clm is based on a simplified topmodel based representation niu et al 2005 and the detailed introduction of the hydrological scheme can be found in the clm manual oleson et al 2010 and is only briefly introduced here both surface and subsurface runoff are parameterized as exponential functions of the water table depth the rate of surface runoff generation is given by r surf f sat p 1 f sat max 0 p i where f sat is the fraction of saturated area within a grid cell p is the effective rainfall intensity in mm s 1 i e equivalent to kg m 2 s 1 in common clm applications which is estimated as the sum of throughfall rainfall and dewfall after canopy interception and snowmelt i is the soil infiltration capacity in mm s 1 which is controlled by soil properties and soil moisture within the top soil layer the fractional saturation area is a function of soil moisture calculated by f sat f max exp 0 5 f over z δ where f max is the maximum possible saturated area fraction f over is a decay factor m 1 and z δ is the water table depth m f max is computed at 14 km resolution using the methods introduced in tesfa et al 2014 and the decay factor f over was determined through sensitivity analysis and comparison with observed runoff to be 0 5 m 1 oleson et al 2010 the rate of subsurface runoff generation is given by r sub r sb max exp f drai z where r sb max is the maximum subsurface runoff when the whole grid cell is saturated in mm s 1 and f drai is a decay factor m 1 that represents the distribution of saturated hydraulic conductivity with depth the total soil column in clm is divided into 10 layers with the thickness of each layer increasing from top to bottom the total soil depth for hydrologic simulation is prescribed a uniform constant value of 3 802 m the maximum subsurface runoff values used in clm are constant at 5 5 10 3 mm s 1 which is derived from a sensitivity analysis of global extent in other words the constant values set in the model implementation are applied generally to watersheds with different actual subsurface permeability and surface conditions li et al 2011 pointed out that this may lead to significant impacts on water table depth and soil moisture profile and thus influence the temporal variation of runoff generation li et al 2011 performed sensitivity analysis and manual trial and error calibration to the default parameters in clm including f sat and r sb max in the american river watershed and found that r sb max is the major factor contributing to the unrealistically high peaks of runoff following li et al 2011 we applied the same calibration approach to r sb max using usgs gauged streamflow data measured at the outlet of each watershed within each watershed r sb max is assumed to be constant and calibrated against the streamflow gauge measurements at the watershed outlets the calibration period is 1970 2006 monthly average streamflow measurements over the calibration period 1970 2006 are used in the trial and error manual calibration the calibration range of the maximum subsurface runoff r sb max determined for our watersheds is set between 0 and 1 1 10 2 mm s 1 or 0 200 of the default maximum subsurface runoff specified in clm since the calibrations are carried out independently in each of the four watersheds evaluated in this study the resulting r sb max values differ across watersheds likely due to differing hydrogeological and surface conditions we also calibrated f sat and r sb max simultaneously and found that their difference is negligible in total runoff which is similar to the results in li et al 2011 however the allocation to surface and subsurface runoff can be different see supplementary material 1 as data are not available to validate this allocation we take the more parsimonious approach here of calibrating only r sb max 2 3 watersheds in the western u s four unmanaged mountainous watersheds have been selected to analyze the vr cesm hydrological simulation fig 1 to represent a wide range of geographic conditions in the western u s unmanaged watersheds ideally do not have human activities such as dams direct withdrawls or water diversion that affect hydrological processes and are essential for evaluation here because vr cesm is not able to simulate these human factors it turns out that unmanaged watersheds are usually mountainous regions with relatively small area these four watersheds represent diverse climate and topography in the western u s the american river and east taylor river are snow dominated watersheds and the cosumnes river and smith river are rain dominated watersheds watershed locations include the pacific coast smith the sierra nevada mountains cosumnes the cascade mountains american and the rocky mountains east taylor furthermore the american river li et al 2011 and the east taylor river https watershed lbl gov are well studied watersheds with ample data for evaluation the american river watershed is a mountainous watershed located along the leeward side of mt rainier in the pacific northwest region of the u s the total drainage area of the american river watershed is 205 km 2 which is mainly covered by evergreen forest and shrub and underlaid by sandy soil the elevation ranges from 850 to 2100 m annual precipitation in the watershed is about 1850 mm mostly occurring in the winter season november to january as snowfall li et al 2011 the cosumnes river is one of the last rivers in the sierra nevada region without a major dam thus it offers a rare opportunity to study natural flow conditions we should note that only the part of cosumnes river watershed upstream of the michigan bar usgs station is considered here which includes only 3500 km 2 of the total 7000 km 2 of the watershed above about 900 m the northern sierra nevada mountains are predominately covered by a mixed evergreen forest spatial patterns of precipitation are highly heterogeneous across the watershed the regional climate is considered mediterranean with average precipitation of 1500 mm yr wet and cold winters with a watershed average temperature equal to 0 c and hot and dry summers with a watershed average temperature reaching 25 c maina et al 2020a b the east taylor river watershed is representative of headwater catchments in the upper colorado basin markstrom et al 2009 with nearly 2000 km 2 the east river and taylor river form the gunnison river which in turn accounts for just under half of the colorado river s discharge at the colorado utah border the watershed has an average elevation of 3266 m with 1420 m of topographic relief and pronounced gradients in hydrology geomorphology vegetation and weather the area is defined as having a continental subarctic climate with long cold winters and short cool summers the watershed has a mean annual temperature of 0 c with average minimum and maximum temperatures of 9 2 and 9 8 c respectively in winter and summer seasons the east taylor watershed receives an average of 1200 mm yr 1 of precipitation the majority of which falls as snow hubbard et al 2018 the smith river is the only coastal river that is evaluated in this study it flows from the klamath mountains to the pacific ocean in del norte county in extreme northwestern california on the west coast of the united states the river is 40 4 km long its watershed catchment area is 1 860 km 2 without no major dams or human activities the climate in smith river is a typical mediterranean regime with most precipitation falling in winter and approximately 60 of the year s total average precipitation occurring in the four month period from november to march smith river is the wettest human inhabited spot in the state of california with the average annual precipitation amount of 1873 mm however very little snow falls as its daily mean temperature is moderate and ranges from 9 0 c in february and 16 0 c in july 2 4 reference hydrological models and reference datasets the national water model nwm is a hydrologic modeling framework that simulates and forecast streamflow over the entire continental united states conus the core of the nwm system is the national center for atmospheric research ncar supported community weather research and forecasting hydrologic model wrf hydro it uses global forcing from a variety of sources and is configured to use the noah mp land surface model lsm to simulate land surface processes separate water routing modules perform diffusive wave surface routing and saturated subsurface flow routing on a 250 m grid and routing downstream along the nriver network and output streamflow simulation at the stream reaches of the national hydrography dataset nhdplusv2 united states geological survey usgs streamflow observations are assimilated into each of the four nwm analysis and assimilation configurations and all analysis and forecast configurations benefit from the inclusion of over 5 000 reservoirs in this study we use the national water model reanalysis dataset which archives the model historical outputs for 25 years from 1993 to 2017 and is publicly available at https registry opendata aws nwm archive nwm reanalysis dataset is selected as the reference hydrological modeling dataset in this study for model assessment because it is one of the most widely used operational streamflow model for at large continental scale for example the western u s it also incorporates regional climate simulation in its hydrological analyses and assimilates observations which has the similar atmosphere land coupling model framework compared to vr cesm usgs streamflow measurements at the outlets of the four focal watersheds were used to calibrate and validate the runoff simulation in this study the four usgs streamflow stations maintained long term daily river discharge measurements since the beginning of our vr cesm simulations january 1 1970 the usgs streamflow measurements are publicly available to be downloaded online 3 results 3 1 calibration and assessments the calibrated mean absolute errors maes of runoff simulations are significantly smaller than the uncalibrated runoff in comparison against usgs gauge measurements and the maximum subsurface runoff parameter varies across watersheds table 1 presents the mae of calibration and the calibrated values of r sb max for each watershed calibration of the maximum subsurface runoff parameter indicates that each watershed has unique geographical and climate conditions that dictate unique parameters the maes at watersheds in table 1 also indicate that the runoff calibration works better in the east taylor and cosumnes river watersheds than the smith river and american river watersheds fig 2 presents the monthly calibration results for most recent 10 year period 1996 2006 in our historical simulation and for the 37 year monthly average of calibrated and uncalibrated runoff simulations the uncalibrated results consistently overestimate the peak of discharge whether it occurs in the winter or summer at these watersheds while the uncalibrated and calibrated runoff are similar in the low runoff periods the calibration particularly improves projections of peak runoff in all four watersheds regardless of seasonal timing in the snow dominated american river and east taylor watersheds most precipitation falls in winter as snowfall that accumulates as snowpack while the runoff peak occurs in late spring because they are high elevation mountain watersheds significantly controlled by snow processes such as timing of snowmelt on the other hand runoff peaks are observed in winter in the smith river and cosumnes river as they are both rain dominated watersheds located in relatively low elevation mountains with more immediate responses to precipitation in both cases calibration reduces the original overestimates of these peaks the calibrated maximum subsurface runoff values r sb max are smaller than the prescribed uniform value 5 5 10 3 mm s 1 that was determined from global data and used in the cesm simulation although the value of maximum subsurface runoff r sb max depends on various factors this is consistent with physics and intuition that maximum subsurface runoff r sb max is generally smaller in the mountainous regions with steeper topographical gradient than the smooth topographical regions li et al 2014 we used vr cesm to evaluate the partition of surface and subsurface runoff in the calibrated total runoff that contributes to streamflow and found that surface runoff is nearly 30 of the total runoff in the peak runoff season indicating that approximately 70 of the peak runoff comes from the subsurface groundwater discharge however this allocation changes if f sat is also calibrated against streamflow measurement supplementary material 1 but we are not able to determine which presents the physical processes due to lack of data of surface and subsurface runoff partition we validated the calibration by comparing with usgs station measurements in the validation period 2007 2019 and the national water model during the period that nwm reanalysis datasets are available 2007 2017 the vr cesm biases of the monthly fraction of annual runoff vary geographically and seasonally as shown in fig 3 in the snow dominated watersheds american river and east taylor river vr cesm consistently overestimates the peak runoff in the snowmelt season with greater annual variability over the historical period the peak monthly runoff in vr cesm is nearly 5 of the total annual runoff or higher while simulated baseflow runoff is relatively low compared to the national water model and usgs station measurements this indicates that quantifying the uncertainties in snow processes and understanding its impacts on runoff generation are the key for hydrological analysis in these snow dominated watersheds on the other hand vr cesm runoff simulation has less difference in the rain dominated cosumnes river and smith river watersheds the peak runoff in vr cesm is similar to that of the national water model and the usgs measurement at about 2 3 of the total annual runoff overall vr cesm biases generally decrease as the amount of monthly runoff decreases in general the timing and magnitude of runoff are appropriately simulated in vr cesm with the assessment of nwm and usgs station measurements further analyses presented in this paper are based on our calibrated version of the model unless otherwise noted overall the calibrated runoff matches reasonably well with the usgs station measurements in the validation period particularly in the baseflow estimation we also observed that the runoff spikes have larger uncertainties and are overestimated in the snow dominated watersheds 3 2 assessments of climate change impacts on total runoff through 2050 the potential impacts of climate change on hydrology vary across watersheds likely due to their varied geographies and climate patterns table 2 indicates that the mean annual runoff in the american and smith rivers remains stable during all periods but 7 15 and 25 increases are observed in the east taylor and cosumnes river watersheds respectively when comparing the projection 2020 2050 and validation 2007 2019 periods against the historical period 1970 2006 in addition to the increasing trend of mean annual average runoff the timing and magnitude of peak monthly average daily runoff in these watersheds can also vary over time for example peak runoff increases in the rain dominated cosumnes and smith river watersheds and decreases or stays similar in snow dominated american and east taylor river watersheds fig 4 in contrast to the historical period projection period peak runoff in the rain dominated watersheds increases approximately 20 in smith river and as high as 60 in the cosumnes river suggesting that the increasing runoff in the projection period is mostly added in the peak and thus increases risk of flooding in the future these peaks are also more pronounced in the future and shift forward one month in the smith river on the other hand the peak runoff is observed in late spring and decreases nearly 30 in the snow dominated american river while winter baseflow increases significantly in the projection period potentially due to smaller snow rain ratios and higher snowmelt compared to other watersheds a smaller increase in peak runoff is simulated in the east taylor watershed between the historical and projection periods as a result of changing temperature impacts on precipitation and snow to better understand the differences in runoff generation across these watersheds we further evaluate potential climate change impacts on precipitation and snow correlation coefficients between calibrated runoff simulation and meteorological variables precipitation snow water equivalent and daily average temperature with lags from 0 to 11 months are computed to help quantitative analysis of the causes of runoff changes supplementary material 2 the change of precipitation between the historical and projection periods varies among watersheds table 2 shows that daily average precipitation slightly decreases 7 in american river and remains the same in smith river but increases approximately 6 in the east taylor watershed and 16 in the cosumnes river watershed fig 5 shows the simulated accumulated precipitation in the four watersheds during the historical validation and projection periods although the detailed discussion of changing precipitation is beyond the scope of this paper these annual changes are due mainly to seasonally dependent changes in the magnitude of monthly precipitation and vary among watersheds precipitation increases mostly during summer in the east taylor watershed in colorado likely due to summer thunderstorms hubbard et al 2018 carroll et al 2020 as a result increasing precipitation does not change the magnitude of runoff peaks in the late spring and early summer in the east taylor watershed uniquely east taylor watershed in the upper colorado river has similar average monthly precipitation year round because it is jointly affected by water vapor from the pacific and the summer monsoon coming from the gulf of mexico hubbard et al 2018 carroll et al 2020 on the other hand significantly increasing precipitation in the winter and spring rainy season is found in the cosumnes river that partially contributes to the higher simulated runoff from january to april in the projection period in the american watershed the decrease in precipitation also occurs in winter which may contribute to less snowpack less summer snowmelt and a lower peak spring runoff temperature plays an important role in the amount and type of precipitation the ratios between rain and snow and can significantly affect the magnitude and timing of runoff at different geographical locations different from most hydrological modeling and analysis studies where temperature is a forcing dataset temperature is simulated in vr cesm in the coupled atmosphere and land surface models increasing temperature in the projection period compared to the historical period is consistently observed in all four watersheds throughout the year fig 6 the difference from the historical period is similar across seasons with an average increase of 1 degree in the recent validation period and an average increase of more than 2 degrees in the projection period future changes in simulated snow water equivalent swe fig 7 are related to both the temperature increases and changes in precipitation this leads to more dramatic swe changes than for total precipitation and also contributes to the projected changes in runoff fig 4 the average peak historical swe in the american river watershed is 700 mm in march and is nearly 50 of the accumulated precipitation since the beginning of water year during the future period this peak diminishes to only 400 mm or 28 of the accumulated precipitation and this peak is shifted one month sooner to february this nearly 40 swe decrease in winter and one month earlier start of snowmelt contribute to changes in magnitude and timing of runoff in the american watershed fig 4 this indicates that climate change has significant impacts on the snow and hydrological process in the cascade mountain regions where the majority of precipitation falls in winter and changing snowpack accumulation and snowmelt in spring play an important roles in runoff generation surprisingly swe is projected to be similar between the historical and future periods in the east taylor watershed under climate change which has the highest elevation among all four watersheds this has been reported by several climate projection studies e g ullrich et al 2018 wu et al 2017 showing little change or even increasing swe in high elevations because of increasing precipitation and water vapor transported from the ocean these studies report that although temperature increases in the mountains in the projection the daily maximum temperature still remains below freezing point so that snowpack does not melt in winter although swe is not projected to decrease warming temperatures and increased precipitation could lead to early snowmelt and thus higher runoff in the spring fig 4 in the two rain dominated watersheds the cosumnes and smith rivers swe is small compared to the other two watersheds and thus has less influence on streamflow but 50 60 swe decreases in the cosumnes river and 80 decreases in the smith river may still contribute to higher winter runoff peaks as precipitation may be falling as rain rather than snow figs 4 and 7 the swe peaks also shift earlier in the year for these two watersheds which may influence runoff timing 3 3 extreme events fig 8 shows the monthly distribution and changing temporal pattern of the 95th percentile of daily runoff r95 a widely used indicator of flood risk khomsi et al 2016 allen et al 2011 mishra and shah 2018 in the comparison to usgs streamflow measurements total runoff is generally overestimated by vr cesm during peak flow seasons across the watersheds the season of highest r95 almost always coincides with the season of peak flow for both vr cesm and the gauge measurements refgroupfig reffig monthlytestingprojection during non peak flow seasons vr cesm better estimates the r95 value but the model doesn t always agree with the measurements on the month of peak flow as the uncertainties can be higher for example 95th percentile runoff at the snowmelt season from april to june are nearly 80 higher than the usgs station measurements in the american river watershed while their differences are small during late summer and fall dry seasons corresponding with potential changes in runoff associated with the changing of snowfall and early snowmelt in these watersheds future monthly r95 can be either higher or lower than the during the historical period in both american river and cosumnes river watersheds the projected r95 increases approximately 30 from december to march indicating that increasing precipitation and higher rain snow ratio in winter could potentially amplify the risk of flooding events in winter in american river watershed the projected r95 decreases in may and june due to earlier snowmelt the future r95 in east taylor watershed is higher than in the historical period from april to june as east taylor is located at higher elevation with later snowmelt thus shifting the risk of extreme runoff in spring the smith river r95 does not change much between historical and future periods likely because projected precipitation does not change significantly and it is a rain dominated watershed with little impact from snow this implies that the extreme analysis of climate model and hydrological outputs are complicated and challenging with many conditions to be considered higher interannual variability of annual average daily runoff is also indicative of increases in both wet and dry extreme events table 2 shows that the standard deviation of annual average daily runoff increases over time in all four watersheds with future values ranging from 14 in the american river to as great as 71 in the cosumnes river with respect to the historical period similarly the 95th percentile of annual average daily runoff is projected to be higher in the future than during the historical period in all four watersheds fig 10 presents the annual time series of the watershed budgets interannual variability in runoff is driven by precipitation with et being more stable over time residual values computed as precipitation minus total runoff minus et indicate incomplete budget closure due to simplified model processes that do not fully account for things such as changing levels of ground water storage for the rain dominated watersheds more years with extreme runoff are projected to occur during the future the counts of extreme runoff years defined as the annual average runoff beyond the mean standard deviation extreme wet or mean standard deviation extreme dry of the 37 year historical period 1970 2006 are computed in the projection period with the same 37 year interval 2014 2050 to evaluate the climate change impacts on extremes table 5 in the cosumnes river watershed the frequency of extreme wet dry years was estimated to be higher lower in the projection period compared to historical period similarly in the east taylor river watershed there are 7 extreme wet years in the historical period but 11 years in the projection period in smith river the counts of extreme wet and dry years both increased in the projection indicating grater interannual variability due to climate change in these two watersheds greater interannual variability and more years with extremely high annual average daily runoff are mostly relative to the similar changes in the precipitation patterns as total runoff subsurface runoff surface runoff is as large as 70 80 of the total precipitation in the water budget on the other hand the number of extremely high annual average daily runoff years does not change significantly in the american river watershed the count of extreme wet dry years in this watershed decreases increases in the projection period partially due to less precipitation overall daily runoff generally shows greater future variability at monthly and annual temporal scales with changing precipitation and snow indicating the potential for increased occurrence of extreme events and dry and wet years 3 4 regional scale watersheds water budget to assess more regional scale hydrological projects we looked at the annual average daily water budget components fig 9 of the four usgs huc hydrological unit code 2 level watersheds in the western u s the california pacific northwest upper colorado and lower colorado river watersheds fig 1 these larger scale watersheds are highly managed with dams canals and pumping activities that are not simulated by vr cesm as a result station measurements are not applicable for calibrating the subsurface runoff as for the smaller mountainous watersheds nor can the previously calibrated maximum subsurface runoff values can be appropriately applied in the larger scale due to the heterogeneity of topography and soil characteristics therefore the uncalibrated simulations are used in this regional scale water budget analysis although runoff is overestimated vr cesm model outputs are still able to provide a relative estimation of each component in the water budget and evaluate climate change impacts table 3 shows increasing annual average daily runoff over time in most of the western u s except for relatively little change in the pacific northwest a majority of precipitation becomes et in the upper and lower colorado river watersheds while et is only approximately 30 in the pacific northwest and california watersheds overall as more precipitation goes to runoff in the california and pacific northwest watersheds and the precipitation variability increases in the future these two watersheds show greater variability in runoff in the future with the standard deviation of annual average daily runoff increasing 82 and 16 respectively in between the historical and projection periods table 3 with respect to the 95th percentile annual average daily runoff there is a 47 increase in california and 32 increase in the lower colorado between the historical and future periods but little chanege in the other two watersheds between these periods table 3 similarly to the extreme analysis in the small four watersheds in the western u s the counts of wet and dry extreme runoff years were computed to evaluate the frequency of extreme events table 6 in watersheds other than the pacific northwest counts of the extreme wet years are double in the projection period while the numbers of extreme dry years are significantly decreased compared to the historical period increasing frequency of extremely high annual average runoff is related to higher precipitation for example in the california watershed where 18 years in the projection period are extreme wet years based on the threshold defined in the historical period with only 7 extreme wet years in the pacific northwest however there are only slight decreases in the number of extreme wet and dry years likely because the average annual precipitation does not change much between historical and projection periods but the variability does this is consistent with the extreme analysis in the previous subsection and implies that the possibility of climate and hydrological extremes increases in the future in most watersheds these increases in extremes may lead to increases in floods or droughts a similar analysis in four usgs huc2 scale regions in china china coastal hai river yangtze river and yellow river shows different impacts across watersheds of projected climate change on the annual average daily water budget similar to the coastal watersheds in the western u s table 4 indicates that annual average daily runoff increases by 33 and 18 in the china coastal and yangtze river watersheds respectively between the historical and projection periods the annual water budget presented in fig 11 clearly indicates that the china coastal region and yangtze river also have higher precipitation and et in the projection period in comparison with the historical period the china coastal region shows 91 higher standard deviation and 47 higher 95th percentile annual average daily runoff in the projection period table 4 indicating greater variability and higher possibility of extreme runoff events under a changing climate similarly to the extreme analysis in the western u s the china coastal yangzte river and yellow river watersheds have 19 16 and 9 extreme wet years in the projection respectively compared to the 6 5 and 5 years in the historical period table 6 the counts of extreme dry years in these watersheds are also smaller in the projection period indicating less potential for drought but higher possibility of flooding hazards under a changing climate the annual variability of each water component particularly the runoff also increases with time in those three watersheds both the mean and standard deviation of annual average daily runoff and precipitation in the hai river watershed which has an arid climate do not vary much with time and et is water limited and does not increase as much as in the yangtze river and china coastal regions in general most of the watersheds in china also exhibit changes in the annual water budget due to projected climate change 4 conclusion in this study we evaluated an application of a variable resolution global climate model vr cesm in varied size watersheds in the western u s the simulated runoffs for four unmanaged watersheds are calibrated against discharge measurements and compared to another hydrological model the impacts of climate change on precipitation snowpack and runoff as well as extreme runoff events in those watersheds are evaluated based on historical and rcp8 5 simulations furthermore we quantified the water budget components in larger scale watersheds in the western u s and china and evaluated their annual variability and potential climate change impacts our major conclusions are listed as follows 1 this study demonstrates the viability of applying fine resolution gcms for unmanaged watershed scale hydrological analysis with careful calibration this is promising for future hydrological analyses that include two way feedbacks between the atmosphere and the surface the implication is that this approach can be used by other climate model and land surface model applications at similar resolution and scales to evaluate the hydrological response to atmospheric forcing particularly for addressing impacts under climate change 2 this study used uggs streamflow gauge measurements to quantify the uncertainties of parameterizations in the runoff generation schemes while the uncertainties of meteorological variables were evaluated in a previous study xu et al 2021 for vr cesm the uncertainty in total runoff was considerably reduced by calibrating the maximum subsurface runoff parameter r sb max against usgs gauge measurements 3 the impacts of climate change on hydrology vary in snow dominated and rain dominated watersheds this is largely due to the interacting effects of changes in precipitation and temperature in snow dominated watersheds decreasing snowpack and early snowmelt shifts runoff peaks earlier and reduces their magnitude supplementary material 2 in the rain dominated watersheds with increasing precipitation in the projection period peak runoff increases in the wet season 4 potential climate change also affects the magnitude of extreme runoff events in snow dominated watersheds early snowmelt increases the potential for high runoff events in spring while in rain dominated watersheds more intense precipitation in winter increases the potential for high runoff events in winter increased variation of annual average runoff and increasing precipitation in the water budget over time also indicates the potential for more extremely dry and extremely wet periods 5 in regional scale watersheds in the western u s and china vr cesm generally projects increasing precipitation and runoff through the middle of this century particularly in the coastal watersheds that receive more moisture from the ocean larger interannual variability and higher frequency of wet and dry years are projected for the future for most of the watersheds indicating that climate change could affect the occurrence of extreme hydrological events thus potentially increase the risks of arising geohazards the increasing number of refined resolution and or variable resolution gcm applications provide significant amounts of data for evaluating the hydrological processes and investigating water budgets in watersheds with careful calibration against observation and assessment of the uncertainties in

4334,long term streamflow forecasting for a multisite river basin system can experience oscillation of spatio temporal dependent forecast errors characterizing the dependent information and conducting spatio temporal dependent forecast error correction can reduce the total uncertainty in real time forecasting on the basis of a single site martingale model of forecast evolution mmfe which can simulate forecast uncertainty evolution over the temporal scale this study developed a dynamic long term streamflow probabilistic forecasting model that addresses spatio temporal dependent error correction for a multisite system error characteristics and hybrid spatio temporal forecast improvements with complex dependencies are captured by copula function which describes the systemwide evolution of forecast uncertainty the proposed model was verified by forecasting the streamflow of the hongze lake luoma lake system in china the results revealed the following 1 the spatio temporal dependent error correction based on mmfe can refine the spatio temporal dimension hybrid error information which is helpful in improving forecast accuracy 2 as the spatio temporal dependence of forecast uncertainty is described using a copula function selection of the marginal distribution and connection function is flexible through combining statistical and informational characteristics of the errors which is helpful in improving the fittedness of complex system error simulation 3 compared with the benchmark forecast model without correction the proposed model greatly decreased forecast uncertainty by reducing the standard deviation of the errors continuous ranked probability score crps and brier score bs by nearly 40 11 4 and 34 6 respectively and further reduce the crps by 2 1 on average highest value 3 7 and reduce the bs by 1 2 on average highest value 2 0 in comparison with only temporal correction the results demonstrate that the proposed model improves the accuracy and reliability of probabilistic streamflow forecasting for complex water resource systems by reducing uncertainty keywords long term streamflow forecast forecast uncertainties martingale model of forecast evolution spatio temporal dependent error correction 1 introduction long term streamflow forecasting which generally refers to a streamflow forecast within a lead time exceeding a month or a season feng et al 2020 can provide effective information for water resource planning and management and operation of water conservancy projects wang et al 2017 xu et al 2021 ensuring the accuracy of long term streamflow forecasts is highly important for exploration of the benefits of reservoir operation xu et al 2015 2019 in comparison with short term streamflow forecasts the climate system and precipitation process within the long term forecast horizon cannot be predicted effectively xu et al 2017 2020 which causes difficulties in building physically based forecast models with stochastic and chaotic inputs with the continuous improvement of the quantity and quality of meteorological and hydrological observation data as well as the rapid development of high performance computing and artificial intelligence techniques data driven methods have been applied as new approaches to long term streamflow forecasting data driven methods can be divided into three categories 1 simulation models based on mathematical statistics such as regressive analysis mohseni and stefan 1998 time series modeling bender and simonovic 1994 robert et al 2010 and wavelet analysis brunner and gilleland 2020 2 intelligent forecast models based on machine learning such as artificial neural networks yang et al 2017 and chaos theory lall et al 1996 and 3 decomposition ensemble forecast models based on signal decomposition and artificial intelligent giulia et al 2011 siriporn et al 2017 these methods establish the mapping function between streamflow response and input conditions through data sample mining and conduct streamflow forecast based on these functions although many earlier studies have contributed to the development of deterministic forecast models for long term streamflow sequences it is widely recognized that the perturbation of high levels of uncertainty introduced by forecast errors reduces the application value of deterministic forecasts xu et al 2020 in contrast a probabilistic forecast combined with error analysis which can provide richer information regarding the confidence range of streamflow forecasts and level of probability confidence for water resource risk analysis and decision making nester et al 2012 has become an important modeling tool for addressing uncertainties however with the increase of lead time forecast accuracy deteriorates rapidly resulting in increased uncertainty and a widened forecasting interval that greatly reduce the value of probabilistic forecasts zhao et al 2011 therefore it is critical to improve forecast accuracy by narrowing the forecasting interval without reducing forecast reliability which is often achieved through frequent updating of information and error correction si et al 2019 this approach necessitates analysis of the evolution mechanism of the uncertainties associated with forecast errors which constitutes a stochastic process identification and simulation problem improving the practical value of probabilistic forecasts by examining and preserving the statistical characteristics of the forecast errors falls within the scope of stochastic simulation modeling commonly used stochastic simulation methods include the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation technique bender and simonovic 1994 markov chain monte carlo approach bates and campbell 2001 and bayesian forecasting system krzysztofowicz 2014 the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation technique generates stochastic processes via parameter perturbation and it often requires large sample volumes for calibrating the parameter combinations which is a limitation in real time application owing to issues regarding data abundancy lin et al 2014 the markov chain monte carlo approach uses markov chains to simulate the stochastic process by preserving the state transition probability of the samples however it also has limitations regarding the dilemma between refined description of the transition matrix and sample data abundancy wu et al 2019 the bayesian forecasting system is an analysis method applicable to correction of real time streamflow error based on real time rainfall information its principal shortcoming reflects the difficulty in obtaining effective forecasted rainfall information that matches the lead time of streamflow forecasting within a long term horizon in a real time situation ajami et al 2007 the above studies generally assumed that the stochastic parameters are stationary which means that the forecast uncertainties do not change when shifted temporally lettenmaier 1984 in fact considering the effect of real time error correction the residual error sequences within the remaining time periods could update as the initial forecast time advances breaking the stationary condition and formulating dynamic stochastic processes maurer and lettenmaier 2003 this is because of the inner consistency and dependency properties of error sequences raised by cascade uncertainties within simulated hydrological processes cloke and pappenberger 2009 therefore the realization of forecast errors in the past could provide a posteriori information that has certain value for the remaining period of the streamflow forecast considering the possible influence of error correction within real time sequence simulations the martingale model of forecast evolution mmfe which introduced the concept of uncertainty evolution heath and jackson 1994 was applied to simulate dynamic stochastic demand time sequences within a supply chain numerous other applications have verified the efficacy of mmfe in capturing the temporal evolution characteristics of forecast errors liu et al 2020 zhou et al 2007 zhu et al 2017 an improved generalized mmfe framework was introduced in hydrologic research to describe the evolution of streamflow forecast uncertainties under the influence of dependent forecast updates within adjacent time periods zhao et al 2011 2013 subsequently the mmfe framework was extended with the copula function and the copula based uncertainty evolution model was proposed chen et al 2016 this model combines the advantages of mmfe and the convenience and flexibility of the copula function in modeling the joint distribution of multivariate random variables the copula function is flexible in dealing with a multivariate joint distribution simple in terms of calculation and suitable for connection of multidimensional random variables patton 2008 thus it is applicable to analysis of forecast uncertainties of different distributions and suitable for simulating forecast updates with multiperiod dependencies therefore it is used widely in the field of hydrology to describe the dependence of hydrologic features such as flood processes and rainfall runoff and it is also used for flood forecasting and drought analysis brunner et al 2019 chen et al 2016 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 lee and salas 2011 different from streamflow forecasting for a single site system the streamflow processes of a small basin with similar climatic and underlying surface conditions or of a multisite system with direct hydraulic connection preserve a certain degree of spatio temporal consistency and correlation bardossy and pegram 2009 this characteristic is fundamental to ensuring the overall accuracy of a streamflow forecast for an entire system studies on developing models for multisite streamflow forecasting began to explore the information value of spatio temporal dependence on a systemwide scale e g streamflow forecasting based on a multisite stochastic weather generator steinschneider and brown 2012 multivariate autoregressive model niedzielski 2006 and the maximum entropy copula method multisite monthly streamflow simulation hao and singh 2013 however the above models fail to consider comprehensively the characteristics of forecast error evolution under the influence of spatio temporal dependent error correction resulting in overestimation of uncertainty a number of other studies li et al 2020 si et al 2015 wang et al 2016 wood 2009 have shown that application of real time spatio temporal dependent error correction for multisite water resource systems could further reduce the overall forecast uncertainty and improve the accuracy of the systemwide simulation to further enhance the overall performance of streamflow forecasting for a multisite system this research exploited the advantages of the single site mmfe framework for dynamic stochastic simulation of error sequences and improved it for application to a multisite system through construction of a multisite streamflow stochastic simulation that considers real time forecast updating through spatio temporal dependent error correction taking into account the difficulty and high computational complexity of processing high order concurrently the copula function is used to model the joint probability density function pdf of the complex real time forecast updates the copula function is selected for its superior performance in flexible modeling and dependency description distinct from previous related work the proposed model 1 refines the spatial temporal dimension hybrid error information which is helpful in improving forecast accuracy 2 describes the spatial temporal dependence of forecast uncertainty by using copula function and selects marginal distributions and connection function through combining statistical and informational characteristics of the errors which is helpful in improving the goodness of fit of complex system error simulation 3 improves the accuracy and reliability of probabilistic streamflow forecasting for complex water resource systems by reducing uncertainty the main objectives of this study were as follows 1 to refine the spatio temporal dependent streamflow forecast updates of errors by modeling the multiscale joint pdf using a copula function within a multisite system 2 to address the dynamic evolution mechanism of forecast uncertainties within a multisite system under the influence of the spatio temporal dependent forecast error correction and 3 to propose an mmfe based long term streamflow probabilistic forecast model for reducing overall streamflow forecast uncertainties in a multisite system methodologies were verified in a two site lake system in china the hongze lake and luoma lake system for demonstrating the model performance with low computational effort and data requirement 2 study area hongze lake and luoma lake of the huai river basin china were selected as the study area for this research fig 1 hongze lake which is located in the downstream reaches of the huai river has a drainage area of 2596 km2 and maximum water storage capacity of 3 04 billion m3 it is the fourth largest freshwater lake in china and the largest storage lake in the huai river basin luoma lake which is located in the downstream reaches of the yi shu si river basin has a drainage area of 375 km2 and water storage capacity of 270 million m3 both lakes are affected primarily by the monsoon climate moreover the catchment areas of both lakes are in moist climatic regions in which the mechanism of runoff generation is saturation excess runoff generation runoff propagates and converges through crossed river networks within the region and the characteristics of runoff generation and convergence are highly similar the flood season in the study area is from june to october and the non flood season extends from november to may of the following year during the non flood season inflow to the lakes is relatively low while the water demands of the surrounding area and the east route of the south to north water diversion project are relatively high long term forecasting of the local streamflow of the two lakes is essential for informing the allocation and dispatch of water resources through reservoir operation and water diversion 3 methodology a structural flow chart of the model framework is illustrated in fig 2 section 3 1 introduces the basic concept of long term streamflow forecasting in a rolling horizon and the procedures of real time error correction section 3 2 establishes an mmfe based single site real time streamflow forecast model considering the evolution of uncertainties influenced by temporal dependent error correction section 3 3 illustrates the concept of dependent correction of multisite forecast errors and elucidates the spatio temporal evolution characteristics of forecast uncertainties under the influence of error correction section 3 4 proposes a multisite real time streamflow forecast model considering the evolution of spatio temporal dependent uncertainties section 3 5 selects two indicators with which to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the established probabilistic forecast models 3 1 dynamic long term streamflow forecast and real time error correction as the long term streamflow process reflects the integrated response of the long term hydrological cycle which is jointly affected by climatic conditions and the characteristics of runoff generation and concentration of a river basin it often presents spatio temporal persistence owing to the principle of mass balance within time and space constructing a statistical forecast model with a certain lead time based on the dependence of a time series is a conventional approach to forecasting the hydrological sequence a typical time series forecast model can be expressed as follows 1 q t f q t 1 q t 2 q t h ε t q t ε t where f represents a general forecast equation of streamflow sequence based on lag time terms q t and q t represent the observed streamflow and forecasted streamflow respectively m3 s h represents the order of the model and ε t is a random variable that represents the forecast error at time t generally the statistical parameters are calibrated by minimizing the error between historical observed streamflow with reforecasted streamflow under the assumption of stationarity the pdf of error random variables can be considered related only to t as given by 2 ε t ε t the sequence forecast for a single future time period based on observations and forecast information from the past is given by eqs 1 and 2 when ignoring the influence of ε t q t represents deterministic forecast point forecast results conversely when considering the influence of ε t q t represents stochastic forecast results with a calibrated pdf of ε t a discretized probabilistic forecast on q t l can be obtained by stochastic simulation of scenarios and superimposition on the point forecast results specifically l represents the index of simulated discretized scenarios l 1 2 l the long term plans for operation of water resource systems often require the support of streamflow forecast schemes with a long lead time which could exceed the model order h time periods zhao et al 2012 in real time forecasting with the increase of lead time it is impossible to forecast streamflow in all time periods with all observed streamflow information using eqs 1 and 2 generally some forecasted streamflow could be used recursively as given information for an extended forecast in later time periods consequently forecast errors have an accumulative effect in the process of model recursion causing a sharp increase in forecast error with lead time as shown in fig 3 a thus forecast uncertainties evolve and increase with time when a forecast system eventually falls into a chaotic system owing to accumulated uncertainties a point forecast provides limited value and a good probabilistic forecast covers a rather wide and low value range as forecast error is unavoidable in real time forecasting the method commonly used to reduce the influence of errors is a rolling forecast combined with real time error correction it can be identified as a process of data mining wherein the correction method necessitates finding the temporal dependence relationship of the error sequence for example a correction method based on the autocorrelation or other lag time function relationship of errors can estimate the error values and update the forecast error ε t by ε s t 3 ε s t ε s 1 t δ ε s 1 t 1 ε s 1 t 2 ε s 1 t τ ξ where the streamflow forecasted at time s for time t is expressed as q s t t s and the corresponding forecast error is expressed as ε s t t s τ represents the maximum dependent length of the time period for the error and ξ represents the residual of the correction equation δ therefore as shown in fig 3b with the step forward of s the updated streamflow information indicates that the observed streamflow information becomes richer which represents information that is much more valuable and reliable for real time error correction while the unknown streamflow information decreases which helps reduce the forecast uncertainties caused by the model input several studies have verified that a rolling forecast with real time error correction can change the stationarity characteristics of the error sequences and that utilizing the value of error correction and updating can improve forecast accuracy for example stochastic simulation for long term streamflow forecasting was conducted with consideration of the influence of a rolling forecast and error correction at all times to observe the effect of the evolution of uncertainties with time zhao et al 2011 2013 3 2 single site streamflow probabilistic forecast model based on temporal dependent error correction as shown in fig 3b streamflow forecasts are updated in real time as time progresses and as more hydrologic information becomes available the forecasts are updated dynamically assuming that the forecast horizon ends at time t and that current time s moves forward to s 1 the forecast q s t changes to q s 1 t whereby the difference between q s t and q s 1 t is recognized as the forecast update similarly the uncertainties evolve with time under the influence of error correction i e the difference between ε s t and ε s 1 t therefore zhao et al 2011 2013 and chen et al 2016 used mmfe to analyze such evolutions in adjacent time periods and formulated them to simulate the single site streamflow process a schematic of the evolution of forecast uncertainties formulated by mmfe is shown in fig 4 and details of the specific steps are described in the following step 1 construct the forecast improvement sequences and establish the relationship between forecast errors and their improvements considering real time correction in a dynamic rolling forecast process the forecast improvement w s t can be defined as the difference between the forecast errors of two adjacent time periods as given by 4 w s t q s t q s 1 t ε s t ε s 1 t δ ε s 1 t 1 ε s 1 t 2 ε s 1 t τ ξ if it is assumed that the forecast at the current time is perfect i e 5 ε t t 0 then similar to eq 4 the relationship between ε s t and w s t can be formulated as follows 6 ε t t 0 ε t 1 t ε t t w t t w t t ε t 2 t ε t 1 t w t 1 t w t t w t 1 t ε t h t ε t h 1 t w t h 1 t j t h 1 t w j t by incorporating eq 6 into eq 4 q s t can be formulated with q t and w s t 7 q t t q t q t 1 t q t w t t q t 2 t q t w t t w t 1 t q t h t q t j t h 1 t w j t as shown in eq 6 the forecast errors can be divided into forecast improvements in the decomposed time periods and the forecast is given by eq 7 as q t in eq 7 cannot be observed at time s it can be replaced by point forecast q t when applied to a real time forecast step 2 description of stochastic process of the forecast improvement sequences a vector w s is constructed to represent the aggregate of forecast improvements for different time at time s 8 w s w s s w s s 1 w s s h 1 the statistical characteristics of w s can be described by the variance covariance matrix of w s 9 vc v s var w s 1 s 1 cov 1 2 cov 1 h cov 2 1 var w s 2 s 2 cov 2 h cov h 1 cov h 2 var w s h s h where var represents the variance functions and cov i j represents the covariance between w s s i 1 and w s s j 1 according to eq 6 the evolution of the forecast errors can be described as follows 10 var ε t h t i 1 i h var w t i 1 t 2 1 i j h cov i j 11 var ε s s h i 1 i h var w s i s h 2 1 i j h cov i j similarly a vector w t is constructed to represent the series of the forecast improvements at different times for time t 12 w t w t h 1 t w t h 2 t w t t noting that w t and w s have the same combination of column vectors in various arrangements the statistical properties of the two vectors are the same thus the statistical properties of w s s i 1 s 1 2 t i 1 2 h may also be described by the variance covariance matrix of w t 13 vc v t var w s h s h cov h h 1 cov h 1 cov h 1 h var w s h 1 s h 1 cov h 1 1 cov 1 h cov 1 h 1 var w s s step 3 stochastic sampling of scenario sequences of forecast improvement and the generation of a streamflow probabilistic forecast zhao et al 2011 initially assumed that w s s i 1 s 1 2 t i 1 2 h has normal distribution with a given vc v t stochastic sampling based on cholesky decomposition can be used to generate scenario sequences of forecast improvement as characterized below 14 vc v t v v t 15 w t h 1 t w t h 2 t w t t y 1 y 2 y h v t where y 1 y 2 y h is an h dimensional independently and identically normal distributed vector of random variables and the scenario sequences of forecast improvement are as follows 16 w s t l w t h 1 t 1 w t h 2 t 1 w t t 1 w t h 1 t 2 w t h 2 t 2 w t t 2 w t h 1 t l w t h 2 t l w t t l where l represents the number of scenarios thus the streamflow probabilistic forecast scenarios can be generated by the following 17 q s t l q s t i t h 1 t w i t 1 q s t i t h 1 t w i t 2 q s t i t h 1 t w i t l where q represents the scenarios of the streamflow probabilistic forecast as forecast errors tend to be biased and do not have normal distributions in real world applications the complexity of modeling is increased the copula function is a reliable method for building a joint probability distribution of multivariate random variables peng et al 2017 it does not require a consistent formulation of marginal distributions and it can treat the nonlinear and asymmetric dependence between random variables bardossy and pegram 2009 with high flexibility according to sklar s theorem if there is a multivariate random variable x 1 x 2 x n with joint distribution function f x 1 x 2 x n for which f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n represent the marginal distribution function then there is a copula function c that satisfies the following equation 18 f x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n if f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n is continuous function c is unique after selecting suitable marginal distributions of each column vector the copula function c can be calibrated according to the results of vc v t and the scenario sequences of forecast improvement can be sampled using inverse conditional probability sampling of the multivariate random variable based on the selected copula function the specific steps are as follows 1 for given n dimensional random variables select the optimal distribution to fit the marginal distribution of each random variable according to maximum likelihood function convert each dimensional variable x i into the quantile of the corresponding marginal distribution f x i 2 select the appropriate copula function and calibrate its parameters according to the maximum likelihood function then the function c has been determined 3 divide the 0 1 interval into n sub intervals randomly sample a number in each sub interval and n numbers are obtained by this way denoted as a i 1 a i 2 a i n i 1 2 n and the random number from a 1 1 to a n n are obtained by the same way therefore the sample y 1 j y 2 j y n j j 1 2 n can be obtained by the conditional probability distribution 19 p x 1 y 1 j x 2 a 2 j x 3 a 3 j x n a n j c y 1 j a 2 j a n j c a 2 j a n j p x 2 y 2 j x 1 y 1 j x 3 a

variables the scenario sequences of forecast improvement can be sampled by their own inverse cumulative distribution probability f 1 y i j 3 3 multisite streamflow probabilistic forecast model based on spatio temporal dependent error correction in the process of multisite streamflow forecasting the forecast uncertainties often present complex dependent properties owing to the similarity in forecast model formulation i e similar streamflow information model structures and parameters for example in persistently dry or wet streamflow conditions over several time periods multiperiod temporal dependent uncertainties could exist in the case of spatially synchronized streamflow conditions over multiple sites biased streamflow forecasts over the sites could result in positive spatial dependent errors implementation of joint error correction through consideration of the complicated spatio temporal dependence of uncertainties could further improve the accuracy of multisite system forecasts an mmfe based streamflow forecasting model that considers the evolution characteristics of the spatio temporal dependent forecast uncertainties can be established as described in the following steps step 1 construct the multidimensional forecast improvement sequences and establish the relationship between forecast errors and their improvements as forecast error sequences ε s t j j 1 2 k are given by the difference of forecast value q s t j and observed value q t ε s t j q t q s t j where k represents the number of sites the forecast improvements of each site j can be expressed as follows 20 w s t j ε s t j ε s 1 t j similarly in comparison with eqs 6 and 7 the equations can be given as follows 21 ε t t j 0 ε t 1 t j ε t t j w t t j w t t j ε t 2 t j ε t 1 t j w t 1 t j w t t j w t 1 t j ε t h t j ε t h 1 t j w t h 1 t j l t h 1 t w l t j 22 q t t j q t j q t 1 t j q t j w t t j q t 2 t j q t j w t t j w t 1 t j q t h t j q t j l t h 1 t w l t j step 2 description of stochastic process of multidimensional forecast improvement sequences to further consider the spatio temporal correlation of forecast uncertainties a kh dimensional vector u s is constructed to represent the aggregate of the forecast improvements of different sites at time s 23 u s w s s 1 w s s 1 1 w s s h 1 1 w s 1 w s s 2 w s s 1 2 w s s h 1 2 w s 2 w s s k w s s 1 k w s s h 1 k w s k therefore for the given vector u s it can be regarded as a kh dimensional multivariate random variable x as shown in fig 5 where each column vector represents one of the unary random variables moreover in a rolling forecast scenario considering the step forward of time s to t t s h the vector u s should be extended as follows 24 u w s s 1 w s s 1 1 w s t 1 w s 1 w s 1 s 1 1 w s s 2 1 w s 1 t 1 w s 1 1 w t t 1 w t 1 site 1 forecast horizon from time s to t w s s k w s s 1 k w s t k w s k w s 1 s 1 k w s s 2 k w s 1 t k w s 1 k w t t k w t k site k forecast horizon from time s to t as shown in fig 6 the variance covariance matrix u is used to describe such complex spatio temporal hybrid correlations each blue submatrix in the main diagonal of u represents the temporal correlation of forecast improvements with the step forward of the forecast beginning time at a single site and the yellow submatrices outside of the main diagonal of u denote the spatio temporal correlations at different sites to fully consider the complex dependence of multivariate random variables and the varied tail dependence of the spatio temporal forecast improvements the description of multivariate random variables is based on the copula function the copula function is used because it not only determines the appropriate marginal distribution for describing the temporal evolution of the forecast improvement but also finely formulates the spatial information step 3 stochastic sampling of scenario sequences of multidimensional forecast improvement the stochastic sampling is based on sampling of the copula based multivariate random variables which is essentially the inverse conditional probability sampling of the multivariate random variables according to step 2 in section 3 2 the abovementioned stochastic sampling of the multivariate random variables based on the copula function can be used to sample u 3 4 multisite real time streamflow probabilistic forecast similar to step 3 in section 3 2 an appropriate copula function is chosen to describe the joint distribution of u and perform stochastic sampling to construct a discrete stochastic process the scenario of sequences of multisite probabilistic forecasts and their improvements are given as follows 25 w s t k l w t h 1 t 1 1 w t h 2 t 1 1 w t t 1 1 w t h 1 t 1 2 w t h 2 t 1 2 w t t 1 2 w t h 1 t 1 l w t h 2 t 1 l w t t 1 l w t h 1 t k l w t h 2 t k l w t t k l 26 q s t k l q s t 1 i t h 1 t w i t 1 1 q s t 1 i t h 1 t w i t 1 2 q s t 1 i t h 1 t w i t 1 l q s t k i t h 1 t w i t k l thereafter multisite real time streamflow probabilistic forecasts with consideration of the evolution characteristics of spatio temporal dependent error correction can be obtained 3 5 evaluation indicators of the probabilistic forecast for a probabilistic forecast the accuracy and reliability of the forecast should be evaluated accuracy refers to the closeness of a certain quantile e g the median q 50 or the mean of the probabilistic forecast to the observed value and studies usually use the root mean square error or the continuous ranked probability score crps for evaluation purposes reliability refers to the ability of the confidence interval of the probabilistic forecast to cover the observed value and metrics such as interval dispersion and coverage are used for evaluation purposes additionally the brier score bs can also be used to examine forecast reliability by identifying whether the observed streamflow is covered by the confidence range of the probabilistic streamflow forecast brier 1950 in this study both the crps and the bs were selected for evaluation of the streamflow rolling probabilistic forecast model the crps is an evaluation indicator commonly used to evaluate the accuracy of a probabilistic forecast and it is also one of the most widely used measures of accuracy in probability forecasting gneiting and raftery 2007 the formula for crps calculation is as follows 27 c r p s f y f x h x y 2 d x where f x represents the cumulative distribution function of the probabilistic forecast y represents the true value of the variable to be forecasted and h x y is a heaviside function 28 h x y 1 x y 0 x y as shown in fig 7 a good probability forecast is supposed to approximate the true pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf of the observation additionally a narrower value of the crps indicates a better forecast the bs is applicable to a task in which predictions must assign probabilities to a set of mutually exclusive discrete outcomes or classes it is the average gap i e mean squared difference between forecast probabilities and actual outcomes the bs can be decomposed into three additive components uncertainties reliability and resolution murphy 1973 the uncertainties term denoted as unc measures the inherent uncertainties in the outcomes of the event the reliability term denoted as rel measures the closeness of the forecast probabilities to the true probabilities given that forecast and the resolution term denoted as res measures by how much the conditional probabilities differ from the average given the different forecasts the most common formulation of the bs is as follows 29 bs 1 r i 1 r p i o i 2 1 r i 1 n r i p i o i 2 1 r i 1 r r i o i o 2 o 1 o r e l r e s u n c where p i represents the probability that was predicted o i represents the actual outcome of the event at instance i o i 0 if it does not happen and o i 1 if it does happen r is the number of predicting instances r i represents the number of forecasts with the same probability category and o i represents the observed frequency given the forecasts with probability p i therefore the lower the bs value for a set of predictions the better the predictions are calibrated ferro 2007 4 case study 4 1 overview of the multisite system water can be diverted between the two lakes through the xuhong river and via the grand canal with controlled outflow and water diversion the two lakes can be regarded as two reservoirs with hydraulic connection fig 8 as a transit lake of the east route of the south to north water diversion project the two lakes are also involved in the task of transporting water from the yangtze river along the grand canal and parallel river channels northward to shandong province the accuracy of long term forecasting of streamflow between the two lakes will not only affect the water supply situation of the surrounding areas but also benefit the south to north water diversion project therefore based on historical data of annual streamflow this research considered different representative hydrological years to reforecast monthly streamflow during the non flood season i e the season of water diversion according to monthly historical inflow data of the two lakes three types of hydrological year were selected a dry year 1982 1983 a normal year 1994 1995 and a wet year 2008 2009 4 2 analysis of streamflow forecast errors and forecast improvement 4 2 1 deterministic time series forecast and error analysis this study used an autoregressive moving average arma model to produce monthly streamflow deterministic forecasts of the two lakes on the basis of which the corresponding forecast errors and improvement sequences were determined the arma model is a combination of an autoregressive ar model and a moving average model ma for example when the order of ar is m the order of ma is n i e arma m n and the structure of arma m n can be expressed as follows 30 x t φ 0 φ 1 x t 1 φ m x t m θ 1 ε t 1 θ n ε t n where x t x t 1 x t m is the m order streamflow time series ε t ε t 1 ε t n is the n order white noise sequence with a mean value of 0 and constant variance φ 0 φ m are ar coefficients and θ 1 θ n are ma coefficients box et al 2015 generally speaking only those sequence that is stochastic and have a close correlation can they be used for modeling by arma model to mine the effective information in historical data and predict future development the results table 1 show a great huge relation between the successive months in non flood season which is suitable for modeling by arma model as monthly streamflow has obvious periodicity and does not meet the assumption of stationarity required by the arma model the streamflow sequences q t were deseasonalized and differentially processed as sequences q t for application of the model therefore the ar integrated ma model arima was established which is a combination of the arma and the difference processes for the order selection the akaike information criterion aic is proposed to estimate the model order aic is used to compare different possible models and determine which one is the best fit for the data sakamoto et al 1986 it is denoted as 31 a i c num 2 n u m 2 ln l num where num represents the number of orders and l is the likelihood function the less aic is the better data fitted and the better model constructed shibata 1976 the result of aic illustrate arima 2 1 2 is better for modeling the hongze lake while arima 4 1 1 is better for modeling the luoma lake besides the truncation characteristics of the autodependence coefficient ac and the partial ac pac of the processed sequence is also a useful way to select the order of model the order selection result table 2 and fig 9 by this method is same as aic therefore ultimately the arima 2 1 2 and the arima 4 1 1 were selected for deterministic forecasting of two lakes the ordinary least squares method is used to determine the parameters of the model orders such that the model can pass the test of white noise and goodness of fit therefore the selected arima models can be expressed as follows the ordinary least squares method is used to determine the parameters of the model orders such that the model can pass the test of white noise and goodness of fit the selected arima models can be expressed as follows hongze lake 32 q t 0 137 q t 1 0 441 q t 2 0 251 ε t 0 749 ε t 1 luoma lake 33 q t 0 457 q t 1 0 023 q t 2 0 036 q t 3 0 092 q t 4 0 903 ε t the results of the forecast model are calculated according to the calibrated parameters of each order and the streamflow forecasts are obtained after reconstruction which is the reverse step of the deseasonalization and difference processes following which the forecast errors sequence ε s t k and the forecast improvements sequence w s t k can be obtained tables 3 and 4 present the temporal evolution and dynamic changes of the forecast uncertainties represented by standard deviation of ε s t k of the two lakes the forecast uncertainties generally present a gradual trend of increase with the increase of lead time 4 2 2 analysis of correlation characteristics and evolution of forecast uncertainties in accordance with the analysis in section 3 3 the forecast improvements sequence w s t k can be described accurately by the multivariate random variable description method based on the copula function the fitting accuracy of the marginal distribution will directly affect the description accuracy of the multivariate random variable we used the kolmogorov smirnov k s test to examine the normality of the forecast improvement sequences of the two lakes as shown in tables 5 and 6 the tested results of the marginal distributions of the forecast improvements mostly satisfy non normal distribution in statistics kernel density estimation kde is a nonparametric approach for estimation of the pdf of a random variable parzen 1962 rosenblatt 1956 one of the most well known applications of kde is the estimation of the class conditional marginal densities of data when using a naive bayes classifier piryonesi and el diraby 2020 ziegel 2010 which can improve its prediction accuracy various kernel functions such as uniform triangular biweight triweight epanechnikov and normal are widely used although the last is used most often therefore the normal kernel function pdf was selected to fit the forecast improvement distributions for those samples that failed the k s test such that the fittedness of the marginal distributions was optimized as shown in table 7 and 8 considering the complexity of the multidimensional joint distribution the gaussian copula function was selected to describe the joint distribution of the forecast improvements while the maximum likelihood method was used to calibrate the parameters of the copula function and scenario sequences of forecast improvement were generated on the basis of the calibrated parameters heat maps of the dependence coefficient matrix between the sequence samples and the generated scenarios of the forecast improvement in january are shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the trends of the two graphs are consistent while the main diagonals of the matrices are largely similar therefore it can be considered that the gaussian copula function and its parameters can satisfactorily retain the dependence of the sample sequences additionally it can be seen from fig 10 that the values of the dependence coefficients of each order near the main diagonal of the matrix are almost all 0 6 indicating high temporal dependence in the lower left and upper right areas of the matrix the dependence coefficients can also reach values of 0 2 and most are 0 4 indicating that the spatial dependence between the two lakes cannot be ignored therefore real time correction should consider the spatio temporal dependencies 4 3 long term real time streamflow probabilistic forecast the scenario describing the sequence probabilistic forecasting of the non flood period of the two lakes can be generated by rolling deterministic forecasting based on the arima model in combination with the scenario sequence of forecast improvements generated in section 3 2 according to eq 27 which is a forecast model that considers both temporal and spatial information of the uncertainties denoted as forecast model c meanwhile two benchmark forecast models denoted as forecast model a and forecast model b were also established model a produces a forecast without error correction using only the calibrated arima model whereas model b produces a forecast considering only the temporal dependent error correction tables 9 and 10 compare the statistical characteristics of forecast improvements generated by the different forecast models the bolded figures means that it is closer to the sample and the results show that the statistics of the generated scenarios from model c are closer than those from model b to the statistical characteristics of the original sample which means that error correction considering the spatio temporal evolution and dependence characteristics of the forecast uncertainties can be more effective in preserving the statistical characteristics the results of the reforecasts produced by the different forecast models in simulating the calibration sample sets are shown in figs 11 and 12 the x axis refers to the number of time periods which includes the 7 months in non flood season of 55 years and the lead time is 1 month in the case of the long series forecast scenario in comparison with model a model c greatly reduces the standard deviation of the forecast error for both hongze lake and luoma lake i e by 40 4 and 36 6 with slight reduction in forecast reliability of 7 7 and 7 4 respectively the results of the rolling reforecasts produced by the different forecast models in simulating the validation sample sets are shown in figs 13 15 in all hydrological years the confidence range of model c is reduced further than that of model b moreover the reliability is not changed significantly indicating that the spatio temporal dependent correction performs better than correction considering only temporal dependencies from tables 11 and 12 which compare the two selected indicators between different forecast models it can be seen that model c has greater improvement in forecast accuracy and reliability than the other models e g the crps is reduced at least by 2 1 compared with model b and 11 4 compared with model a when the lead time exceeds the effective forecast period the reduction is 15 4 with the highest value of 21 0 in forecast of 7 months similarly the bs is reduced at least by 1 2 compared with model b and 34 6 compared with model a with any lead time moreover when the lead time exceeds the effective forecast period the reduction is 29 8 with the highest value of 59 3 compared with model a however it is evident that both indicators show an increasing trend with the increase of lead time indicating a gradual decrease in forecast accuracy 5 conclusions and discussion long term real time streamflow probabilistic forecasting for river basins provide an important basis for risk assessment and decision making related to water resource management probabilistic forecasting considering real time error correction is an effective method for improving the accuracy of forecasts and reducing uncertainties in a multisite system further utilizing spatio temporal dependent error information to correct forecasts could result in better overall reduction of forecast uncertainty this study proposed a martingale model of forecast evolution mmfe based dynamic long term streamflow probabilistic forecasting model for a multisite system that addresses the coevolution of multisite forecast errors over time the kernel function is used to estimate the marginal distributions of the forecast errors and the gaussian copula function is used to establish a multivariate joint probability function of the hybrid spatio temporal dependencies of forecast improvements the hongze lake luoma lake system in china was selected as a study case and the main conclusions are summarized below 1 the spatio temporal dependent error correction based on mmfe can simultaneously consider the high order and hybrid dependent characteristics the error sequences are considered comprehensively which both refines the error information over the temporal scale and enriches the information over the spatial scale 2 a copula function is used to describe the spatio temporal dependence of forecast uncertainties and the marginal distribution and connection function can be flexibly selected in combination with the statistical and information characteristics of the errors which helps improve the fittedness of the simulation of complex system errors 3 forecast results for the validation years demonstrated that the proposed forecast model considering the spatio temporal dependence correction of forecast uncertainties can reduce the continuous ranked probability score crps by 11 4 and the brier score bs by 34 6 in comparison with a forecast model without any correction and further reduce the crps by 2 1 on average highest value 3 7 and reduce the bs by 1 2 on average highest value 2 0 in comparison with only temporal correction meanwhile this model can reduce the width of the confidence interval by nearly 40 which reflects the better performance in terms of accuracy and reliability of long term probabilistic streamflow forecasts indicating that real time hybrid spatio temporal error correction could further considering more comprehensive statistic characteristics of forecast errors with their correlation information and it will contribute to reduce forecast uncertainties effectively this study proposed a data driven method for exploring the spatio temporal correlation of forecast error correction to improve real time probabilistic forecast in multi sites system further studies could also try to identify the possibility of using real time forecast information of meteorological hydrological factors to improve the accuracy of correction or alternative long term streamflow forecast models can be employed to forecast the deterministic sequences of streamflow these could also provide alternative solutions for

4334,long term streamflow forecasting for a multisite river basin system can experience oscillation of spatio temporal dependent forecast errors characterizing the dependent information and conducting spatio temporal dependent forecast error correction can reduce the total uncertainty in real time forecasting on the basis of a single site martingale model of forecast evolution mmfe which can simulate forecast uncertainty evolution over the temporal scale this study developed a dynamic long term streamflow probabilistic forecasting model that addresses spatio temporal dependent error correction for a multisite system error characteristics and hybrid spatio temporal forecast improvements with complex dependencies are captured by copula function which describes the systemwide evolution of forecast uncertainty the proposed model was verified by forecasting the streamflow of the hongze lake luoma lake system in china the results revealed the following 1 the spatio temporal dependent error correction based on mmfe can refine the spatio temporal dimension hybrid error information which is helpful in improving forecast accuracy 2 as the spatio temporal dependence of forecast uncertainty is described using a copula function selection of the marginal distribution and connection function is flexible through combining statistical and informational characteristics of the errors which is helpful in improving the fittedness of complex system error simulation 3 compared with the benchmark forecast model without correction the proposed model greatly decreased forecast

average highest value 3 7 and reduce the bs by 1 2 on average highest value 2 0 in comparison with only temporal correction the results demonstrate that the proposed model improves the accuracy and reliability of probabilistic streamflow forecasting for complex water resource systems by reducing uncertainty keywords long term streamflow forecast forecast uncertainties martingale model of forecast evolution spatio temporal dependent error correction 1 introduction long term streamflow forecasting which generally refers to a streamflow forecast within a lead time exceeding a month or a season feng et al 2020 can provide effective information for water resource planning and management and operation of water conservancy projects wang et al 2017 xu et al 2021 ensuring the accuracy of long term streamflow forecasts is highly important for exploration of the benefits of reservoir operation xu et al 2015 2019 in comparison with short term streamflow forecasts the climate system and precipitation process within the long term forecast horizon cannot be predicted effectively xu et al 2017 2020 which causes difficulties in building physically based forecast models with stochastic and chaotic inputs with the continuous improvement of the quantity and quality of meteorological and hydrological observation data as well as the rapid development of high performance computing and artificial intelligence techniques data driven methods have been applied as new approaches to long term streamflow forecasting data driven methods can be divided into three categories 1 simulation models based on mathematical statistics such as regressive analysis mohseni and stefan 1998 time series modeling bender and simonovic 1994 robert et al 2010 and wavelet analysis brunner and gilleland 2020 2 intelligent forecast models based on machine learning such as artificial neural networks yang et al 2017 and chaos theory lall et al 1996 and 3 decomposition ensemble forecast models based on signal decomposition and artificial intelligent giulia et al 2011 siriporn et al 2017 these methods establish the mapping function between streamflow response and input conditions through data sample mining and conduct streamflow forecast based on these functions although many earlier studies have contributed to the development of deterministic forecast models for long term streamflow sequences it is widely recognized that the perturbation of high levels of uncertainty introduced by forecast errors reduces the application value of deterministic forecasts xu et al 2020 in contrast a probabilistic forecast combined with error analysis which can provide richer information regarding the confidence range of streamflow forecasts and level of probability confidence for water resource risk analysis and decision making nester et al 2012 has become an important modeling tool for addressing uncertainties however with the increase of lead time forecast accuracy deteriorates rapidly resulting in increased uncertainty and a widened forecasting interval that greatly reduce the value of probabilistic forecasts zhao et al 2011 therefore it is critical to improve forecast accuracy by narrowing the forecasting interval without reducing forecast reliability which is often achieved through frequent updating of information and error correction si et al 2019 this approach necessitates analysis of the evolution mechanism of the uncertainties associated with forecast errors which constitutes a stochastic process identification and simulation problem improving the practical value of probabilistic forecasts by examining and preserving the statistical characteristics of the forecast errors falls within the scope of stochastic simulation modeling commonly used stochastic simulation methods include the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation technique bender and simonovic 1994 markov chain monte carlo approach bates and campbell 2001 and bayesian forecasting system krzysztofowicz 2014 the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation technique generates stochastic processes via parameter perturbation and it often requires large sample volumes for calibrating the parameter combinations which is a limitation in real time application owing to issues regarding data abundancy lin et al 2014 the markov chain monte carlo approach uses markov chains to simulate the stochastic process by preserving the state transition probability of the samples however it also has limitations regarding the dilemma between refined description of the transition matrix and sample data abundancy wu et al 2019 the bayesian forecasting system is an analysis method applicable to correction of real time streamflow error based on real time rainfall information its principal shortcoming reflects the difficulty in obtaining effective forecasted rainfall information that matches the lead time of streamflow forecasting within a long term horizon in a real time situation ajami et al 2007 the above studies generally assumed that the stochastic parameters are stationary which means that the forecast uncertainties do not change when shifted temporally lettenmaier 1984 in fact considering the effect of real time error correction the residual error sequences within the remaining time periods could update as the initial forecast time advances breaking the stationary condition and formulating dynamic stochastic processes maurer and lettenmaier 2003 this is because of the inner consistency and dependency properties of error sequences raised by cascade uncertainties within simulated hydrological processes cloke and pappenberger 2009 therefore the realization of forecast errors in the past could provide a posteriori information that has certain value for the remaining period of the streamflow forecast considering the possible influence of error correction within real time sequence simulations the martingale model of forecast evolution mmfe which introduced the concept of uncertainty evolution heath and jackson 1994 was applied to simulate dynamic stochastic demand time sequences within a supply chain numerous other applications have verified the efficacy of mmfe in capturing the temporal evolution characteristics of forecast errors liu et al 2020 zhou et al 2007 zhu et al 2017 an improved generalized mmfe framework was introduced in hydrologic research to describe the evolution of streamflow forecast uncertainties under the influence of dependent forecast updates within adjacent time periods zhao et al 2011 2013 subsequently the mmfe framework was extended with the copula function and the copula based uncertainty evolution model was proposed chen et al 2016 this model combines the advantages of mmfe and the convenience and flexibility of the copula function in modeling the joint distribution of multivariate random variables the copula function is flexible in dealing with a multivariate joint distribution simple in terms of calculation and suitable for connection of multidimensional random variables patton 2008 thus it is applicable to analysis of forecast uncertainties of different distributions and suitable for simulating forecast updates with multiperiod dependencies therefore it is used widely in the field of hydrology to describe the dependence of hydrologic features such as flood processes and rainfall runoff and it is also used for flood forecasting and drought analysis brunner et al 2019 chen et al 2016 grimaldi and serinaldi 2006 lee and salas 2011 different from streamflow forecasting for a single site system the streamflow processes of a small basin with similar climatic and underlying surface conditions or of a multisite system with direct hydraulic connection preserve a certain degree of spatio temporal consistency and correlation bardossy and pegram 2009 this characteristic is fundamental to ensuring the overall accuracy of a streamflow forecast for an entire system studies on developing models for multisite streamflow forecasting began to explore the information value of spatio temporal dependence on a systemwide scale e g streamflow forecasting based on a multisite stochastic weather generator steinschneider and brown 2012 multivariate autoregressive model niedzielski 2006 and the maximum entropy copula method multisite monthly streamflow simulation hao and singh 2013 however the above models fail to consider comprehensively the characteristics of forecast error evolution under the influence of spatio temporal dependent error correction resulting in overestimation of uncertainty a number of other studies li et al 2020 si et al 2015 wang et al 2016 wood 2009 have shown that application of real time spatio temporal dependent error correction for multisite water resource systems could further reduce the overall forecast uncertainty and improve the accuracy of the systemwide simulation to further enhance the overall performance of streamflow forecasting for a multisite system this research exploited the advantages of the single site mmfe framework for dynamic stochastic simulation of error sequences and improved it for application to a multisite system through construction of a multisite streamflow stochastic simulation that considers real time forecast updating through spatio temporal dependent error correction taking into account the difficulty and high computational complexity of processing high order concurrently the copula function is used to model the joint probability density function pdf of the complex real time forecast updates the copula function is selected for its superior performance in flexible modeling and dependency description distinct from previous related work the proposed model 1 refines the spatial temporal dimension hybrid error information which is helpful in improving forecast accuracy 2 describes the spatial temporal dependence of forecast uncertainty by using copula function and selects marginal distributions and connection function through combining statistical and informational characteristics of the errors which is helpful in improving the goodness of fit of complex system error simulation 3 improves the accuracy and reliability of probabilistic streamflow forecasting for complex water resource systems by reducing uncertainty the main objectives of this study were as follows 1 to refine the spatio temporal dependent streamflow forecast updates of errors by modeling the multiscale joint pdf using a copula function within a multisite system 2 to address the dynamic evolution mechanism of forecast uncertainties within a multisite system under the influence of the spatio temporal dependent forecast error correction and 3 to propose an mmfe based long term streamflow probabilistic forecast model for reducing overall streamflow forecast uncertainties in a multisite system methodologies were verified in a two site lake system in china the hongze lake and luoma lake system for demonstrating the model performance with low computational effort and data requirement 2 study area hongze lake and luoma lake of the huai river basin china were selected as the study area for this research fig 1 hongze lake which is located in the downstream reaches of the huai river has a drainage area of 2596 km2 and maximum water storage capacity of 3 04 billion m3 it is the fourth largest freshwater lake in china and the largest storage lake in the huai river basin luoma lake which is located in the downstream reaches of the yi shu si river basin has a drainage area of 375 km2 and water storage capacity of 270 million m3 both lakes are affected primarily by the monsoon climate moreover the catchment areas of both lakes are in moist climatic regions in which the mechanism of runoff generation is saturation excess runoff generation runoff propagates and converges through crossed river networks within the region and the characteristics of runoff generation and convergence are highly similar the flood season in the study area is from june to october and the non flood season extends from november to may of the following year during the non flood season inflow to the lakes is relatively low while the water demands of the surrounding area and the east route of the south to north water diversion project are relatively high long term forecasting of the local streamflow of the two lakes is essential for informing the allocation and dispatch of water resources through reservoir operation and water diversion 3 methodology a structural flow chart of the model framework is illustrated in fig 2 section 3 1 introduces the basic concept of long term streamflow forecasting in a rolling horizon and the procedures of real time error correction section 3 2 establishes an mmfe based single site real time streamflow forecast model considering the evolution of uncertainties influenced by temporal dependent error correction section 3 3 illustrates the concept of dependent correction of multisite forecast errors and elucidates the spatio temporal evolution characteristics of forecast uncertainties under the influence of error correction section 3 4 proposes a multisite real time streamflow forecast model considering the evolution of spatio temporal dependent uncertainties section 3 5 selects two indicators with which to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the established probabilistic forecast models 3 1 dynamic long term streamflow forecast and real time error correction as the long term streamflow process reflects the integrated response of the long term hydrological cycle which is jointly affected by climatic conditions and the characteristics of runoff generation and concentration of a river basin it often presents spatio temporal persistence owing to the principle of mass balance within time and space constructing a statistical forecast model with a certain lead time based on the dependence of a time series is a conventional approach to forecasting the hydrological sequence a typical time series forecast model can be expressed as follows 1 q t f q t 1 q t 2 q t h ε t q t ε t where f represents a general forecast equation of streamflow sequence based on lag time terms q t and q t represent the observed streamflow and forecasted streamflow respectively m3 s h represents the order of the model and ε t is a random variable that represents the forecast error at time t generally the statistical parameters are calibrated by minimizing the error between historical observed streamflow with reforecasted streamflow under the assumption of stationarity the pdf of error random variables can be considered related only to t as given by 2 ε t ε t the sequence forecast for a single future time period based on observations and forecast information from the past is given by eqs 1 and 2 when ignoring the influence of ε t q t represents deterministic forecast point forecast results conversely when considering the influence of ε t q t represents stochastic forecast results with a calibrated pdf of ε t a discretized probabilistic forecast on q t l can be obtained by stochastic simulation of scenarios and superimposition on the point forecast results specifically l represents the index of simulated discretized scenarios l 1 2 l the long term plans for operation of water resource systems often require the support of streamflow forecast schemes with a long lead time which could exceed the model order h time periods zhao et al 2012 in real time forecasting with the increase of lead time it is impossible to forecast streamflow in all time periods with all observed streamflow information using eqs 1 and 2 generally some forecasted streamflow could be used recursively as given information for an extended forecast in later time periods consequently forecast errors have an accumulative effect in the process of model recursion causing a sharp increase in forecast error with lead time as shown in fig 3 a thus forecast uncertainties evolve and increase with time when a forecast system eventually falls into a chaotic system owing to accumulated uncertainties a point forecast provides limited value and a good probabilistic forecast covers a rather wide and low value range as forecast error is unavoidable in real time forecasting the method commonly used to reduce the influence of errors is a rolling forecast combined with real time error correction it can be identified as a process of data mining wherein the correction method necessitates finding the temporal dependence relationship of the error sequence for example a correction method based on the autocorrelation or other lag time function relationship of errors can estimate the error values and update the forecast error ε t by ε s t 3 ε s t ε s 1 t δ ε s 1 t 1 ε s 1 t 2 ε s 1 t τ ξ where the streamflow forecasted at time s for time t is expressed as q s t t s and the corresponding forecast error is expressed as ε s t t s τ represents the maximum dependent length of the time period for the error and ξ represents the residual of the correction equation δ therefore as shown in fig 3b with the step forward of s the updated streamflow information indicates that the observed streamflow information becomes richer which represents information that is much more valuable and reliable for real time error correction while the unknown streamflow information decreases which helps reduce the forecast uncertainties caused by the model input several studies have verified that a rolling forecast with real time error correction can change the stationarity characteristics of the error sequences and that utilizing the value of error correction and updating can improve forecast accuracy for example stochastic simulation for long term streamflow forecasting was conducted with consideration of the influence of a rolling forecast and error correction at all times to observe the effect of the evolution of uncertainties with time zhao et al 2011 2013 3 2 single site streamflow probabilistic forecast model based on temporal dependent error correction as shown in fig 3b streamflow forecasts are updated in real time as time progresses and as more hydrologic information becomes available the forecasts are updated dynamically assuming that the forecast horizon ends at time t and that current time s moves forward to s 1 the forecast q s t changes to q s 1 t whereby the difference between q s t and q s 1 t is recognized as the forecast update similarly the uncertainties evolve with time under the influence of error correction i e the difference between ε s t and ε s 1 t therefore zhao et al 2011 2013 and chen et al 2016 used mmfe to analyze such evolutions in adjacent time periods and formulated them to simulate the single site streamflow process a schematic of the evolution of forecast uncertainties formulated by mmfe is shown in fig 4 and details of the specific steps are described in the following step 1 construct the forecast improvement sequences and establish the relationship between forecast errors and their improvements considering real time correction in a dynamic rolling forecast process the forecast improvement w s t can be defined as the difference between the forecast errors of two adjacent time periods as given by 4 w s t q s t q s 1 t ε s t ε s 1 t δ ε s 1 t 1 ε s 1 t 2 ε s 1 t τ ξ if it is assumed that the forecast at the current time is perfect i e 5 ε t t 0 then similar to eq 4 the relationship between ε s t and w s t can be formulated as follows 6 ε t t 0 ε t 1 t ε t t w t t w t t ε t 2 t ε t 1 t w t 1 t w t t w t 1 t ε t h t ε t h 1 t w t h 1 t j t h 1 t w j t by incorporating eq 6 into eq 4 q s t can be formulated with q t and w s t 7 q t t q t q t 1 t q t w t t q t 2 t q t w t t w t 1 t q t h t q t j t h 1 t w j t as shown in eq 6 the forecast errors can be divided into forecast improvements in the decomposed time periods and the forecast is given by eq 7 as q t in eq 7 cannot be observed at time s it can be replaced by point forecast q t when applied to a real time forecast step 2 description of stochastic process of the forecast improvement sequences a vector w s is constructed to represent the aggregate of forecast improvements for different time at time s 8 w s w s s w s s 1 w s s h 1 the statistical characteristics of w s can be described by the variance covariance matrix of w s 9 vc v s var w s 1 s 1 cov 1 2 cov 1 h cov 2 1 var w s 2 s 2 cov 2 h cov h 1 cov h 2 var w s h s h where var represents the variance functions and cov i j represents the covariance between w s s i 1 and w s s j 1 according to eq 6 the evolution of the forecast errors can be described as follows 10 var ε t h t i 1 i h var w t i 1 t 2 1 i j h cov i j 11 var ε s s h i 1 i h var w s i s h 2 1 i j h cov i j similarly a vector w t is constructed to represent the series of the forecast improvements at different times for time t 12 w t w t h 1 t w t h 2 t w t t noting that w t and w s have the same combination of column vectors in various arrangements the statistical properties of the two vectors are the same thus the statistical properties of w s s i 1 s 1 2 t i 1 2 h may also be described by the variance covariance matrix of w t 13 vc v t var w s h s h cov h h 1 cov h 1 cov h 1 h var w s h 1 s h 1 cov h 1 1 cov 1 h cov 1 h 1 var w s s step 3 stochastic sampling of scenario sequences of forecast improvement and the generation of a streamflow probabilistic forecast zhao et al 2011 initially assumed that w s s i 1 s 1 2 t i 1 2 h has normal distribution with a given vc v t stochastic sampling based on cholesky decomposition can be used to generate scenario sequences of forecast improvement as characterized below 14 vc v t v v t 15 w t h 1 t w t h 2 t w t t y 1 y 2 y h v t where y 1 y 2 y h is an h dimensional independently and identically normal distributed vector of random variables and the scenario sequences of forecast improvement are as follows 16 w s t l w t h 1 t 1 w t h 2 t 1 w t t 1 w t h 1 t 2 w t h 2 t 2 w t t 2 w t h 1 t l w t h 2 t l w t t l where l represents the number of scenarios thus the streamflow probabilistic forecast scenarios can be generated by the following 17 q s t l q s t i t h 1 t w i t 1 q s t i t h 1 t w i t 2 q s t i t h 1 t w i t l where q represents the scenarios of the streamflow probabilistic forecast as forecast errors tend to be biased and do not have normal distributions in real world applications the complexity of modeling is increased the copula function is a reliable method for building a joint probability distribution of multivariate random variables peng et al 2017 it does not require a consistent formulation of marginal distributions and it can treat the nonlinear and asymmetric dependence between random variables bardossy and pegram 2009 with high flexibility according to sklar s theorem if there is a multivariate random variable x 1 x 2 x n with joint distribution function f x 1 x 2 x n for which f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n represent the marginal distribution function then there is a copula function c that satisfies the following equation 18 f x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n if f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n is continuous function c is unique after selecting suitable marginal distributions of each column vector the copula function c can be calibrated according to the results of vc v t and the scenario sequences of forecast improvement can be sampled using inverse conditional probability sampling of the multivariate random variable based on the selected copula function the specific steps are as follows 1 for given n dimensional random variables select the optimal distribution to fit the marginal distribution of each random variable according to maximum likelihood function convert each dimensional variable x i into the quantile of the corresponding marginal distribution f x i 2 select the appropriate copula function and calibrate its parameters according to the maximum likelihood function then the function c has been determined 3 divide the 0 1 interval into n sub intervals randomly sample a number in each sub interval and n numbers are obtained by this way denoted as a i 1 a i 2 a i n i 1 2 n and the random number from a 1 1 to a n n are obtained by the same way therefore the sample y 1 j y 2 j y n j j 1 2 n can be obtained by the conditional probability distribution 19 p x 1 y 1 j x 2 a 2 j x 3 a 3 j x n a n j c y 1 j a 2 j a n j c a 2 j a n j p x 2 y 2 j x 1 y 1 j x 3 a 3 j x n a n j c y 1 j y 2 j a n j c y 1 j a 3 j a n j p x n y n j x 1 y 1 j x 2 y 2 j x n 1 y n 1 j c y 1 j y n j c y 1 j y n 1 j 4 according to the calibrated marginal distributions of random variables the scenario sequences of forecast improvement can be sampled by their own inverse cumulative distribution probability f 1 y i j 3 3 multisite streamflow probabilistic forecast model based on spatio temporal dependent error correction in the process of multisite streamflow forecasting the forecast uncertainties often present complex dependent properties owing to the similarity in forecast model formulation i e similar streamflow information model structures and parameters for example in persistently dry or wet streamflow conditions over several time periods multiperiod temporal dependent uncertainties could exist in the case of spatially synchronized streamflow conditions over multiple sites biased streamflow forecasts over the sites could result in positive spatial dependent errors implementation of joint error correction through consideration of the complicated spatio temporal dependence of uncertainties could further improve the accuracy of multisite system forecasts an mmfe based streamflow forecasting model that considers the evolution characteristics of the spatio temporal dependent forecast uncertainties can be established as described in the following steps step 1 construct the multidimensional forecast improvement sequences and establish the relationship between forecast errors and their improvements as forecast error sequences ε s t j j 1 2 k are given by the difference of forecast value q s t j and observed value q t ε s t j q t q s t j where k represents the number of sites the forecast improvements of each site j can be expressed as follows 20 w s t j ε s t j ε s 1 t j similarly in comparison with eqs 6 and 7 the equations can be given as follows 21 ε t t j 0 ε t 1 t j ε t t j w t t j w t t j ε t 2 t j ε t 1 t j w t 1 t j w t t j w t 1 t j ε t h t j ε t h 1 t j w t h 1 t j l t h 1 t w l t j 22 q t t j q t j q t 1 t j q t j w t t j q t 2 t j q t j w t t j w t 1 t j q t h t j q t j l t h 1 t w l t j step 2 description of stochastic process of multidimensional forecast improvement sequences to further consider the spatio temporal correlation of forecast uncertainties a kh dimensional vector u s is constructed to represent the aggregate of the forecast improvements of different sites at time s 23 u s w s s 1 w s s 1 1 w s s h 1 1 w s 1 w s s 2 w s s 1 2 w s s h 1 2 w s 2 w s s k w s s 1 k w s s h 1 k w s k therefore for the given vector u s it can be regarded as a kh dimensional multivariate random variable x as shown in fig 5 where each column vector represents one of the unary random variables moreover in a rolling forecast scenario considering the step forward of time s to t t s h the vector u s should be extended as follows 24 u w s s 1 w s s 1 1 w s t 1 w s 1 w s 1 s 1 1 w s s 2 1 w s 1 t 1 w s 1 1 w t t 1 w t 1 site 1 forecast horizon from time s to t w s s k w s s 1 k w s t k w s k w s 1 s 1 k w s s 2 k w s 1 t k w s 1 k w t t k w t k site k forecast horizon from time s to t as shown in fig 6 the variance covariance matrix u is used to describe such complex spatio temporal hybrid correlations each blue submatrix in the main diagonal of u represents the temporal correlation of forecast improvements with the step forward of the forecast beginning time at a single site and the yellow submatrices outside of the main diagonal of u denote the spatio temporal correlations at different sites to fully consider the complex dependence of multivariate random variables and the varied tail dependence of the spatio temporal forecast improvements the description of multivariate random variables is based on the copula function the copula function is used because it not only determines the appropriate marginal distribution for describing the temporal evolution of the forecast improvement but also finely formulates the spatial information step 3 stochastic sampling of scenario sequences of multidimensional forecast improvement the stochastic sampling is based on sampling of the copula based multivariate random variables which is essentially the inverse conditional probability sampling of the multivariate random variables according to step 2 in section 3 2 the abovementioned stochastic sampling of the multivariate random variables based on the copula function can be used to sample u 3 4 multisite real time streamflow probabilistic forecast similar to step 3 in section 3 2 an appropriate copula function is chosen to describe the joint distribution of u and perform stochastic sampling to construct a discrete stochastic process the scenario of sequences of multisite probabilistic forecasts and their improvements are given as follows 25 w s t k l w t h 1 t 1 1 w t h 2 t 1 1 w t t 1 1 w t h 1 t 1 2 w t h 2 t 1 2 w t t 1 2 w t h 1 t 1 l w t h 2 t 1 l w t t 1 l w t h 1 t k l w t h 2 t k l w t t k l 26 q s t k l q s t 1 i t h 1 t w i t 1 1 q s t 1 i t h 1 t w i t 1 2 q s t 1 i t h 1 t w i t 1 l q s t k i t h 1 t w i t k l thereafter multisite real time streamflow probabilistic forecasts with consideration of the evolution characteristics of spatio temporal dependent error correction can be obtained 3 5 evaluation indicators of the probabilistic forecast for a probabilistic forecast the accuracy and reliability of the forecast should be evaluated accuracy refers to the closeness of a certain quantile e g the median q 50 or the mean of the probabilistic forecast to the observed value and studies usually use the root mean square error or the continuous ranked probability score crps for evaluation purposes reliability refers to the ability of the confidence interval of the probabilistic forecast to cover the observed value and metrics such as interval dispersion and coverage are used for evaluation purposes additionally the brier score bs can also be used to examine forecast reliability by identifying whether the observed streamflow is covered by the confidence range of the probabilistic streamflow forecast brier 1950 in this study both the crps and the bs were selected for evaluation of the streamflow rolling probabilistic forecast model the crps is an evaluation indicator commonly used to evaluate the accuracy of a probabilistic forecast and it is also one of the most widely used measures of accuracy in probability forecasting gneiting and raftery 2007 the formula for crps calculation is as follows 27 c r p s f y f x h x y 2 d x where f x represents the cumulative distribution function of the probabilistic forecast y represents the true value of the variable to be forecasted and h x y is a heaviside function 28 h x y 1 x y 0 x y as shown in fig 7 a good probability forecast is supposed to approximate the true pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf of the observation additionally a narrower value of the crps indicates a better forecast the bs is applicable to a task in which predictions must assign probabilities to a set of mutually exclusive discrete outcomes or classes it is the average gap i e mean squared difference between forecast probabilities and actual outcomes the bs can be decomposed into three additive components uncertainties reliability and resolution murphy 1973 the uncertainties term denoted as unc measures the inherent uncertainties in the outcomes of the event the reliability term denoted as rel measures the closeness of the forecast probabilities to the true probabilities given that forecast and the resolution term denoted as res measures by how much the conditional probabilities differ from the average given the different forecasts the most common formulation of the bs is as follows 29 bs 1 r i 1 r p i o i 2 1 r i 1 n r i p i o i 2 1 r i 1 r r i o i o 2 o 1 o r e l r e s u n c where p i represents the probability that was predicted o i represents the actual outcome of the event at instance i o i 0 if it does not happen and o i 1 if it does happen r is the number of predicting instances r i represents the number of forecasts with the same probability category and o i represents the observed frequency given the forecasts with probability p i therefore the lower the bs value for a set of predictions the better the predictions are calibrated ferro 2007 4 case study 4 1 overview of the multisite system water can be diverted between the two lakes through the xuhong river and via the grand canal with controlled outflow and water diversion the two lakes can be regarded as two reservoirs with hydraulic connection fig 8 as a transit lake of the east route of the south to north water diversion project the two lakes are also involved in the task of transporting water from the yangtze river along the grand canal and parallel river channels northward to shandong province the accuracy of long term forecasting of streamflow between the two lakes will not only affect the water supply situation of the surrounding areas but also benefit the south to north water diversion project therefore based on historical data of annual streamflow this research considered different representative hydrological years to reforecast monthly streamflow during the non flood season i e the season of water diversion according to monthly historical inflow data of the two lakes three types of hydrological year were selected a dry year 1982 1983 a normal year 1994 1995 and a wet year 2008 2009 4 2 analysis of streamflow forecast errors and forecast improvement 4 2 1 deterministic time series forecast and error analysis this study used an autoregressive moving average arma model to produce monthly streamflow deterministic forecasts of the two lakes on the basis of which the corresponding forecast errors and improvement sequences were determined the arma model is a combination of an autoregressive ar model and a moving average model ma for example when the order of ar is m the order of ma is n i e arma m n and the structure of arma m n can be expressed as follows 30 x t φ 0 φ 1 x t 1 φ m x t m θ 1 ε t 1 θ n ε t n where x t x t 1 x t m is the m order streamflow time series ε t ε t 1 ε t n is the n order white noise sequence with a mean value of 0 and constant variance φ 0 φ m are ar coefficients and θ 1 θ n are ma coefficients box et al 2015 generally speaking only those sequence that is stochastic and have a close correlation can they be used for modeling by arma model to mine the effective information in historical data and predict future development the results table 1 show a great huge relation between the successive months in non flood season which is suitable for modeling by arma model as monthly streamflow has obvious periodicity and does not meet the assumption of stationarity required by the arma model the streamflow sequences q t were deseasonalized and differentially processed as sequences q t for application of the model therefore the ar integrated ma model arima was established which is a combination of the arma and the difference processes for the order selection the akaike information criterion aic is proposed to estimate the model order aic is used to compare different possible models and determine which one is the best fit for the data sakamoto et al 1986 it is denoted as 31 a i c num 2 n u m 2 ln l num where num represents the number of orders and l is the likelihood function the less aic is the better data fitted and the better model constructed shibata 1976 the result of aic illustrate arima 2 1 2 is better for modeling the hongze lake while arima 4 1 1 is better for modeling the luoma lake besides the truncation characteristics of the autodependence coefficient ac and the partial ac pac of the processed sequence is also a useful way to select the order of model the order selection result table 2 and fig 9 by this method is same as aic therefore ultimately the arima 2 1 2 and the arima 4 1 1 were selected for deterministic forecasting of two lakes the ordinary least squares method is used to determine the parameters of the model orders such that the model can pass the test of white noise and goodness of fit therefore the selected arima models can be expressed as follows the ordinary least squares method is used to determine the parameters of the model orders such that the model can pass the test of white noise and goodness of fit the selected arima models can be expressed as follows hongze lake 32 q t 0 137 q t 1 0 441 q t 2 0 251 ε t 0 749 ε t 1 luoma lake 33 q t 0 457 q t 1 0 023 q t 2 0 036 q t 3 0 092 q t 4 0 903 ε t the results of the forecast model are calculated according to the calibrated parameters of each order and the streamflow forecasts are obtained after reconstruction which is the reverse step of the deseasonalization and difference processes following which the forecast errors sequence ε s t k and the forecast improvements sequence w s t k can be obtained tables 3 and 4 present the temporal evolution and dynamic changes of the forecast uncertainties represented by standard deviation of ε s t k of the two lakes the forecast uncertainties generally present a gradual trend of increase with the increase of lead time 4 2 2 analysis of correlation characteristics and evolution of forecast uncertainties in accordance with the analysis in section 3 3 the forecast improvements sequence w s t k can be described accurately by the multivariate random variable description method based on the copula function the fitting accuracy of the marginal distribution will directly affect the description accuracy of the multivariate random variable we used the kolmogorov smirnov k s test to examine the normality of the forecast improvement sequences of the two lakes as shown in tables 5 and 6 the tested results of the marginal distributions of the forecast improvements mostly satisfy non normal distribution in statistics kernel density estimation kde is a nonparametric approach for estimation of the pdf of a random variable parzen 1962 rosenblatt 1956 one of the most well known applications of kde is the estimation of the class conditional marginal densities of data when using a naive bayes classifier piryonesi and el diraby 2020 ziegel 2010 which can improve its prediction accuracy various kernel functions such as uniform triangular biweight triweight epanechnikov and normal are widely used although the last is used most often therefore the normal kernel function pdf was selected to fit the forecast improvement distributions for those samples that failed the k s test such that the fittedness of the marginal distributions was optimized as shown in table 7 and 8 considering the complexity of the multidimensional joint distribution the gaussian copula function was selected to describe the joint distribution of the forecast improvements while the maximum likelihood method was used to calibrate the parameters of the copula function and scenario sequences of forecast improvement were generated on the basis of the calibrated parameters heat maps of the dependence coefficient matrix between the sequence samples and the generated scenarios of the forecast improvement in january are shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the trends of the two graphs are consistent while the main diagonals of the matrices are largely similar therefore it can be considered that the gaussian copula function and its parameters can satisfactorily retain the dependence of the sample sequences additionally it can be seen from fig 10 that the values of the dependence coefficients of each order near the main diagonal of the matrix are almost all 0 6 indicating high temporal dependence in the lower left and upper right areas of the matrix the dependence coefficients can also reach values of 0 2 and most are 0 4 indicating that the spatial dependence between the two lakes cannot be ignored therefore real time correction should consider the spatio temporal dependencies 4 3 long term real time streamflow probabilistic forecast the scenario describing the sequence probabilistic forecasting of the non flood period of the two lakes can be generated by rolling deterministic forecasting based on the arima model in combination with the scenario sequence of forecast improvements generated in section 3 2 according to eq 27 which is a forecast model that considers both temporal and spatial information of the uncertainties denoted as forecast model c meanwhile two benchmark forecast models denoted as forecast model a and forecast model b were also established model a produces a forecast without error correction using only the calibrated arima model whereas model b produces a forecast considering only the temporal dependent error correction tables 9 and 10 compare the statistical characteristics of forecast improvements generated by the different forecast models the bolded figures means that it is closer to the sample and the results show that the statistics of the generated scenarios from model c are closer than those from model b to the statistical characteristics of the original sample which means that error correction considering the spatio temporal evolution and dependence characteristics of the forecast uncertainties can be more effective in preserving the statistical characteristics the results of the reforecasts produced by the different forecast models in simulating the calibration sample sets are shown in figs 11 and 12 the x axis refers to the number of time periods which includes the 7 months in non flood season of 55 years and the lead time is 1 month in the case of the long series forecast scenario in comparison with model a model c greatly reduces the standard deviation of the forecast error for both hongze lake and luoma lake i e by 40 4 and 36 6 with slight reduction in forecast reliability of 7 7 and 7 4 respectively the results of the rolling reforecasts produced by the different forecast models in simulating the validation sample sets are shown in figs 13 15 in all hydrological years the confidence range of model c is reduced further than that of model b moreover the reliability is not changed significantly indicating that the spatio temporal dependent correction performs better than correction considering only temporal dependencies from tables 11 and 12 which compare the two selected indicators between different forecast models it can be seen that model c has greater improvement in forecast accuracy and reliability than the other models e g the crps is reduced at least by 2 1 compared with model b and 11 4 compared with model a when the lead time exceeds the effective forecast period the reduction is 15 4 with the highest value of 21 0 in forecast of 7 months similarly the bs is reduced at least by 1 2 compared with model b and 34 6 compared with model a with any lead time moreover when the lead time exceeds the effective forecast period the reduction is 29 8 with the highest value of 59 3 compared with model a however it is evident that both indicators show an increasing trend with the increase of lead time indicating a gradual decrease in forecast accuracy 5 conclusions and discussion long term real time streamflow probabilistic forecasting for river basins provide an important basis for risk assessment and decision making related to water resource management probabilistic forecasting considering real time error correction is an effective method for improving the accuracy of forecasts and reducing uncertainties in a multisite system further utilizing spatio temporal dependent error information to correct forecasts could result in better overall reduction of forecast uncertainty this study proposed a martingale model of forecast evolution mmfe based dynamic long term streamflow probabilistic forecasting model for a multisite system that addresses the coevolution of multisite forecast errors over time the kernel function is used to estimate the marginal distributions of the forecast errors and the gaussian copula function is used to establish a multivariate joint probability function of the hybrid spatio temporal dependencies of forecast improvements the hongze lake luoma lake system in china was selected as a study case and the main conclusions are summarized below 1 the spatio temporal dependent error correction based on mmfe can simultaneously consider the high order and hybrid dependent characteristics the error sequences are considered comprehensively which both refines the error information over the temporal scale and enriches the information over the spatial scale 2 a copula function is used to describe the spatio temporal dependence of forecast uncertainties and the marginal distribution and connection function can be flexibly selected in combination with the statistical and information characteristics of the errors which helps improve the fittedness of the simulation of complex system errors 3 forecast results for the validation years demonstrated that the proposed forecast model considering the spatio temporal dependence correction of forecast uncertainties can reduce the continuous ranked probability score crps by 11 4 and the brier score bs by 34 6 in comparison with a forecast model without any correction and further reduce the crps by 2 1 on average highest value 3 7 and reduce the bs by 1 2 on average highest value 2 0 in comparison with only temporal correction meanwhile this model can reduce the width of the confidence interval by nearly 40 which reflects the better performance in terms of accuracy and reliability of long term probabilistic streamflow forecasts indicating that real time hybrid spatio temporal error correction could further considering more comprehensive statistic characteristics of forecast errors with their correlation information and it will contribute to reduce forecast uncertainties effectively this study proposed a data driven method for exploring the spatio temporal correlation of forecast error correction to improve real time probabilistic forecast in multi sites system further studies could also try to identify the possibility of using real time forecast information of meteorological hydrological factors to improve the accuracy of correction or alternative long term streamflow forecast models can be employed to forecast the deterministic sequences of streamflow these could also provide alternative solutions for
