950,vegetation water content is a critical aspect of ecosystem water balance and plant physiology including how plants cope with drought deciduous trees store significant water for use in transpiration throughout the growing season in the boreal forest of alaska water content of shrub stems and their role in the water balance remains unquantified for many woody species in boreal and arctic tundra ecosystems we adapted time domain reflectometry tdr to continuously measure shrub water content we created calibration equations relating apparent dielectric constant to volumetric water content of shrub stems of felt leaf willow salix alaxensis diamond leaf willow s pulchra and dwarf birch betula nana our results show seasonal patterns of volumetric stem water content ranging from 40 to 70 stem water content prior to leaf out was minimal scaled by biomass 2mm compared to total snowmelt water implying little water uptake of snowmelt water stem water content was small compared to other components of the hydrologic water budget precipitation runoff evaporation evapotranspiration infiltration indicating the importance of shrub transpiration and dependence of shrubs on available soil moisture for uptake the technique and findings here are needed to quantify the role of deciduous shrub vegetation in the hydrologic cycle of ecosystems particularly those where shrubs predominate keywords woody shrubs tundra vegetation time domain reflectometry tdr stem water content snowmelt water uptake ecohydrology arctic alaska 1 introduction uncertainties remain in terrestrial arctic water budgets surrounding the storage and flux of water recent findings have highlighted the important role of deciduous trees in the boreal hydrologic budget young robertson et al 2016 deciduous trees may take up significant portions of early spring snowmelt water 21 25 for use in transpiration throughout the growing season in the boreal forest of interior alaska young robertson et al 2016 however water content of shrub stems and their role in the water balance remains unquantified for many woody species in boreal and arctic tundra ecosystems quantifying the seasonal dynamics of stem water content also reveals how much plants rely on water stored in stems compared to water in soil plants relying on internal storage can have transpiration dynamics that are decoupled from the soil moisture dynamics constantz and murphy 1990 goldstein et al 1998 holbrook 1995 meinzer 2002 phillips et al 2003 measuring stem water content may thus provide insight into both the hydrologic fluxes as well as plant water use and adaption shrub expansion has been well documented in the arctic myers smith et al 2011 tape et al 2006 the increases in shrub cover have altered and continue to alter energy fluxes water exchange carbon and nutrients in tundra ecosystems lafleur and humphreys 2018 myers smith et al 2011 sturm et al 2001 shrub expansion is projected to continue with continued implications for surface processes and feedbacks bonfils et al 2012 lawrence and swenson 2011 for this study we focused on three shrub species dominate in shrub tundra subzone e of the circumarctic vegetation map walker et al 2005 shrub dendroecological studies have identified air temperature soil moisture and precipitation as the important factors controlling stem growth in arctic alaska ackerman et al 2017 andreu hayles et al 2020 summer temperatures have similarly been found to affect salix pulchra and betula nana radial growth in northeastern siberia blok et al 2011 li et al 2016 and salix spp in canada weijers et al 2018 zalatan and gajewski 2006 a dendrochronology record from s alaxensis in northwest territories canada suggests that winter precipitation and snow melt water recharge of soil water is an important factor in explain ring width zalatan and gajewski 2006 dendrochronology studies rely on measurements of stem growth obtained from shrub ring series at annual timescale however the annual time scale may be too coarse to explain intra annual events during the thaw season high temporal resolution data as presented in this study can provide a window into plant responses to a changing environment by adding information on stem water within the thaw season to understand the increasing role of shrubs in tundra water budgets we applied a method of embedding stainless steel rods in shrub stems to continuously measure shrub stem water content using time domain reflectometry tdr time domain reflectometry tdr has been used extensively over the last 35 years to measure soil water content and tree stem water content in both the lab and the field constantz and murphy 1990 hernández santana et al 2008 nadler et al 2006 sparks et al 2001 wullschleger et al 1996 the technique benefits from minimal tree stem disturbance accuracy and ease of automation despite wide application in soil science and limited use in trees relatively little work has been done applying the technique to woody shrubs partly because of the small diameter of shrub stems we developed a method to measure shrub stem water content and compared it to other portions of the hydrologic budget results allow us to assess shrub use of stem water vs soil water to support transpiration in the arctic tundra we hypothesize that water storage in arctic shrub stems constitutes an important component of the hydrologic budget this technique can be applied to quantify shrub water content and their hydrologic role in other shrub dominated ecosystems and to model future changes in shrub function in tundra ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 probe development we fabricated tdr probes using stainless steel rods 2 mm in diameter and 12 cm in length tdr probes were soldered to a 15 m 50 ω coaxial cable and connected to a multiplexer and a tdr100 time domain reflectometer campbell scientific 2007 we inserted the probes into shrub stems by sawing two vertical grooves on opposite sides of a straight section of stem fig 1 a the probes were then pressed into the grooves and held in place with silicon tape fig 1b the probes were in physical contact with the xylem cambium and phloem of the stem tdr probes were inserted into stems of salix alaxensis andersson colville n 22 salix pulchra chamisso linnaea n 12 and betula nana ssp exilis sukaczev hultén n 10 in early spring of 2016 and 2017 at two field sites near the toolik field station in the northern foothills of the brooks range northern alaska the shrub stem tdr measurements were taken in conjunction with meteorological and shrub sap flow measurements over the growing season at each site measurements of air temperature relative humidity vapor pressure deficit net total radiation net shortwave radiation precipitation wind speed and direction radiometric surface temperature soil temperature and soil moisture were taken at hourly intervals using a data logger campbell scientific logan utah usa from 28 march 2016 to 01 september 2016 and from 28 march 2017 to 01 september 2017 soil temperature was measured in three locations within a 10m radius plot at each of three depths 4 16 and 28 cm soil moisture sensors were vertically oriented with each integrating measurements across 12 cm at three depths 8 20 cm 20 32 cm 32 44 cm upward facing photographs were taken every three hours from the ground surface to capture leaf area la development over the growing season site leaf area index lai was estimated from the photographs using the lai package in r martin 2015 sap flow was measured on shrub stems at both sites using stem heat balance sensors dynagage dynamax houston texas usa measurements were taken hourly from early june through august using a datalogger cr1000 campbell scientific logan utah usa s alaxensis s pulchra and b nana stems 5 33 mm in diameter were used for sap flow sensors sensors were placed 10 30 cm above the ground and were protected from solar radiation with reflective foil insulation above and below the sensors 2 2 principles of time domain reflectometry tdr the tdr device sends a short electromagnetic pulse through a coaxial cable and into two parallel rods embedded in the test material i e soil or wood the reflected signal is then recorded the reflected waveform is used to determine the apparent probe length la the apparent dielectric constant ka of the test material is then calculated as the squared ratio of la to the probe length l 1 k a l a l 2 2 3 calculation of la from tdr waveform we used the campbell tdr100 algorithm to measure la from the recorded tdr waveforms campbell scientific 2007 in each waveform a series of three points p1 p2 p3 were identified figure s1 p1 is identified by searching from the first data point to the point where the first derivative rises above a given threshold the maximum of the first derivative after p1 is used to define a tangent line through the point of the maximum derivative p2 is defined by the intersection of the tangent line and the waveform offset by the distance from the proximal end of the rod to the end of the solder junction p3 is defined by the next local minima la is defined as the distance between p2 and p3 ka was calculated following eq 1 2 4 water content calibration the tdr stem sections were cut from our field sites for calibration at the end of the growing season in late august 2017 calibration of the shrub tdr probes was performed after drying shrub stems in the laboratory at 20 c stem volume was determined using calipers to measure three diameters and length to the nearest 0 1 mm stems were weighed and then submersed in water for several days to saturate them prior to calibration daily tdr measurements and stem masses g were recorded between measurements stems were stored in loosely sealed plastic bags to slow the drying process after approximately two months the drying ceased and stems had dried below values recorded in field samples 30 volumetric water content samples were placed in a drying oven at 65 c for two weeks weights were taken daily to confirm drying had ceased gravimetric water content g water g 1 wood was calculated and converted to volumetric water content vwc volume using the stem volume and wood density measurements of shrub stem ka and vwc content were compared and regression equations for each species were developed to relate tdr measurements of ka to vwc 2 5 field measurements of shrub stem vwc field measurements were conducted over the summers may august of 2016 and 2017 at two sites one tundra shrub and one riparian shrub tundra located in the broad uplands north of the brooks range alaska fig 2 the tundra shrub site was located near the headwaters of imnavait creek approximately 12 km east of the toolik field station at 884m elevation the site was composed of a moist acidic shrub tundra community and was dominated by the woody shrubs salix pulchra and betula nana and the moss sphagnum rubellum walker et al 2005 the site is on an east facing slope and the surface geomorphology is poorly defined water tracks and weakly developed solifluction lobes the active layer i e seasonally thawed layer consists of 10 to 15 cm of peat underlain by 20 to 30 cm of plastic wet gravelly sandy clay loam the site is entirely underlain by near surface permafrost at a maximum seasonal thaw depth of 35 to 50 cm walker and walker 1996 the riparian shrub tundra site is located approximately 18 km south of the toolik field station along a tributary stream of galbraith lake at 853 m elevation the vegetation consists of tall riparian shrubs dominated by salix alaxensis the site is on a stabilized floodplain terrace consisting of glaciofluvial outwash bordering the terrace on the north is a toeslope and on the south is an active floodplain the soils consist of a thin organic layer 5 cm underlain by sandy loam and intermixed with coarse gravel and cobbles the presence of permafrost at the riparian site is unknown but likely deep or absent due to the thin or nonexistent organic layer large cobbles and location within an active stream floodplain 2 6 field measurements of sap flow sap flow was measured on shrub stems at both the tundra shrub site n 16 8 salix pulchra and 8 betula nana 1 stem per plant and riparian shrub site n 24 s alaxensis 1 stem per plant using stem heat balance sensors dynagage dynamax houston texas usa measurements were taken hourly from early june through august using a datalogger cr1000 campbell scientific logan utah usa sensors were placed 10 30 cm above the ground and were protected from solar radiation with reflective foil insulation above and below the sensors 2 7 scaling shrub stem vwc to stem water storage estimates of shrub aboveground biomass agb came from berner et al 2018 and combined with our measurements of shrub stem density and range of shrub stem vwc to estimate quantities of water stored on the landscape in shrub stems agb kg m 2 was converted to shrub stem volume vs m3 using shrub stem density by species ρspecies kg m 3 and area m2 2 v s s p e c i e s a g b ρ s p e c i e s 1 m 2 where ρ was determined from stem volume measurements and stem dry weight shrub stem vwc was then used to calculate the volume of water in the shrub stems and converted to mm of water in stems s mm using the density of water 1000 kg m 3 ρw and the conversion 1mm water column 1 kg m 2 3 s s p e c i e s v s s p e c i e s v w c ρ w 1 m 2 m 2 kg a range of agb 0 2 kg m 2 and shrub stem vwc 30 70 were used to estimate ranges of growing season s for each species spring uptake of snowmelt water was estimated from the difference in stem water content during winter dormancy april and stem water content at leaf out early june transpiration is assumed to be zero prior to leaf out 3 results preliminary calibration measurements revealed the cut shrub stems quickly dry 1 3 days to below observed live field moisture values placing the cut stems in loosely sealed plastic bags slowed the drying process and allowed more data points 30 per stem to be collected over the range of stem moisture content observed in situ 30 70 vwc ka showed a linear decline with decreasing stem vwc fig s2 calibration equations were developed that relate the tdr derived ka to shrub stem vwc fig 3 the regression fit for s alaxensis was weaker than for the other two shrub species the calibration for both salix species was similar while that for b nana had a steeper slope and spanned the narrowest range of ka values 0 10 the calibration equations had moderate error with s alaxensis having the greatest error followed by s pulchra and b nana rmse 0 101 0 075 and 0 061 respectively spring and summer daily average stem vwc from the two field sites revealed early spring wetting of shrub stems coinciding with snowmelt and above freezing temperatures approximately six weeks prior to leaf emergence fig 4 at the riparian site stem vwc gradually increased from 40 to 60 in 2016 over the early growing season before plateauing in mid july figs 4 s3 at the tundra site there was a more apparent wetting period in may and june vwc increases from 40 to 50 in 2017 followed by consistent stem vwc in july and august figs s4 s5 stem vwc was not measured outside the thaw season september march scaling the shrub stem water content over a range of abg and stem vwc provides an estimate of shrub stem water storage s across the tundra landscape fig 5 manual measurements of s ranged from 0 3 mm with s alaxensis having the greatest s capacity due to lower wood density and greater biomass unpublished data spring uptake of snowmelt water was found to be minimal 1mm table 1 4 discussion deciduous trees in boreal alaska uptake and store large amounts of water but the vegetation contribution of deciduous shrubs to the arctic water balance is largely unknown sap flux studies quantify the amount of water transpired by arctic shrubs but it is unclear how much is stored in the stems the results here show that stem water content in arctic shrubs is a minimal portion of the hydrologic budget established by kane et al 2004 arctic shrub daily transpiration 0 4mm d 1 fig 4 fig s3 fig s4 fig s5 is comparable to stem water content 0 3 mm implying that the stem contains less water than could be transpired in a day the small amount of stem water content in arctic shrubs 0 3 mm suggests that stem water cannot support long term transpiration and that shrubs are likely taking up soil water on a daily basis to meet transpiration requirements this study highlights the importance of available soil moisture compared to stem water storage for the maintenance of arctic shrub transpiration young robertson et al 2016 found that deciduous trees in boreal alaska uptake large amounts of snowmelt water 21 25 30 36mm in early spring furthermore they found that the deciduous trees appeared to uptake and store the snowmelt water for transpiration needs throughout the growing season although there are differences in the maximum water content of wood between species water storage in woody vegetation trees and shrubs proportional to biomass varies by a factor of two nobel and jordan 1983 deciduous tree water content is quite large compared to daily transpiration rates unlike the boreal deciduous trees arctic deciduous shrub stem storage capacity and biomass are relatively low and cannot retain enough water to maintain transpiration over a long period of time necessitating that shrubs rely on soil moisture to maintain transpiration while it is unclear how long the limited amount of stem water in these arctic shrubs can sustain transpiration it is likely not beyond one day fig 4 in context of the hydrologic budget established by kane et al 2004 arctic shrub stem water content is a minor component for the tundra site estimates of stem water content are 3 of winter precipitation 2 of summer precipitation 2 of runoff and 2 of summer et as measured over an 11 year period kane et al 2004 the low stem water storage measured here indicates that arctic shrubs likely play an important role in the terrestrial water cycle and the energy budget through transpiration the timing of stem water changes during the growing season reported here show similarities to fine scale temperature sensitivity in a dendrochronology study and to stem phenology in a nearby dendrometer study using a shrub ring chronology network consisting of 6 species spanning 18 sites on the north slope of alaska andreu hayles et al 2020 found maximum daily air temperature may 31 to july 9 had the greatest control on ring width this period for shrub growth spans the time of leaf development beginning in june and reaching a maximum in july and increases in stem water over the same period figs 4 s3 s5 cold de hardening start as indicated by increase in stem diameter in salix spp at a nearby site corresponds to stem moisture increases noted at the tundra shrub site in mid may figure s5 julian day 120 130 brown et al 2022 stem water content could add value to studies of shrub phenology and climate sensitivity when combined with high resolution dendrometers dobbert et al 2021 suggest a thermal limitation of growth for b nana possibly attributed to root zone temperatures in summer high temporal resolution stem moisture measurements could be used to provide information on plant water status during these periods of stress building on the work of dobbert et al 2022 tdr measurement of stem water content could be used in combination with dendrometers to aid in the interpretation of reversible water related and irreversible growth related stem increments the method presented here for measuring water content of shrub stems using tdr probes provides estimates of stem water content the calibration equations for each of the three species ranged from a poor to moderate fit r2 values 0 19 0 43 but nonetheless quantified the stem water storage by arctic shrubs and highlighted the tight coupling of soil moisture and transpiration in the controlled calibration drying experiment the individual tdr measurements exhibited noise relative to the steadily declining stem water content which we speculate is due to a limited physical connection between the tdr probe and the stem wood compared to probes embedded in trees or soil additionally the small shrub stems may have posed a problem selecting larger stems for future work could improve the technique future work should also consider using smaller diameter 1mm tdr probes inserted horizontally in the shrub stem for a better electrical connection despite these limitations this method provides a means to quantify the storage of water in shrub dominated ecosystems and can be applied using the recommendations described here future work should analyze the temporal relationship between shrub vwc and relevant enivornmental variables supplementary materials the following are

decreasing stem vwc fig s2 calibration equations were developed that relate the tdr derived ka to shrub stem vwc fig 3 the regression fit for s alaxensis was weaker than for the other two shrub species the calibration for both salix species was similar while that for b nana had a steeper slope and spanned the narrowest range of ka values 0 10 the calibration equations had moderate error with s alaxensis having the greatest error followed by s pulchra and b nana rmse 0 101 0 075 and 0 061 respectively spring and summer daily average stem vwc from the two field sites revealed early spring wetting of shrub stems coinciding with snowmelt and above freezing temperatures approximately six weeks prior to leaf emergence fig 4 at the riparian site stem vwc gradually increased from 40 to 60 in 2016 over the early growing season before plateauing in mid july figs 4 s3 at the tundra site there was a more apparent wetting period in may and june vwc increases from 40 to 50 in 2017 followed by consistent stem vwc in july and august figs s4 s5 stem vwc was not measured outside the thaw season september march scaling the shrub stem water content over a range of abg and stem vwc provides an estimate of shrub stem water storage s across the tundra landscape fig 5 manual measurements of s ranged from 0 3 mm with s alaxensis having the greatest s capacity due to lower wood density and greater biomass unpublished data spring uptake of snowmelt water was found to be minimal 1mm table 1 4 discussion deciduous trees in boreal alaska uptake and store large amounts of water but the vegetation contribution of deciduous shrubs to the arctic water balance is largely unknown sap flux studies quantify the amount of water transpired by arctic shrubs but it is unclear how much is stored in the stems the results here show that stem water content in arctic shrubs is a minimal portion of the hydrologic budget established by kane et al 2004 arctic shrub daily transpiration 0 4mm d 1 fig 4 fig s3 fig s4 fig s5 is comparable to stem water content 0 3 mm implying that the stem contains less water than could be transpired in a day the small amount of stem water content in arctic shrubs 0 3 mm suggests that stem water cannot support long term transpiration and that shrubs are likely taking up soil water on a daily basis to meet transpiration requirements this study highlights the importance of available soil moisture compared to stem water storage for the maintenance of arctic shrub transpiration young robertson et al 2016 found that deciduous trees in boreal alaska uptake large amounts of snowmelt water 21 25 30 36mm in early spring furthermore they found that the deciduous trees appeared to uptake and store the snowmelt water for transpiration needs throughout the growing season although there are differences in the maximum water content of wood between species water storage in woody vegetation trees and shrubs proportional to biomass varies by a factor of two nobel and jordan 1983 deciduous tree water content is quite large compared to daily transpiration rates unlike the boreal deciduous trees arctic deciduous shrub stem storage capacity and biomass are relatively low and cannot retain enough water to maintain transpiration over a long period of time necessitating that shrubs rely on soil moisture to maintain transpiration while it is unclear how long the limited amount of stem water in these arctic shrubs can sustain transpiration it is likely not beyond one day fig 4 in context of the hydrologic budget established by kane et al 2004 arctic shrub stem water content is a minor component for the tundra site estimates of stem water content are 3 of winter precipitation 2 of summer precipitation 2 of runoff and 2 of summer et as measured over an 11 year period kane et al 2004 the low stem water storage measured here indicates that arctic shrubs likely play an important role in the terrestrial water cycle and the energy budget through transpiration the timing of stem water changes during the growing season reported here show similarities to fine scale temperature sensitivity in a dendrochronology study and to stem phenology in a nearby dendrometer study using a shrub ring chronology network consisting of 6 species spanning 18 sites on the north slope of alaska andreu hayles et al 2020 found maximum daily air temperature may 31 to july 9 had the greatest control on ring width this period for shrub growth spans the time of leaf development beginning in june and reaching a maximum in july and increases in stem water over the same period figs 4 s3 s5 cold de hardening start as indicated by increase in stem diameter in salix spp at a nearby site corresponds to stem moisture increases noted at the tundra shrub site in mid may figure s5 julian day 120 130 brown et al 2022 stem water content could add value to studies of shrub phenology and climate sensitivity when combined with high resolution dendrometers dobbert et al 2021 suggest a thermal limitation of growth for b nana possibly attributed to root zone temperatures in summer high temporal resolution stem moisture measurements could be used to provide information on plant water status during these periods of stress building on the work of dobbert et al 2022 tdr measurement of stem water content could be used in combination with dendrometers to aid in the interpretation of reversible water related and irreversible growth related stem increments the method presented here for measuring water content of shrub stems using tdr probes provides estimates of stem water content the calibration equations for each of the three species ranged from a poor to moderate fit r2 values 0 19 0 43 but nonetheless quantified the stem water storage by arctic shrubs and highlighted the tight coupling of soil moisture and transpiration in the controlled calibration drying experiment the individual tdr measurements exhibited noise relative to the steadily declining stem water content which we speculate is due to a limited physical connection between the tdr probe and the stem wood compared to probes embedded in trees or soil additionally the small shrub stems may have posed a problem selecting larger stems for future work could improve the technique future work should also consider using smaller diameter 1mm tdr probes inserted horizontally in the shrub stem for a better electrical connection despite these limitations this method provides a means to quantify the storage of water in shrub dominated ecosystems and can be applied using the recommendations described here future work should analyze the temporal relationship between shrub vwc and relevant enivornmental variables supplementary materials the following are

marine ecosystem 2 methods 2 1 study area and dataset collection the study area was located in coastal waters of the yellow sea northern china and four study sites were selected according to the gradient of pollution fig 1 a d site a a relatively clean area situated in the olympic sailing center area site b a slightly polluted area located near the mouth of jiaozhou bay site c a moderately polluted area with minor discharge from rivers in jiaozhou bay and site d a heavily polluted area in jiaozhou bay stressed mainly by organic pollutants and nutrients from the discharge of domestic sewage and industrial discharge via several rivers fig 1 protozoan samples were collected every month over a 1 year cycle from august 2011 to july 2012 using microscopic glass slides as an artificial substratum at a depth of 1 m a total of 960 glass slides 2 5 7 5cm were used to collect the protozoan fauna at a depth of 1m below the water surface two pvc frames with 20 slides for each sampling site were collected after the exposure time of 14 days glass slides were transferred into the petri dishes containing habitat water of each sampling site and then stored in a cooling box before transporting to the laboratory within the 2 h for identification and enumeration xu et al 2014 kazmi et al 2020 identification and enumeration of protozoans were performed under an inverted microscope

and the permanova v1 0 7 for primer anderson et al 2008 the shade plot with clustering analysis was used to summarize the functional unit distribution of the protozoan periphytons among four sampling sites anderson et al 2008 using the submodule cap canonical analysis of principal coordinates of permanova on bray curtis similarities from the transformed species abundance the spatial differences in functional units among the four sampling sites were summarized while the environmental status of the four sampling sites was summarized based on euclidean distances from the log transformed normalized abiotic data anderson et al 2008 the metric multidimensional scaling mmds ordination based on the bootstrapped average analysis were used to show the variations in the functional unit patterns of the protozoan periphytons and environmental variables among four sampling sites clarke and gorley 2015 permanova test was used to signify the differences in the functional unit patterns among four sampling sites anderson et al 2008 the significance level of biota environment correlations was tested using the routine relate following the submodule bioenv biota environment correlation analysis to explore the potential environmental drivers for changes of the protozoan functional units along the pollution gradient clarke and gorley 2006 xu et al 2008 jiang et al 2011 2013b xu et al 2014 correlation analyses were performed using statistical program spss v16 0 to observe the pearson correlation coefficient between fus diversity and environmental variables xu et al 2008 xu et al 2014 3 results 3 1 physico chemical environmental variables significant variations have been observed in abiotic factors along the pollution gradient from site a to d respectively worth mentioning site d heavily polluted area showed the lowest salinity and ph values whereas do and transparency were observed to be increased gradually from sites a to d meanwhile nh4 n was observed to be increased from a to d sites however lower values of srp and no3 n were recorded at sites a and b clean slightly polluted area as compared to the sites c and d moderately heavily polluted area table s1 3 2 spatial distribution of functional units the observed species list with functional units fus and abundance of the protozoan periphytons at four sampling sites during one year study period have been showed in table s2 a total of 144 protozoan species have been identified which were assigned into 53 fus table s2 the spatial distribution of 53 fus among four sampling sites were summarized in fig 2 based on the index of association matrix from standardized fu abundance data the clustering analysis divided 53 fus into four groups i iv fig 2a groups i and ii showed a decreasing trend from clean area site a to heavily polluted area site d whereas groups iii and iv generally represented a revert gradient in particular group iiib fig 2 3 3 spatial variations in the patterns of functional units the protozoan samples showed clear spatial variations in functional unit patterns from site a to d fig 3 in clean area site a the bacterivores and raptors with inside and outside feeding source were predominant during the period of june to october and were primary contributors during the july to october at site b fig 3a b at site c the dominant fus were raptors feeder with inside food supply during jan to june fig 3c however it should be noted that the sessile bacterivores with outside food source e g bos5s generally dominated the samples during april to july period from clean area site a to heavily polluted area site d while the other fus showed an invert trend fig 3d the cap ordinations and vector overlays on correlations 0 25 demonstrated that the pattern of fus at three sites was discriminated from those in all polluted areas site b c by cap 1 fig 4 a it should be addressed that of the vectors with correlation 0 25 the fu bos2s i e small bacterivores with outside resource of food supply were pointing towards samples at site a while the fu bos5s i e large bacterivores with outside resource of food supply pointed towards the samples in heavily polluted area site d fig 4a furthermore the permanova test revealed that there was a significant difference in the protozoan fus pattern among four sampling sites pseudo f 2 1829 p 0 05 and the patterns of all polluted samples were significantly different from those in clean area t 1 7 1 8 p 0 05 3 4 linkage between biotic and abiotic factors the cap ordinations and vector on the correlations 0 25 on abiotic data revealed a similar pattern to the biotic data fig 4b by cap2 it is clear that the vectors nh4 n and no3 n directly pointed towards sample in heavily polluted area site d while the transparency was towards samples in clean area site a fig 4b based on bootstrapped average analyses on both biotic and abiotic matrices mmds ordinations revealed a similar pattern between both datasets the continuous overlapping patterns with pollution gradients were presented by biotic and abiotic factors fig 5 a and b the relate analysis revealed significant relationship between the fus patterns and changes in environmental variables ρ 0 467 p 0 05 based on the multivariate biota environment bioenv analysis top 10 matches of environmental factors with the protozoan fus pattern were mainly nutrients nh4 n and no3 n with the combination of do table 1 pearson correlation coefficients showed that 14 fus were significant correlated with environmental variables table 2 for example bos5s aos2p v aos7s and bis3v were significant positively correlated with nh4 n while ais8v aos3v aos6v bos5v and ris4s were significant positively correlated to transparency p 0 05 table 2 the numbers of fus showed a significant positive relationship to nh4 n but a significant negative correlation with do and transparency p 0 05 whereas the abundances of fus represented a revert case table 3 of three biodiversity indices at fus resolution the fus richness dfu was significant positively correlated with nh4 n while the other indices jfu and hfu showed a significant negative relationship to do p 0 01 table 3 however it should be noted that these indices were significantly influenced by the environmental variables among all the four sampling sites 4 discussion recent studies have reported that there is a strong signal to noise ratio due to the functional redundancy at species abundance resolution when using the communities of protozoans for the assessment of environmental ecological quality status jiang et al 2014 zhong et al 2014 hunter jr et al 2016 contrary to this the community level bioindicators based on a small taxonomic or functional traits are considered as more effective towards environmental heterogeneity xu g et al 2014 zhong et al 2014 xu g and xu 2017 therefore in this study we have identified 53 fus based on four biological traits feeding type resource of food supply body size rank and movement type of the protozoan periphytons to make sure about the hypothesis that the fus of the protozoan fauna may be used as a potential bioindicators of water quality status in marine ecosystems in this study the functional units of the protozoan fauna showed a significant variations among four sampling sites a d among these functional units the functional traits of feeding type and source of the food supply were primary contributors and were variable at different pollution gradients in particular the large sessile bacterivores feeding on food supply from plankton e g bos5s zoothamnium spp occurred in high abundance at moderately or heavily polluted areas c and d while the other fus e g bis1v aspidisca spp showed decreasing trend from clean site a to the polluted ones b d whereas the large algivores were consistently dominated the clean and moderately polluted sites a b including a1s6v diophrys spp a1s7v condylostoma spp however in contrast algivores were dominated on heavily polluted site d a1s2v hartmannula spp interestingly the small raptors ris1s ephelota spp were found to be increasingly dominated from clean to the polluted sites a d indicating that the ecosystem functions of the protozoan fauna altered significantly among the different water quality status these results were consistent with hamels et al 2004 reported the dominance of ciliated protozoa is related to the environmental quality in the water columns in contrast to this paganelli et al 2012 and wong and dowd 2015 in their studies on marine benthos reported that the environmental variations and pollution gradients can altered the distribution of functional traits of the communities on spatio temporal scales therefore it can be assumed that the food supply from the water may directly influence the composition of functional traits and these traits may indirectly reflecting the water quality present study showed that the patterns of functional units of protozoan periphytons were significantly associated with variations in environmental variables in particular the nutrients nh4 n and or no3 n in combination with do furthermore the pearson correlation coefficients demonstrated that the large and small size bacterivores fus e g bos5s and bis3v were significantly positively correlated to nh4 n while large and small algivores fus e g ais8v aos6v and aos3v and small raptors fus e g ris4s were significantly positively correlated with transparency however medium size non selective protozoan periphyton fus e g nis4v and ris4s were positively correlated with do p 0 05 these findings were consistent with zhong et al 2017 reported that the functional traits of protozoan communities have strong correlations with environmental variables therefore we can conclude that the functional units of the protozoan periphytons may reflect the water quality status and these fus might be used as a useful bioindicator of water quality status in marine ecosystems biodiversity parameters such as species number richness evenness and diversity have widely been used as a traditional bioindicators to discriminate environmental ecological quality status shi et al 2012 xu et al 2012a 2012b zhang et al 2012b in our study however all these parameters at fu resolution had higher values in samples at less stressed sites a and b than in those at more polluted sites c and d for example the fus number and richness indices were significantly positively correlated with nh4 n whereas the fus diversity and evenness were significantly negatively correlated with do furthermore the lower value of the functional units diversity and functional units richness were found in the clean sites a and b showed low heterogeneity in these sites during the whole study period however contrary to this generally the higher values of these indices indicate better water quality status with the possible exception of low levels of organic pollution ismael and dorgham 2003 thus it can be hypothesized that the diversity indices of functional units of protozoan periphytons maybe the valuable indicators of aquatic pollution which can be used to evaluate the water quality status in marine ecosystems in conclusion the fus of protozoan periphytons represented a significant variation in spatial distribution and were driven by the increasing levels of nutrients e g nh4 n and decreasing ranks of do among four sampling sites the bacterivorous fus e g bos5s and bis3v were significantly positively related to nh4 n while the vagile algivorous fus e g ais8v aos3v aos6v and sessile predators e g ris4s were significantly positively correlated with transparency therefore it is suggested that fus of protozoan periphytons may be used as a useful

xu 2016 zhao et al 2016 modes of locomotion planktonic p sessile s and vagile v a combination composite of four traits designated as functional units fus of protozoan periphytons proposed as possible bioindicators of water quality status in marine environment as these functional units clearly represents the assemblage of the functional traits of periphytic protozoans moreover the functional units of the protozoan periphytons can be used as potential bioindicators of water quality status in marine ecosystems kazmi et al 2021a briefly to highlight the potential application of the functional units of protozoan periphytons for monitoring water quality status a 1 year cycle baseline study was conducted in coastal waters of yellow sea northern china with following objectives 1 to examine the response of functional units patterns in different water quality status 2 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the functional units for indication of water quality status using protozoan periphytons in marine ecosystem 2 methods 2 1 study area and dataset collection the study area was located in coastal waters of the yellow sea northern china and four study sites were selected according to the gradient of pollution fig 1 a d site a a relatively clean area situated in the olympic sailing center area site b a slightly polluted area located near the mouth of jiaozhou bay site c a moderately polluted area with minor discharge from rivers in jiaozhou bay and site d a heavily polluted area in jiaozhou bay stressed mainly by organic pollutants and nutrients from the discharge of domestic sewage and industrial discharge via several rivers fig 1 protozoan samples were collected every month over a 1 year cycle from august 2011 to july 2012 using microscopic glass slides as an artificial substratum at a depth of 1 m a total of 960 glass slides 2 5 7 5cm were used to collect the protozoan fauna at a depth of 1m below the water surface two pvc frames with 20 slides for each sampling site were collected after the exposure time of 14 days glass slides were transferred into the petri dishes containing habitat water of each sampling site and then stored in a cooling box before transporting to the laboratory within the 2 h for identification and enumeration xu et al 2014 kazmi et al 2020 identification and enumeration of protozoans were performed under an inverted microscope with magnification of 10 400x kazmi et al 2021b the references key for species identification were followed according to song et al 2009 the enumeration strategy was followed xu et al 2014 wtw multi

and the permanova v1 0 7 for primer anderson et al 2008 the shade plot with clustering analysis was used to summarize the functional unit distribution of the protozoan periphytons among four sampling sites anderson et al 2008 using the submodule cap canonical analysis of principal coordinates of permanova on bray curtis similarities from the transformed species abundance the spatial differences in functional units among the four sampling sites were summarized while the environmental status of the four sampling sites was summarized based on euclidean distances from the log transformed normalized abiotic data anderson et al 2008 the metric multidimensional scaling mmds ordination based on the bootstrapped average analysis were used to show the variations in the functional unit patterns of the protozoan periphytons and environmental variables among four sampling sites clarke and gorley 2015 permanova test was used to signify the differences in the functional unit patterns among four sampling sites anderson et al 2008 the significance level of biota environment correlations was tested using the routine relate following the submodule bioenv biota environment correlation analysis to explore the potential environmental drivers for changes of the protozoan functional units along the pollution gradient clarke and gorley 2006 xu et al 2008 jiang et al 2011 2013b xu et al 2014 correlation analyses were performed using statistical program spss v16 0 to observe the pearson correlation coefficient between fus diversity and environmental variables xu et al 2008 xu et al 2014 3 results 3 1 physico chemical environmental variables significant variations have been observed in abiotic factors along the pollution gradient from site a to d respectively worth mentioning site d heavily polluted area showed the lowest salinity and ph values whereas do and transparency were observed to be increased gradually from sites a to d meanwhile nh4 n was observed to be increased from a to d sites however lower values of srp and no3 n were recorded at sites a and b clean slightly polluted area as compared to the sites c and d moderately heavily polluted area table s1 3 2 spatial distribution of functional units the observed species list with functional units fus and abundance of the protozoan periphytons at four sampling sites during one year study period have been showed in table s2 a total of 144 protozoan species have been identified which were assigned into 53 fus table s2 the spatial distribution of 53 fus among four sampling sites were summarized in fig 2 based on the index of association matrix from standardized fu abundance data the clustering analysis divided 53 fus into four groups i iv fig 2a groups i and ii showed a decreasing trend from clean area site a to heavily polluted area site d whereas groups iii and iv generally represented a revert gradient in particular group iiib fig 2 3 3 spatial variations in the patterns of functional units the protozoan samples showed clear spatial variations in functional unit patterns from site a to d fig 3 in clean area site a the bacterivores and raptors with inside and outside feeding source were predominant during the period of june to october and were primary contributors during the july to october at site b fig 3a b at site c the dominant fus were raptors feeder with inside food supply during jan to june fig 3c however it should be noted that the sessile bacterivores with outside food source e g bos5s generally dominated the samples during april to july period from clean area site a to heavily polluted area site d while the other fus showed an invert trend fig 3d the cap ordinations and vector overlays on correlations 0 25 demonstrated that the pattern of fus at three sites was discriminated from those in all polluted areas site b c by cap 1 fig 4 a it should be addressed that of the vectors with correlation 0 25 the fu bos2s i e small bacterivores with outside resource of food supply were pointing towards samples at site a while the fu bos5s i e large bacterivores with outside resource of food supply pointed towards the samples in heavily polluted area site d fig 4a furthermore the permanova test revealed that there was a significant difference in the protozoan fus pattern among four sampling sites pseudo f 2 1829 p 0 05 and the patterns of all polluted samples were significantly different from those in clean area t 1 7 1 8 p 0 05 3 4 linkage between biotic and abiotic factors the cap ordinations and vector on the correlations 0 25 on abiotic data revealed a similar pattern to the biotic data fig 4b by cap2 it is clear that the vectors nh4 n and no3 n directly pointed towards sample in heavily polluted area site d while the transparency was towards samples in clean area site a fig 4b based on bootstrapped average analyses on both biotic and abiotic matrices mmds ordinations revealed a similar pattern between both datasets the continuous overlapping patterns with pollution gradients were presented by biotic and abiotic factors fig 5 a and b the relate analysis revealed significant relationship between the fus patterns and changes in environmental variables ρ 0 467 p 0 05 based on the multivariate biota environment bioenv analysis top 10 matches of environmental factors with the protozoan fus pattern were mainly nutrients nh4 n and no3 n with the combination of do table 1 pearson correlation coefficients showed that 14 fus were significant correlated with environmental variables table 2 for example bos5s aos2p v aos7s and bis3v were significant positively correlated with nh4 n while ais8v aos3v aos6v bos5v and ris4s were significant positively correlated to transparency p 0 05 table 2 the numbers of fus showed a significant positive relationship to nh4 n but a significant negative correlation with do and transparency p 0 05 whereas the abundances of fus represented a revert case table 3 of three biodiversity indices at fus resolution the fus richness dfu was significant positively correlated with nh4 n while the other indices jfu and hfu showed a significant negative relationship to do p 0 01 table 3 however it should be noted that these indices were significantly influenced by the environmental variables among all the four sampling sites 4 discussion recent studies have reported that there is a strong signal to noise ratio due to the functional redundancy at species abundance resolution when using the communities of protozoans for the assessment of environmental ecological quality status jiang et al 2014 zhong et al 2014 hunter jr et al 2016 contrary to this the community level bioindicators based on a small taxonomic or functional traits are considered as more effective towards environmental heterogeneity xu g et al 2014 zhong et al 2014 xu g and xu 2017 therefore in this study we have identified 53 fus based on four biological traits feeding type resource of food supply body size rank and movement type of the protozoan periphytons to make sure about the hypothesis that the fus of the protozoan fauna may be used as a potential bioindicators of water quality status in marine ecosystems in this study the functional units of the protozoan fauna showed a significant variations among four sampling sites a d among these functional units the functional traits of feeding type and source of the food supply were primary contributors and were variable at different pollution gradients in particular the large sessile bacterivores feeding on food supply from plankton e g bos5s zoothamnium spp occurred in high abundance at moderately or heavily polluted areas c and d while the other fus e g bis1v aspidisca spp showed decreasing trend from clean site a to the polluted ones b d whereas the large algivores were consistently dominated the clean and moderately polluted sites a b including a1s6v diophrys spp a1s7v condylostoma spp however in contrast algivores were dominated on heavily polluted site d a1s2v hartmannula spp interestingly the small raptors ris1s ephelota spp were found to be increasingly dominated from clean to the polluted sites a d indicating that the ecosystem functions of the protozoan fauna altered significantly among the different water quality status these results were consistent with hamels et al 2004 reported the dominance of ciliated protozoa is related to the environmental quality in the water columns in contrast to this paganelli et al 2012 and wong and dowd 2015 in their studies on marine benthos reported that the environmental variations and pollution gradients can altered the distribution of functional traits of the communities on spatio temporal scales therefore it can be assumed that the food supply from the water may directly influence the composition of functional traits and these traits may indirectly reflecting the water quality present study showed that the patterns of functional units of protozoan periphytons were significantly associated with variations in environmental variables in particular the nutrients nh4 n and or no3 n in combination with do furthermore the pearson correlation coefficients demonstrated that the large and small size bacterivores fus e g bos5s and bis3v were significantly positively correlated to nh4 n while large and small algivores fus e g ais8v aos6v and aos3v and small raptors fus e g ris4s were significantly positively correlated with transparency however medium size non selective protozoan periphyton fus e g nis4v and ris4s were positively correlated with do p 0 05 these findings were consistent with zhong et al 2017 reported that the functional traits of protozoan communities have strong correlations with environmental variables therefore we can conclude that the functional units of the protozoan periphytons may reflect the water quality status and these fus might be used as a useful bioindicator of water quality status in marine ecosystems biodiversity parameters such as species number richness evenness and diversity have widely been used as a traditional bioindicators to discriminate environmental ecological quality status shi et al 2012 xu et al 2012a 2012b zhang et al 2012b in our study however all these parameters at fu resolution had higher values in samples at less stressed sites a and b than in those at more polluted sites c and d for example the fus number and richness indices were significantly positively correlated with nh4 n whereas the fus diversity and evenness were significantly negatively correlated with do furthermore the lower value of the functional units diversity and functional units richness were found in the clean sites a and b showed low heterogeneity in these sites during the whole study period however contrary to this generally the higher values of these indices indicate better water quality status with the possible exception of low levels of organic pollution ismael and dorgham 2003 thus it can be hypothesized that the diversity indices of functional units of protozoan periphytons maybe the valuable indicators of aquatic pollution which can be used to evaluate the water quality status in marine ecosystems in conclusion the fus of protozoan periphytons represented a significant variation in spatial distribution and were driven by the increasing levels of nutrients e g nh4 n and decreasing ranks of do among four sampling sites the bacterivorous fus e g bos5s and bis3v were significantly positively related to nh4 n while the vagile algivorous fus e g ais8v aos3v aos6v and sessile predators e g ris4s were significantly positively correlated with transparency therefore it is suggested that fus of protozoan periphytons may be used as a useful bioindicators of water quality status in marine ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

952,coevolution of living things and their surroundings contributes to the biodiversity on earth combining with the abiotic biotic regulatory concept the gaia theory and the philosophical view in ancient china we believe the physical river evolution must somehow takes on biological evolution characteristics and the river biosphere could be an anti entropic system and develop towards the higher beings here beyond the traditional understanding of river we redefine a kind of systematic out branching dragon style river which is characterized by a systematic connection between the stable unobstructed main channel and the active open abducent out branches under some high resistant environmental conditions especially in tropical and polar zones it has the potential to help detect the signatures of life on other planets which are similar in river landscape to earth keywords coevolution systematic out branching river anti entropic system biological significance 1 introduction earth can be roughly divided into three main climatic zones according to lines of latitude tropical temperate and polar each of these zones has its own typical climate animal and plant life hydrology and some other natural landscape characteristics the obvious zonality is one of the basic laws of geographic environment of the earth the classic evolutionary theory gould 2002 pigliucci and müller 2010 explains that all organic beings tend to increase however limited spaces and resources would inevitably lead the life growth into a struggle for existence state evolution occurs when biological populations struggle to survive and reproduce in their respective environments it is this process of evolution that includes character mutation gene mutation natural selection and geographic isolation etc has given rise to biodiversity in the different climatic zones and yet competition for existence is just one of the stimulative factors on biological evolution there also exists innovatory evolution besides adaptive evolution xu 2012 xu et al 2005 biological system is an open system with dissipation structure and anti entropic self organized structure the anti entropy mechanism can absorb transform save the disorganized energy for the system automatically slow the entropy increasing and greatly improves the levels of biological innovation under a steady supply of matter and energy such formations as cells from complex organics metazoans from single cells hard bones from metazoans appendages and wings in arthropods chlorophylls eyes are the innovation results of various trials and errors under the induction of anti entropy mechanism xu et al 2005 the earth biosphere is an overall anti entropic system the energy of the low forms of life are continuously transferred into the higher beings the living nature develops in the direction of enhancing anti entropy capacity in general wildlife at various levels constitute an intricate food web and at the same time a harmonious and anti entropic relation network xu et al 2005 2 biological significance of river evolutions as the linkage of continents and oceans river ecosystem plays a vital role in matter cycling the biocoenosis and river environment act upon each other push forward the development of this complex open dynamic nonequilibrium nonlinear river system together as an important representative the abiotic biotic regulatory concept abrc model was formulated in the 1980 s and has been widely discussed in the aspect of underlining the hierarchy of abiotic and biotic drivers in shaping the riverine ecosystems zalewski et al 2021 zalewski 2015 zalewski 2013 besides the controversial gaia theory mcguire 1993 fairbairn 1994 volk 2003 lenton and wilkinson 2003 turney 2005 daszak et al 2008 arthur and nicholson 2017 holds that all the living things and their physical environments are closely united into a whole self organizing system lovelock 1989 1995 traditional culture of chinese especially taoism is rich in ecological wisdom goodman 1980 peter et al 2008 sylvan and bennett 1988 and also emphasizes that everything are mutual restraint mutual infiltration and mutual transformation the above synergetic effect in rivers means that the physical river evolution necessarily takes on biological evolution characteristics which weren t considered seriously enough in this respect for long periods of time in river dynamics studies in our opinion in a possible unknown sense river morphology reflects the biological activity of a specific area on the planet carvalho carneiro de mendonça et al 2021 hopper et al 2021 ulloa et al 2020 see fig 1 for the graphical description of the above way of thinking based on morphological characteristics rivers are mainly categorized into three patterns meandering anabranching and braided in tradition eaton et al 2010 leopold and wolman 1957 van den berg 1995 we find that these various forms are in common as follow external banklines are smooth and simple internal environments are complex and multi branching all could be redefined as a kind of introverted development modes crucially if regarding meandering river as a baseline and considering bed resistance as internal river problem bank resistance bank friction and the resistance caused by riparian vegetation is the dominant factor of controlling the transformation of such river modes eaton et al 2010 song and bai 2015 xin et al 2017 if the constituent materials are mostly non cohesive soil meandering could easily become anabranching or braided schumm and khan 1971 song et al 2016 while when adding some cohesive sediments local bank collapse possibly appears around the down apex only under long term action of flow the slump block failure may be taken to the downstream channel or ends up on the river bed as a sediment buffer in front of the bank crosato 2008 during this whole process the bank gaps are enlarged the bank lines retreat and the bend curvatures are intensified yet the meandering morphology are well maintained dulal and shimizu 2010 the formation of the often discussed floodplain van dijk et al 2013 scrolled bars van de lageweg et al 2013 chute cutoffs van dijk et al 2012 and meander cutoffs han and endreny 2014 can be captured perfectly and then based on the clay mixed sediments increasing riparian vegetation coverage has been further proven to be more effective in enhancing channel stability allen et al 2016 kobayashi and mori 2017 bai et al 2018 yang et al 2018 reducing bank erosion relieving internal branching phenomenon bertoldi et al 2015 and improving ecological environment kim et al 2015 the key of all the discussion is the introverted developments are gradually weakened but never changed with the growth of bank resistance also inspired by the conception that only when abiotic water factors become stable and predictable the biotic factors would start to manifest themselves zalewski 2015 our question arises in higher resistance situations what would happen next when a bank collapse mutation occurs is there any possible some magic or innovative changes in the evolution of river systems like biological evolution under the environmental pressure 3 systematic out branching rivers across the world the surface geological conditions in high latitude and cold regions are mainly permafrost the climate in tropical areas of low latitudes are humid hot resulting in their superhigh coverage of land vegetation macroscopically speaking the river bank environment resistances for water flow in the both zones obviously exceed the level of temperate mid latitudes therefore primary part observations are firstly performed on these locations see fig 2 for some examples we have found what is to our knowledge the first description of the systematic out branching phenomenon in these high resistance rivers to some extent like that of biological innovatory evolution on pressure situations obviously the generated outward branches in turn influence the dynamical evolution process of the main channel the overall system is characterized by stable unobstructed main channel and active open abducent out branches a kind of seemingly self adapting extroverted development modes traditional theories blondeaux and seminara 1985 ikeda et al 1981 imran et al 1999 johannesson and parker 2013 on the transformation from mildly meandering to internal branching braided cannot describe the new found inner outer multi channel river systems owing to the lack of enough decades or even hundreds of years of image data their forming process has remained a mystery however in the simplest case it can be imagined that it is the bank collapses that occurred randomly in local specific locations triggered the systematic mutation then the flow made branches in the bank gaps through the conflict with environment resistances and work out an independent development journey finally main channel system and out branch subsystems interact each other and run on together for mutual development in nature the majority are the traditional introverted developed river patterns the systematic out branching rivers belong to the minority innovations rather than the product of mechanism for selecting the superior and eliminating the inferior see fig 3 for some evident traces of evolution and degeneration between out branching high level beings and introverted developed mid low level beings rivers with the variation of the input of matter and energy we can also get to know the important role of the anti entropy mechanism in driving the stable development of out branching rivers and to some extent the fundamental biological characteristics that contained in this form of river morphology it can also be considered that the existence of such high low level beings for rivers are in analogy with nature s food chain on the earth the entire rivers together make up a kind of organic river web to some extent river managements could benefit much from such understanding and wouldn t need to blindly struggle to maintain single and stable river morphologies in engineering practice the global distribution state and geometrical characteristics of systematic out branching rivers remain a huge blank which would lay an important foundation for system wide understanding of river environmental structures and also help to provide new insights into the detect of the signatures of life on other planets which are similar in river landscape to earth after two years of manual statistics based on remote sensing images at the end of this article the statistical dataset characteristics that map the global extent and could facilitate the generalized understanding of these dragon style rivers are given in fig 4 in particular considering the limited quantity of such rivers around the world and the deficiencies of pattern recognition technologies we depicted the river bank lines by manual work and combined the arcgis and autocad to extract the geometrical characteristics based on the ideal model of fig 4a the parameterized relationships reveal some similar characteristics for both the tropical and polar zones and underline some singularities among the different latitudinal bands in the future combining with the field investigations we believe the data could not only make for the optimization design of river branch plant configurations at different latitudes but could play a guiding role for improving the alien river recognition 4 conclusion traditional views of river evolution mechanism have always been overly concerned with the purely physical interaction of water sediment vegetation etc however the coevolution of living things and their surroundings must bring the explanation plight to a diversity of river morphology in this paper the conception of a kind of systematic out branching dragon style river is extracted and purified as a representative of higher river being under the reciprocal effect of some specific organisms in specific circumstances in our opinion in the direction of coevolutionary logic the dragon style river could guide not only the structure optimization of river branch plant and the biological detection in an environment but also support the establishment of habitable zones on other planets it means under the harmonious states between river morphology and biology the positive maintenance and development of some systematic out branching dragon style river patterns could create the matter and energy conditions for forward evolution of living things and in turn the biological flourishing could consolidate and improve the water sediment environment in the systematic out branching river basins further research on the highly active dragon style rivers are of great value to fluvial dynamics in the discipline and biological development outside the discipline declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

rather than the product of mechanism for selecting the superior and eliminating the inferior see fig 3 for some evident traces of evolution and degeneration between out branching high level beings and introverted developed mid low level beings rivers with the variation of the input of matter and energy we can also get to know the important role of the anti entropy mechanism in driving the stable development of out branching rivers and to some extent the fundamental biological characteristics that contained in this form of river morphology it can also be considered that the existence of such high low level beings for rivers are in analogy with nature s food chain on the earth the entire rivers together make up a kind of organic river web to some extent river managements could benefit much from such understanding and wouldn t need to blindly struggle to maintain single and stable river morphologies in engineering practice the global distribution state and geometrical characteristics of systematic out branching rivers remain a huge blank which would lay an important foundation for system wide understanding of river environmental structures and also help to provide new insights into the detect of the signatures of life on other planets which are similar in river landscape to earth after two years of manual statistics based on remote sensing images at the end of this article the statistical dataset characteristics that map the global extent and could facilitate the generalized understanding of these dragon style rivers are given in fig 4 in particular considering the limited quantity of such rivers around the world and the deficiencies of pattern recognition technologies we depicted the river bank lines by manual work and combined the arcgis and autocad to extract the geometrical characteristics based on the ideal model of fig 4a the parameterized relationships reveal some similar characteristics for both the tropical and polar zones and underline some singularities among the different latitudinal bands in the future combining with the field investigations we believe the data could not only make for the optimization design of river branch plant configurations at different latitudes but could play a guiding role for improving the alien river recognition 4 conclusion traditional views of river evolution mechanism have always been overly concerned with the purely physical interaction of water sediment vegetation etc however the coevolution of living things and their surroundings must bring the explanation plight to a diversity of river morphology in this paper the conception of a kind of systematic out branching dragon style river is extracted and purified as a representative of higher river being under the reciprocal effect of some specific organisms in specific circumstances in our opinion in the direction of coevolutionary logic the dragon style river could guide not only the structure optimization of river branch plant and the biological detection in an environment but also support the establishment of habitable zones on other planets it means under the harmonious states between river morphology and biology the positive maintenance and development of some systematic out branching dragon style river patterns could create the matter and energy conditions for forward evolution of living things and in turn the biological flourishing could consolidate and improve the water sediment environment in the systematic out branching river basins further research on the highly active dragon style rivers are of

953,in the present study it was analyzed the structure of mesozooplankton community and their spatio temporal variations along the caeté river estuary northeast of pará brazil samples were collected during spring tides conducted in nychthemeral cycles in three fixed sectors located along the studied estuary inner s1 middle s2 and outer s3 using conical plankton nets of 200 μm mesh size samplings were performed in september 2014 dry season and march 2015 rainy season totaling 54 samples a total of 25 mesozooplankton species were recorded being the copepods the most diversified group 21 species mostly dominated by estuarine and coastal species the most abundant mesozooplankton species presented significantly higher densities p 0 0001 between the middle pseudodiaptomus richardi 583 8 956 5

increasing toward the mouth of the estuary except for p richardi spearman s correlation rs demonstrated that the salinity turbidity dissolved nutrients and chlorophyll a concentrations were the prevailing environmental variables associated with significant spatial changes of mesozooplankton distribution in this area overall the results showed that spatial variation in the water physicochemical characteristics of the caeté estuary have significant effects on the structure and succession of the mesozooplankton which may potentially affect the functioning and biodiversity of this coastal ecosystem keywords tropical estuary plankton zooplankton salinity river flow 1 introduction estuarine regions have been recognized as a mosaic of habitats and due to their connections with adjoining freshwater and marine ecosystems estuaries act as a transitional ecotone with marked gradients of physical chemical and biological variables van der maarel 1990 atique et al 2017 lee et al 2021 in addition estuaries act as a nursery ground for different aquatic species by providing food and shelter for larvae and juveniles of ecological and economic importance telesh 2004 dorak and albay 2016 yuan et al 2020 these ecosystems also act as a hotspot for many larval stages of nekton benthic or nekton benthic species which spend some time of their lives in the estuarine waters after the planktonic phase the larvae return to their place of origin in pelagic or benthic environments in freshwater coastal or marine waters harris et al 2000 miranda et al 2005 nugroho et al 2019 in estuarine ecosystems zooplankton has a key position in the trophic webs as they are mostly composed of phagotrophic and herbivorous organisms serving as a link between primary planktonic producers phytoplankton and the higher trophic levels with an important contribution to the microbial loop hopkinson jr 1989 ortell and ortmann 2014 magalhães et al 2015 dorak and albay 2016 they are also important in the classic trophic webs occupying a fundamental niche in these environments degerman et al 2018 the estuarine ecotone and inshore fishing profits are always influenced by the zooplankton population due to its role as an essential food item for fish bianchi et al 2003 ayon et al 2008 due to zooplankton large density shorter life span drifting nature high taxa species diversity and different tolerance to the environmental stress they are being used as indicator organisms for the physical chemical and biological processes in the aquatic ecosystems uriarte and villate 2004 longhurst 2007 connelly et al 2020 the seasonal and spatial dominance of certain zooplankton taxa may indicate the relative influence of different water parameters on the estuarine ecosystem and serve as an early indication of a biological response to environmental and or climatic changes hays et al 2005 ziadi et al 2015 in this respect the study of estuarine zooplankton ecology thus demands considerable efforts from the scientific standpoint given the great variety of taxonomic groups size classes and life cycle strategies found in this group of organisms lopes et al 1998 yuan et al 2020 the amazon coastal area includes the world s second largest continuous tract of mangrove forest and is characterized by a high ecological diversity with many deltas sandy beaches and estuaries souza filho et al 2009 nascimento júnior et al 2013 magalhães et al 2015 asp et al 2018 the climate of the region is relatively hot 20 c and wet annual precipitation up to 3 300 mm with very little variation in temperature during the course of the year pereira et al 2009 inmet 2020 the continental shelf extends some 330 km into the atlantic ocean and receives the discharge of the amazon river 16 of the world s river water and dozens of other estuaries consisting in the major run off of sediments nutrients and organic material worldwide demaster and pope 1996 geyer et al 1996 the region is also characterized by a macrotidal regime with maximum tide levels of 8 m in maranhão 6 m in pará and 12 m in amapá pereira et al 2009 dhn 2020 the caeté river estuary is located in this region being one of the most studied estuaries of northeastern pará state and where knowledge about zooplankton communities is relatively limited costa et al 2011 and mostly related to the study of the group copepoda krumme and liang 2004 magalhães et al 2006 2010 atique et al 2017 therefore the objective of the present study was to describe the spatial and temporal seasonal composition density and diversity of the mesozooplankton and the effects of environmental variables on its community dynamics we hypothesize that salinity is the most important factor in explaining the dynamics of local mesozooplankton especially at a spatial scale 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the caeté estuary 0 45 1 07 s 46 50 46 30 w fig 1 is an estuarine environment situated on the amazon macrotidal mangrove coast of the northern brazilian state of pará and is located approximately 150 km east southeast of the mouth of the amazon river dittmar and lara 2001 this ecosystem serves as an important spawning ground and nursery for a wide variety of fishes and crustaceans due to its ample riverine network with dense mangrove vegetation it also plays a major role in the natural filtration of anthropogenic pollutants and acts as an important pathway for nutrients recycling camargo and isaac 2004 pereira et al 2010 monteiro et al 2016 atique et al 2017 the local climate is humid equatorial with two main seasons a dry season august to december and a rainy season normally lasting from december to may moraes et al 2005 pereira et al 2013 inmet 2020 in this last period the precipitation is relatively high often exceeding 2000 mm approximately 70 80 of annual rainfall inmet 2020 air temperatures are consistently high and stable with a mean annual temperature of around 27 c winds also vary seasonally with the greatest intensities occurring during the dry season with more moderate wind speeds being recorded during the rainy season martorano et al 1993 dhn 2020 this estuary can be classified as a well mixed permanently open turbid and shallow estuary with a maximum depth of about 10 m dittmar et al 1999 barletta bergan et al 2002 mean river discharge is approximately 180 m3 s 1

during the flood and ebb phases of the spring tides each sample of zooplankton was collected with a 3 min subsurface horizontal tow of a conical plankton net 200 μm mesh and 0 50 m mouth diameter fitted with a mechanical flowmeter general oceanics 2030r to estimate the volume of water filtered through the net samplings of the three sectors studied were conducted simultaneously one tow per

resulting in a total of 54 samples 9 samplings per sector per day of campaign as soon as they were collected the samples were transferred to 600 ml plastic bottles and preserved in a 4 buffered formaldehyde seawater solution sodium tetraborate in the laboratory the preserved mesozooplankton samples were rinsed to remove the formalin buffer and divided into aliquots between four and eleven times in a folsom splitter to provide standardized subsamples containing approximately 1000 individuals which were then identified björnberg 1981 bradford grieve et al 1999 classified taxonomically worms 2022 and counted in a gridded petri dish under a stereomicroscope the counts for each mesozooplankton species were multiplied by the subsampling factor 4 11 to obtain an estimate of the total

sectors responsible for spatial variation might show the indicator species for the particular sector due to their high dominance among all the groups taxa copepod was not only the dominant one but also well distributed all along the studied sectors group i was composed primarily of samples from sectors 1 and 2 in both seasonal periods salinity levels for these sectors can be considered oligo mesohaline and reflected the elevated contribution of p richardi sim sd 2 23 91 6 in the dry and rainy sim sd 1 98 82 8 seasons group ii by contrast was composed by samples from sector 3 which were

mesohaline and poli euhaline sectors was p richardi 4 discussion 4 1 changes in environmental variables and chl a concentrations according to previous studies developed in estuaries of the amazon coast costa et al 2009 magalhães et al 2009 2011 2015 leite et al 2009 2010 2016 the months of september and march can be considered good representatives of the dry and rainy season respectively the caeté estuary is largely influenced by rainfall and freshwater discharge mainly in the first half of the year magalhães et al 2015 and nandy and mandal 2020 showed that these two variables are very important in tropical countries as it regulates the biogeochemical characteristics of the coastal and estuarine environment influencing the pattern of composition and density of the zooplankton community in the present study each of the environmental variables such as water temperature salinity ph turbidity and do showed remarkable spatio temporal variations in general the lowest salinity values recorded during the rainy season could be attributed to the combined effect of precipitation 2 000 mm and freshwater influx 60 70 of the total drastically reducing salinity mainly in middle s2 sector reduction of approximately 45 of the value observed during the dry season opposite trend was observed in the second half of the year when the greater entry of marine waters promotes an increase in salinity and ph with peaks of up to 35 and 8 8 respectively both observed in the outer s3 sector estuary mouth the presence of a turbidity maximum zone is a common feature of many amazon estuaries pamplona et al 2013 asp et al 2018 the high turbidity observed in the caeté estuary is caused by the mangrove runoff and the resuspension transportation and redistribution of large amounts of fine sediments and mangrove materials within the water column monteiro et al 2016 nutrient concentrations are known to be a significant determinant of estuarine productivity and their spatio temporal variations can play a crucial role by influencing directly the trophic dynamics in the estuarine environments gaonkar et al 2010 nandy and mandal 2020 in tropical regions distribution of nutrients in estuaries is mainly controlled by season tide conditions freshwater runoff from surrounding landmass and anthropogenic sources pamplona et al 2013 monteiro et al 2016 nandy and mandal 2020 as also observed by atique et al 2017 in the caeté estuary nitrate was predominant among nitrogen compounds its spatio temporal variations may be related to phytoplankton consumption making the concentrations of these last compounds relatively low in the estuary as suggested for other estuarine environments of the region studied oliveira et al 2022 queiroz et al 2022 the nitrate concentrations in the present study were higher than those over 70 recorded in northeastern and northern brazilian estuaries such as the barra de jangadas estuary pe noriega et al 2005 and guajará mirim pa estuary santos et al 2020 which could be a consequence of enrichment originated from degradation and remineralization of mangrove debris ortohosphate concentrations were similar to those observed in other tropical estuaries near urban centers pereira filho 2001 noriega et al 2005 santos et al 2020 the use of orthophosphate by phytoplankton and bacteria together with the high input of freshwater nutrient concentrations dilution into the estuarine system during the rainy season contributes to its reduction mainly in the inner s1 sector of the environment studied according to movellán 2003 it s likely that the interactions of ortohosphate with suspended matter represent an important mechanism with the particulate fraction containing a greater amount of this element mainly when the estuary presents high turbidity as is the case of caeté estuary dissolved silicate dsi is an important nutrient in coastal water which is used by planktonic diatoms for cell division and growth fernandes 1994 zhang et al 2020 the dissolved silicate dsi derived from terrigenous source is considered the inorganic nutrient with the highest concentrations in estuaries pamplona et al 2013 monteiro et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 oliveira et al 2022 in this study the seasonal river discharge was the predominant influencing factor on the seasonal dsi flux therefore the high nutrient loads in the rainy season could possibly be attributed to the large freshwater discharges induced by rainfall in this case the high concentrations of silicate in the waters of the caeté river estuary mainly during the rainy season is a result of the intense leaching of sediments through weathering along the margins of the estuary and mangroves overall nutrient concentrations found in the inner s1 sector of the caeté estuary were similar to those recorded in other highly populated and industrialized brazilian estuaries e g flores montes et al 2011 alves et al 2013 cotovicz et al 2013 according to monteiro et al 2016 in the caeté estuary nutrient input is more accentuated in the inner s1 sector of the estuary where 90 of the local population live and a high incidence of commercial activities public markets ice factories and boat repairing among others is concentrated according to these authors a peculiarity of caeté estuary is that the river discharge from the caeté basin contributes to the dilution of effluents released into the estuary mainly during the rainy season when the river runoff is the highest an average monthly river discharge of about 45 0 m3 s 1 or more can be considered to be the threshold to converting river flow into an efficient mechanism that significantly reduces the impact of released effluents in this estuary as previously noted by these authors the highest chl a concentrations recorded at the beginning of the rainy season was a consequence of the increase in phytoplankton biomass mainly in the inner s1 and middle s2 sectors observed during the period of fluvial discharge rising and high nitrate availability in the middle s2 and dsi availability in all the three sectors of the estuary diatoms use to be the dominant taxa in the estuaries of the amazon region and the increase in silicate concentrations during the rainy season can stimulate phytoplankton growth as suggested by previous studies developed in the region oliveira et al 2022 queiroz et al 2022 the strong tidal currents recorded during this period may also have contributed to the resuspension of benthic photosynthetic species which were considered abundant in the microphytoplankton community as previously observed by pereira et al 2010 for this environment and by other authors santos et al 2008 sousa et al 2008 2009 matos et al 2012 2016 pereira et al 2012 for other coastal amazon environments in this region the occurrence of macrotidal regimes high energy the high turbulent mixture and bottom sediment re suspension could contribute to the presence of phytobenthonic species in the water column tychoplankton besides the turbidity seems not to limit primary productivity by restricting the penetration of sunlight since peaks in chl a indirect measure of biomass and consequently of productivity concentrations were observed in regions of high turbidity see figs 3c and 3l the influence of biological activity of photosynthetic organisms might also be responsible for the high do concentrations recorded during the rainy season furthermore the mixing of surface waters by wind increases the rate at which oxygen from the air can be dissolved or absorbed into the water as previously observed in amazonian estuaries costa et al 2009 pereira et al 2018 costa et al 2018 barros et al 2019 4 2 the spatio temporal distribution of mesozooplankton density in amazon estuaries the occurrence and density of zooplankton species is strongly correlated with fluctuations in salinity whereas the role of temperature differences is less significant leite et al 2016 costa et al 2018 barros et al 2019 in caeté estuary the zooplankton was dominated by copepods as it is generally the case in estuaries duggan et al 2008 connelly et al 2020 with most of these being euryhaline marine species rather than true estuarine species magalhães et al 2015 costa et al 2018 nandy and mandal 2020 srichandan et al 2021 in fact the only truly estuarine copepod species that occurred in caeté estuary was p richardi which was abundant in the oligo mesohaline sectors see table 2 and fig 4c nevertheless the physical and chemical gradients along the sectors studied i e from places highly influenced by the river to the mouth of the estuary determined the composition of the mesozooplankton community during the dry season species characteristic of the outer s3 sector dominated by a more coastal assemblage such as acartia tonsa a lilljeborgii and p tenuis increased in density as salinities were increased indicating their preference for predominantly poly euhaline waters from the nmds it can be seen that the average density of the dominant species of mesozooplankton varied spatially and acted as the factor responsible for the significant dissimilarity p 0 05 between the sampling sectors the dynamics of the main species in the caeté estuary were closely related to salinity turbidity nutrient mainly nitrate and chl a concentrations thus indicating that the levels of rainfall and freshwater discharge highly influenced the occurrence and distribution of these organisms the high dominance of copepods confirms their key role in the estuarine food web as the major grazers providing the principal pathway of energy from primary producers to consumers at higher trophic levels such as many commercially important shellfish and fin fish haedrich 1983 ara 2004 magalhães et al 2013 andrade et al 2016 nandy and mandal 2020 lee et al 2021 in the present study the salinity seemed to be an important variable in explaining the dynamics of the mesozooplankton especially at a spatial scale there was a general trend of declining mesozooplankton density from the inner s1 to the outer s3 sector of the caeté and an increase in the number of species in the outer s3 sector from the rainy season 12 species to the dry season 21 species in the case of the copepods seasonal patterns were weak but the highest average total density of zooplankton occurred during the dry season overall tidal mixing of the estuary resulted in little variation in the density of individual species within the caeté except for p quasimodo species characteristic of environments dominated by the tides sterza and loureiro fernandes 2006 andrade et al 2016 previous studies reported that its occurrence depends on additional recruitment from the adjacent coastal region for the maintenance of its population stocks lopes et al 1998 araújo et al 2008 leite et al 2016 the calanoida group showed the highest density during the study calanoida can survive in a wide range of habitats and maintain their population in adverse environmental conditions e g vineetha et al 2015 andrade et al 2016 calliari et al 2019 the dominance of a tonsa and a lilljeborgii during the dry season suggests their high adaptability to trophic and hydrologic conditions of this period which might be confirmed by their continuous reproduction and reduced mortality rates during this season ara 2001 2004 magalhães et al 2015 barros et al 2019 the ability of acartiidae to cross geographic barriers relies mainly in their capability of producing resting stages castro longoria 2001 katajisto 2006 tello cetina et al 2013 which are seen to provide a mechanism for the species to survive independently of seasonal and spatial changes in the characteristics of the environment additionally organisms of this genus can restore high growth rates in the remaining adult population under favorable conditions ara 2004 primo et al 2009 magalhães et al 2015 yuan et al 2020 still the nauplii of all species of acartia survive well at higher salinities chinnery and williams 2004 which can also explain its high densities in the outer s3 sector regardless of the seasonal period the present results suggest that these copepods can be considered resident species of the estuary and are not only transported by tidal currents since they reproduce in the estuary throughout the year among these a tonsa present an invasive behavior and is considered an opportunistic tolerant species camatti et al 2019 this species is widely distributed in estuarine environments along the atlantic coasts of north and south america hoffmeyer 1994 and the pacific coast of north america durbin et al 1983 where it is the most abundant species this copepod can also present high densities in areas of low salinity where its spatial distribution can be significantly associated with temperature phytoplankton particulate organic carbon and chlorophyll a camatti et al 2019 the present study indicates that salinity could a limiting factor for this species since food availability is high during the whole year within the caeté estuary a number of variables may influence the dominance of copepods although salinity correlated with the community structure in studied environment other factors can also influence the copepod distribution in estuaries since its dynamics may be explained by the balance between food concentration and predation pressure ueda 1991 camargo and isaac 2004 magalhães et al 2015 yuan et al 2020 generally food concentration is higher within estuaries than outside them and the predominance of benthic and planktonic microalgae mangrove macroalgae and detritus within the studied environment koch and wolff 2002 brenner and krumme 2007 matos et al 2011 suits the omnivorous zooplankton like a tonsa and a lilljeborgii schwamborn et al 2002 observed that a lilljeborgii is capable of assimilating among 13 and 40 of the organic carbon from the mangrove allowing this species to prosper in environments with high turbidity this pattern may contribute to a reduction in interspecific competition among the copepods facilitating the coexistence of these and other species in the same estuary without spatial and temporal alternations between the species as observed for species of acartia the interspecific competition for food and space with the p richardi population in the middle s2 sector must also be considered since these copepods inhabit coastal regions under the domain of mesohaline waters lopes et al 1998 magalhães et al 2015 smaller bodied copepods such as paracalanus species may suffer lower predation from visual predators than larger bodied copepods and depth can interfere in predation pressure through vertical migration vega pérez and hemandez 1997 in addition the copepods employ a variety of strategies to maximize reproduction and survival e g high egg production rates and rapid per stage growth rates and for some species an ability to reproduce in high temperatures e g p richardi a tonsa and a lilljeborgii ara 2001 kaminski et al 2009 2014 that may be lethal for other species gaudy et al 2000 turner 2004 kaminski et al 2005 2014 shifts in copepod community structure from dominance by larger species to dominance by smaller species can also occur due to eutrophication uye 1994 rose et al 2019 although there is no evidence that this is the case in caeté estuary the moderate salinity observed at middle s2 sector and high nutrient concentration waters available for primary production in this sector triggers the growth of estuarine species such as p richardi magalhães et al 2006 costa et al 2013 among the hypothesized adaptive mechanisms for this behavior are the ability to consume phytoplankton cells of a wide size spectrum kaminski et al 2009 2014 the increase in reproductive rate with population peaks throughout the year andrade unpublished data and the passive accumulation in the turbidity maximum zone p richardi was the copepod that benefited the most from the peaks in chl a thus confirming the study of magalhães et al 2006 which referred to this species as one of the major top controllers of primary production in the caeté estuary this opportunistic herbivore can attain rapid growth rates induced by pulses of autotrophic biomass inner s1 and middle s2 sectors of the caeté estuary typical in areas of bloom or high phytoplankton densities costa et al 2018 barros et al 2019 an opposite trend was observed for its congener p acutus which occurred almost exclusively at the outer s3 sector of the estuary the dominance of p acutus in terms of density in areas of high salinity in the vicinity of river mouths santana barreto et al 1991 lopes et al 1998 magalhães et al 2006 was described as typical for mangrove areas bays and estuaries along the brazilian coast montú and cordeiro 1998 costa et al 2013 2018 in addition to the factors mentioned above the demersal behavior of the genus pseudodiaptomus can compensate for their loss in numbers in estuaries the demersal species of the genus tend to remain near on or in the bottom during the day but rise towards the water column at night walter 1987 behavioral responses with respect to diel vertical migration are mediated by several factors light is a major environmental cue regulating diel vertical migration observed in estuarine copepods such as adults of p acutus tundisi and matsumura tundisi 2008 nonetheless the absence of significant differences between copepods composition or density between tidal periods may resulted from the well mixed water column as a consequence of the strong local hydrodynamics although retention mechanisms such as diel vertical migration has been previously suggested by atique et al 2017 according to these authors this may be primarily true in the inner oligohaline sector of the caeté river estuary where tidal current velocities are the lowest although this phenomenon has yet to be confirmed in practice p tenuis was the only non copepod organism considered dominant it is a protandrous hermaphrodite species with direct development being the cross fertilization probably typical of the phylum chaetognatha liang and vega pérez 2001 these organisms are voracious carnivores that feed on a wide variety of organisms including eggs and fish larvae with copepods being the main item in their diet liang and vega pérez 1995 2001 they are marine and can be found in all oceans as well as in estuarine and mangrove regions worldwide hossfeld 1996 casanova 1991 costa et al 2011 barros et al 2019 in the caeté estuary the contribution of non copepods e g foraminifers cnidarians mollusks amphipods brachyurans appendicularians and chordates among others was highly variable but together accounted for an average of 25 of total mesozooplankton relative abundance these values were lower when compared to estuaries that presented the absence of fluvial discharge and small catchment areas minimal sporadic freshwater inflow throughout the year such as the neighboring taperaçu estuary koch et al 2005 magalhães et al 2015 leite et al 2016 the ecological indices recorded in the present study reflect the relatively low diversity typical of estuarine environments araújo et al 2008 leite et al 2016 barros et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 the significant variation observed in diversity index in relation to sampling sectors may be related to the strong bi directional tidal river flow large salinity fluctuations thus maximizing the horizontal gradients in some environmental variables and consequently in this diversity indices stirling and wilsey 2001 observed that competition predation and succession also might change the evenness and richness indices according to wang et al 2014 the diversity threshold of zooplankton in a tropical estuarine system can be divided into 5 stages as follows bad 0 6 average 0 6 1 5 good 1 6 2 5 better 2 6 3 5 and excellent 3 5 considering these stages the most saline downstream section of the caeté estuary outer s3 sector presented good diversity during the dry season with greater richness and evenness due to the greater contribution of marine species e g centropages furcatus calanopia americana temora turbinata subeucalanus pileatus among others and the reduction in the density of dominant species e g p richardi p acutus and p quasimodo all these marine species appear to be dependent on the additional recruitment from the adjacent coastal area for the maintenance of their population stocks miranda et al 2005 reported that the high habitat heterogeneity and environmental conditions promote higher diversity levels because this enhances the coexistence of either taxonomically diverse species with contrasting ecological requirements or ecologically similar congeneric species being either adapted to slightly different niches or able to avoid direct competition 5 conclusion although rainfall is seasonal in the area studied differences in rainfall rates did not reduce drastically the mean salinity in the caeté estuary which varied from intermediate to high mainly in the middle s2 and outer s3 sectors respectively the spatial differences observed in the water physicochemical variables of the caeté estuary indicate that physical events the influence of freshwater and tidal waters play an important role in causing the marked spatial salinity gradient of this ecosystem the salinity gradient in caeté estuary results from freshwater inflow from the river in the inner area and extensive mixing between the middle and marine areas therefore the high salinity observed in the caeté estuary reflects the strong influence of the coastal water mass contributing to the occurrence of coastal marine species such as a tonsa and a lilljeborgii and p quasimodo rather than truly estuarine species additionally in the caeté estuary the high concentration of nutrients stimulates phytoplankton biomass which in turn facilitated the reproduction and growth of the herbivore mesozooplankton e g p richardi and other predators that feed on these organisms e g p tenuis declaration of competing interest the authors

953,in the present study it was analyzed the structure of mesozooplankton community and their spatio temporal variations along the caeté river estuary northeast of pará brazil samples were collected during spring tides conducted in nychthemeral cycles in three fixed sectors located along the studied estuary inner s1 middle s2 and outer s3 using conical plankton nets of 200 μm mesh size samplings were performed in september 2014 dry season and march 2015 rainy season totaling 54 samples a total of 25 mesozooplankton species were recorded being the copepods the most diversified group 21 species mostly dominated by estuarine and coastal species the most abundant mesozooplankton species presented significantly higher densities p 0 0001 between the middle pseudodiaptomus richardi 583 8 956 5

increasing toward the mouth of the estuary except for p richardi spearman s correlation rs demonstrated that the salinity turbidity dissolved nutrients and chlorophyll a concentrations were the prevailing environmental variables associated with significant spatial changes of mesozooplankton distribution in this area overall the results showed that spatial variation in the water physicochemical characteristics of the caeté estuary have significant effects on the structure and succession of the mesozooplankton which may potentially affect the functioning and biodiversity of this coastal ecosystem keywords tropical estuary plankton zooplankton salinity river flow 1 introduction estuarine regions have been recognized as a mosaic of habitats and due to their connections with adjoining freshwater and marine ecosystems estuaries act as a transitional ecotone with marked gradients of physical chemical and biological variables van der maarel 1990 atique et al 2017 lee et al 2021 in addition estuaries act as a nursery ground for different aquatic species by providing food and shelter for larvae and juveniles of ecological and economic importance telesh 2004 dorak and albay 2016 yuan et al 2020 these ecosystems also act as a hotspot for many larval stages of nekton benthic or nekton benthic species which spend some time of their lives in the estuarine waters after the planktonic phase the larvae return to their place of origin in pelagic or benthic environments in freshwater coastal or marine waters harris et al 2000 miranda et al 2005 nugroho et al 2019 in estuarine ecosystems zooplankton has a key position in the trophic webs as they are mostly composed of phagotrophic and herbivorous organisms serving as a link between primary planktonic producers phytoplankton and the higher trophic levels with an important contribution to the microbial loop hopkinson jr 1989 ortell and ortmann 2014 magalhães et al 2015 dorak and albay 2016 they are also important in the classic trophic webs occupying a fundamental niche in these environments degerman et al 2018 the estuarine ecotone and inshore fishing profits are always influenced by the zooplankton population due to its role as an essential food item for fish bianchi et al 2003 ayon et al 2008 due to zooplankton large density shorter life span drifting nature high taxa species diversity and different tolerance to the environmental stress they are being used as indicator organisms for the physical chemical and biological processes in the aquatic ecosystems uriarte and villate 2004 longhurst 2007 connelly et al 2020 the seasonal and spatial dominance of certain zooplankton taxa may indicate the relative influence of different water parameters on the estuarine ecosystem and serve as an early indication of a biological response to environmental and or climatic changes hays et al 2005 ziadi et al 2015 in this respect the study of estuarine zooplankton ecology thus demands considerable efforts from the scientific standpoint given the great variety of taxonomic groups size classes and life cycle strategies found in this group of organisms lopes et al 1998 yuan et al 2020 the amazon coastal area includes the world s second largest continuous tract of mangrove forest and is characterized by a high ecological diversity with many deltas sandy beaches and estuaries souza filho et al 2009 nascimento júnior et al 2013 magalhães et al 2015 asp et al 2018 the climate of the region is relatively hot 20 c and wet annual precipitation up to 3 300 mm with very little variation in temperature during the course of the year pereira et al 2009 inmet 2020 the continental shelf extends some 330 km into the atlantic ocean and receives the discharge of the amazon river 16 of the world s river water and dozens of other estuaries consisting in the major run off of sediments nutrients and organic material worldwide demaster and pope 1996 geyer et al 1996 the region is also characterized by a macrotidal regime with maximum tide levels of 8 m in maranhão 6 m in pará and 12 m in amapá pereira et al 2009 dhn 2020 the caeté river estuary is located in this region being one of the most studied estuaries of northeastern pará state and where knowledge about zooplankton communities is relatively limited costa et al 2011 and mostly related to the study of the group copepoda krumme and liang 2004 magalhães et al 2006 2010 atique et al 2017 therefore the objective of the present study was to describe the spatial and temporal seasonal composition density and diversity of the mesozooplankton and the effects of environmental variables on its community dynamics we hypothesize that salinity is the most important factor in explaining the dynamics of local mesozooplankton especially at a spatial scale 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the caeté estuary 0 45 1 07 s 46 50 46 30 w fig 1 is an estuarine environment situated on the amazon macrotidal mangrove coast of the northern brazilian state of pará and is located approximately 150 km east southeast of the mouth of the amazon river dittmar and lara 2001 this ecosystem serves as an important spawning ground and nursery for a wide variety of fishes and crustaceans due to its ample riverine network with dense mangrove vegetation it also plays a major role in the natural filtration of anthropogenic pollutants and acts as an important pathway for nutrients recycling camargo and isaac 2004 pereira et al 2010 monteiro et al 2016 atique et al 2017 the local climate is humid equatorial

vary seasonally with the greatest intensities occurring during the dry season with more moderate wind speeds being recorded during the rainy season martorano et al 1993 dhn 2020 this estuary can be classified as a well mixed permanently open turbid and shallow estuary with a maximum depth of about 10 m dittmar et al 1999 barletta bergan et al 2002 mean river discharge is approximately 180 m3 s 1

during the flood and ebb phases of the spring tides each sample of zooplankton was collected with a 3 min subsurface horizontal tow of a conical plankton net 200 μm mesh and 0 50 m mouth diameter fitted with a mechanical flowmeter general oceanics 2030r to estimate the volume of water filtered through the net samplings of the three sectors studied were conducted simultaneously one tow per station per sampling hour each month during the nychthemeral period 25 h using 3 different small powerboats running at an average speed of 1 5 knots between s1 inner sector and s3 outer sector resulting in a total of 54 samples 9 samplings per sector per day of campaign as soon as they were collected the samples were transferred to 600 ml plastic bottles and preserved in a 4 buffered formaldehyde seawater solution sodium tetraborate in the laboratory the preserved mesozooplankton samples were rinsed to remove the formalin buffer and divided into aliquots between four and eleven times in a folsom splitter to provide standardized subsamples containing approximately 1000 individuals which were then identified björnberg 1981 bradford grieve et al 1999 classified taxonomically

density data the quality of the nmds analysis was assessed using kruskal s stress standardized residual sum of squares which indicates the degree of deformation necessary for the presentation of the results in the desired number of dimensions a one way analysis of similarity anosim was subsequently used to test whether the composition of the mesozooplankton community varied significantly between

1894 pseudodiaptomus acutus dahl f 1894 and paracalanus quasimodo bowman 1971 all belonging to calanoida group in general short term variation related to tidal and day night cycles nychthemeral was

the estuary spearman rs correlation analysis revealed that a tonsa a lilljeborgii p quasimodo p acutus and p tenuis were positively correlated with salinity which accounts for the higher values

sectors responsible for spatial variation might show the indicator species for the particular sector due to their high dominance among all the groups taxa copepod was not only the dominant one but also well distributed all along the studied sectors group i was composed primarily of samples from sectors 1 and 2 in both seasonal periods salinity levels for these sectors can be considered oligo mesohaline and reflected the elevated contribution of p richardi sim sd 2 23 91 6 in the dry and rainy sim sd 1 98 82 8 seasons group ii by contrast was composed by samples from sector 3 which were associated with the poli euhaline conditions of the estuary when a tonsa a lilljeborgii euterpina acutifrons p quasimodo and p tenuis contributed the most to within group similarity with the highest

mesohaline and poli euhaline sectors was p richardi 4 discussion 4 1 changes in environmental variables and chl a concentrations according to previous studies developed in estuaries of the amazon coast costa et al 2009 magalhães et al 2009 2011 2015 leite et al 2009 2010 2016 the months of september and march can be considered good representatives of the dry and rainy season respectively the caeté estuary is largely influenced by rainfall and freshwater discharge mainly in the first half of the year magalhães et al 2015 and nandy and mandal 2020 showed that these two variables are very important in tropical countries as it regulates the biogeochemical characteristics of the coastal and estuarine environment influencing the pattern of composition and density of the zooplankton community in the present study each of the environmental variables such as water temperature salinity ph turbidity and do showed remarkable spatio temporal variations in general the lowest salinity values recorded during the rainy season could be attributed to the combined effect of precipitation 2 000 mm and freshwater influx 60 70 of the total drastically reducing salinity mainly in middle s2 sector reduction of approximately 45 of the value observed during the dry season opposite trend was observed in the second half of the year when the greater entry of marine waters promotes an increase in salinity and ph with peaks of up to 35 and 8 8 respectively both observed in the outer s3 sector estuary mouth the presence of a turbidity maximum zone is a common feature of many amazon estuaries pamplona et al 2013 asp et al 2018 the high turbidity observed in the caeté estuary is caused by the mangrove runoff and the resuspension transportation and redistribution of large amounts of fine sediments and mangrove materials within the water column monteiro et al 2016 nutrient concentrations are known to be a significant determinant of estuarine productivity and their spatio temporal variations can play a crucial role by influencing directly the trophic dynamics in the estuarine environments gaonkar et al 2010 nandy and mandal 2020 in tropical regions distribution of nutrients in estuaries is mainly controlled by season tide conditions freshwater runoff from surrounding landmass and anthropogenic sources pamplona et al 2013 monteiro et al 2016 nandy and mandal 2020 as also observed by atique et al 2017 in the caeté estuary nitrate was predominant among nitrogen compounds its spatio temporal variations may be related to phytoplankton consumption making the concentrations of these last compounds relatively low in the estuary as suggested for other estuarine environments of the region studied oliveira et al 2022 queiroz et al 2022 the nitrate concentrations in the present study were higher than those over 70 recorded in northeastern and northern brazilian estuaries such as the barra de jangadas estuary pe noriega et al 2005 and guajará mirim pa estuary santos et al 2020 which could be a consequence of enrichment originated from degradation and remineralization of mangrove debris ortohosphate concentrations were similar to those observed in other tropical estuaries near urban centers pereira filho 2001 noriega et al 2005 santos et al 2020 the use of orthophosphate by phytoplankton and bacteria together with the high input of freshwater nutrient concentrations dilution into the estuarine system during the rainy season contributes to its reduction mainly in the inner s1 sector of the environment studied according to movellán 2003 it s likely that the interactions of ortohosphate with suspended matter represent an important mechanism with the particulate fraction containing a greater amount of this element mainly when the estuary presents high turbidity as is the case of caeté estuary dissolved silicate dsi is an important nutrient in coastal water which is used by planktonic diatoms for cell division and growth fernandes 1994 zhang et al 2020 the dissolved silicate dsi derived from terrigenous source is considered the inorganic nutrient with the highest concentrations in estuaries pamplona et al 2013 monteiro et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 oliveira et al 2022 in this study the seasonal river discharge was the predominant influencing factor on the seasonal dsi flux therefore the high nutrient loads in the rainy season could possibly be attributed to the large freshwater discharges induced by rainfall in this case the high concentrations of silicate in the waters of the caeté river estuary mainly during the rainy season is a result of the intense leaching of sediments through weathering along the margins of the estuary and mangroves overall nutrient concentrations found in the inner s1 sector of the caeté estuary were similar to those recorded in other highly populated and industrialized brazilian estuaries e g flores montes et al 2011 alves et al 2013 cotovicz et al 2013 according to monteiro et al 2016 in the caeté estuary nutrient input is more accentuated in the inner s1 sector of the estuary where 90 of the local population live and a high incidence of commercial activities public markets ice factories and boat repairing among others is concentrated according to these authors a peculiarity of caeté estuary is that the river discharge from the caeté basin contributes to the dilution of effluents released into the estuary mainly during the rainy season when the river runoff is the highest an average monthly river discharge of about 45 0 m3 s 1 or more can be considered to be the threshold to converting river flow into an efficient mechanism that significantly reduces the impact of released effluents in this estuary as previously noted by these authors the highest chl a concentrations recorded at the beginning of the rainy season was a consequence of the increase in phytoplankton biomass mainly in the inner s1 and middle s2 sectors observed during the period of fluvial discharge rising and high nitrate availability in the middle s2 and dsi availability in all the three sectors of the estuary diatoms use to be the dominant taxa in the estuaries of the amazon region and the increase in silicate concentrations during the rainy season can stimulate phytoplankton growth as suggested by previous studies developed in the region oliveira et al 2022 queiroz et al 2022 the strong tidal currents recorded during this period may also have contributed to the resuspension of benthic photosynthetic species which were considered abundant in the microphytoplankton community as previously observed by pereira et al 2010 for this environment and by other authors santos et al 2008 sousa et al 2008 2009 matos et al 2012 2016 pereira et al 2012 for other coastal amazon environments in this region the occurrence of macrotidal regimes high energy the high turbulent mixture and bottom sediment re suspension could contribute to the presence of phytobenthonic species in the water column tychoplankton besides the turbidity seems not to limit primary productivity by restricting the penetration of sunlight since peaks in chl a indirect measure of biomass and consequently of productivity concentrations were observed in regions of high turbidity see figs 3c and 3l the influence of biological activity of photosynthetic organisms might also be responsible for the high do concentrations recorded during the rainy season furthermore the mixing of surface waters by wind increases the rate at which oxygen from the air can be dissolved or absorbed into the water as previously observed in amazonian estuaries costa et al 2009 pereira et al 2018 costa et al 2018 barros et al 2019 4 2 the spatio temporal distribution of mesozooplankton density in amazon estuaries the occurrence and density of zooplankton species is strongly correlated with fluctuations in salinity whereas the role of temperature differences is less significant leite et al 2016 costa et al 2018 barros et al 2019 in caeté estuary the zooplankton was dominated by copepods as it is generally the case in estuaries duggan et al 2008 connelly et al 2020 with most of these being euryhaline marine species rather than true estuarine species magalhães et al 2015 costa et al 2018 nandy and mandal 2020 srichandan et al 2021 in fact the only truly estuarine copepod species that occurred in caeté estuary was p richardi which was abundant in the oligo mesohaline sectors see table 2 and fig 4c nevertheless the physical and chemical gradients along the sectors studied i e from places highly influenced by the river to the mouth of the estuary determined the composition of the mesozooplankton community during the dry season species characteristic of the outer s3 sector dominated by a more coastal assemblage such as acartia tonsa a lilljeborgii and p tenuis increased in density as salinities were increased indicating their preference for predominantly poly euhaline waters from the nmds it can be seen that the average density of the dominant species of mesozooplankton varied spatially and acted as the factor responsible for the significant dissimilarity p 0 05 between the sampling sectors the dynamics of the main species in the caeté estuary were closely related to salinity turbidity nutrient mainly nitrate and chl a concentrations thus indicating that the levels of rainfall and freshwater discharge highly influenced the occurrence and distribution of these organisms the high dominance of copepods confirms their key role in the estuarine food web as the major grazers providing the principal pathway of energy from primary producers to consumers at higher trophic levels such as many commercially important shellfish and fin fish haedrich 1983 ara 2004 magalhães et al 2013 andrade et al 2016 nandy and mandal 2020 lee et al 2021 in the present study the salinity seemed to be an important variable in explaining the dynamics of the mesozooplankton especially at a spatial scale there was a general trend of declining mesozooplankton density from the inner s1 to the outer s3 sector of the caeté and an increase in the number of species in the outer s3 sector from the rainy season 12 species to the dry season 21 species in the case of the copepods seasonal patterns were weak but the highest average total density of zooplankton occurred during the dry season overall tidal mixing of the estuary resulted in little variation in the density of individual species within the caeté except for p quasimodo species characteristic of environments dominated by the tides sterza and loureiro fernandes 2006 andrade et al 2016 previous studies reported that its occurrence depends on additional recruitment from the adjacent coastal region for the maintenance of its population stocks lopes et al 1998 araújo et al 2008 leite et al 2016 the calanoida group showed the highest density during the study calanoida can survive in a wide range of habitats and maintain their population in adverse environmental conditions e g vineetha et al 2015 andrade et al 2016 calliari et al 2019 the dominance of a tonsa and a lilljeborgii during the dry season suggests their high adaptability to trophic and hydrologic conditions of this period which might be confirmed by their continuous reproduction and reduced mortality rates during this season ara 2001 2004 magalhães et al 2015 barros et al 2019 the ability of acartiidae to cross geographic barriers relies mainly in their capability of producing resting stages castro longoria 2001 katajisto 2006 tello cetina et al 2013 which are seen to provide a mechanism for the species to survive independently of seasonal and spatial changes in the characteristics of the environment additionally organisms of this genus can restore high growth rates in the remaining adult population under favorable conditions ara 2004 primo et al 2009 magalhães et al 2015 yuan et al 2020 still the nauplii of all species of acartia survive well at higher salinities chinnery and williams 2004 which can also explain its high densities in the outer s3 sector regardless of the seasonal period the present results suggest that these copepods can be considered resident species of the estuary and are not only transported by tidal currents since they reproduce in the estuary throughout the year among these a tonsa present an invasive behavior and is considered an opportunistic tolerant species camatti et al 2019 this species is widely distributed in estuarine environments along the atlantic coasts of north and south america hoffmeyer 1994 and the pacific coast of north america durbin et al 1983 where it is the most abundant species this copepod can also present high densities in areas of low salinity where its spatial distribution can be significantly associated with temperature phytoplankton particulate organic carbon and chlorophyll a camatti et al 2019 the present study indicates that salinity could a limiting factor for this species since food availability is high during the whole year within the caeté estuary a number of variables may influence the dominance of copepods although salinity correlated with the community structure in studied environment other factors can also influence the copepod distribution in estuaries since its dynamics may be explained by the balance between food concentration and predation pressure ueda 1991 camargo and isaac 2004 magalhães et al 2015 yuan et al 2020 generally food concentration is higher within estuaries than outside them and the predominance of benthic and planktonic microalgae mangrove macroalgae and detritus within the studied environment koch and wolff 2002 brenner and krumme 2007 matos et al 2011 suits the omnivorous zooplankton like a tonsa and a lilljeborgii schwamborn et al 2002 observed that a lilljeborgii is capable of assimilating among 13 and 40 of the organic carbon from the mangrove allowing this species to prosper in environments with high turbidity this pattern may contribute to a reduction in interspecific competition among the copepods facilitating the coexistence of these and other species in the same estuary without spatial and temporal alternations between the species as observed for species of acartia the interspecific competition for food and space with the p richardi population in the middle s2 sector must also be considered since these copepods inhabit coastal regions under the domain of mesohaline waters lopes et al 1998 magalhães et al 2015 smaller bodied copepods such as paracalanus species may suffer lower predation from visual predators than larger bodied copepods and depth can interfere in predation pressure through vertical migration vega pérez and hemandez 1997 in addition the copepods employ a variety of strategies to maximize reproduction and survival e g high egg production rates and rapid per stage growth rates and for some species an ability to reproduce in high temperatures e g p richardi a tonsa and a lilljeborgii ara 2001 kaminski et al 2009 2014 that may be lethal for other species gaudy et al 2000 turner 2004 kaminski et al 2005 2014 shifts in copepod community structure from dominance by larger species to dominance by smaller species can also occur due to eutrophication uye 1994 rose et al 2019 although there is no evidence that this is the case in caeté estuary the moderate salinity observed at middle s2 sector and high nutrient concentration waters available for primary production in this sector triggers the growth of estuarine species such as p richardi magalhães et al 2006 costa et al 2013 among the hypothesized adaptive mechanisms for this behavior are the ability to consume phytoplankton cells of a wide size spectrum kaminski et al 2009 2014 the increase in reproductive rate with population peaks throughout the year andrade unpublished data and the passive accumulation in the turbidity maximum zone p richardi was the copepod that benefited the most from the peaks in chl a thus confirming the study of magalhães et al 2006 which referred to this species as one of the major top controllers of primary production in the caeté estuary this opportunistic herbivore can attain rapid growth rates induced by pulses of autotrophic biomass inner s1 and middle s2 sectors of the caeté estuary typical in areas of bloom or high phytoplankton densities costa et al 2018 barros et al 2019 an opposite trend was observed for its congener p acutus which occurred almost exclusively at the outer s3 sector of the estuary the dominance of p acutus in terms of density in areas of high salinity in the vicinity of river mouths santana barreto et al 1991 lopes et al 1998 magalhães et al 2006 was described as typical for mangrove areas bays and estuaries along the brazilian coast montú and cordeiro 1998 costa et al 2013 2018 in addition to the factors mentioned above the demersal behavior of the genus pseudodiaptomus can compensate for their loss in numbers in estuaries the demersal species of the genus tend to remain near on or in the bottom during the day but rise towards the water column at night walter 1987 behavioral responses with respect to diel vertical migration are mediated by several factors light is a major environmental cue regulating diel vertical migration observed in estuarine copepods such as adults of p acutus tundisi and matsumura tundisi 2008 nonetheless the absence of significant differences between copepods composition or density between tidal periods may resulted from the well mixed water column as a consequence of the strong local hydrodynamics although retention mechanisms such as diel vertical migration has been previously suggested by atique et al 2017 according to these authors this may be primarily true in the inner oligohaline sector of the caeté river estuary where tidal current velocities are the lowest although this phenomenon has yet to be confirmed in practice p tenuis was the only non copepod organism considered dominant it is a protandrous hermaphrodite species with direct development being the cross fertilization probably typical of the phylum chaetognatha liang and vega pérez 2001 these organisms are voracious carnivores that feed on a wide variety of organisms including eggs and fish larvae with copepods being the main item in their diet liang and vega pérez 1995 2001 they are marine and can be found in all oceans as well as in estuarine and mangrove regions worldwide hossfeld 1996 casanova 1991 costa et al 2011 barros et al 2019 in the caeté estuary the contribution of non copepods e g foraminifers cnidarians mollusks amphipods brachyurans appendicularians and chordates among others was highly variable but together accounted for an average of 25 of total mesozooplankton relative abundance these values were lower when compared to estuaries that presented the absence of fluvial discharge and small catchment areas minimal sporadic freshwater inflow throughout the year such as the neighboring taperaçu estuary koch et al 2005 magalhães et al 2015 leite et al 2016 the ecological indices recorded in the present study reflect the relatively low diversity typical of estuarine environments araújo et al 2008 leite et al 2016 barros et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 the significant variation observed in diversity index in relation to sampling sectors may be related to the strong bi directional tidal river flow large salinity fluctuations thus maximizing the horizontal gradients in some environmental variables and consequently in this diversity indices stirling and wilsey 2001 observed that competition predation and succession also might change the evenness and richness indices according to wang et al 2014 the diversity threshold of zooplankton in a tropical estuarine system can be divided into 5 stages as follows bad 0 6 average 0 6 1 5 good 1 6 2 5 better 2 6 3 5 and excellent 3 5 considering these stages the most saline downstream section of the caeté estuary outer s3 sector presented good diversity during the dry season with greater richness and evenness due to the greater contribution of marine species e g centropages furcatus calanopia americana temora turbinata subeucalanus pileatus among others and the reduction in the density of dominant species e g p richardi p acutus and p quasimodo all these marine species appear to be dependent on the additional recruitment from the adjacent coastal area for the maintenance of their population stocks miranda et al 2005 reported that the high habitat heterogeneity and environmental conditions promote higher diversity levels because this enhances the coexistence of either taxonomically diverse species with contrasting ecological requirements or ecologically similar congeneric species being either adapted to slightly different niches or able to avoid direct competition 5 conclusion although rainfall is seasonal in the area studied differences in rainfall rates did not reduce drastically the mean salinity in the caeté estuary which varied from intermediate to high mainly in the middle s2 and outer s3 sectors respectively the spatial differences observed in the water physicochemical variables of the caeté estuary indicate that physical events the influence of freshwater and tidal waters play an important role in causing the marked spatial salinity gradient of this ecosystem the salinity gradient in caeté estuary results from freshwater inflow from the river in the inner area and extensive mixing between the middle and marine areas therefore the high salinity observed in the caeté estuary reflects the strong influence of the coastal water mass contributing to the occurrence of coastal marine species such as a tonsa and a lilljeborgii and p quasimodo rather than truly estuarine species additionally in the caeté estuary the high concentration of nutrients stimulates phytoplankton biomass which in turn facilitated the reproduction and growth of the herbivore mesozooplankton e g p richardi and other predators that feed on these organisms e g p tenuis declaration of competing interest the authors

954,the campus is facing the problems of waterlogging and runoff pollution to mitigate these phenomena this study constructs a swmm model using a campus as the study area the reduction effects of runoff volume and pollutant load under four lid facility combination scenarios were simulated eleven evaluation indicators were selected from environmental economic and social aspects and the weights of each indicator were calculated by applying the critic method the relative percentage of different rainfall recurrence periods under the same evaluation indicator was obtained the composite index method is used to calculate the composite index for each scenario the combination of rain garden permeable pavement bioretention and green roof is determined as the optimal scenario the fuzzy pattern recognition method is used to select three representative rainfall events and simulate the reduction effect of runoff volume and pollutant load under four scenarios to further verify the optimal scenario the results show that the reduction rates of runoff volume and pollutant load under scenario 4 are 2 7 4 2 and 4 7 higher than those under scenarios 1 2 and 3 based on the above study the optimal lid facility combination selected in this paper will provide a reference for the construction of sponge facilities similar to this study area key words swmm critic composite index method fuzzy

the hydrological cycle include mainly the increase in runoff and peak flows with extreme rainfall events leopold et al 1968 walsh et al 2005 as urban populations continue to increase the percentage of impervious areas in cities is rising leading to significant deterioration in water quality davis et al 2005 kayhanian et al 2012 barbosa et al 2012 many theories and techniques have been proposed due to the increase in runoff and peak flows and the deterioration of water quality caused by rapid urbanization existing stormwater management practices include low impact development lid and best

underlying conditions have changed seriously with a significant reduction in green areas and an increase in impervious areas such as building roads these phenomena lead to a reduction in the infiltration of runoff volume during the heavy rainfall season and the drainage system is unable to drain the rainwater quickly to mitigate these problems many scholars have proposed a combination of lid facilities to alleviate waterlogging and runoff pollution li et al 2019 taghizadeh et al 2021 reduced total suspended solids tss total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations by 97 68

the optimal lid scenario and showed that at least 20 reduction in peak runoff was achieved under the optimal lid scenario li et al 2017 suggested that bioretentions green roofs retention ponds and sunken green spaces are preferred as sponge construction facilities they then evaluated the performance of a lid combination consisting of two or three components today due to the low design standard of the drainage network and the large percentage of impervious areas in the old campus it is very easy to form campus waterlogging and cause runoff pollution problems therefore it is important to select an optimal lid facility combination scenario to alleviate the campus waterlogging and pollution problems this paper will set up four lid facility combination scenarios based on the swmm model the critic method is used to calculate weight values to each evaluation indicator and the composite index method is used to quantify the combined effect of different lid facility combinations to select the optimal lid facility combination scenario it provides a basis for the construction of sponge facilities similar to this study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the built up area of xi an e107 40 109 49 and n33 39 34 45 as shown in fig 1 xi an is located in the middle of the guanzhong plain bordered by the wei river in the north and the qinling mountains in the south and is one of the important birthplaces of chinese civilization and the chinese nation the city has a warm temperate semi humid continental monsoon climate the average annual rainfall is 584 9 mm and the average annual evaporation is 990 mm jia et al 2016 with heavy rainfall from may to october accounting for 78 7 of the annual rainfall the total area of the study area is 0 26 km2 the study area consists of buildings impervious surfaces green areas and waters and the impervious area is 0 20 km2 accounting for 76 9 of the total area the large percentage of impervious areas coupled with the aging pipe network and low initial design standards cannot meet the drainage requirements for short duration high intensity rainfall it frequently leads to large waterlogging of the campus during the rainy season thus forming internal flooding and susceptible to runoff pollution the overall topography of the study area is high in the east and low in the west high in the south and low in the north which makes it suitable for sponge campus renovation 2 2 data sources the data to be input for constructing the swmm model of the study area mainly include meteorological data underlying data and pipe network data the meteorological data is mainly the complete rainfall series which comes from the meteorological station on campus the underlying data mainly includes land use slope and ground elevation the pipe network data mainly includes pipe length pipe diameter and pipe bottom elevation both of them are obtained through a field survey 2 3 indicator selection and evaluation criteria the selection of reasonable evaluation indicators is crucial to the evaluation of the lid facility combination and the evaluation indicators should be easy to quantify many studies nowadays demonstrate that the combined benefits of lid facility combinations are mainly reflected in their runoff volume and quality control and reduction effects darnthamrongkul and mozingo 2021 raei et al 2019 yang et al 2020 meanwhile construction operation and maintenance o m costs are the main factors that substantially impact gscis implementation in the decision making process consequently in many studies construction o m costs are considered as one of the selected criteria for evaluating the options bhatt et al 2019 gogate et al 2017 han et al 2021 therefore in this study 11 indicators were selected for the evaluation of different lid scenarios including runoff reduction rate flood reduction rate ss reduction rate cod reduction rate tp reduction rate tn reduction rate infrastructure construction cost o m cost rainwater utilization rate ecological landscape function and public acceptance c1 c11 the standard values of the evaluation indicators for the lid facility combinations are determined by referencing the literature li et al 2021 and are shown in table 1 2 4 swmm model 2 4 1 generalization of the model the study area in this paper is small in size with reference to the distribution of building structures within the study area pipe network measurement data road alignment and slope the study area is divided into 51 sub catchments 106 pipe sections and 106 nodes using the manual sub catchment division method fig 2 the horton infiltration model was selected for the study area the non linear reservoir model was used to calculate the runoff concentration process and the dynamic wave method was used to calculate the drainage system 2 4 2 parameter input this paper uses the chicago rain pattern to generate rainfall scenarios with recurrence periods of 1a 3a 5a and 10a based on the xi an rainstorm intensity equation 1 as the model base input data the precipitation for the four recurrence periods were 12 775 mm 30 543 mm 38 804 mm and 50 014 mm respectively while urban flooding is frequent the problem of urban runoff pollution caused by rainfall should not be underestimated since the study area is located in the center of the city the population is concentrated and dense and its living and production human activities are more frequent the pollutants produced to some extent enter the urban water body through various ways to cause pollution therefore it is necessary to study the problem of water pollution caused by rainfall the runoff quality parameters table 2 in the study area of this paper refer to the swmm manual and the data of the similar area study mark et al 2019 1 q 2210 87 1 2 915 lg p t 21 933 0 974 where q is rainstorm intensity l s hm 2 p is the recurrence period of rainfall a t is rainfall duration min 2 4 3 model parameter validation due to the lack of actual measured outfall information in this study area the integrated runoff coefficient rate model is used in this paper the integrated runoff coefficient is a concept proposed to meet the design of stormwater pipes it has a specific physical meaning and its value depends on the ground cover of the catchment area the condition of the underlying etc and has a specific range of values liu et al 2009 the method of rainfall runoff model calibration based on runoff coefficients needs to obtain runoff coefficients first including two aspects the integrated runoff coefficient of the catchment area and the acquisition of runoff coefficient model simulation values the impervious cover area in the study area before lid was set was 76 2 the empirical runoff coefficient for the catchment area is 0 60 0 85 for densely built up areas impervious coverage area 70 which is based on the urban area integrated runoff coefficient in the urban drainage design manual madrazo uribeetxebarria et al 2021 and zaghloul 1983 found that n imperv dstore imperv dstore perv etc are swmm model sensitivity parameters and they were used as the main adjustment parameters in the first iteration after running the model it was obtained that the integrated runoff coefficient of the study area was 85 9 when p 10a which did not satisfy the empirical range of values after four iterations of adjusting the parameters table 3 the swmm model was run and the integrated runoff coefficient of the study area was calculated as 63 4 at p 1a 69 6 at p 3a 75 6 at p 5a and 80 8 at p 10a the simulation results satisfy the empirical taking specification of the integrated runoff coefficient so the model setting is reasonable 2 4 4 scenario design selection of suitable low impact development facilities with reference to the study area underlying and measured waterlogging points for example permeable pavement is suitable for roadsides and squares and green roofs are suitable for building roofs facilities such as sunken green space bioretention and rain garden are suitable for placement in green areas consequently there are four combinations of lid facilities in this study scenario 1 is rain garden permeable pavement sunken green space scenario 2 is rain garden permeable pavement sunken green space green roof scenario 3 is rain garden permeable pavement bioretention scenario 4 is rain garden permeable pavement bioretention cell green roof fig 3 the area of the rain garden is 4410m2 the green roof is 10 040m2 the permeable pavement is 16 966 6m2 the sunken green space area is 3 280 81m2 and the bioretention is 5 908 97m2 the area of the four combinations of lid facilities accounts for 9 4 13 2 10 4 and 14 2 of the total area of the study area respectively determine the parameters of a single lid facility with reference to the sponge construction planning and design of the xiaozhai area the specific parameters are shown in table a 1 and table a 2 2 5 research methodology 2 5 1 critic method there are two main methods commonly used to calculate the weights of evaluation indicators namely the subjective assignment method and the objective assignment method the subjective weighting methods mainly include the ahp method delphi dephi method expert scoring method objective weighting methods mainly include standard deviation method entropy method critic method and coefficient of variation method ma 2019 if the subjective weighting method is used to calculate the weights of evaluation indicators there is a great subjective will which makes the calculated results too idealized therefore this paper uses the objective weighting method to calculate the weight of each evaluation indicator and the calculation results are more in line with reality the critic method is an objective weighting method proposed by diakoulaki et al 1995 and its basic idea is to determine the objective weights of the indicators its calculation method is simple and the calculation results are reliable therefore this paper selects the critic method to calculate the weights of evaluation indicators in this paper the critic method is selected to calculate the weights of evaluation indicators the critic method is based on two basic concepts the first is the intensity of contrast which indicates the size of the difference between the values taken by the various evaluation options for the same indicator expressed in the form of standard deviation secondly the conflict between indicators is evaluated and the conflict between indicators is based on the correlation between indicators if there is a strong positive correlation between two indicators it means that the conflict between the two indicators is low bhadra et al 2021 the objective weight of each indicator is the combined measure of contrast intensity and conflict let cj denote the amount of information contained in j evaluation indicators then cj can be expressed as wu et al 2020 2 c j σ j t 1 n 1 r t j j 1 2 m where cj is standard deviation rtj is correlation coefficient between indicator t and j the larger cj is the greater the amount of information contained in the jth evaluation indicator and the greater the relative importance of that indicator so the objective weight wj of the jth indicator is expressed as 3 w j c j j 1 m c j j 1 2 m 2 5 2 composite index method the composite index method is an evaluation method that takes the positive and negative mean values as the benchmark and finds the discounted index of each indicator and then aggregates them the larger the composite index the better the overall effectiveness of the object the calculation equation is as follows wirehn et al 2015 4 y i x i x i 5 y i 1 x y i w i i 1 x x i x i w i where yi is individual index of the ith evaluation indicator xi is evaluation value of the ith evaluation indicator xi is evaluation criteria value of the ith evaluation indicator y is aggregate index calculated from the comprehensive evaluation wi is weight of the ith evaluation indicator in the overall evaluation 2 5 3 fuzzy pattern recognition method the fuzzy pattern recognition method is a method to discriminate against the rainstorm pattern that has been summarised by the scholars concerned the ratio of rainfall over time to the total rainfall is used as an indicator to determine the rain pattern and seven standard pattern matrices are established the closeness of each measured rainfall to the seven pattern rain patterns fig 4 is calculated separately and this is used as the basis for determining the rain pattern of the measured rainfall among them according to the different locations of the rain peaks the seven pattern rain patterns can be classified as front peaked i back peaked ii symmetrical iii uniform iv equal bimodal v back major bimodal vi and front major bimodal vii molokov and shtigorin 1956 the calculation equation is as follows 6 x i δ h i h x i 1 2 n 7 σ k 1 1 n i 1 n v k i x i 2 k 1 2 7 where hi is rainfall for each divisional period hx is total rainfall σk is the closeness of the kth rainfall n is number of periods of divided rainfall vki is standard rainfall period vector xi is rainfall time vector if the kth closeness is the largest then the rainfall is the kth rain type 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of simulation results with the use of swmm the runoff volumes are simulated for four scenarios that are shown in table a 3 the four combinations of lid facilities have a reduction in both runoff volume and peak flows as the rainfall recurrence period increases the reduction in runoff and peak flows decreases the reason for these changes is that as the rainfall recurrence period increases the intensity of the rainfall increases and the runoff cannot infiltrate promptly as a result a large amount of runoff flows into the pipe network and the network cannot discharge the runoff in a timely manner the pollutant ss cod tp and tn simulation results for the four lid facility combinations under different rainfall recurrence periods are shown in table a 4 as the recurrence period increases the emissions of the four pollutants increase the largest amount of ss is emitted followed by cod tp and tn and the least amount of tp is emitted as the rainfall recurrence period increases the reduction effect of the four pollutants decreases the reasons for this change are summarized as follows as the rainfall recurrence period increases the washout of pollutants from the study area increases as pollutants flow through the lid facility there is not enough time to dilute and degrade the pollutants consequently a large amount of pollutants are discharged into the pipe network from fig 5 it can be seen that the reduction effects of runoff volume flood flow and pollutants for the four lid facility combinations the lid scenario performs better than the high rainfall recurrence period in regulating runoff volume and pollutant loads at low rainfall recurrence periods the reason for this result is that the area of the deployed lid facilities is limited and the reduction capacity of each individual facility for runoff volume and pollutants is limited when the rainfall recurrence period p 1a the reduction rate of runoff under scenario 4 is 14 0 1 4 and 12 4 higher than that of scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively for the flood flow reduction rate scenarios 1 2 and 3 are all 13 5 2 4 and 11 2 lower than that of scenario 4 the reason for this result may be that the runoff storage under scenario 4 is all larger than that of the remaining scenarios table 4 the pollutant load reduction rate was highest in scenario 4 with 57 3 for the other rainfall recurrence periods p 3a 5a and 10a the reduction rates were consistent with those for p 1a and were highest for scenario 4 therefore the reduction effect of runoff volume and pollutant load is most obvious in scenario 4 the reason for this is that the bioretention runoff reduction effect and pollutant load reduction effect are better than that of the sunken green space under the same rainfall recurrence period as the rainfall recurrence period increases the effect of bioretention on runoff reduction becomes obvious however the reduction effect of sunken green space on runoff increases and then decreases with the increase of rainfall recurrence period li 2019 3 2 comprehensive benefits evaluation in this study four lid facility combination scenarios were evaluated by 11 evaluation indicators firstly the initial matrices of the four lid facility combination scenarios with different rainfall recurrence periods were established the values of c1 c6 are calculated based on the swmm simulation results fig 5 c7 and c8 are calculated based on the actual facility unit prices and the values of c9 c11 are obtained by referring to relevant literature ma 2019 where the same values of c7 c11 are taken for the same lid facility scenario table a 5 for example the initial matrix a with a rainfall recurrence period of 1a is as follows a 1 38 0 37 8 40 5 46 8 41 7 44 4 6 367 0 401 7 7 8 50 6 48 9 54 1 58 7 54 4 56 2 10 785 0 461 9 9 10 39 6 40 1 42 3 48 5 43 4 46 1 9 289 0 634 7 8 8 52 0 51 3 55 6 60 0 55 9 57 7 13 707 0 694 9 10 10 after normalizing the initial matrix the weights w of each indicator under different recurrence periods were calculated by using matlab software according to equations 2 and 3 the process of calculating the weights of each indicator under the other three rainfall recurrence periods is the same as the above process the weights w1 w3 w5 and w10 of each evaluation indicator under different recurrence periods were calculated as follows w 1 0 0117 0 0099 0 8004 0 0116 0 0114 0 0112 0 0490 0 0110 0 0229 0 0380 0 0229 w 3 0 0096 0 0095 0 8037 0 0105 0 0107 0 0104 0 0441 0 0099 0 0282 0 0352 0 0282 w 5 0 0121 0 0097 0 7940 0 0101 0 0100 0 0099 0 0389 0 0100 0 0357 0 0339 0 0357 w 10 0 0157 0 0116 0 7517 0 0131 0 0130 0 0129 0 0306 0 0132 0 0519 0 0344 0 0519 from the calculation results we get that when p 1a the evaluation indicator ranking is c3 c7 c10 c9 c11 c1 c4 c5 c6 c8 c2 when p 3a c3 c8 c7 c9 c11 c10 c4 c5 c6 c2 c1 when p 5a c3 c8 c7 c9 c11 c10 c4 c5 c6 c2 c1 when p 10a c3 c8 c7 c9 c11 c10 c4 c5 c6 c2 c1 the ss reduction rate has the largest weight in each recurrence period and the infrastructure and o m costs also have a larger weight it can be obtained that when choosing the lid facility combination scenario the effect of the facility combination on ss removal in runoff should be fully considered also the infrastructure costs and o m costs of the facility combination are not negligible parts in the selection of options the results of this study are consistent with those obtained by luan et al 2019 under the same evaluation indicator the relative proportions of different rainfall recurrence periods varied fig 6 for example the percentages of runoff reduction rate under different rainfall recurrence periods are 24 20 25 and 32 respectively when the rainfall recurrence period p 10a the relative percentage of the flood flow reduction indicator is 5 6 and 5 higher than the rest of the rainfall recurrence periods respectively the relative percentage of rainfall recurrence period p 1a is 3 6 and 11 higher than the rest of the recurrence periods p 3a 5a and 10a under the infrastructure cost indicator when the rainfall recurrence period p 10a the relative percentages of o m cost indicators are 5 8 and 7 higher than the rest of the rainfall recurrence periods respectively in summary there should be a focus on the consideration of evaluation indicators when choosing the combination of lid facilities under different rainfall intensities if the intensity of rainfall is small the consideration of infrastructure costs and ecological landscape functions should be favored if the intensity of rainfall is higher there is no doubt that the focus should be on water quantity water quality reduction effect and o m costs therefore in the actual sponge facilities construction process should fully consider the impact of different rainfall intensity on the choice of sponge facilities combination the results of this study are similar to those obtained by hou et al 2020 according to the weight values of each evaluation indicator calculated by critic method and combined with the actual values of each indicator under the four scenarios the composite indices of the four scenarios under different recurrence periods were calculated by equations 4 and 5 as shown in table 5 the results of the composite index method show that scenario 4 reaches the maximum value with different rainfall recurrence periods and its composite indexes are 96 0 86 4 78 4 and 69 4 respectively a larger composite index indicates that the combined effect of the scenario is better therefore scenario 4 is the optimal lid facility combination with the increase in the recurrence period of rainfall the composite index of all four lid facility combinations decreases the result that the reduction capacity of runoff volume flood flow and pollutants of lid facility combinations gradually decreases with the increase of rainfall recurrence period indicating that it is reasonable to select the optimal lid facility combination scenario by the composite index method 3 3 optimum solution validation 3 3 1 selection of representative rain patterns rainfall at the medium and heavy rainfall and above levels in xi an showed a weak increasing trend but the increasing trend was not significant the cyclical oscillations of rainfall and rainfall days were more consistent across levels with introductory oscillations 20 25 years dominating for light rainfall heavy rainfall and above and total rainfall and internal oscillations 3 4 years dominating for medium rainfall shen et al 2015 consequently the internal variability of rainfall in the study area is stable and cyclical there is a basis for screening rainfall data from meteorological stations in the study area using the fuzzy pattern recognition method xi an has frequent rainfall during the rainy season and many rainfall events so the fuzzy pattern recognition method was used to screen a few of the most representative rainfall processes as model input data when verifying the optimal lid facility combination scenario based on the rainfall data obtained from the meteorological stations in the study area the closeness vectors of several rainfall processes were calculated by equation 6 and 7 finally three representative rainfall processes were screened out on 2021 7 26 2021 8 30 and 2021 9 18 the closeness vectors were 0 86 0 80 0 85 0 84 0 83 0 88 0 87 0 76 0 89 0 76 0 84 0 87 0 59 0 81 0 92 0 83 0 90 0 91 0 86 0 88 0 89 from the above results it is concluded that the three measured rainfall patterns belong to the post main bimodal post peak and pre peak rainfall patterns respectively based on the measured rainfall process lines fig 7 a b c the results are consistent with the fuzzy pattern identification method which illustrates the reasonableness of the fuzzy pattern identification method 3 3 2 reliability verification of optimal solutions in order to verify the reliability of the optimal scheme three representative measured rainfall data are input into the swmm model from fig 7 a b c we can see the variation curves of runoff processes during the three rainfall events on 2021 7 26 2021 8 30 and 2021 9 18 for the no lid facility and the four facility combination scenarios for each facility scenario the runoff and peak flows are substantially reduced compared to the no lid scenario 2021 7 26 the peak runoff occurs around 7 2 h the reduction in runoff and peak flow is most effective under scenario 4 with reduction rates of up to 52 7 and 50 9 respectively for the other three facility scenarios the runoff and peak flow reduction rates are 17 5 6 7 15 7 and 13 5 3 and 10 9 lower than those for scenario 4 for 2021 8 30 and 2021 9 18 the peak runoff occurs at about 12 7 hours and 3 5 hours respectively and the runoff and peak flow reduction rates are most effective under scenario 4 the reduction rates were 52 0 52 1 and 52 4 and 51 0 respectively the reduction rates of pollutant loads for the four scenarios are shown in fig 7 d the reduction rates of four pollutant loads ss cod tp and tn were 41 46 42 and 45 for scenario 1 40 45 41 and 44 for scenario 2 43 48 44 and 47 for scenario 3 and 56 60 56 and 58 for scenario 4 respectively it can be seen that the pollutant load reduction rate is highest in scenario 4 in summary the reduction rate of runoff volume and pollutant load in scenario 4 is considerably higher than the other scenarios and the reduction effect is obvious 4 conclusion this paper simulates the reduction of runoff volume and pollutant load under four rainfall recurrence periods with different lid facility combination scenarios by constructing a swmm model for the study area the weights of the evaluation indicators were obtained by the critic method and the composite indexes of the four scenarios were obtained by the composite index method the optimal lid facility combination was selected secondly the most representative three measured rainfall data were selected by the fuzzy pattern recognition method as the input parameters of the model to further verify the rationality of the optimal scenarios suggestions are provided for the construction of sponge facilities similar to this study area from the above study the following conclusions are drawn the reduction rate of runoff peak flow reduction rate and pollutant load reduction rate all decrease with the increase of rainfall recurrence period and the lid facility combination scenario performs better than the high rainfall recurrence period in regulating runoff volume and pollutant load under the low rainfall recurrence period this indicates that the focus of the evaluation indicators is different under different rainfall intensities when the combination of lid facilities is selected according to the perennial rainfall observation data of the area if the rainfall intensity is small the focus is on the infrastructure construction cost rainwater utilization rate and ecological landscape function of the facility combination if the rainfall intensity is large the focus will be on runoff volume and pollutant load reduction effect the composite index method was calculated to obtain composite indexes of 66 73 88 00 71 68 and 92 23 for the four scenarios so that scenario 4 is the optimal lid facility combination three measured rainfall data on 2021 7 26 2021 8 30 and 2021 9 18 were used as model input data to verify the reliability of scenario 4 under the four scenarios the reduction rates of runoff volume for scenario 4 were 51 8 52 1 and 51 7 respectively all of which were higher than the other scenarios at the same time the pollutant load reduction rates for scenario 4 were 14 15 and 12 higher than those of scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively consequently scenario 4 is the optimal lid facility combination in addition the life cycle of each facility was not taken into account in the selection of evaluation indicators which needs to be taken into account in subsequent studies to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the scheme evaluation the method used for calculating the weights of the evaluation indicators is biased towards objective factors and there is a need to improve the method of combining subjective factors in subsequent studies to make the calculation of the weights of the evaluation indicators more relevant to reality declaration of competing interest none

954,the campus is facing the problems of waterlogging and runoff pollution to mitigate these phenomena this study constructs a swmm model using a campus as the study area the reduction effects of runoff volume and pollutant load under four lid facility combination scenarios were simulated eleven evaluation indicators were selected from environmental economic and social aspects and the weights of each indicator were calculated by applying the critic method the relative percentage of different rainfall recurrence periods under the same evaluation indicator was obtained the composite index

scenario the results show that the reduction rates of runoff volume and pollutant load under scenario 4 are 2 7 4 2 and 4 7 higher than those under scenarios 1 2 and 3 based on the above study the optimal lid facility combination selected in this paper will provide a reference for the construction of sponge facilities similar to this study area key words swmm critic composite index method fuzzy pattern recognition method 1 introduction rapid urbanization affects hydrology environment and ecosystems on a regional and global scale gao et al 2003 shi et al 2016 the effects of urbanization on the hydrological cycle include mainly the increase in runoff and peak flows with extreme rainfall events leopold et al 1968 walsh et al 2005 as urban populations continue to increase the percentage of impervious areas in cities is rising leading to significant deterioration in water quality davis et al 2005 kayhanian et al 2012 barbosa et al 2012 many theories and techniques have been proposed due to the increase in runoff and peak flows and the deterioration of water quality caused by rapid urbanization existing stormwater management practices include low impact development lid and best management practices bmp in the united states sustainable urban drainage system suds in the united kingdom and sponge city construction scc in china beak et al 2015 thuy et al 2019 li et al 2019 urban underlying conditions have changed seriously with a significant reduction in green areas and an increase in impervious areas such as building roads these phenomena lead to a reduction in the infiltration of runoff volume during the heavy rainfall season and the drainage system is unable to drain the rainwater quickly to mitigate these problems many scholars have proposed a combination of lid facilities to alleviate waterlogging and runoff pollution li et al 2019 taghizadeh et al 2021 reduced total suspended solids tss total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations by 97 68 and 72 respectively in the study area by optimising the type and area of low impact development best management practices lid bmp in urban areas hamouz et al 2019 based on the swmm model studied the hydrological performance of green and grey roofs located in coastal areas to provide recommendations for roof retrofitting in cities babaei et al 2018 used the swmm model to estimate surface runoff from urban sub catchments evaluate the accuracy of the drainage system in the studied urban area and prioritise the sub catchments using the promethee ii method and swmm koc et al 2021 evaluated the performance of seven different lid scenarios the results showed that community resistance operational feasibility and quantifiable benefits are the most important criteria for selecting lid scenarios in terms of social economic and ecological aspects respectively and in combination with green roofs and bioretentions the impact of urban flooding can be significantly reduced chui et al 2016 studied the optimal lid scenario and showed that at least 20 reduction in peak runoff was achieved under the optimal lid scenario li et al 2017 suggested that bioretentions green roofs retention ponds and sunken green spaces are preferred as sponge construction facilities they then evaluated the performance of a lid combination consisting of two or three components today due to the low design standard of the drainage network and the large percentage of impervious areas in the old campus it is very easy to form campus waterlogging and cause runoff pollution problems therefore it is important to select an optimal lid facility combination scenario to alleviate the campus waterlogging and pollution problems this paper will set up four lid facility combination scenarios based on the swmm model the critic method is used to calculate weight values to each evaluation indicator and the composite index method is used to quantify the combined effect of different lid facility combinations to select the optimal lid facility combination scenario it provides a basis for the construction of sponge facilities similar to this study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the built up area of xi an e107 40 109 49 and n33 39 34 45 as shown in fig 1 xi an is located in the middle of the guanzhong plain bordered by the wei river in the north and the qinling mountains in the south and is one of the important birthplaces of chinese civilization and the chinese nation the city has a warm temperate semi humid continental monsoon climate the average annual rainfall is 584 9 mm and the average annual evaporation is 990 mm jia et al 2016 with heavy rainfall from may to october accounting for 78 7 of the annual rainfall the total area of the study area is 0 26 km2 the study area consists of buildings impervious surfaces green areas and waters and the impervious area is 0 20 km2 accounting for 76 9 of the total area the large percentage of impervious areas coupled with the aging pipe network and low initial design standards cannot meet the drainage requirements for short duration high intensity rainfall it frequently leads to large waterlogging of the campus during the rainy season thus forming internal flooding and susceptible to runoff pollution the overall topography of the study area is high in the east and low in the west high in the south and low in the north which makes it suitable for sponge campus renovation 2 2 data sources the data to be input for constructing the swmm model of the study area mainly include meteorological data underlying data and pipe network data the meteorological data is mainly the complete rainfall series which comes from the meteorological station on campus the underlying data mainly includes land use slope and ground elevation the pipe network data mainly includes pipe length pipe diameter and pipe bottom elevation both of them are obtained through a field survey 2 3 indicator selection and evaluation criteria the selection of reasonable evaluation indicators is crucial to the evaluation of the lid facility combination and the evaluation indicators should be easy to quantify many studies nowadays demonstrate that the combined benefits of lid facility combinations are mainly reflected in their runoff volume and quality control and reduction effects darnthamrongkul and mozingo 2021 raei et al 2019 yang et al 2020 meanwhile construction operation and maintenance o m costs are the main factors that substantially impact gscis implementation in the decision making process consequently in many studies construction o m costs are considered as one of the selected criteria for evaluating the options bhatt et al 2019 gogate et al 2017 han et al 2021 therefore in this study 11 indicators were selected for the evaluation of different lid scenarios including runoff reduction rate flood reduction rate ss reduction rate cod reduction rate tp reduction rate tn reduction rate infrastructure construction cost o m cost rainwater utilization rate ecological landscape function and public acceptance c1 c11 the standard values of the evaluation indicators for the lid facility combinations are determined by referencing the literature li et al 2021 and are shown in table 1 2 4 swmm model 2 4 1 generalization of the model the study area in this paper is small in size with reference to the distribution of building structures within the study area pipe network measurement data road alignment and slope the study area is divided into 51 sub catchments 106 pipe sections and 106 nodes using the manual sub catchment division method fig 2 the horton infiltration model was selected for the study area the non linear reservoir model was used to calculate the runoff concentration process and the dynamic wave method was used to calculate the drainage system 2 4 2 parameter input this paper uses the chicago rain pattern to generate rainfall scenarios with recurrence periods of 1a 3a 5a and 10a based on the xi an rainstorm intensity equation 1 as the model base input data the precipitation for the four recurrence periods were 12 775 mm 30 543 mm 38 804 mm and 50 014 mm respectively while urban flooding is frequent the problem of urban runoff pollution caused by rainfall should not be underestimated since the study area is located in the center of the city the population is concentrated and dense and its living and production human activities are more frequent the pollutants produced to some extent enter the urban water body through various ways to cause pollution therefore it is necessary to study the problem of water pollution caused by rainfall the runoff quality parameters table 2 in the study area of this paper refer to the swmm manual and the data of the similar area study mark et al 2019 1 q 2210 87 1 2 915 lg p t 21 933 0 974 where q is rainstorm intensity l s hm 2 p is the recurrence period of rainfall a t is rainfall duration min 2 4 3 model parameter validation due to the lack of actual measured outfall information in this study area the integrated runoff coefficient rate model is used in this paper the integrated runoff coefficient is a concept proposed to meet the design of stormwater pipes it has a specific physical meaning and its value depends on the ground cover of the catchment area the condition of the underlying etc and has a specific range of values liu et al 2009 the method of rainfall runoff model calibration based on runoff coefficients needs to obtain runoff coefficients first including two aspects the integrated runoff coefficient of the catchment area and the acquisition of runoff coefficient model simulation values the impervious cover area in the study area before lid was set was 76 2 the empirical runoff coefficient for the catchment area is 0 60 0 85 for densely built up areas impervious coverage area 70 which is based on the urban area integrated runoff coefficient in the urban drainage design manual madrazo uribeetxebarria et al 2021 and zaghloul 1983 found that n imperv dstore imperv dstore perv etc are swmm model sensitivity parameters and they were used as the main adjustment parameters in the first iteration after running the model it was obtained that the integrated runoff coefficient of the study area was 85 9 when p 10a which did not satisfy the empirical range of values after four iterations of adjusting the parameters table 3 the swmm model was run and the integrated runoff coefficient of the study area was calculated as 63 4 at p 1a 69 6 at p 3a 75 6 at p 5a and 80 8 at p 10a the simulation results satisfy the empirical taking specification of the integrated runoff coefficient so the model setting is reasonable 2 4 4 scenario design selection of suitable low impact development facilities with reference to the study area underlying and measured waterlogging points for example permeable pavement is suitable for roadsides and squares and green roofs are suitable for building roofs facilities such as sunken green space bioretention and rain garden are suitable for placement in green areas consequently there are four combinations of lid facilities in this study scenario 1 is rain garden permeable pavement sunken green space scenario 2 is rain garden permeable pavement sunken green space green roof scenario 3 is rain garden permeable pavement bioretention scenario 4 is rain garden permeable pavement bioretention cell green roof fig 3 the area of the rain garden is 4410m2 the green roof is 10 040m2 the permeable pavement is 16 966 6m2 the sunken green space area is 3 280 81m2 and the bioretention is 5 908 97m2 the area of the four combinations of lid facilities accounts for 9 4 13 2 10 4 and 14 2 of the total area of the study area respectively determine the parameters of a single lid facility with reference to the sponge construction planning and design of the xiaozhai area the specific parameters are shown in table a 1 and table a 2 2 5 research methodology 2 5 1 critic method there are two main methods commonly used to calculate the weights of evaluation indicators namely the subjective assignment method and the objective assignment method the subjective weighting methods mainly include the ahp method delphi dephi method expert scoring method objective weighting methods mainly include standard deviation method entropy method critic method and coefficient of variation method ma 2019 if the subjective weighting method is used to calculate the weights of evaluation indicators there is a great subjective will which makes the calculated results too idealized therefore this paper uses the objective weighting method to calculate the weight of each evaluation indicator and the calculation results are more in line with reality the critic method is an objective weighting method proposed by diakoulaki et al 1995 and its basic idea is to determine the objective weights of the indicators its calculation method is simple and the calculation results are reliable therefore this paper selects the critic method to calculate the weights of evaluation indicators in this paper the critic method is selected to calculate the weights of evaluation indicators the critic method is based on two basic concepts the first is the intensity of contrast which indicates the size of the difference between the values taken by the various evaluation options for the same indicator expressed in the form of standard deviation secondly the conflict between indicators is evaluated and the conflict between indicators is based on the correlation between indicators if there is a strong positive correlation between two indicators it means that the conflict between the two indicators is low bhadra et al 2021 the objective weight of each indicator is the combined measure of contrast intensity and conflict let cj denote the amount of information contained in j evaluation indicators then cj can be expressed as wu et al 2020 2 c j σ j t 1 n 1 r t j j 1 2 m where cj is standard deviation rtj is correlation coefficient between indicator t and j the larger cj is the greater the amount of information contained in the jth evaluation indicator and the greater the relative importance of that indicator so the objective weight wj of the jth indicator is expressed as 3 w j c j j 1 m c j j 1 2 m 2 5 2 composite index method the composite index method is an evaluation method that takes the positive and negative mean values as the benchmark and finds the discounted index of each indicator and then aggregates them the larger the composite index the better the overall effectiveness of the object the calculation equation is as follows wirehn et al 2015 4 y i x i x i 5 y i 1 x y i w i i 1 x x i x i w i where yi is individual index of the ith evaluation indicator xi is evaluation value of the ith evaluation indicator xi is evaluation criteria value of the ith evaluation indicator y is aggregate index calculated from the comprehensive evaluation wi is weight of the ith evaluation indicator in the overall evaluation 2 5 3 fuzzy pattern recognition method the fuzzy pattern recognition method is a method to discriminate against the rainstorm pattern that has been summarised by the scholars concerned the ratio of rainfall over time to the total rainfall is used as an indicator to determine the rain pattern and seven standard pattern matrices are established the closeness of each measured rainfall to the seven pattern rain patterns fig 4 is calculated separately and this is used as the basis for determining the rain pattern of the measured rainfall among them according to the different locations of the rain peaks the seven pattern rain patterns can be classified as front peaked i back peaked ii symmetrical iii uniform iv equal bimodal v back major bimodal vi and front major bimodal vii molokov and shtigorin 1956 the calculation equation is as follows 6 x i δ h i h x i 1 2 n 7 σ k 1 1 n i 1 n v k i x i 2 k 1 2 7 where hi is rainfall for each divisional period hx is total rainfall σk is the closeness of the kth rainfall n is number of periods of divided rainfall vki is standard rainfall period vector xi is rainfall time vector if the kth closeness is the largest then the rainfall is the kth rain type 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of simulation results with the use of swmm the runoff volumes are simulated for four scenarios that are shown in table a 3 the four combinations of lid facilities have a reduction in both runoff volume and peak flows as the rainfall recurrence period increases the reduction in runoff and peak flows decreases the reason for these changes is that as the rainfall recurrence period increases the intensity of the rainfall increases and the runoff cannot infiltrate promptly as a result a large amount of runoff flows into the pipe network and the network cannot discharge the runoff in a timely manner the pollutant ss cod tp and tn simulation results for the four lid facility combinations under different rainfall recurrence periods are shown in table a 4 as the recurrence period increases the emissions of the four pollutants increase the largest amount of ss is emitted followed by cod tp and tn and the least amount of tp is emitted as the rainfall recurrence period increases the reduction effect of the four pollutants decreases the reasons for this change are summarized as follows as the rainfall recurrence period increases the washout of pollutants from the study area increases as pollutants flow through the lid facility there is not enough time to dilute and degrade the pollutants consequently a large amount of pollutants are discharged into the pipe network from fig 5 it can be seen that the reduction effects of runoff volume flood flow and pollutants for the four lid facility combinations the lid scenario performs better than the high rainfall recurrence period in regulating runoff volume and pollutant loads at low rainfall recurrence periods the reason for this result is that the area of the deployed lid facilities is limited and the reduction capacity of each individual facility for runoff volume and pollutants is limited when the rainfall recurrence period p 1a the reduction rate of runoff under scenario 4 is 14 0 1 4 and 12 4 higher than that of scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively for the flood flow reduction rate scenarios 1 2 and 3 are all 13 5 2 4 and 11 2 lower than that of scenario 4 the reason for this result may be that the runoff storage under scenario 4 is all larger than that of the remaining scenarios table 4 the pollutant load reduction rate was highest in scenario 4 with 57 3 for the other rainfall recurrence periods p 3a 5a and 10a the reduction rates were consistent with those for p 1a and were highest for scenario 4 therefore the reduction effect of runoff volume and pollutant load is most obvious in scenario 4 the reason for this is that the bioretention runoff reduction effect and pollutant load reduction effect are better than that of the sunken green space under the same rainfall recurrence period as the rainfall recurrence period increases the effect of bioretention on runoff reduction becomes obvious however the reduction effect of sunken green space on runoff increases and then decreases with the increase of rainfall recurrence period li 2019 3 2 comprehensive benefits evaluation in this study four lid facility combination scenarios were evaluated by 11 evaluation indicators firstly the initial matrices of the four lid facility combination scenarios with different rainfall recurrence periods were established the values of c1 c6 are calculated based on the swmm simulation results fig 5 c7 and c8 are calculated based on the actual facility unit prices and the values of c9 c11 are obtained by referring to relevant literature ma 2019 where the same values of c7 c11 are taken for the same lid facility scenario table a 5 for example the initial matrix a with a rainfall recurrence period of 1a is as follows a 1 38 0 37 8 40 5 46 8 41 7 44 4 6 367 0 401 7 7 8 50 6 48 9 54 1 58 7 54 4 56 2 10 785 0 461 9 9 10 39 6 40 1 42 3 48 5 43 4 46 1 9 289 0 634 7 8 8 52 0 51 3 55 6 60 0 55 9 57 7 13 707 0 694 9 10 10 after normalizing the initial matrix the weights w of each indicator under different recurrence periods were calculated by using matlab software according to equations 2 and 3 the process of calculating the weights of each indicator under the other three rainfall recurrence periods is the same as the above process the weights w1 w3 w5 and w10 of each evaluation indicator under different recurrence periods were calculated as follows w 1 0 0117 0 0099 0 8004 0 0116 0 0114 0 0112 0 0490 0 0110 0 0229 0 0380 0 0229 w 3 0 0096 0 0095 0 8037 0 0105 0 0107 0 0104 0 0441 0 0099 0 0282 0 0352 0 0282 w 5 0 0121 0 0097 0 7940 0 0101 0 0100 0 0099 0 0389 0 0100 0 0357 0 0339 0 0357 w 10 0 0157 0 0116 0 7517 0 0131 0 0130 0 0129 0 0306 0 0132 0 0519 0 0344 0 0519 from the calculation results we get that when p 1a the evaluation indicator ranking is c3 c7 c10 c9 c11 c1 c4 c5 c6 c8 c2 when p 3a c3 c8 c7 c9 c11 c10 c4 c5 c6 c2 c1 when p 5a c3 c8 c7 c9 c11 c10 c4 c5 c6 c2 c1 when p 10a c3 c8 c7 c9 c11 c10 c4 c5 c6 c2 c1 the ss reduction rate has the largest weight in each recurrence period and the infrastructure and o m costs also have a larger weight it can be obtained that when choosing the lid facility combination scenario the effect of the facility combination on ss removal in runoff should be fully considered also the infrastructure costs and o m costs of the facility combination are not negligible parts in the selection of options the results of this study are consistent with those obtained by luan et al 2019 under the same evaluation indicator the relative proportions of different rainfall recurrence periods varied fig 6 for example the percentages of runoff reduction rate under different rainfall recurrence periods are 24 20 25 and 32 respectively when the rainfall recurrence period p 10a the relative percentage of the flood flow reduction indicator is 5 6 and 5 higher than the rest of the rainfall recurrence periods respectively the relative percentage of rainfall recurrence period p 1a is 3 6 and 11 higher than the rest of the recurrence periods p 3a 5a and 10a under the infrastructure cost indicator when the rainfall recurrence period p 10a the relative percentages of o m cost indicators are 5 8 and 7 higher than the rest of the rainfall recurrence periods respectively in summary there should be a focus on the consideration of evaluation indicators when choosing the combination of lid facilities under different rainfall intensities if the intensity of rainfall is small the consideration of infrastructure costs and ecological landscape functions should be favored if the intensity of rainfall is higher there is no doubt that the focus should be on water quantity water quality reduction effect and o m costs therefore in the actual sponge facilities construction process should fully consider the impact of different rainfall intensity on the choice of sponge facilities combination the results of this study are similar to those obtained by hou et al 2020 according to the weight values of each evaluation indicator calculated by critic method and combined with the actual values of each indicator under the four scenarios the composite indices of the four scenarios under different recurrence periods were calculated by equations 4 and 5 as shown in table 5 the results of the composite index method show that scenario 4 reaches the maximum value with different rainfall recurrence periods and its composite indexes are 96 0 86 4 78 4 and 69 4 respectively a larger composite index indicates that the combined effect of the scenario is better therefore scenario 4 is the optimal lid facility combination with the increase in the recurrence period of rainfall the composite index of all four lid facility combinations decreases the result that the reduction capacity of runoff volume flood flow and pollutants of lid facility combinations gradually decreases with the increase of rainfall recurrence period indicating that it is reasonable to select the optimal lid facility combination scenario by the composite index method 3 3 optimum solution validation 3 3 1 selection of representative rain patterns rainfall at the medium and heavy rainfall and above levels in xi an showed a weak increasing trend but the increasing trend was not significant the cyclical oscillations of rainfall and rainfall days were more consistent across levels with introductory oscillations 20 25 years dominating for light rainfall heavy rainfall and above and total rainfall and internal oscillations 3 4 years dominating for medium rainfall shen et al 2015 consequently the internal variability of rainfall in the study area is stable and cyclical there is a basis for screening rainfall data from meteorological stations in the study area using the fuzzy pattern recognition method xi an has frequent rainfall during the rainy season and many rainfall events so the fuzzy pattern recognition method was used to screen a few of the most representative rainfall processes as model input data when verifying the optimal lid facility combination scenario based on the rainfall data obtained from the meteorological stations in the study area the closeness vectors of several rainfall processes were calculated by equation 6 and 7 finally three representative rainfall processes were screened out on 2021 7 26 2021 8 30 and 2021 9 18 the closeness vectors were 0 86 0 80 0 85 0 84 0 83 0 88 0 87 0 76 0 89 0 76 0 84 0 87 0 59 0 81 0 92 0 83 0 90 0 91 0 86 0 88 0 89 from the above results it is concluded that the three measured rainfall patterns belong to the post main bimodal post peak and pre peak rainfall patterns respectively based on the measured rainfall process lines fig 7 a b c the results are consistent with the fuzzy pattern identification method which illustrates the reasonableness of the fuzzy pattern identification method 3 3 2 reliability verification of optimal solutions in order to verify the reliability of the optimal scheme three representative measured rainfall data are input into the swmm model from fig 7 a b c we can see the variation curves of runoff processes during the three rainfall events on 2021 7 26 2021 8 30 and 2021 9 18 for the no lid facility and the four facility combination scenarios for each facility scenario the runoff and peak flows are substantially reduced compared to the no lid scenario 2021 7 26 the peak runoff occurs around 7 2 h the reduction in runoff and peak flow is most effective under scenario 4 with reduction rates of up to 52 7 and 50 9 respectively for the other three facility scenarios the runoff and peak flow reduction rates are 17 5 6 7 15 7 and 13 5 3 and 10 9 lower than those for scenario 4 for 2021 8 30 and 2021 9 18 the peak runoff occurs at about 12 7 hours and 3 5 hours respectively and the runoff and peak flow reduction rates are most effective under scenario 4 the reduction rates were 52 0 52 1 and 52 4 and 51 0 respectively the reduction rates of pollutant loads for the four scenarios are shown in fig 7 d the reduction rates of four pollutant loads ss cod tp and tn were 41 46 42 and 45 for scenario 1 40 45 41 and 44 for scenario 2 43 48 44 and 47 for scenario 3 and 56 60 56 and 58 for scenario 4 respectively it can be seen that the pollutant load reduction rate is highest in scenario 4 in summary the reduction rate of runoff volume and pollutant load in scenario 4 is considerably higher than the other scenarios and the reduction effect is obvious 4 conclusion this paper simulates the reduction of runoff volume and pollutant load under four rainfall recurrence periods with different lid facility combination scenarios by constructing a swmm model for the study area the weights of the evaluation indicators were obtained by the critic method and the composite indexes of the four scenarios were obtained by the composite index method the optimal lid facility combination was selected secondly the most representative three measured rainfall data were selected by the fuzzy pattern recognition method as the input parameters of the model to further verify the rationality of the optimal scenarios suggestions are provided for the construction of sponge facilities similar to this study area from the above study the following conclusions are drawn the reduction rate of runoff peak flow reduction rate and pollutant load reduction rate all decrease with the increase of rainfall recurrence period and the lid facility combination scenario performs better than the high rainfall recurrence period in regulating runoff volume and pollutant load under the low rainfall recurrence period this indicates that the focus of the evaluation indicators is different under different rainfall intensities when the combination of lid facilities is selected according to the perennial rainfall observation data of the area if the rainfall intensity is small the focus is on the infrastructure construction cost rainwater utilization rate and ecological landscape function of the facility combination if the rainfall intensity is large the focus will be on runoff volume and pollutant load reduction effect the composite index method was calculated to obtain composite indexes of 66 73 88 00 71 68 and 92 23 for the four scenarios so that scenario 4 is the optimal lid facility combination three measured rainfall data on 2021 7 26 2021 8 30 and 2021 9 18 were used as model input data to verify the reliability of scenario 4 under the four scenarios the reduction rates of runoff volume for scenario 4 were 51 8 52 1 and 51 7 respectively all of which were higher than the other scenarios at the same time the pollutant load reduction rates for scenario 4 were 14 15 and 12 higher than those of scenarios 1 2 and 3 respectively consequently scenario 4 is the optimal lid facility combination in addition the life cycle of each facility was not taken into account in the selection of evaluation indicators which needs to be taken into account in subsequent studies to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the scheme evaluation the method used for calculating the weights of the evaluation indicators is biased towards objective factors and there is a need to improve the method of combining subjective factors in subsequent studies to make the calculation of the weights of the evaluation indicators more relevant to reality declaration of competing interest none
