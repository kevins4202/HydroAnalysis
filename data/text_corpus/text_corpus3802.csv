information concerning the chemotactic biosorption of microorganism is severely limited thus far therefore chemotactic biosorption a novel way of sorption was put forward the equation was defined as a chemotactic biosorption a extracellular biosorption a passive extracellular biosorption e intracellular effects of controlling parameters like pollutant fertilizer sediments and surfactant on bacterial chemotactic sorption capacity of tetradecane hexadecane phenanthrene or pyrene were described in detail the results showed bacterial chemotactic biosorption would be promoted under the conditions of low pollutant concentration high sediment concentration and fertilizer however tween 80 would promote the sorption of pollutants onto bacterial cells depending on the concentration of surfactant correlational analyses were conducted with the biodegradation rate and the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass we concluded there existed great correlation between

bacterial chemotactic sorption of tetradecane or hexadecane extracted by hexane was measured by agilent gas chromatograph 7890a with fid using capillary bp5 column 5 phenyl methyl polysiloxane column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 μm both injection and detector temperature are maintained at 280 c initial oven temperature is maintained 80 c for 2 min and then increase to 300 c with 10 c increase per min bacterial chemotactic adsorption of phenanthrene or pyrene extracted by dichloromethane was determined by a agilent hplc fitted with uv detector and a agilent eclipse xdb c8 column 4 5 mm 150 mm 5 μm using methanol water as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min chromatography was performed at 40 c the excitation wavelength incident wavelength of phenanthrene pyrene were set at 342 383 nm and 384 406 nm respectively 2 6 statistical analysis all results were obtained as mean standard deviation of three independent experiments statistical analysis was conducted using the spass software these dates were compared by anova the dates were expressed as mean sd or ns p 0 05 as compared with the controls 3 results and discussion 3 1 bacterial chemotactic biosorption was put forward past studies of biosorption for removing hydrocarbons pollutant had made some progress the apparent partition coefficients kd in live microbe system and the kd of dead microbes without uptake of petroleum hydrocarbons were compared and then the kd kd ratio was employed to explain the relative contributions of biological adsorption and biodegradation chen et al 2010 the exploration of surface adsorption by dead bacteria were constant for pahs and decreased for crude oil xu et al 2013 although biosorption decreased the rate of pahs biodegradation in the short term it can be also ultimately biodegraded stringfellow and alvarez cohen 1999 it was well known that the sorption desorption behaviors of petroleum hydrocarbons in a seawater sediment or seawater bacteria system were linked biosorption and desorption behaviors of naphthalene and phenanthrene were studied with sediments in a specific environment yang et al 2011 sorption behaviors of dispersed oil in seawaters about granular materials including coastal rocks sediments and bacterial strain were explored in simulation environmental conditions meng and bao 2017a b however there is little research on the relationship between biosorption and degradation therefore the concept of bacterial chemotactic adsorption was put forward fig 1 studied the amount of tetradecane a hexadecane b phenanthrene c and pyrene d adsorbed by sediment dead bacteria or live bacteria and the amount of these petroleum hydrocarbons uptake in live bacteria when bacteria biomass reached to a constant maximum dry cell weight the initial concentration of alkanes and pahs were 2 5 v v and 100 mg l respectively in our study for any given petroleum hydrocarbons the amount of adsorption was always followed the order of live bacteria dead bacteria sediment for any given adsorbents the amount of adsorption was always followed the order of hexadecane tetradecane phenanthrene pyrene based on the above considerations petroleum hydrocarbons adsorbed by living thing live bacteria were always more than non living things dead bacteria or sediment no matter what n alkane or pahs moreover the amount of petroleum hydrocarbons uptake in live bacteria was followed a decreasing order of hexadecane tetradecane pyrene phenanthrene in general desorption rate was slower than sorption rate for example 49 of dissolved petroleum hydrocarbons remained on the sediments gong et al 2014 but petroleum hydrocarbons adsorbed by bacterial chemotactic were not easy to be removed when the desorption equilibrium after 18 h for tetradecane 15 h for hexadecane 24 h for phenanthrene 30 h for pyrene was established fig 1 it was very meaningful to study the bacterial chemotactic biosorption in a follow up work in order to survive better a way of bacteria is to move to nutrients wang and shao 2014 sensory signal transduction changes the concentration of small phosphorylated modulators that bind to the rotational flagellar motor and leads to transformation bi and sourjik 2018 wong ng et al 2018 it was to assume that the uptake process was likely controlled by chemotactic adsorption of bacteria when the equilibrium adsorption was established between extracellular and intracellular fig 2 the equation was defined a chemotactic adsorption a extracellular biosorption a passive extracellular biosorption e intracellular 3 2 chemotactic adsorption experiments as known the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants depends on microorganisms and surrounding environment much more microbes have been isolated for the ability of metabolizing alkanes and pahs gong et al 2014 meng et al 2016 the rate of degradation of hydrocarbons would be influenced by the mean pollutant concentration and seasonal concentration variations guo et al 2018 adding n and p nutrients can promote the removal efficiency bragg et al 1994 and the presence of sediment or dispersant plays a pivotal role in bioremediation of crude oil pollution yang et al 2011 bezza and chirwa 2016 in order to investigate the relationship between biodegradation and chemotactic biosorption it is necessary to study the chemotactic biosorption under varying conditions including pollutant concentration fertilizer sediments and surfactant 3 2 1 effect of pollutant concentration as shown in fig 3 in a certain pollutant concentration range 0 5 2 v v for alkane 5 200 mg l for pahs with hydrocarbon concentrations increased the amount of dry cell weights of bacteria was increased while the concentration mg g of each hydrocarbon measured in the biomass were decreased in general bacterial abundances in crude oil contaminated seawater were decreased obviously after the occurrence of oil spill meng et al 2016 the percentage of biodegradation 78 52 was decreased as crude oil concentration arrange from 1 to 10 was increased rahman et al 2002 however bacterial chemotactic biosorption would be promoted when the concentration of hydrocarbons was at a low concentration explaining a key role of chemotaxis in petroleum hydrocarbons sensing and subsequent uptake wang and shao 2014 wong ng et al 2018 when bacteria seek carbon sources for better living in this work for all pollutant concentrations the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass was at a different level and followed the order of hexadecane tetradecane phenanthrene pyrene it was consistent with the removal efficiencies of petroleum hydrocarbons 3 2 2 effect of fertilizer eight groups of fertilizer were designed to be examined the influences on bacterial chemotactic adsorption fig 4 when the growth of bacteria was at a stable stage the amount of maximum dry cell weights was measured under various nutrient conditions fig 4a c e and g the amount of maximum dry cell weights were all increased when the addition of fertilizer were used at a higher pollutant concentrations including 2 v v of tetradecane or hexadecane 100 mg l of phenanthrene and 50 mg l of pyrene however the amount of maximum dry cell weights remained unchanged when the addition of fertilizer were used at a lower pollutant concentrations including 0 5 v v of tetradecane or hexadecane 10 mg l of phenanthrene and 5 mg l of pyrene this could be explained that the amount of maximum dry cell weights in low carbon culture condition was dominated by nutrient limitation chen et al 2010 the growth of biomass is determined by a low concentration of carbon source but from fig 4b d f and h the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass were all increased with different degrees no matter what high pollutant concentration or low it may be possible that the formation of biofloccules would be occurred and nutrients could be easily utilized for petroleum hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms and enhanced cell aggregation in the culture liao et al 2015 in the previous studies adsorption of n alkane and pahs by strain rhodococcus erythropolis ntu 1 and brevibacillus brevis under various nutrient conditions was used for biosorption study respectively liu et al 2009 yang et al 2011 it was found that the addition of 0 24 g l nutrient broth into the medium would significantly promote the cell aggregation phenomenon during the process and more than 80 95 removal of n alkanes were achieved within 56 68 h it was also suggested that organic phosphate carboxyl and hydroxyl were predominant contributors in pyrene biosorption 3 2 3 effect of sediment fig 5 showed the differences of the amount of maximum dry cell weights and the changing of the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass when the bacteria cultured in the medium with tetradecane 0 5 or 2 v v hexadecane 0 5 or 2 v v phenanthrene 10 or 100 mg l pyrene 5 or 50 mg l as the sole carbon sources with different concentration of sediments with the increasing concentration of sediment the amounts of maximum dry cell weight and the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass were all decreased when the pollutant concentrations were at a low level but when the pollutant concentrations were at a high level the amounts of maximum dry cell weight and the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass were all increased it was opposite with the removal efficiencies of petroleum hydrocarbons for example one study proposed that the accumulation of pahs in sediment would reduce their bioavailability to bacteria and thus retard biodegradation marini and frapiccini 2014 some reasons could be explained this phenomenon it is complex to uncover the interactions between petroleum hydrocarbons bacteria and sediment their roles in developing crude oil pollution countermeasures and how those interactions might change in marine environment gong et al 2014 the hydrocarbons adsorbed on sediments may be far greater than that on bacteria when the pollutant concentrations were at a low level yang et al 2008 the bacteria populations in the water system was probably found to be increased with the increasing sediment concentration when the pollutant concentrations were at a high level xia et al 2006 yang et al 2011 in a word sediment indirectly affected the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass by changing the concentration of pollutant 3 2 4 effect of surfactant the potential for surfactant enhanced bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons pollution have received more and more attention bezza and chirwa 2016 chemical dispersants did disperse oil slick into small oil droplets which stimulated hydrocarbons biodegradation by increasing its bioavailability to indigenous bacteria capable of metabolizing crude oil tremblay et al 2017 hydrocarbons adsorbed on strain lsh 7 in the presence of the tween 80 were studied toward a better understanding of chemotactic biosorption fig 6 the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons including 2 v v of tetradecane or hexadecane 100 mg l of phenanthrene and 50 mg l of pyrene measured in the biomass could be enhanced depending on the concentration of tween 80 of which the most significant promotion of the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass were always achieved at critical micelle concentration of tween 80 approximately surfactant would promote the sorption of pollutants onto bacterial cells which occurred probably by changing the cell surface zeta potential cell surface hydrophobicity or functional groups zhang et al 2013 furthermore the effect of tween 80 on chemotactic adsorption of hexadecane was much more obvious when compared with another hydrocarbons like tetradecane phenanthrene and pyrene and the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass were no longer changed at a higher concentration of tween 80 by contrast rhamnolipid at high concentrations of 200 mg l hindered the biosorption of pahs and further biodegradation ma et al 2018a b 3 3 the correlation between biodegradation and chemotactic adsorption to improve the biodegradation rate the uptake of hydrocarbons by microbes was limited by the process of biosorption phenanthrene or pyrene had been used to investigate pahs sorption by microbe biomass and examine the relationship between pahs sorption and biodegradation stringfellow and alvarez cohen 1999 zhang and zhu 2012 however the presence of biosorption often hinders the degradation of pollutants the biosorption behaviors were varied from alkane to pahs and often controlled by microorganisms with different environment conditions vergeynst et al 2018 because the limiting stage for the removal was not biodegradation but the transfer of substances from the water phase to the bacteria phase the methods of promoting degradation may result in more substrate diffusing across the biofilm and increases the ratio of adsorption rather than biodegradation chen et al 2013 kumari et al 2018 in our study a highly positive correlation p 0 05 was observed between the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass and biodegradation rates of strain lsh 7 fig 7 biodegradation rate were all linearly correlated with the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass in all respects with tetradecane r2 0 9873 hexadecane r2 0 9705 phenanthrene r2 0 9098 and pyrene r2 0 9424 table 1 under the effect of various conditions including pollutant concentration fertilizer sediment content and the concentration of tween 80 it indicated that there existed a close relationship between the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass and biodegradation rate from above results as long as it can be improved the ratio of bacterial chemotactic adsorption biodegradation rate of hydrocarbons will be enhanced this new strategy will improve petroleum hydrocarbons biodegradation to a certain degree 4 conclusions in this work bacterial chemotactic biosorption was proposed and the equation was defined as a chemotactic biosorption a extracellular biosorption a passive extracellular biosorption e intracellular fertilizer low pollutant and high sediment concentration would enhance the chemotactic sorption but the maximum of chemotactic sorption by tween 80 was at critical micelle concentration positive correlations were found between the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass and biodegradation rates of strain lsh 7 under various conditions including pollutant concentration fertilizer sediment content and the concentration of tween 80 the idea will improve hydrocarbon degradation to a certain degree notes the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgement this research was supported by the fundamental research funds for the central

and dichloromethane for pahs all washed solutions by this extraction process were considered as the passive adsorption by dead bacteria the passive biosorption of petroleum hydrocarbons can be expressed as eq 3 3 a passive extracellular biosorption c3 b where a passive extracellular biosorption is the amount of passive extracellular petroleum hydrocarbons adsorbed mg c3 is the concentration mg g of each hydrocarbon measured in the dead biomass b is also the amount of dead biomass g that is equal to live biomass finally the amount of petroleum hydrocarbons by chemotactic adsorption were calculated as it can be seen in eq 4 4 a chemotactic biosorption a extracellular biosorption a passive extracellular biosorption e intracellular in addition sediments adsorption experiments were conducted in the same way 0 45 g of tetradecane 0 56 g of hexadecane 0 37 g of phenanthrene and 0 28 g of pyrene after incubation sediments were washed one time with distilled water two times with respective extractants hexane for alkane and dichloromethane for pahs all washed solutions were measured respectively after bacteria or sediments adsorption experiments of hexadecane tetradecane

conducted with different concentration of tetradecane 2 5 v v 2 v v 1 v v and 0 5 v v for all the concentrations the experiments were performed at 30 c and ph 7 4 when the growth of bacteria was at a stable stage the cell density was measured at day 1 3 5 7 10 respectively for dry cell weights samples were centrifuged using centrifuge neofuge 18r at 7829 g for 10 min and supernatant was removed while distilled water was added into the eppendorf to resuspend and wash cells the liquid was dried at 60 c until constant weight was reached the amount of chemotactic biosorption of tetradecane was determined by the technology of gc fid finally they were sampled at day 2 8 and 9 to calculate the concentration mg g of tetradecane measured in the biomass seemly the selected concentration of hexadecane was 2 5 v v 2 v v 1 v v and 0 5 v v respectively the concentration mg g of hexadecane was measured at day 1 7 8 but for phenanthrene the selected concentration was 200 mg l 100 mg l 50 mg l

amount of petroleum hydrocarbons uptake in biomass but no degrade mg a extracellular biosorption is the amount of total extracellular petroleum hydrocarbons adsorbed mg 2 5 analytical methods bacterial chemotactic sorption of tetradecane or hexadecane extracted by hexane was measured by agilent gas chromatograph 7890a with fid using capillary bp5 column 5 phenyl methyl polysiloxane column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 μm both injection and detector temperature are maintained at 280 c initial oven temperature is maintained 80 c for 2 min and then increase to 300 c with 10 c increase per min bacterial chemotactic adsorption of phenanthrene or pyrene extracted by dichloromethane was determined by a agilent hplc fitted with uv detector and a agilent eclipse xdb c8 column 4 5 mm 150 mm 5 μm using methanol water as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min chromatography was performed at 40 c the excitation wavelength incident wavelength of phenanthrene pyrene were set at 342 383 nm and 384 406 nm respectively 2 6 statistical analysis all results were obtained as mean standard deviation of three independent experiments statistical analysis was conducted using the spass software these dates were compared by anova the dates were expressed as mean sd or ns p 0 05 as compared with the controls 3 results and discussion 3 1 bacterial chemotactic biosorption was put forward past studies of biosorption for removing hydrocarbons pollutant had made some progress the apparent partition coefficients kd in live microbe system and the kd of dead microbes without uptake of petroleum hydrocarbons were compared and then the kd kd ratio was employed to explain the relative contributions of biological adsorption and biodegradation chen et al 2010 the exploration of surface adsorption by dead bacteria were constant for pahs and decreased for crude oil xu et al 2013 although biosorption decreased the rate of pahs biodegradation in the short term it can be also ultimately biodegraded stringfellow and alvarez cohen 1999 it was well known that the sorption desorption behaviors of petroleum hydrocarbons in a seawater sediment or seawater bacteria system were linked biosorption and desorption behaviors of naphthalene and phenanthrene were studied with sediments in a specific environment yang et al 2011 sorption behaviors of dispersed oil in seawaters about granular materials including coastal rocks sediments and bacterial strain were explored in simulation environmental conditions meng and bao 2017a b however there is little research on the relationship between biosorption and degradation therefore the concept of bacterial chemotactic adsorption was put forward fig 1 studied the amount of tetradecane a hexadecane b phenanthrene c and pyrene d adsorbed by sediment dead bacteria or live bacteria and the amount of these petroleum hydrocarbons uptake in live bacteria when bacteria biomass reached to a constant maximum dry cell weight the initial concentration of alkanes and pahs were 2 5 v v and 100 mg l respectively in our study for any given petroleum hydrocarbons the amount of adsorption was always followed the order of live bacteria dead bacteria sediment for any given adsorbents the amount of adsorption was always followed the order of hexadecane tetradecane phenanthrene pyrene based on the above considerations petroleum hydrocarbons adsorbed by living thing live bacteria were always more than non living things dead bacteria or sediment no matter what n alkane or pahs moreover the amount of petroleum hydrocarbons uptake in live bacteria was followed a decreasing order of hexadecane tetradecane pyrene phenanthrene in general desorption rate was slower than sorption rate for example 49 of dissolved petroleum hydrocarbons remained on the sediments gong et al 2014 but petroleum hydrocarbons adsorbed by bacterial chemotactic were not easy to be removed when the desorption equilibrium after 18 h for tetradecane 15 h for hexadecane 24 h for phenanthrene 30 h for pyrene was established fig 1 it was very meaningful to study the bacterial chemotactic biosorption in a follow up work in order to survive better a way of bacteria is to move to nutrients wang and shao 2014 sensory signal transduction changes the concentration of small phosphorylated modulators that bind to the rotational flagellar motor and leads to transformation bi and sourjik 2018 wong ng et al 2018 it was to assume that the uptake process was likely controlled by chemotactic adsorption of bacteria when the equilibrium adsorption was established between extracellular and intracellular fig 2 the equation was defined a chemotactic adsorption a extracellular biosorption a passive extracellular biosorption e intracellular 3 2 chemotactic adsorption experiments as known the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants depends on microorganisms and surrounding environment much more microbes have been isolated for the ability of metabolizing alkanes and pahs gong et al 2014 meng et al 2016 the rate of degradation of hydrocarbons would be influenced by the mean pollutant concentration and seasonal concentration variations guo et al 2018 adding n and p nutrients can promote the removal efficiency bragg et al 1994 and the presence of sediment or dispersant plays a pivotal role in bioremediation of crude oil pollution yang et al 2011 bezza and chirwa 2016 in order to investigate the relationship between biodegradation and chemotactic biosorption it is necessary to study the chemotactic biosorption under varying conditions including pollutant concentration fertilizer sediments and surfactant 3 2 1 effect of pollutant concentration as shown in fig 3 in a certain pollutant concentration range 0 5 2 v v for alkane 5 200 mg l for pahs with hydrocarbon concentrations increased the amount of dry cell weights of bacteria was increased while the concentration mg g of each hydrocarbon measured in the biomass were decreased in general bacterial abundances in crude oil contaminated seawater were decreased obviously after the occurrence of oil spill meng et al 2016 the percentage of biodegradation 78 52 was decreased as crude oil concentration arrange from 1 to 10 was increased rahman et al 2002 however bacterial chemotactic biosorption would be promoted when the concentration of hydrocarbons was at a low concentration explaining a key role of chemotaxis in petroleum hydrocarbons sensing and subsequent uptake wang and shao 2014 wong ng et al 2018 when bacteria seek carbon sources for better living in this work for all pollutant concentrations the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass was at a different level and followed the order of hexadecane tetradecane phenanthrene pyrene it was consistent with the removal efficiencies of petroleum hydrocarbons 3 2 2 effect of fertilizer eight groups of fertilizer were designed to be examined the influences on bacterial chemotactic adsorption fig 4 when the growth of bacteria was at a stable stage the amount of maximum dry cell weights was measured under various nutrient conditions fig 4a c e and g the amount of maximum dry cell weights were all increased when the addition of fertilizer were used at a higher pollutant concentrations including 2 v v of tetradecane or hexadecane 100 mg l of phenanthrene and 50 mg l of pyrene however the amount of maximum dry cell weights remained unchanged when the addition of fertilizer were used at a lower pollutant concentrations including 0 5 v v of tetradecane or hexadecane 10 mg l of phenanthrene and 5 mg l of pyrene this could be explained that the amount of maximum dry cell weights in low carbon culture condition was dominated by nutrient limitation chen et al 2010 the growth of biomass is determined by a low concentration of carbon source but from fig 4b d f and h the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass were all increased with different degrees no matter what high pollutant concentration or low it may be possible that the formation of biofloccules would be occurred and nutrients could be easily utilized for petroleum hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms and enhanced cell aggregation in the culture liao et al 2015 in the previous studies adsorption of n alkane and pahs by strain rhodococcus erythropolis ntu 1 and brevibacillus brevis under various nutrient conditions was used for biosorption study respectively liu et al 2009 yang et al 2011 it was found that the addition of 0 24 g l nutrient broth into the medium would significantly promote the cell aggregation phenomenon during the process and more than 80 95 removal of n alkanes were achieved within 56 68 h it was also suggested that organic phosphate carboxyl and hydroxyl were predominant contributors in pyrene biosorption 3 2 3 effect of sediment fig 5 showed the differences of the amount of maximum dry cell weights and the changing of the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass when the bacteria cultured in the medium with tetradecane 0 5 or 2 v v hexadecane 0 5 or 2 v v phenanthrene 10 or 100 mg l pyrene 5 or 50 mg l as the sole carbon sources with different concentration of sediments with the increasing concentration of sediment the amounts of maximum dry cell weight and the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass were all decreased when the pollutant concentrations were at a low level but when the pollutant concentrations were at a high level the amounts of maximum dry cell weight and the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass were all increased it was opposite with the removal efficiencies of petroleum hydrocarbons for example one study proposed that the accumulation of pahs in sediment would reduce their bioavailability to bacteria and thus retard biodegradation marini and frapiccini 2014 some reasons could be explained this phenomenon it is complex to uncover the interactions between petroleum hydrocarbons bacteria and sediment their roles in developing crude oil pollution countermeasures and how those interactions might change in marine environment gong et al 2014 the hydrocarbons adsorbed on sediments may be far greater than that on bacteria when the pollutant concentrations were at a low level yang et al 2008 the bacteria populations in the water system was probably found to be increased with the increasing sediment concentration when the pollutant concentrations were at a high level xia et al 2006 yang et al 2011 in a word sediment indirectly affected the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass by changing the concentration of pollutant 3 2 4 effect of surfactant the potential for surfactant enhanced bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons pollution have received more and more attention bezza and chirwa 2016 chemical dispersants did disperse oil slick into small oil droplets which stimulated hydrocarbons biodegradation by increasing its bioavailability to indigenous bacteria capable of metabolizing crude oil tremblay et al 2017 hydrocarbons adsorbed on strain lsh 7 in the presence of the tween 80 were studied toward a better understanding of chemotactic biosorption fig 6 the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons including 2 v v of tetradecane or hexadecane 100 mg l of phenanthrene and 50 mg l of pyrene measured in the biomass could be enhanced depending on the concentration of tween 80 of which the most significant promotion of the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass were always achieved at critical micelle concentration of tween 80 approximately surfactant would promote the sorption of pollutants onto bacterial cells which occurred probably by changing the cell surface zeta potential cell surface hydrophobicity or functional groups zhang et al 2013 furthermore the effect of tween 80 on chemotactic adsorption of hexadecane was much more obvious when compared with another hydrocarbons like tetradecane phenanthrene and pyrene and the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass were no longer changed at a higher concentration of tween 80 by contrast rhamnolipid at high concentrations of 200 mg l hindered the biosorption of pahs and further biodegradation ma et al 2018a b 3 3 the correlation between biodegradation and chemotactic adsorption to improve the biodegradation rate the uptake of hydrocarbons by microbes was limited by the process of biosorption phenanthrene or pyrene had been used to investigate pahs sorption by microbe biomass and examine the relationship between pahs sorption and biodegradation stringfellow and alvarez cohen 1999 zhang and zhu 2012 however the presence of biosorption often hinders the degradation of pollutants the biosorption behaviors were varied from alkane to pahs and often controlled by microorganisms with different environment conditions vergeynst et al 2018 because the limiting stage for the removal was not biodegradation but the transfer of substances from the water phase to the bacteria phase the methods of promoting degradation may result in more substrate diffusing across the biofilm and increases the ratio of adsorption rather than biodegradation chen et al 2013 kumari et al 2018 in our study a highly positive correlation p 0 05 was observed between the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass and biodegradation rates of strain lsh 7 fig 7 biodegradation rate were all linearly correlated with the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass in all respects with tetradecane r2 0 9873 hexadecane r2 0 9705 phenanthrene r2 0 9098 and pyrene r2 0 9424 table 1 under the effect of various conditions including pollutant concentration fertilizer sediment content and the concentration of tween 80 it indicated that there existed a close relationship between the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass and biodegradation rate from above results as long as it can be improved the ratio of bacterial chemotactic adsorption biodegradation rate of hydrocarbons will be enhanced this new strategy will improve petroleum hydrocarbons biodegradation to a certain degree 4 conclusions in this work bacterial chemotactic biosorption was proposed and the equation was defined as a chemotactic biosorption a extracellular biosorption a passive extracellular biosorption e intracellular fertilizer low pollutant and high sediment concentration would enhance the chemotactic sorption but the maximum of chemotactic sorption by tween 80 was at critical micelle concentration positive correlations were found between the concentration mg g of hydrocarbons measured in the biomass and biodegradation rates of strain lsh 7 under various conditions including pollutant concentration fertilizer sediment content and the concentration of tween 80 the idea will improve hydrocarbon degradation to a certain degree notes the authors declare no competing financial interest acknowledgement this research was supported by the fundamental research funds for the central

19011,a nationwide survey was conducted on per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in precipitation across mainland china twenty two pfass including precursors to perfluoroalkyl acids pre pfaas were investigated in thirty nine precipitation samples collected from twenty eight cities trifluoroacetate tfa perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos were ubiquitous in precipitation tfa displayed the highest concentrations 8 8 1 8 103 ng l which were particularly elevated in coastal cities 6 2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid an alternative to pfos was detected for the first time in precipitation at a frequency of 43 polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid diesters and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid were also occasionally detected pfas fluxes in the northeastern area c4c12 2 0 102 3 4 103 ng m2 d with major pfas manufacturing facilities were higher than those in the southwestern area 63 1 7 103 ng m2 d using total oxidizable precursor top assay the occurrence of unknown pre pfaas was for the first time uncovered in precipitation with maximum estimated fluxes of c6 and c8 pre pfaas at 3 1 103 and 4 3 103 ng m2 d respectively the relative contribution of ultrashort chain pfcas c2c3 ranged from 22 to 91 of pfass while unknown pre pfaas accounted for 6 56 of the total molar concentrations of pfass this bears critical concerns on underestimation of pfas mass load from precipitation to surface environment ascribed to monitoring data solely on known pfass unknown precursors of pfaas in the atmosphere are yet to be identified for their chemical

late 1940s wang et al 2017 due to their wide usage and persistence pfass have been detected in numerous environmental matrices such as air precipitation dust surface river water and sediment kwok et al 2010 wang et al 2016a yao et al 2016a tian et al 2018 the bioaccumulation potential and adverse effects of long chain pfass wang et al 2013a including perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa c8 and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos c8 raised concerns and led to their gradual phase out since the early 21st century 3m company 2000 u s epa 2006 the production of pfos for instance has shifted from western europe and the united states to china wang et al 2014a additionally pfas manufacturers shifted their production to alternative products in replacement some of which are increasingly detected in the environment wang et al 2013a these pfas alternatives include short chain perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas c4c6 ether pfass and fluorotelomer pfass perfluorobutane sulfonic acid pfbs c4 and c4c6 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas were dominant in italian river basins their total contribution to pfas dwarfed pfos 61 vs 6 valsecchi et al 2015 in recent years pfass with c o c linkages including perfluoropolyethers pfpes have also raised concerns due to their widespread occurrence in the environment from europe and china heydebreck et al 2015 xiao 2017 as an alternative to pfos 6 2

2017 due to analytical limitations only a small fraction of pfass may be currently identified and monitored ruan and jiang 2017 this may lead to the underestimation of pfas associated risks combustion ion chromatography cic revealed that commonly monitored pfcas and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas may represent an incomplete fraction of extractable organofluorine in sediment yeung et al 2013 and adsorbable organic fluorine in surface waters willach et al 2016 as a new method to integrate difficult to measure precursors houtz and sedlak 2012 the total oxidizable precursor top assay has been applied to afff impacted groundwater houtz et al 2013 urban river water ye et al 2014 and wwtp effluent samples houtz et al 2016 it was proposed that 23 63 of pfass in these matrices originated from unknown untargeted pfaa precursors pre pfaas this accounts for a significant indirect source of pfaas in the environment which might have long been overlooked precipitation is an important non point source of pfass to the surface environment xiao et al 2012 the concentrations and fluxes of pfass in precipitation can be strongly influenced by local sources taniyasu et al 2013 pfass can be released into the atmosphere during production usage and disposal via evaporation and suspended dust chen et al 2018 volatile precursors may undergo transformation into pfaas or other intermediates prior scavenging from the atmosphere by wet deposition lei and wania 2004 to the best of our knowledge the proportion of unidentified precursors and intermediates in precipitation remains uninvestigated and largely unknown relevant to this work unidentified pre pfaas were found in urban runoff samples and the concentrations of pfcas increased by a median of 69 after top conversion houtz and sedlak 2012 therefore estimating the total levels of pre pfaas including unknown untargeted precursors in precipitation and their contribution to pfass are of great importance to fill a research gap pfas alternatives including pfpes and dipaps have been produced and used at least for two decades however the occurrence and spatial distribution of these compounds in precipitation in china are yet to be investigated ultrashort chain trifluoroacetate tfa c2 has been reported with higher concentrations in the atmosphere precipitation surface river water soil and sediment than those of its longer chain pfca homologues li et al 2010 wang et al 2014b tian et al 2018 scheurer et al 2017 tfa can be produced from the thermolysis of fluoropolymers and degradation of fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs ellis et al 2001 2004 apart from degradation of pfas precursors tfa is also largely produced by photodegradation of hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfcs and hydrofluorocarbons hfcs kazil et al 2014 in addition tfa may originate from the degradation of non pfas products solomon et al 2016 tfa was reported at levels μg l in precipitation in china and the united states wang et al 2014b kazil et al 2014 this raises concerns because of its accumulation in terminal water bodies russell et al 2012 and recalcitrance to removal scheurer et al 2017 however few reports have studied the occurrence spatial distribution and sources of tfa together with other pfcas in precipitation in this study 39 precipitation samples were collected from 28 cities across mainland china and 22 pfass including novel pfaa alternatives and c2c3 pfcas were analyzed a top assay method was enlisted to estimate the concentrations and fluxes of unknown pre pfaas the objectives of this study were i to

discussion 3 1 concentrations and fluxes of pfass in precipitation 3 1 1 pfaas the detailed concentrations and fluxes of pfass in individual precipitation samples are provided in tables s7 and s8 of the si tfa pfoa and pfos were systematically detected perfluoropropionic acid pfpra pfba pfhxa pfhpa pfna pfda and pfuna were also detected at frequencies of 85 or higher lower frequencies of detection were observed for pfpea 41 pfbs 56 and pfhxs 64 table s7 the total concentrations of pfcas c4c12 and pfsas c4 c6 c8 ranged from 4 8 ng l to 1 9 102 ng l pfcas were the predominant pfaas with mean concentrations generally higher than those of pfsas with the same carbon chain length which was consistent with other studies dreyer et al 2010 kwok et al 2010 zhao et al 2013 this may be due to the current higher production and usage of pfcas and their precursors than those of pfsas in china wang et al 2014a the mean concentration of pfoa in precipitation samples was 10 ng l median 3 4 ng l which was lower than those characterized in snow from dalian city northeastern china mean 25 ng l median 17 ng l liu et al 2009 and from northern china mean 34 ng l median 28 ng l shan et al 2015 but higher than those in precipitation samples from japan 1 94 ng l the united states 3 40 ng l southeastern china 0 32 ng l india 0 21 ng l and france 0 21 ng l kwok et al 2010 pfos concentrations in the present study mean 6 2 3 7 ng l were substantially higher than those in precipitation samples from northern germany 1 ng l dreyer et al 2010 japan 0 81 ng l the united states 0 27 ng l southeastern china 0 32 ng l india 0 04 ng l and france 0 11 ng l kwok et al 2010 but lower than those of snow from northern china in earlier studies liu et al 2009 shan et al 2015 high fluxes of pfoa and pfos were detected at 3 9 1 8 103 ng m2 d mean 1 6 102 ng m2 d and 10 5 1 102 ng m2 d mean 1 1 102 ng m2 d respectively high fluxes of pfba mean 99 130 ng m2 d were also detected which may reflect the current shift to short chain pfaas and or their precursors correspondingly high concentrations of pfba were also recently reported in surface water close to fluorochemical industrial parks china wang et al 2016a chen et al 2018 these results together demonstrated that the production and use of pfass in china are shifting toward the shorter chain alternatives with regard to ultrashort chain pfcas c2c3 tfa displayed generally higher concentrations than other targeted pfca homologues tfa concentrations range 8 8 1 8 103 ng l average 1 5 102 ng l and fluxes range 1 2 102 1 6 104 ng m2 d average 2 2 103 ng m2 d were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of other individual pfaas the observed dominance of tfa over other targeted pfass in precipitation was consistent with previous studies in north america and other regions worldwide scott et al 2006 kwok et al 2010 the concentrations of tfa and pfpra in this study are comparable to those from other studies in china and other countries scott et al 2006 kwok et al 2010 wang et al 2014b elevated tfa concentrations and fluxes have been reported in water bodies in recent years worldwide zhai et al 2015 scheurer et al 2017 it has been further noted that 95 of the annual mass flux of tfa originated from wet deposition berg et al 2000 therefore precipitation is acknowledged as the dominant source of ultrashort chain pfcas c2c3 to surface environment 3 1 2 fluorinated alternatives and dipaps in precipitation samples the detection frequencies of 6 2 ftsa and 6 2 cl pfaes were 41 and 43 respectively to the best of our knowledge this constitutes the first report of 6 2 cl pfaes in precipitation 6 2 cl pfaes was previously detected in surface water and sediment from the fenghuajiang and pan rivers mean 19 3 ng l in china lin et al 2017 the 6 2 cl pfaes was also reported in atmospheric particulate matter from dalian city china at 100 700 pg m3 liu et al 2017 in contrast dona 8 2 ftsa and 8 2 cl pfaes were not detected dipaps were detected less frequently 20 and 25 for 6 2 dipap and 8 2 dipap respectively the concentrations of 6 2 ftsa 0 31 0 63 ng l and 6 2 cl pfaes 0 23 1 0 ng l were about 1 order of magnitude lower than those of pfcas and pfsas although cl pfaes appeared as major newly identified environmental contaminants in china their low volatility 0 0268 pa u s epa 2013 makes them less likely to partition into gas phase in the atmosphere in addition 6 2 cl pfaes tends to sorb strongly onto soil and sediment and may be highly resistant to degradation wang et al 2013b shi et al 2016 ruan et al 2015 levels of 6 2 dipap max 0 16 ng l and 8 2 dipap max 9 2 ng l were also considerably lower than those of pfcas in our previous study both 6 2 dipap 71 of samples and 8 2 dipap 59 of samples were widely detected in outdoor dust from urban areas across mainland china yao et al 2016a and atmospheric particulate matter yao et al 2017 their detection in both wet and dry deposition from urban areas in china indicated that dipaps are widespread in the urban atmosphere high soil water distribution coefficients 10000 times higher than that of pfos d eon et al 2009 and short half lives of dipaps 0 226 days for 8 2 dipap estimated by epi suite u s epa 2013 may be the confounding factors for their low detection frequencies and concentrations in precipitation until now limited information is available on the fate of these compounds in the atmosphere 3 2 spatial distribution of pfaas in precipitation relatively higher fluxes of pfass c4c12 were detected in precipitation in the northeastern area 2 0 102 3 4 103 ng m2 d than those in the southwestern area 63 1 7 103 ng m2 d in china fig 1 particularly high fluxes of pfass c4c12 from the north were detected in fuxin city fx 3 2 1 103 ng m2 d and in linqu county that was located 50 km downwind from zibo city wf lq 3 4 103 ng m2 d several major fluorochemical industrial parks are distributed locally including in fuxin zibo and jinan cities where extremely high pfas levels were previously reported in local environmental samples heydebreck et al 2015 shi et al 2015 chen et al 2018 barring the cases of fluorochemical industrial cities there was no significant difference in pfass fluxes between northeastern average 530 270 ng m2 d and southwestern average 530 450 ng m2 d sampling locations high pfas fluxes were also related to densely populated urban areas and or highly industrialized ones including chengdu cd sl 1 7 103 ng m2 d and zhengzhou zz 3 2 5 103 ng m2 d the pfas fluxes were about five times higher at site cd sl located about 10 km away from the shuangliu international airport as compared to those determined at site cd 3 4 102 ng m2 d at the same sampling date in the same city chengdu city commercial airports and military bases have been reported to be important sources of pfass to the environment ahrens et al 2015 wang et al 2016b which could be a reason for the observed difference between the two sites the production and usage of pfass in urban centers may also bear implications for contamination in remote areas including the tibetan plateau through atmospheric transport and dry wet deposition wang et al 2014c observed pfaas in dated snow cores accumulation period 1980 2007 dominated by pfos and pfoa and recent surface snowpack dominated by pfba in tibet china providing further evidence of the manufacturing shift toward shorter chain pfass it is also noteworthy that the spatial distribution of tfa pfpra fig 2 showed distinct trends compared to commonly monitored pfaas c4c12 fig 1 suggesting that tfa pfpra may have different sources the highest levels of tfa pfpra were generally found in coastal cities fig 2 such as shantou st 1 6 104 ng m2 d tianjin tj 6 9 103 ng m2 d and xiamen city xm 11 08 2016 9 103 ng m2 d rather than sites impacted by fluorochemical manufacture activities this trend is consistent with the spatial distribution of tfa in the united states kazil et al 2014 urbanization levels and number of private vehicles are higher in these coastal cities in china thus the emissions of refrigerants hcfcs hfcs and other related chemicals are assumed to be greater in this region upon release partitioning into the atmosphere refrigerants such as hfc 134a and hfo 1234yf can be readily oxidized by oh radicals burkholder et al 2015 more oh radicals and marine derived chlorine atom precursors are expected close to coastal regions under stronger solar radiation thornton et al 2010 tang et al 2015 therefore these refrigerants could be converted to tfa with greater efficiency under the large amounts of oh radicals and chlorine atoms present in such environments hfc 134a was reported to contribute 14 to the annual tfa deposition flux wu et al 2014 other potential tfa sources may exist in the atmosphere jordan and frank 1999 the enhanced tfa formation may also proceed from non pfas products pharmaceuticals pesticides or volatile precursors with carbon bound cf3 with industrial and or domestic origins solomon et al 2016 although not as high as in the surveyed coastal cities substantial tfa fluxes were observed in fuxin city fx 2 1 5 103 ng m2 d and linqu county wf lq 2 6 103 ng m2 d which are heavily influenced by fluoropolymers production this is also consistent with our earlier assessment of the surface environment at these sites where even higher levels of tfa were reported chen et al 2018 while tfa is manufactured and or used in manufacturing processes at these sites it may also proceed from environmental degradation of acknowledged pfas precursors ellis et al 2001 2004 3 3 correlations among pfass and possible sources of pfass in precipitation multivariate statistical analysis was used to discriminate trends among pfass fig s2 pfass of relatively low detection frequencies 64 were not discussed in this subsection the first component cluster explains 36 of the variability in the pca including pfhxa pfhpa and three long chain pfcas pfna pfda and pfuna statistically significant correlations were also observed among these pfcas spearman s r 0 341 0 747 p 0 05 table s9 possibly indicating a common source e g degradation of ftohs or uniform distribution behavior in precipitation the second component cluster explains 18 of the variability in pfass and grouped two ultra short chain pfcas tfa and pfpra fig s2 suggesting additional sources of tfa pfpra other than the degradation of fluoropolymers and or fluorotelomers in urban areas kazil et al 2014 wu et al 2014 although high fluxes of tfa were observed both for fluorochemical production sites fx 3 and wf lq and coastal city sites st and xm 11 08 2016 the sampling sites were grouped separately in the cluster analysis suggesting differences in source contribution tfa may essentially originate from its use in manufacture or the degradation of fluoropolymers at industrial sites while its primary source at other sampling sites may involve the degradation of novel fluorine containing refrigerants wang et al 2014b the third including pfba and pfoa and fourth including pfos components explained 16 and 11 of the variability respectively the underlying factor may be geographic differences in usage and production category in china pfba pfoa and fluorotelomer based pfass were mainly produced in eastern and northern china chen et al 2018 while pfos and pfos related electrochemical fluorination products ecf were mainly produced in eastern and southern china jin et al 2015 3 4 pfaa precursors estimated by top assay pfca concentrations increased significantly through top oxidation fig 3 table s10 note however that c2 and c3 homologues are not considered in this subsection due to incomplete recoveries pfcas c5c12 increased by a total molar concentration of 77 to 3 7 102 pm l with a median molar concentration increase of 1 3 102 pm l the molar concentrations of unknown precursors can be inferred from the top related pfca variation δpfca as follows based on the concentrations of targeted precursors in the unoxidized samples and their expected molar conversion rates to pfcas houtz and sedlak 2012 the pfca produced from each precursor can be calculated the contribution of unknown untargeted pre pfaas δunk pfca is subsequently obtained by subtracting the total theoretically transformed pfcas from targeted pre pfaas δt pfca to the overall observed δpfca the low concentrations of measured pre pfaas e g dipaps 6 2 ftsa in unoxidized samples implied that the top induced increase essentially resulted from oxidative conversion of untargeted and or unknown precursors and δunk pfca simplifies as δpfca when the molar concentrations of ultrashort chain pfcas c2c3 were not considered the molar fraction of total pfaa precursors ranged from 20 zhengzhou city to 89 taiyuan city of pfass concentrations fig 4 a the contribution of unknown pre pfaas was rather low in the fluorochemical manufacture areas fuxin city 32 weifang city 26 this may be explained by the remarkably high pfca concentrations c4c12 in the fluorochemical industrial areas in contrast in areas of lower pfas production such as in anshun city and nanning city unknown pre pfaas showed major contributions to composition profiles 65 and 73 respectively however volatile precursors such as ftohs were not included in the present survey due to their limited water solubility nevertheless the unknown precursors discussed here may have also encompassed these untargeted volatile precursors if they were ever dissolved in precipitation when taking into account tfa and pfpra these compounds contributed to a large proportion of pfas composition profiles 22 91 fig 4b the total contributions of ultrashort chain pfcas c2c3 and unknown untargeted pre pfaas accounted for more than 72 of the estimated pfass in precipitation except for the low fraction of 40 at zz 2 sharp increases in molar concentrations of pfhxa mean δpfhxa 67 40 pm l pfhpa mean δpfhpa 42 12 pm l and pfoa mean δpfoa 34 27 pm l were observed after top conversion fig 3 this represents a wide presence of c8 based and c6 based fluorotelomer based pre pfaas i e 6 2 and 8 2 in precipitation in contrast the increase in longer chain c 8 pfcas was less significant suggesting a minor presence of pre pfaas with longer fluoroalkylated chains c 8 a substantially high production of pfba mean δpfba 80 87 pm l was also observed after top conversion and the increase was significantly higher than that of pfpea in some precipitation samples p 0 01 this further suggested the presence of unmonitored short chain precursors in precipitation such as 4 2 fluorotelomers or c4 based perfluoroalkyl precursors as a possible candidate perfluorobutane sulfonamide fbsa has been recently identified in various fish species from canada chu et al 2016 and tap water from several countries kabore et al 2018 some c4 pre pfaas have been shown to degrade in the atmosphere and may contribute to the elevated concentrations of short chain pfcas in the environment martin et al 2006 d eon et al 2006 interestingly the top related increase in pfhpa molar concentration was higher than that of pfoa and the ratio of δ pfhpa δ pfoa was about 1 3 in 11 out of 26 samples this suggested that a majority of pfoa was generated from oxidative conversion of c8 based fluorotelomer precursors i e 8 2 derivatives for instance it was reported that the top conversion yield of pfhpa from 8 2 ftsa was approximately 27 mol but the yield was only about 21 mol for pfoa houtz and sedlak 2012 much higher δ pfhpa δ pfoa ratios in 10 26 samples in this study strongly indicated contributions of intermediates other than c8 based fluorotelomer precursors including pre pfaas of c7 perfluoroalkyl chains or more probably 6 2 fluorotelomers the concentration ranges of c6 based and c8 based precursors were estimated from the increases in c5c7 pfcas and c7c9 pfcas respectively based on a previously established estimation method houtz and sedlak 2012 estimated concentrations of c8 based pre pfaas ng l as pfoa range n d 1 6 102 ng l are higher than those of c6 based pre pfaas ng l as pfhxa range n d 94 ng l table s11 fig s3 c8 perfluoroalkane sulfonamide based precursors are quantitatively converted into pfoa while c8 based fluorotelomers generate a mixture of pfcas in which pfoa is typically 20 mol of the product yield for each fluoroalkylated chain present in the molecule houtz and sedlak 2012 for more than 81 of samples the upper estimate of c8 pfaa precursors is at least 5 times of δ pfoa table s11 providing additional evidence that a large proportion of unidentified c8 pre pfaas in precipitation samples from china were c8 based fluorotelomer precursors this corresponded to the wide production and usage of c8 based fluorotelomers in china in recent years which has been confirmed in our previous studies yao et al 2016b tian et al 2018 the estimated maximum fluxes of c6 and c8 pfaa precursors reached up to 3 1 103 and 4 3 103 ng m2 d respectively fig s4 due to the lack of information on short chain pfcas c2c3 concentrations in oxidized precipitation samples the flux estimation of c4 pfaa precursors was not applicable in this study however it can be inferred from the high increase in the pfba concentration after top conversion fig 3 table s10 that there may be a substantial amount of c4 pfaa precursors in the atmosphere as well which need further clarification after optimization for the method recovery of these ultrashort chain pfcas 3 5 precipitation scavenging of pfaas and pfaa precursors most environmental contaminants can be effectively scavenged from the atmosphere at the beginning of a rainfall event and the concentrations and fluxes of pfass may therefore show quite variable trends over the sampling period taniyasu et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 individual precipitation samples nc 02 06 2016 nc 15 06 2016 and nc 20 06 2016 were collected from different rain events no rain event occurred between two rain events on june 2 15 and 20 2016 respectively in nanchang city precipitation samples xm 11 08 2016 and xm 12 08 2016 were also collected in xiamen city high fluxes of pfaas and unknown pre pfaas were found in the first rain event and they decreased sharply by the second one fig 5 short chain pfcas and certain untargeted pre pfaas may have higher water solubility and be more effectively dissolved in cloud water droplets lei and wania 2004 scheurer et al 2017 thus they were effectively scavenged by wet deposition fig 5a and b alternatively some neutral pre pfaas may occur in particulate matter which can be captured through nucleation and impaction scavenging by growing cloud droplets in cloud scavenging or washed out by rain drops below cloud scavenging flossmann et al 1985 ligocki et al 1985 lei and wania 2004 on reaching the surface environment these pre pfaas may undergo subsequent water transport and the unknown ones may be transformed into pfaas in surface water or sediment which accounts for an additional portion of indirect sources of pfaas in the environment liu and mejia avendano 2013 harding marjanovic et al 2015 4 conclusions the occurrence of pfass in precipitation from urban areas of china was investigated tfa pfoa and pfos were the predominant compounds among 22 analyzed pfass relatively higher concentrations and fluxes of pfass c4c12 were detected in precipitation from northeastern areas with major fluorochemical industrial parks as compared to southwestern areas tfa was detected at generally higher concentrations than other pfass and displayed a unique trend with elevated levels occurring in coastal cities these results highlighted that tfa in the atmosphere may originate from multiple sources apart from commonly monitored c4c12 perfluoroalkyl acids and some selected target precursors the occurrence of unknown pre pfaas in precipitation was for the first time uncovered and their contributions were quantified at high levels using a top assay approach the fluxes of c6 based and c8 based unknown precursors were estimated to reach up to several thousand ng m2 d in china some of these pre pfaas may be soluble intermediates and can be further transformed to pfaas by biotic and or abiotic processes thus accounting for an additional source of pfaas hence the mass loads of pfass from precipitation to surface environment may have been underestimated to a larger extent ascribed to monitoring data solely on known pfaas further research efforts should be devoted to structure identification and possible quantification of these unknown pre pfaas in the atmosphere thus to comprehensively evaluate the contribution of non point sources to pfass in surface environments conflicts of interest the authors

19011,a nationwide survey was conducted on per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in precipitation across mainland china twenty two pfass including precursors to perfluoroalkyl acids pre pfaas were investigated in thirty nine precipitation samples collected from twenty eight cities trifluoroacetate tfa perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos were ubiquitous in precipitation tfa displayed the highest concentrations 8 8 1 8 103 ng l which were particularly elevated in coastal cities 6 2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid an alternative to pfos was detected for the first time in precipitation at a frequency of 43 polyfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid diesters and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid were also occasionally detected pfas fluxes in the northeastern area c4c12 2 0 102 3 4 103 ng m2 d with major pfas manufacturing facilities were higher than those in the southwestern area 63 1 7 103 ng m2 d using total oxidizable precursor top assay the occurrence of unknown pre pfaas was for the first time uncovered in precipitation with maximum estimated fluxes of c6 and c8 pre pfaas at 3 1 103 and 4 3 103 ng m2 d respectively the relative contribution of ultrashort chain pfcas c2c3 ranged from 22 to 91 of pfass while unknown pre pfaas accounted for 6 56 of the total molar concentrations of pfass this bears critical concerns on underestimation of pfas mass load from precipitation to surface environment ascribed to monitoring data solely on known pfass unknown precursors of pfaas in the atmosphere are yet to be identified for their chemical structures and relevant environmental risks as well graphical abstract image 1 keywords pfas alternatives unknown pfaa precursors pre pfaas trifluoroacetate tfa 6 2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether

late 1940s wang et al 2017 due to their wide usage and persistence pfass have been detected in numerous environmental matrices such as air precipitation dust surface river water and sediment kwok et al 2010 wang et al 2016a yao et al 2016a tian et al 2018 the bioaccumulation potential and adverse effects of long chain pfass wang et al 2013a including perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa c8 and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos c8 raised concerns and led to their gradual phase out since the early 21st century 3m company 2000 u s epa 2006 the production of pfos for instance has shifted from western europe and the united states to china wang et al 2014a additionally pfas manufacturers shifted their production to alternative products in replacement some of which are increasingly detected in the environment wang et al 2013a these pfas alternatives include short chain perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas c4c6 ether pfass and fluorotelomer pfass perfluorobutane sulfonic acid pfbs c4 and c4c6 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas were dominant in italian river basins their total contribution to pfas dwarfed pfos 61 vs 6 valsecchi et al 2015 in recent years pfass with c o c linkages including perfluoropolyethers pfpes have also raised concerns due to their widespread occurrence in the environment from europe and china heydebreck et al 2015 xiao 2017 as an alternative to pfos 6 2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid 6 2 cl pfaes has been widely used in electroplating industry in china since the 1970s wang et al 2013b 6 2 cl pfaes which is known under the trade name

al 2016a 2017 and may also degrade to pfcas lee et al 2013 besides these known pfas alternatives thousands of unknown pfass are being produced and used in consumer and industrial products wang et al 2017 due to analytical limitations only a small fraction of pfass may be currently identified and monitored ruan and jiang 2017 this may lead to the underestimation of pfas associated risks combustion ion chromatography cic revealed that commonly monitored pfcas and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas may represent an incomplete fraction of extractable organofluorine in sediment yeung et al 2013 and adsorbable organic fluorine in surface waters willach et al 2016 as a new method to integrate difficult to measure precursors houtz and sedlak 2012 the total oxidizable precursor top assay has been applied to afff impacted groundwater houtz et al 2013 urban river water ye et al 2014 and wwtp effluent samples houtz et al 2016 it was proposed that 23 63 of pfass in these matrices originated from unknown untargeted pfaa precursors pre pfaas this accounts for a significant indirect source of pfaas in the environment which might have long been overlooked precipitation is an important non point source of pfass to the surface environment xiao et al 2012 the concentrations and fluxes of pfass in precipitation can be strongly influenced by local sources taniyasu et al 2013 pfass can be released into the atmosphere during production usage and disposal via evaporation and suspended dust chen et al 2018 volatile precursors may undergo transformation into pfaas or other intermediates prior scavenging from the atmosphere by wet deposition lei and wania 2004 to the best of our knowledge the proportion of unidentified precursors and intermediates in precipitation remains uninvestigated and largely unknown relevant to this work unidentified pre pfaas were found in urban runoff samples and the concentrations of pfcas increased by a median of 69 after top conversion houtz and sedlak 2012 therefore estimating the total levels of pre pfaas including unknown untargeted precursors in precipitation and their contribution to pfass are of great importance to fill a research gap pfas alternatives including pfpes and dipaps have been produced and used at least for two decades however the occurrence and spatial distribution of these compounds in precipitation in china are yet to be investigated ultrashort chain trifluoroacetate tfa c2 has been reported with higher concentrations in the atmosphere precipitation surface river water soil and sediment than those of its longer chain pfca homologues li et al 2010 wang et al 2014b tian et al 2018 scheurer et al 2017 tfa can be produced from the thermolysis of fluoropolymers and degradation of fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs ellis et al 2001 2004 apart from degradation of pfas precursors tfa is also largely produced by photodegradation of hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfcs and hydrofluorocarbons hfcs kazil et al 2014 in addition tfa may originate from the degradation of non pfas products solomon et al 2016 tfa was reported at levels μg l in precipitation in china and the united states wang et al 2014b kazil et al 2014 this raises concerns because of its accumulation in terminal water bodies russell et al 2012 and recalcitrance to removal scheurer et al 2017 however few reports have studied the occurrence spatial distribution and sources of tfa together with other pfcas in precipitation in this study 39 precipitation samples were collected from 28 cities across mainland china and 22 pfass including novel pfaa alternatives and c2c3 pfcas were analyzed a top assay method was enlisted to estimate the concentrations and fluxes of unknown pre pfaas the objectives of this study were i to investigate the occurrence spatial distribution and fluxes of pfaas mainly pfcas and pfsas and infrequently monitored pfass including tfa pfpes and dipaps in precipitation at a nationwide scale in urban areas from mainland china and ii to estimate the contribution of total pre pfaas including potential unknown untargeted precursors to pfass using a top assay approach 2 materials and methods 2 1

heated for 6 h in a heated water bath at 85 c under such conditions hydroxyl radical is produced and readily converts pre pfaas to pfcas houtz and sedlak 2012 on completion of the reaction the samples

discussion 3 1 concentrations and fluxes of pfass in precipitation 3 1 1 pfaas the detailed concentrations and fluxes of pfass in individual precipitation samples are provided in tables s7 and s8 of the si tfa pfoa and pfos were systematically detected perfluoropropionic acid pfpra pfba pfhxa pfhpa pfna pfda and pfuna were also detected at frequencies of 85 or higher lower frequencies of detection were observed for pfpea 41 pfbs 56 and pfhxs 64 table s7 the total concentrations of pfcas c4c12 and pfsas c4 c6 c8 ranged from 4 8 ng l to 1 9 102 ng l pfcas were the predominant pfaas with mean concentrations generally higher than those of pfsas with the same carbon chain length which was consistent with other studies dreyer et al 2010 kwok et al 2010 zhao et al 2013 this may be due to the current higher production and usage of pfcas and their precursors than those of pfsas in china wang et al 2014a the mean concentration of pfoa in precipitation samples was 10 ng l median 3 4 ng l which was lower than those characterized in snow from dalian city northeastern china mean 25 ng l median 17 ng l liu et al 2009 and from northern china mean 34 ng l median 28 ng l shan et al 2015 but higher than those in precipitation samples from japan 1 94 ng l the united states 3 40 ng l southeastern china 0 32 ng l india 0 21 ng l and france 0 21 ng l kwok et al 2010 pfos concentrations in the present study mean 6 2 3 7 ng l were substantially higher than those in precipitation samples from northern germany 1 ng l dreyer et al 2010 japan 0 81 ng l the united states 0 27 ng l southeastern china 0 32 ng l india 0 04 ng l and france 0 11 ng l kwok et al 2010 but lower than those of snow from northern china in earlier studies liu et al 2009 shan et al 2015 high fluxes of pfoa and pfos were detected at 3 9 1 8 103 ng m2 d mean 1 6 102 ng m2 d and 10 5 1 102 ng m2 d mean 1 1 102 ng m2 d respectively high fluxes of pfba mean 99 130 ng m2 d were also detected which may reflect the current shift to short chain pfaas and or their precursors correspondingly high concentrations of pfba were also recently reported in surface water close to fluorochemical industrial parks china wang et al 2016a chen et al 2018 these results together demonstrated that the production and use of pfass in china are shifting toward the shorter chain alternatives with regard to ultrashort chain pfcas c2c3 tfa displayed generally higher concentrations than other targeted pfca homologues tfa concentrations range 8 8 1 8 103 ng l average 1 5 102 ng l and fluxes range 1 2 102 1 6 104 ng m2 d average 2 2 103 ng m2 d were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of other individual pfaas the observed dominance of tfa over other targeted pfass in precipitation was consistent with previous studies in north america and other regions worldwide scott et al 2006 kwok et al 2010 the concentrations of tfa and pfpra in this study are comparable to those from other studies in china and other countries scott et al 2006 kwok et al 2010 wang et al 2014b elevated tfa concentrations and fluxes have been reported in water bodies in recent years worldwide zhai et al 2015 scheurer et al 2017 it has been further noted that 95 of the annual mass flux of tfa originated from wet deposition berg et al 2000 therefore precipitation is acknowledged as the dominant source of ultrashort chain pfcas c2c3 to surface environment 3 1 2 fluorinated alternatives and dipaps in precipitation samples the detection frequencies of 6 2 ftsa and 6 2 cl pfaes were 41 and 43 respectively to the best of our knowledge this constitutes the first report of 6 2 cl pfaes in precipitation 6 2 cl pfaes was previously detected in surface water and sediment from the fenghuajiang and pan rivers mean 19 3 ng l in china lin et al 2017 the 6 2 cl pfaes was also reported in atmospheric particulate matter from dalian city china at 100 700 pg m3 liu et al 2017 in contrast dona 8 2 ftsa and 8 2 cl pfaes were not detected dipaps were detected less frequently 20 and 25 for 6 2 dipap and 8 2 dipap respectively the concentrations of 6 2 ftsa 0 31 0 63 ng l and 6 2 cl pfaes 0 23 1 0 ng l were about 1 order of magnitude lower than those of pfcas and pfsas although cl pfaes appeared as major newly identified environmental contaminants in china their low volatility 0 0268 pa u s epa 2013 makes them less likely to partition into gas phase in the atmosphere in addition 6 2 cl pfaes tends to sorb strongly onto soil and sediment and may be highly resistant to degradation wang et al 2013b shi et al 2016 ruan et al 2015 levels of 6 2 dipap max 0 16 ng l and 8 2 dipap max 9 2 ng l were also considerably lower than those of pfcas in our previous study both 6 2 dipap 71 of samples and 8 2 dipap 59 of samples were widely detected in outdoor dust from urban areas across mainland china yao et al 2016a and atmospheric particulate matter yao et al 2017 their detection in both wet and dry deposition from urban areas in china indicated that dipaps are widespread in the urban atmosphere high soil water distribution coefficients 10000 times higher than that of pfos d eon et al 2009 and short half lives of dipaps 0 226 days for 8 2 dipap estimated by epi suite u s epa 2013 may be the confounding factors for their low detection frequencies and concentrations in precipitation until now limited information is available on the fate of these compounds in the atmosphere 3 2 spatial distribution of pfaas in precipitation relatively higher fluxes of pfass c4c12 were detected in precipitation in the northeastern area 2 0 102 3 4 103 ng m2 d than those in the southwestern area 63 1 7 103 ng m2 d in china fig 1 particularly high fluxes of pfass c4c12 from the north were detected in fuxin city fx 3 2 1 103 ng m2 d and in linqu county that was located 50 km downwind from zibo city wf lq 3 4 103 ng m2 d several major fluorochemical industrial parks are distributed locally including in fuxin zibo and jinan cities where extremely high pfas levels were previously reported in local environmental samples heydebreck et al 2015 shi et al 2015 chen et al 2018 barring the cases of fluorochemical industrial cities there was no significant difference in pfass fluxes between northeastern average 530 270 ng m2 d and southwestern average 530 450 ng m2 d sampling locations high pfas fluxes were also related to densely populated urban areas and or highly industrialized ones including chengdu cd sl 1 7 103 ng m2 d and zhengzhou zz 3 2 5 103 ng m2 d the pfas fluxes were about five times higher at site cd sl located about 10 km away from the shuangliu international airport as compared to those determined at site cd 3 4 102 ng m2 d at the same sampling date in the same city chengdu city commercial airports and military bases have been reported to be important sources of pfass to the environment ahrens et al 2015 wang et al 2016b which could be a reason for the observed difference between the two sites the production and usage of pfass in urban centers may also bear implications for contamination in remote areas including the tibetan plateau through atmospheric transport and dry wet deposition wang et al 2014c observed pfaas in dated snow cores accumulation period 1980 2007 dominated by pfos and pfoa and recent surface snowpack dominated by pfba in tibet china providing further evidence of the manufacturing shift toward shorter chain pfass it is also noteworthy that the spatial distribution of tfa pfpra fig 2 showed distinct trends compared to commonly monitored pfaas c4c12 fig 1 suggesting that tfa pfpra may have different sources the highest levels of tfa pfpra were generally found in coastal cities fig 2 such as shantou st 1 6 104 ng m2 d tianjin tj 6 9 103 ng m2 d and xiamen city xm 11 08 2016 9 103 ng m2 d rather than sites impacted by fluorochemical manufacture activities this trend is consistent with the spatial distribution of tfa in the united states kazil et al 2014 urbanization levels and number of private vehicles are higher in these coastal cities in china thus the emissions of refrigerants hcfcs hfcs and other related chemicals are assumed to be greater in this region upon release partitioning into the atmosphere refrigerants such as hfc 134a and hfo 1234yf can be readily oxidized by oh radicals burkholder et al 2015 more oh radicals and marine derived chlorine atom precursors are expected close to coastal regions under stronger solar radiation thornton et al 2010 tang et al 2015 therefore these refrigerants could be converted to tfa with greater efficiency under the large amounts of oh radicals and chlorine atoms present in such environments hfc 134a was reported to contribute 14 to the annual tfa deposition flux wu et al 2014 other potential tfa sources may exist in the atmosphere jordan and frank 1999 the enhanced tfa formation may also proceed from non pfas products pharmaceuticals pesticides or volatile precursors with carbon bound cf3 with industrial and or domestic origins solomon et al 2016 although not as high as in the surveyed coastal cities substantial tfa fluxes were observed in fuxin city fx 2 1 5 103 ng m2 d and linqu county wf lq 2 6 103 ng m2 d which are heavily influenced by fluoropolymers production this is also consistent with our earlier assessment of the surface environment at these sites where even higher levels of tfa were reported chen et al 2018 while tfa is manufactured and or used in manufacturing processes at these sites it may also proceed from environmental degradation of acknowledged pfas precursors ellis et al 2001 2004 3 3 correlations among pfass and possible sources of pfass in precipitation multivariate statistical analysis was used to discriminate trends among pfass fig s2 pfass of relatively low detection frequencies 64 were not discussed in this subsection the first component cluster explains 36 of the variability in the pca including pfhxa pfhpa and three long chain pfcas pfna pfda and pfuna statistically significant correlations were also observed among these pfcas spearman s r 0 341 0 747 p 0 05 table s9 possibly indicating a common source e g degradation of ftohs or uniform distribution behavior in precipitation the second component cluster explains 18 of the variability in pfass and grouped two ultra short chain pfcas tfa and pfpra fig s2 suggesting additional sources of tfa pfpra other than the degradation of fluoropolymers and or fluorotelomers in urban areas kazil et al 2014 wu et al 2014 although high fluxes of tfa were observed both for fluorochemical production sites fx 3 and wf lq and coastal city sites st and xm 11 08 2016 the sampling sites were grouped separately in the cluster analysis suggesting differences in source contribution tfa may essentially originate from its use in manufacture or the degradation of fluoropolymers at industrial sites while its primary source at other sampling sites may involve the degradation of novel fluorine containing refrigerants wang et al 2014b the third including pfba and pfoa and fourth including pfos components explained 16 and 11 of the variability respectively the underlying factor may be geographic differences in usage and production category in china pfba pfoa and fluorotelomer based pfass were mainly produced in eastern and northern china chen et al 2018 while pfos and pfos related electrochemical fluorination products ecf were mainly produced in eastern and southern china jin et al 2015 3 4 pfaa precursors estimated by top assay pfca concentrations increased significantly through top oxidation fig 3 table s10 note however that c2 and c3 homologues are not considered in this subsection due to incomplete recoveries pfcas c5c12 increased by a total molar concentration of 77 to 3 7 102 pm l with a median molar concentration increase of 1 3 102 pm l the molar concentrations of unknown precursors can be inferred from the top related pfca variation δpfca as follows based on the concentrations of targeted precursors in the unoxidized samples and their expected molar conversion rates to pfcas houtz and sedlak 2012 the pfca produced from each precursor can be calculated the contribution of unknown untargeted pre pfaas δunk pfca is subsequently obtained by subtracting the total theoretically transformed pfcas from targeted pre pfaas δt pfca to the overall observed δpfca the low concentrations of measured pre pfaas e g dipaps 6 2 ftsa in unoxidized samples implied that the top induced increase essentially resulted from oxidative conversion of untargeted and or unknown precursors and δunk pfca simplifies as δpfca when the molar concentrations of ultrashort chain pfcas c2c3 were not considered the molar fraction of total pfaa precursors ranged from 20 zhengzhou city to 89 taiyuan city of pfass concentrations fig 4 a the contribution of unknown pre pfaas was rather low in the fluorochemical manufacture areas fuxin city 32 weifang city 26 this may be explained by the remarkably high pfca concentrations c4c12 in the fluorochemical industrial areas in contrast in areas of lower pfas production such as in anshun city and nanning city unknown pre pfaas showed major contributions to composition profiles 65 and 73 respectively however volatile precursors such as ftohs were not included in the present survey due to their limited water solubility nevertheless the unknown precursors discussed here may have also encompassed these untargeted volatile precursors if they were ever dissolved in precipitation when taking into account tfa and pfpra these compounds contributed to a large proportion of pfas composition profiles 22 91 fig 4b the total contributions of ultrashort chain pfcas c2c3 and unknown untargeted pre pfaas accounted for more than 72 of the estimated pfass in precipitation except for the low fraction of 40 at zz 2 sharp increases in molar concentrations of pfhxa mean δpfhxa 67 40 pm l pfhpa mean δpfhpa 42 12 pm l and pfoa mean δpfoa 34 27 pm l were observed after top conversion fig 3 this represents a wide presence of c8 based and c6 based fluorotelomer based pre pfaas i e 6 2 and 8 2 in precipitation in contrast the increase in longer chain c 8 pfcas was less significant suggesting a minor presence of pre pfaas with longer fluoroalkylated chains c 8 a substantially high production of pfba mean δpfba 80 87 pm l was also observed after top conversion and the increase was significantly higher than that of pfpea in some precipitation samples p 0 01 this further suggested the presence of unmonitored short chain precursors in precipitation such as 4 2 fluorotelomers or c4 based perfluoroalkyl precursors as a possible candidate perfluorobutane sulfonamide fbsa has been recently identified in various fish species from canada chu et al 2016 and tap water from several countries kabore et al 2018 some c4 pre pfaas have been shown to degrade in the atmosphere and may contribute to the elevated concentrations of short chain pfcas in the environment martin et al 2006 d eon et al 2006 interestingly the top related increase in pfhpa molar concentration was higher than that of pfoa and the ratio of δ pfhpa δ pfoa was about 1 3 in 11 out of 26 samples this suggested that a majority of pfoa was generated from oxidative conversion of c8 based fluorotelomer precursors i e 8 2 derivatives for instance it was reported that the top conversion yield of pfhpa from 8 2 ftsa was approximately 27 mol but the yield was only about 21 mol for pfoa houtz and sedlak 2012 much higher δ pfhpa δ pfoa ratios in 10 26 samples in this study strongly indicated contributions of intermediates other than c8 based fluorotelomer precursors including pre pfaas of c7 perfluoroalkyl chains or more probably 6 2 fluorotelomers the concentration ranges of c6 based and c8 based precursors were estimated from the increases in c5c7 pfcas and c7c9 pfcas respectively based on a previously established estimation method houtz and sedlak 2012 estimated concentrations of c8 based pre pfaas ng l as pfoa range n d 1 6 102 ng l are higher than those of c6 based pre pfaas ng l as pfhxa range n d 94 ng l table s11 fig s3 c8 perfluoroalkane sulfonamide based precursors are quantitatively converted into pfoa while c8 based fluorotelomers generate a mixture of pfcas in which pfoa is typically 20 mol of the product yield for each fluoroalkylated chain present in the molecule houtz and sedlak 2012 for more than 81 of samples the upper estimate of c8 pfaa precursors is at least 5 times of δ pfoa table s11 providing additional evidence that a large proportion of unidentified c8 pre pfaas in precipitation samples from china were c8 based fluorotelomer precursors this corresponded to the wide production and usage of c8 based fluorotelomers in china in recent years which has been confirmed in our previous studies yao et al 2016b tian et al 2018 the estimated maximum fluxes of c6 and c8 pfaa precursors reached up to 3 1 103 and 4 3 103 ng m2 d respectively fig s4 due to the lack of information on short chain pfcas c2c3 concentrations in oxidized precipitation samples the flux estimation of c4 pfaa precursors was not applicable in this study however it can be inferred from the high increase in the pfba concentration after top conversion fig 3 table s10 that there may be a substantial amount of c4 pfaa precursors in the atmosphere as well which need further clarification after optimization for the method recovery of these ultrashort chain pfcas 3 5 precipitation scavenging of pfaas and pfaa precursors most environmental contaminants can be effectively scavenged from the atmosphere at the beginning of a rainfall event and the concentrations and fluxes of pfass may therefore show quite variable trends over the sampling period taniyasu et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 individual precipitation samples nc 02 06 2016 nc 15 06 2016 and nc 20 06 2016 were collected from different rain events no rain event occurred between two rain events on june 2 15 and 20 2016 respectively in nanchang city precipitation samples xm 11 08 2016 and xm 12 08 2016 were also collected in xiamen city high fluxes of pfaas and unknown pre pfaas were found in the first rain event and they decreased sharply by the second one fig 5 short chain pfcas and certain untargeted pre pfaas may have higher water solubility and be more effectively dissolved in cloud water droplets lei and wania 2004 scheurer et al 2017 thus they were effectively scavenged by wet deposition fig 5a and b alternatively some neutral pre pfaas may occur in particulate matter which can be captured through nucleation and impaction scavenging by growing cloud droplets in cloud scavenging or washed out by rain drops below cloud scavenging flossmann et al 1985 ligocki et al 1985 lei and wania 2004 on reaching the surface environment these pre pfaas may undergo subsequent water transport and the unknown ones may be transformed into pfaas in surface water or sediment which accounts for an additional portion of indirect sources of pfaas in the environment liu and mejia avendano 2013 harding marjanovic et al 2015 4 conclusions the occurrence of pfass in precipitation from urban areas of china was investigated tfa pfoa and pfos were the predominant compounds among 22 analyzed pfass relatively higher concentrations and fluxes of pfass c4c12 were detected in precipitation from northeastern areas with major fluorochemical industrial parks as compared to southwestern areas tfa was detected at generally higher concentrations than other pfass and displayed a unique trend with elevated levels occurring in coastal cities these results highlighted that tfa in the atmosphere may originate from multiple sources apart from commonly monitored c4c12 perfluoroalkyl acids and some selected target precursors the occurrence of unknown pre pfaas in precipitation was for the first time uncovered and their contributions were quantified at high levels using a top assay approach the fluxes of c6 based and c8 based unknown precursors were estimated to reach up to several thousand ng m2 d in china some of these pre pfaas may be soluble intermediates and can be further transformed to pfaas by biotic and or abiotic processes thus accounting for an additional source of pfaas hence the mass loads of pfass from precipitation to surface environment may have been underestimated to a larger extent ascribed to monitoring data solely on known pfaas further research efforts should be devoted to structure identification and possible quantification of these unknown pre pfaas in the atmosphere thus to comprehensively evaluate the contribution of non point sources to pfass in surface environments conflicts of interest the authors

19012,benzophenones bps which are widely used uv filters have aroused considerable public concern owing to their potential endocrine disrupting activities herein we systematically investigated their photochemical behavior and fate which is mediated by nitrate in aquatic environments the results showed that 10 μm of 3 bps can be completely degraded within 4 h of simulated sunlight irradiation in a 10 mm nitrate solution at ph 8 0 and 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone bp 1 has a 31 6 mineralization rate after 12 h irradiation their photolytic rates k obs presented a significant linear correlation with the logarithmic values of the nitrate concentration for 0 1 10 mm r 2 0 98 and in three actual waters the rates of bp 1 were also positively related to the intrinsic nitrate concentration furthermore higher transformation rates under alkaline condition were observed especially for bp 1 with its k obs at ph 10 being 8 3 fold higher than that at ph 6 0 moreover dissolved oxygen do also has an impact on the reaction kinetics to some degree according to the quenching experiments we found that three reactive oxygen species ros namely oh no and no2 participated in this photolysis of bps and the contribution of oh accounted for 32 1 furthermore we selected bp 1 as the model molecule to study the transformation pathways and toxicity changes in this system four main transformation pathways including hydroxylation nitrosylation nitration and dimerization were proposed based on liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry lc q tof ms analysis and density functional theory dft according to the toxicity test the formed intermediates were more toxic to photobacterium phosphoreum than the parent bp 1 therefore these results can help reveal primary phototransformation mechanisms and evaluate the potential ecological risks of bps in aquatic environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords benzophenones phototransformation nitrate kinetics product identification 1 introduction benzophenones bps are a class of synthetic substances that have been widely used as sunscreen agents in pharmaceutical personal care products ppcps giokas et al 2007 grabicova et al 2013 rodil and moeder 2008 and as uv stabilizers in plastic packaging díaz cruz and barceló 2009 vione et al 2013 these substances can enter the aquatic environment directly via wash off from skin during bathing or swimming díaz cruz and barceló 2009 or can be indirectly discharged from wastewater treatment plants as a result of their incomplete elimination balmer et al 2005 giokas et al 2007 santos et al 2012 the occurrence of bps and their potentially toxic metabolites has become an emerging environmental concern several studies have reported that bps are frequently detected in various aqueous environments for example the concentration of 2 hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone bp 3 ranges from 97 to 722 ng l in a wastewater reclamation plant wwrp in tianjin china li et al 2007 and higher concentrations of bp 3 and 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone bp 1 3300 ng l and 280 ng l respectively have also been detected in spanish coastal seawater tarazona et al 2010 additionally bps have also been detected in the drinking waters of southern california ranging from 0 36 to 0 79 μg l loraine and pettigrove 2006 more seriously owing to the exposure of humans to bps being prevalent such as through ingestion of the packaging from food suzuki et al 2005 and absorbed through the skin from cosmetics jeon et al 2008 jiang et al 1999 several bps have been detected in human urine calafat et al 2008 jiang et al 1999 blood zhang et al 2013 and breast milk kim and choi 2014 samples it is noteworthy that some of these metabolic products are more toxic to aquatic organisms bp 1 which is a major metabolite of bp 3 kunisue et al 2012 wang and kannan 2013 exhibits estrogenic activity or anti androgenic activity in vitro coronado et al 2008 kunz et al 2006 morohoshi et al 2005 and has a longer biological half life than its parent compound kim and choi 2014 as a result some attention has been paid in the last years to effective degradation approaches of bps in aquatic environments for example sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops liu et al 2016 pan et al 2017 chlorination manasfi et al 2015 santos et al 2012 lu et al 2018 ozonation gago ferrero et al 2013 wang et al 2018a and photodegradation gago ferrero et al 2012 gong et al 2015 li et al 2016 however the phototransformation fates of bps may be affected by natural environmental factors in particular nitrate is a widely occurring inorganic salt and it is known to induce the transformation of many organic pollutants to form similar metabolites many results indicate that the photolysis of aqueous no3 could induce the oxidation reaction of organic chemicals by generating several reactive species ros including oh no no2 and o2 under sunlight irradiation brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 carena and vione 2016 goldstein and rabani 2007 mack and bolton 1999 previous studies have investigated the role of nitrate on the indirect photochemical behavior of several ppcps in aquatic environments such as thiamphenicol ge et al 2009 enrofloxacin li et al 2011 atenolol ji et al 2012 tetracycline niu et al 2013 bp 3 vione et al 2014 and bisphenol a bpa kang et al 2018 more interestingly perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa can be completely mineralized in aqueous solutions containing 100 mm nitrate with uv irradiation li et al 2017 however the mechanism of the nitrate induced phototransformation of bps in real aqueous systems remains unclear particularly the formation of intermediate products which may be more toxic than the parental compound hence the transformation pathways of bps and their potential products induced by nitrate photolysis in natural environments has aroused great interest in the current study the phototransformation mechanism of bps during the nitrate induced process was investigated and the formation of intermediate products was confirmed via density functional theory dft and liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry lc q tof ms subsequently the effects of water matrices including nitrate concentration solution ph do and different water bodies on bp degradation were evaluated the reaction mechanisms were explored through ros quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy products identification and theoretical computations the findings in this study can help in the

suspended particles a 1 ml aliquot of the reaction solution was sampled at different irradiation times 0 10 30 60 90 120 180 and 240 min and then subjected to hplc to determine the concentrations of target bps 2 3 analytical methods hplc analysis an agilent 1260 infinity ii high performance liquid chromatograph hplc equipped with a photodiode array and an agilent c18 reversed phase column 5 μm 4

mode a mass to charge ratio from 60 to 700 was selected to record the mass spectra the detailed parameter settings of the ms instrument were optimized and are shown in the supporting epr analysis electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy was employed to detect the generation of ros including oh and o2 from the nitrate solution under xenon light irradiation and we used 5 5 dimethylpyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping agent experimental conditions 1 for the determination of oh 1 ml reaction solution containing 0 1 m dmpo and 1 m no3 was irradiated under xe light for 25 min at ph 2 ph 8 and ph 12 2 for the determination of o2 0 1 m dmpo and 0 1 m no3 were prepared in a 1 ml mixture solution containing 80 20 v v dimethylsulfoxide dmso and water at ph 2 ph 8 and ph 12 after 25 min irradiation the epr spectra were recorded by a bruker emx 10 12 spectrometer bruker bremen germany with magnetic field strengths of 1 48 t magnetic moment 72 mm and 1 90 t magnetic moment 50 mm and a scanning frequency of 9 773 ghz 2 4 molecular parameters and computational method the optimal molecular configuration and the frontier electron densities feds of bp 1 and the intermediate products were calculated and analyzed at the b3lyp 6 311g level using gaussian 09w software additionally the potential active site for the chemical reaction was determined by calculating the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital e homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital e lumo to further confirm the reasonability of the proposed pathways 2 5 toxicity tests of photobacterium phosphoreum photobacterium phosphoreum t 3 spp was used as the test organism for assessing the bio toxicity of reaction solution the freeze dried powder was provided by the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences nanjing china the detailed experimental procedure was conducted according to the national standard water quality determination of the acute toxicity luminescent bacteria test gb t 15441 1995 the bioluminescence was measured on a tecan infinite 200 pro multimode microplate reader tecan switzerland the toxicity data were recorded as the inhibition percentage versus the control 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics 3 1 1 effect of nitrate on the photolysis of bps the phototransformation experiments of bps were conducted in 40 ml aqueous solutions containing 10 μm substrates with different nitrate concentrations ranging from 0 1 mm to 10 mm under xe light irradiation for 4 h fig 1 a shows that an enhanced degradation of bps was apparently observed with the addition of nitrate compared to that without nitrate after 4 h of irradiation approximately 99 7 100 and 95 6 of the three bps were removed at a nitrate concentration of 10 mm the conversion rates increased with the increasing nitrate concentration and all these reaction rates appeared to follow pseudo first order kinetics among the reactions the k obs values were linearly fitted to the logarithmic values of the nitrate concentration log no3 as shown in fig s2 r 2 0 98 this indicated that nitrate could play a critical role in influencing the reaction of bp removal under xe light irradiation 3 1 2 effect of ph on the photolysis of bps the effect of ph on the removal of the three types of bps 2 hbp bp 1 and bp 3 was also investigated as shown in fig 1b and the results showed that the reaction rates of the bps in alkaline solutions ph 10 were clearly higher than those in acidic solutions ph 4 particularly for bp 1 slightly increasing k obs values with an increase in the solution ph were observed in the ph range of 4 0 7 0 however under alkaline conditions from ph 7 0 to 10 0 the values of k obs rapidly increased from 0 0117 s 1 to 0 0348 s 1 which were 2 8 and 8 3 fold higher than the value at ph 6 0 fig 1b the higher k obs values at ph 7 0 may be explained by considering the deprotonation of bp 1 in alkaline solutions ph pk a 7 72 the deprotonated bp 1 would react faster than the molecular form due to the higher electronic density surroundings chen et al 2013 this can also be confirmed by the theoretical calculations where the energy gap between e homo and e lumo e homo lumo for the deprotonation of bp 1 0 1170 a u was lower than that of protonation 0 1629 a u however from ph 4 0 to 6 0 the k obs of all the bps showed a negligible change and this is because the free radicals were at a steady level previous studies have reported that oh quantum yields φ oh for the photolysis of no3 are independent of ph between ph 4 and 9 zellner et al 1990 and that no statistically significant trend is observed over the entire ph range from 4 to 6 for no2 scharko et al 2014 furthermore we only detected a weak hydroxyl radical signal under acidic conditions ph 2 in a 1 m nano3 solution as illustrated in fig s3a because in this case the relatively high φ oh was 10 20 fold of that under neutral conditions ph 4 to 9 mack and bolton 1999 moreover the degradation rates of other derivatives of bps bp 3 and 2 hbp were observed to be slower than that of bp 1 at the different ph levels this indicates that different bps may differ in molecular stability because of their different structures under the ph 4 condition the three bps mainly existed in the form of molecular states and they had similar e homo values of 0 2356 0 2293 and 0 2351 for bp 1 bp 3 and 2 hbp respectively resulting in their more similar conversion efficiencies however when the ph increased to 8 and 10 the degradation rate of bp 1 exhibited an apparent change from the rates of 2 hbp and bp 3 this is because bp 1 was substantially easier to convert into its deprotonated form bp 1 as the pk a values of 2 hbp bp 1 and bp 3 are 9 30 shiung et al 2018 7 72 yin et al 2013 and 9 57 yang et al 2016 respectively even under the ph 10 condition as shown in fig 1b the reaction rate constant of bp 1 was still higher than that of bp 3 and 2 hbp and in this way bp 1 lost two protons and turned into bp 1 2 the e homo lumo of bp 1 2 0 07253 remained less than that of 2 hbp 0 10808 and bp 3 0 11696 3 1 3 effect of dissolved oxygen on the photolysis of bps dissolved oxygen do is an important factor that affects the photoreaction of organic substances in aquatic environments lee et al 2005 shirayama et al 2001 to explore the role of do on the photolysis of bps n2 and o2 were purged to the nitrate reaction system to regulate the do level the do contents were measured as 0 26 0 03 5 36 0 20 and 12 32 0 80 mg l in n2 purging control and o2 purging solutions respectively as shown in fig 1c the bp 1 removal rate in the oxygen saturated system was higher than that in the control system and a decrease in the removal of bp 1 was observed in the oxygen depleted system this indicated that do may be involved in the nitrate induced transformation of bp 1 it has been reported that do can affect the formation of no2 shankar et al 2007 such as in eq 1and eq 2 therefore do undoubtedly increases the electron transport chain and can then improve the level of free radicals in the solution 1 no 2 h υ no 2 e a q φ 355 nm 0 076 2 e a q o 2 o 2 k 9 1 9 10 10 m 1 s 1 3 2 exploration of the reaction mechanism 3 2 1 identification of intermediate products in this work we selected bp 1 as a representative compound and systematically investigated its intermediate products via lc q tof ms analysis which can be used to show the reaction mechanisms involving ros the total ion currents tics and extracted ion chromatograms eics of bp 1 and its reaction products after different irradiation times are shown in fig 2 reviewing the tics it can be seen that the parent compound bp 1 m h m z 213 0550 was eluted at 13 6 min and other peaks were also observed at different retention times according to the discussions related to the photolysis mechanism of nitrate ros oh no no2 and o2 should be the major oxidizing agents responsible for the removal of bp 1 thus bp 1 is likely to be substituted by the oh no and no2 functional groups at an early stage as shown in the inset of fig 2 the eics of these intermediate products were indeed obtained in the tics at different reaction times the appearance of two peaks with m z 229 05 indicated the formation of two hydroxylated bp 1 isomers p1 at retention times from 12 1 to 13 0 min and the peaks at m z 242 05 and 258 04 were assigned as the nitrosylation product p2 and nitration product p3 respectively with retention times of 12 2 min and 13 4 min in addition there were four new peaks of p4 with a m z of 425 1025 appearing at 14 8 15 2 15 8 and 16 8 min which were identified to be dimers through the analysis of the product ion spectra in addition the eics fragment ion spectra and proposed fragmentation pathways of all products are presented in table s1 and fig s4 3 2 2 role of ros in the photolysis of bps to evaluate which ros were predominant during the phototransformation of bp 1 we investigated the effect of various scavengers tba ipa pbq ffa and sod on the photolysis of bp 1 according to previous reports isopropanol alcohol ipa was chosen as the oh scavenger for the nitrate photolysis system goldstein and rabani 2007 as seen from fig 3 a both the addition of ipa and tba clearly reduced the reaction rates of bp 1 however ipa was more effective than tba corresponding to their different reaction rates with the oh radical k ipa 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 k tba 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 moreover in a fenton reaction system bp 1 can be rapidly degraded with different fenton reagent dosages as shown in fig s5 thus we can preliminarily speculate that oh should participate in decomposing bps the superoxide radical o2 is another ros produced during the photolysis of nitrate and the epr spectral signal of dmpo o2 adducts can prove the species did exist in this system as shown in fig s3b therefore in this work we selected superoxide dismutase sod to evaluate the role of o2 in removing bp 1 as illustrated in fig 3b two concentrations of sod 400 and 4000 u l 1 were chosen to investigate the role of superoxide radicals in the nitrate photolysis system it has been suggested that o2 inefficiently effects the transformation of bp 1 and instead other reactive species may contribute to the enhanced removal of bp 1 according to scheme 1 the accompanying generations of o2 and no were observed under this condition in the presence of sod o2 can be eliminated and the generation of no is increased due to the chemical equilibrium therefore the enhanced degradation rate of bp 1 with the addition of sod could be attributed to the increasing no radical concentration which suggested that no is also involved in the degradation of bps furthermore both pbq and ffa tremendously inhibited the removal of bp 1 depending on their dosages in this case their shadowing effects are negligible as shown in fig s6 previous studies have shown that pbq can primarily scavenge o2 an et al 2014 wang et al 2018b which is inconsistent with the aforementioned results of sod thus we had to divert our attention to other ros in the system such as no and no2 which may be quenched by pbq and ffa therefore we can speculate that the reactive nitrogen species rns no and no2 should participate in the transformation of bps to further ascertain the transformation mechanisms of the bps driven by these reactive species we monitored the yields of four early intermediate products with the addition of various scavengers as shown in fig 4 and 5 the lc ms intensities of p1 hydroxylation p2 nitrosylation p3 nitration and p4 dimerization were obtained from eic using hplc tof ms ms with the addition of ipa to the bp 1 nitrate system the yield of p1 was almost completely suppressed as shown in fig 4a however a negligible change was observed for the formation of p2 which indicated that the formation of the n nitroso bp 1 was independent of oh however for p3 and p4 the peak areas were reduced in the presence of ipa suggesting that oh radicals had a positive effect on the formation of nitrated and dimer products one possibility for the decrease in nitration and dimer products is that oh radicals first reacted with bp 1 to form the organic free radical of bp 1 bp 1 eq 3 which was followed by the reaction with other radicals such as no2 and bp 1 to generate p3 nitrated products no2 bp 1 eq 4 and p4 dimers bp 1 2 eq 5 3 oh bp 1 bp 1 oh 4 no2 bp 1 no2 bp 1 5 bp 1 bp 1 bp 1 2 dimer another possible explanation is that formed no2 was firstly reacted with oh and convert to no2 under this conditions eq 6 goldstein and rabani 2007 shankar et al 2007 then no2 can directly react with bp 1 to form no2 bp 1 eq 7 or bp 1 eq 8 6 oh no2 no2 oh k 10 1 0 1010 m 1s 1 7 no2 bp 1 no2 bp 1 8 no2 bp 1 bp 1 no2 h nevertheless when pbq was introduced to the reaction all transformation pathways were completely inhibited except for hydroxylation in the presence of pbq we regarded that oh was the only active species in solution however from fig 4d the formation of dimers was also completely suppressed indicating that oh was not the reactive species firsthand to converting bp 1 into bp 1 but no2 therefore the reduced yields of p3 and p4 was due to part of no2 converted by oh was cut off in the presence of ipa but the negligible change of p2 indicated that oh not participating in the formation of no furthermore ffa exhibited a multi effect on the transformation of bp 1 and all these products were suppressed finally it is also worth noting that the time to peak of these early intermediates were further delayed and this suggests that the following evolution profiles of these species would be limited in the absence of oh moreover the contribution rate of oh radicals to the photolysis of bps was further investigated first we obtained the second order reaction rate constants for bp 1 with oh in a photo fenton system k bp 1 4 16 109 m 1 s 1 the detailed information were shown in supporting information text s2 in the no3 solution 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid htpa was usually used to calculate φ oh charbouillot et al 2011 tafer et al 2016 because it is a primary product of the reaction of tpa and oh additionally the hydroxylation yield of tpa into htpa defined as yhtpa is usually 35 chen et al 2018 page et al 2010 and here the steady state concentration of oh oh ss can be calculated based on eqs 9 11 9 r d h t p a d t k t p a t p a o h s s y h t p a 10 l i m t 0 d h t p a d t l i m t 0 k t p a t p a o h s s y h t p a 11 k 0 h t p a k t p a t p a 0 o h s s y h t p a where k 0 h t p a is the initial formation rate of htpa as shown fig s7 and k 0 h t p a 3 89 0 03 10 2 μm min 1 furthermore k tpa is the second order kinetics constant of the tpa reaction with oh and it is usually 4 4 109 m 1s 1 charbouillot et al 2011 when tpa 0 is the initial concentration of tpa then the oh ss of this system can be obtained as 4 21 10 14 m according to fig 1b the degradation rate constant k obs of bp 1 at ph 8 was calculated as 3 27 10 2 min 1 herein the quasi first order rate constant of bp 1 induced by oh in the nitrate photolysis system is defined as γ o h which could be calculated via eq 12 12 γ o h k b p 1 o h s s n i t r a t e 1 05 10 2 m i n 1 therefore the contribution of oh in the photolysis of bp 1 accounted for 32 1 of the conversion in the nitrate system 13 γ o h γ o h k o b s 32 1 3 2 3 gaussian calculation and elucidation of possible pathways recently density functional theory dft has increasingly been used to show the conversion behavior of contaminants during environmental treatment processes dang et al 2015 qu et al 2016 xiao et al 2014 electrophilic addition reactions of hydroxyl radicals usually occur at positions with higher fed 2 homo lumo luo et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 as shown in fig s8 and table s3 c11 was determined to be the most prioritized location for hydroxylation coincidentally two fragment ions m z 109 0296 and 135 0083 in ms ms spectrum of p1 fig s4 verified this result then c3 was determined to be the second prioritized location therefore yielding two isomers p1 in pathway i afterwards p1 was rapidly converted into p5 and will undergo further oxidation to form p6 which is a ring opening product finally these intermediates gradually disappeared as shown in fig s9 therefore this is a path that can mineralize bp 1 and the total organic carbon toc of the solution data exactly matched this result fig s10 in pathway ii and pathway iii no and no2 as electrophiles can readily attack locations with a high electron density such as c1 c3 and o16 because of their higher 2fed homo2 the fragment ions at m z 120 0090 for p2 and m z 179 9932 for p3 proved that its reaction does occur in the right benzene ring in pathway iv bp 1 was converted into three phenoxy free radicals r1 r3 by no2 which can undergo coupling reactions at different positions via cc or c o c bonds and then on to form four dimers after this initial reaction these dimers were the substituted products p7 p8 and p9 via the attack of oh no and no2 for these products as seen from fig s9 their peak areas p2 p3 p4 p7 p8 and p9 gradually increased within 1 2 h and then they decreased over the irradiation time which indicated that these intermediates are not part of a continuous cumulative process in actual aqueous environments as long as is sufficient irradiation time 3 3 acute toxicity to evaluate the potential ecological risk of bp 1 and its products the toxicity changes of the reaction solutions were assessed using p phosphoreum liu et al 2015 as shown in fig 6 the relative toxicity of the reaction solution containing bp 1 was gradually enhanced with the irradiation time to be specific the inhibition rate on p phosphoreum increased from 31 1 at 0 h to 81 3 at 8 h while the inhibition rate slightly decreased to 77 1 after 24 h irradiation this indicated that the intermediates generated from the irradiation solution are more toxic than the parent compound bp 1 hence the phototransformation of bps in nitrate solution could enhance the potential ecological risks to aquatic organisms 3 4 photolysis of bp 1 in actual waters in natural aquatic environments the concentration of nitrate ranges from 0 01 to 1 mm we selected three water bodies as reaction solutions to explore the transformation of bps these systems were from jiuxiang river water jrw aerobic tank water atw ph 7 55 and secondary clarifier water scw from the donggang sewage treatment plant nanjing china as shown in table s3 the concentrations of nitrate were 0 26 0 07 and 0 18 mm the amount of bp 1 10 μm decreased by 66 0 14 5 and 40 4 in the three waters which was consistent with the background concentration of nitrate however when 10 mm nitrate was added to these real waters as shown in fig 7 b the removal rates observed in atw and scw were lower than that in jrw and pure water this indicated that a large amount of organic matter such as nom existed in these two water bodies and competitively consumed the ros thus slowing the reaction rate between ros and bps brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 lam et al 2003 4 conclusions nitrate is an abundant component of surface water the photolysis of no3 leads to abundant ros such as oh no and no2 which play important roles in the conversion fate of the widely occurring contaminants in aquatic environments in this study we systematically investigated the photochemical behavior of bps by irradiated nitrate in aquatic environments 1 our results showed that bps can be completely removed under the simulated sunlight irradiation and bp 1 has a 31 6 degradation rate of toc after 12 h irradiation in a 10 mm nitrate solution 2 some environmental factors such as intrinsic no3 concentration do ph and dissolved organic matter in actual water can affect the reaction kinetics of bps 3 we proved that there were three reactive oxygen species ros oh no and no2 that participated in this photolysis of bps and the contribution of oh accounted for 32 1 4 four main transformation pathways were proposed in this photolysis of bps via lc q tof ms analysis and dft these include hydroxylation nitrosylation nitration and dimerization according to the mechanism these early intermediates were generated from transformations in which oh no and no2 directly participated this study provides theoretical and experimental insights into the nitrate induced phototransformation of organic pollutants in an aquatic environment 5 the early intermediate products in this photolysis exhibited more toxicity than the parent compound therefore this result can remind us that we should pay attention to the potential ecological risks of the photochemical

19012,benzophenones bps which are widely used uv filters have aroused considerable public concern owing to their potential endocrine disrupting activities herein we systematically investigated their photochemical behavior and fate which is mediated by nitrate in aquatic environments the results showed that 10 μm of 3 bps can be completely degraded within 4 h of simulated sunlight irradiation in a 10 mm nitrate solution at ph 8 0 and 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone bp 1 has a 31 6 mineralization rate after 12 h irradiation their photolytic rates k obs presented a significant linear correlation with the logarithmic values of the nitrate concentration for 0 1 10 mm r 2 0 98 and in three actual waters the rates of bp 1 were also positively related to the intrinsic nitrate concentration furthermore higher transformation rates under alkaline condition were observed especially for bp 1 with its k obs at ph 10 being 8 3 fold higher than that at ph 6 0 moreover dissolved oxygen do also has an impact on the reaction kinetics to some degree according to the quenching experiments we found that three reactive oxygen species ros namely oh no and no2 participated in this photolysis of bps and the contribution of oh accounted for 32 1 furthermore we selected bp 1 as the model molecule to study the transformation pathways and toxicity changes in this system four main transformation pathways including hydroxylation nitrosylation nitration and dimerization were proposed based on liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry lc q tof ms analysis and density functional theory dft according to the toxicity test the formed intermediates were more toxic to photobacterium phosphoreum than the parent bp 1 therefore these results can help reveal primary phototransformation mechanisms and evaluate the potential ecological risks of bps in aquatic environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords benzophenones phototransformation nitrate kinetics product

grabicova et al 2013 rodil and moeder 2008 and as uv stabilizers in plastic packaging díaz cruz and barceló 2009 vione et al 2013 these substances can enter the aquatic environment directly via wash off from skin during bathing or swimming díaz cruz and barceló 2009 or can be indirectly discharged from wastewater treatment plants as a result of their incomplete elimination balmer et al 2005 giokas et al 2007 santos et al 2012 the occurrence of bps and their potentially toxic metabolites has become an emerging environmental concern several studies have reported that bps are frequently detected in various aqueous environments for example the concentration of 2 hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone bp 3 ranges from 97 to 722 ng l in a wastewater reclamation plant wwrp in tianjin china li et al 2007 and higher concentrations of bp 3 and 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone bp 1 3300 ng l and 280 ng l respectively have also been detected in spanish coastal seawater tarazona et al 2010 additionally bps have also been detected in the drinking waters of southern california ranging from 0 36 to 0 79 μg l loraine and pettigrove 2006 more seriously owing to the exposure of humans to bps being prevalent such as through ingestion of the packaging from food suzuki et al 2005 and absorbed through the skin from cosmetics jeon et al 2008 jiang et al 1999 several bps have been detected in human urine calafat et al 2008 jiang et al 1999 blood zhang et al 2013 and breast milk kim and choi 2014 samples it is noteworthy that some of these metabolic products are more toxic to aquatic organisms bp

and has a longer biological half life than its parent compound kim and choi 2014 as a result some attention has been paid in the last years to effective degradation approaches of bps in aquatic environments for example sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops liu et al 2016 pan et al 2017 chlorination manasfi et al 2015 santos et al 2012 lu et al 2018 ozonation gago ferrero et al 2013 wang et al 2018a and photodegradation gago ferrero et al 2012 gong et al 2015 li et al 2016 however the phototransformation fates of bps may be affected by natural environmental factors in particular nitrate is a widely occurring inorganic salt and it is known to induce the transformation of many organic pollutants to form similar metabolites many results indicate that the photolysis of aqueous no3 could induce the oxidation reaction of organic chemicals by generating several reactive species ros including oh no no2 and o2 under sunlight irradiation brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 carena and vione 2016 goldstein and rabani 2007 mack and bolton 1999 previous studies have investigated the role of nitrate on the indirect photochemical behavior of several ppcps in aquatic environments such as thiamphenicol ge et al 2009 enrofloxacin li et al 2011 atenolol ji et al 2012 tetracycline niu et al 2013 bp 3 vione et al 2014 and bisphenol a bpa kang et al 2018 more interestingly perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa can be completely mineralized in aqueous solutions containing 100 mm nitrate with uv irradiation li et al 2017 however the mechanism of the nitrate induced phototransformation of bps in real aqueous systems remains unclear particularly the formation of intermediate products which may be more toxic than the parental compound hence the transformation pathways of bps and their potential products induced by nitrate photolysis in natural environments has aroused great interest in the current study the phototransformation mechanism of bps during the nitrate induced process was investigated and the formation of intermediate products was confirmed via density functional theory dft and liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry lc q tof ms subsequently the effects of water matrices including nitrate concentration solution ph do and different water bodies on bp degradation were evaluated the reaction mechanisms were explored through ros quenching experiments electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy products identification and theoretical computations the findings in this study can help in the

suspended particles a 1 ml aliquot of the reaction solution was sampled at different irradiation times 0 10 30 60 90 120 180 and 240 min and then subjected to hplc to determine the concentrations of target bps 2 3 analytical methods hplc analysis an agilent 1260 infinity ii high performance liquid chromatograph hplc equipped with a photodiode array and an agilent c18 reversed phase column 5 μm 4

mode a mass to charge ratio from 60 to 700 was selected to record the mass spectra the detailed parameter settings of the ms instrument were optimized and are shown in the supporting epr analysis electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy was employed to detect the generation of ros including oh and o2 from the nitrate solution under xenon light irradiation and we used 5 5 dimethylpyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping agent experimental conditions 1 for the determination of oh 1 ml reaction solution containing 0 1 m dmpo and 1 m no3 was irradiated under xe light for 25 min at ph 2 ph 8 and ph 12 2 for the determination of o2 0 1 m dmpo and 0 1 m no3 were prepared in a 1 ml mixture solution containing 80 20 v v dimethylsulfoxide dmso and water at ph 2 ph 8 and ph 12 after 25 min irradiation the epr spectra were recorded by a bruker emx 10 12 spectrometer bruker bremen germany with magnetic field strengths of 1 48 t magnetic moment 72 mm and 1 90 t magnetic moment 50 mm and a scanning frequency of 9 773 ghz 2 4 molecular parameters and computational method the optimal molecular configuration and the frontier electron densities feds of bp 1 and the intermediate products were calculated and analyzed at the b3lyp 6 311g level using gaussian 09w software additionally the potential active site for the chemical reaction was determined by calculating the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital e homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital e lumo to further confirm the reasonability of the proposed pathways 2 5 toxicity tests of photobacterium phosphoreum photobacterium phosphoreum t 3 spp was used as the test organism for assessing the bio toxicity of reaction solution the freeze dried powder was provided by the institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences nanjing china the detailed experimental procedure was conducted according to the national standard water quality determination of the acute toxicity luminescent bacteria test gb t 15441 1995 the bioluminescence was measured on a tecan infinite 200 pro multimode microplate reader tecan switzerland the toxicity data were recorded as the inhibition percentage versus the control 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics 3 1 1 effect of nitrate on the photolysis of bps the phototransformation experiments of bps were conducted in 40 ml aqueous solutions containing 10 μm substrates with different nitrate concentrations ranging from 0 1 mm to 10 mm under xe light irradiation for 4 h fig 1 a shows that an enhanced degradation of bps was apparently observed with the addition of nitrate compared to that without nitrate after 4 h of irradiation approximately 99 7 100 and 95 6 of the three bps were removed at a nitrate concentration of 10 mm the conversion rates increased with the increasing nitrate concentration and all these reaction rates appeared to follow pseudo first order kinetics among the reactions the k obs values were linearly fitted to the logarithmic values of the nitrate concentration log no3 as shown in fig s2 r 2 0 98 this indicated that nitrate could play a critical role in influencing the reaction of bp removal under xe light irradiation 3 1 2 effect of ph on the photolysis of bps the effect of ph on the removal of the three types of bps 2 hbp bp 1 and bp 3 was also investigated as shown in fig 1b and the results showed that the reaction rates of the bps in alkaline solutions ph 10 were clearly higher than those in acidic solutions ph 4 particularly for bp 1 slightly increasing k obs values with an increase in the solution ph were observed in the ph range of 4 0 7 0 however under alkaline conditions from ph 7 0 to 10 0 the values of k obs rapidly increased from 0 0117 s 1 to 0 0348 s 1 which were 2 8 and 8 3 fold higher than the value at ph 6 0 fig 1b the higher k obs values at ph 7 0 may be explained by considering the deprotonation of bp 1 in alkaline solutions ph pk a 7 72 the deprotonated bp 1 would react faster than the molecular form due to the higher electronic density surroundings chen et al 2013 this can also be confirmed by the theoretical calculations where the energy gap between e homo and e lumo e homo lumo for the deprotonation of bp 1 0 1170 a u was lower than that of protonation 0 1629 a u however from ph 4 0 to 6 0 the k obs of all the bps showed a negligible change and this is because the free radicals were at a steady level previous studies have reported that oh quantum yields φ oh for the photolysis of no3 are independent of ph between ph 4 and 9 zellner et al 1990 and that no statistically significant trend is observed over the entire ph range from 4 to 6 for no2 scharko et al 2014 furthermore we only detected a weak hydroxyl radical signal under acidic conditions ph 2 in a 1 m nano3 solution as illustrated in fig s3a because in this case the relatively high φ oh was 10 20 fold of that under neutral conditions ph 4 to 9 mack and bolton 1999 moreover the degradation rates of other derivatives of bps bp 3 and 2 hbp were observed to be slower than that of bp 1 at the different ph levels this indicates that different bps may differ in molecular stability because of their different structures under the ph 4 condition the three bps mainly existed in the form of molecular states and they had similar e homo values of 0 2356 0 2293 and 0 2351 for bp 1 bp 3 and 2 hbp respectively resulting in their more similar conversion efficiencies however when the ph increased to 8 and 10 the degradation rate of bp 1 exhibited an apparent change from the rates of 2 hbp and bp 3 this is because bp 1 was substantially easier to convert into its deprotonated form bp 1 as the pk a values of 2 hbp bp 1 and bp 3 are 9 30 shiung et al 2018 7 72 yin et al 2013 and 9 57 yang et al 2016 respectively even under the ph 10 condition as shown in fig 1b the reaction rate constant of bp 1 was still higher than that of bp 3 and 2 hbp and in this way bp 1 lost two protons and turned into bp 1 2 the e homo lumo of bp 1 2 0 07253 remained less than that of 2 hbp 0 10808 and bp 3 0 11696 3 1 3 effect of dissolved oxygen on the photolysis of bps dissolved oxygen do is an important factor that affects the photoreaction of organic substances in aquatic environments lee et al 2005 shirayama et al 2001 to explore the role of do on the photolysis of bps n2 and o2 were purged to the nitrate reaction system to regulate the do level the do contents were measured as 0 26 0 03 5 36 0 20 and 12 32 0 80 mg l in n2 purging control and o2 purging solutions respectively as shown in fig 1c the bp 1 removal rate in the oxygen saturated system was higher than that in the control system and a decrease in the removal of bp 1 was observed in the oxygen depleted system this indicated that do may be involved in the nitrate induced transformation of bp 1 it has been reported that do can affect the formation of no2 shankar et al 2007 such as in eq 1and eq 2 therefore do undoubtedly increases the electron transport chain and can then improve the level of free radicals in the solution 1 no 2 h υ no 2 e a q φ 355 nm 0 076 2 e a q o 2 o 2 k 9 1 9 10 10 m 1 s 1 3 2 exploration of the reaction mechanism 3 2 1 identification of intermediate products in this work we selected bp 1 as a representative compound and systematically investigated its intermediate products via lc q tof ms analysis which can be used to show the reaction mechanisms involving ros the total ion currents tics and extracted ion chromatograms eics of bp 1 and its reaction products after different irradiation times are shown in fig 2 reviewing the tics it can be seen that the parent compound bp 1 m h m z 213 0550 was eluted at 13 6 min and other peaks were also observed at different retention times according to the discussions related to the photolysis mechanism of nitrate ros oh no no2 and o2 should be the major oxidizing agents responsible for the removal of bp 1 thus bp 1 is likely to be substituted by the oh no and no2 functional groups at an early stage as shown in the inset of fig 2 the eics of these intermediate products were indeed obtained in the tics at different reaction times the appearance of two peaks with m z 229 05 indicated the formation of two hydroxylated bp 1 isomers p1 at retention times from 12 1 to 13 0 min and the peaks at m z 242 05 and 258 04 were assigned as the nitrosylation product p2 and nitration product p3 respectively with retention times of 12 2 min and 13 4 min in addition there were four new peaks of p4 with a m z of 425 1025 appearing at 14 8 15 2 15 8 and 16 8 min which were identified to be dimers through the analysis of the product ion spectra in addition the eics fragment ion spectra and proposed fragmentation pathways of all products are presented in table s1 and fig s4 3 2 2 role of ros in the photolysis of bps to evaluate which ros were predominant during the phototransformation of bp 1 we investigated the effect of various scavengers tba ipa pbq ffa and sod on the photolysis of bp 1 according to previous reports isopropanol alcohol ipa was chosen as the oh scavenger for the nitrate photolysis system goldstein and rabani 2007 as seen from fig 3 a both the addition of ipa and tba clearly reduced the reaction rates of bp 1 however ipa was more effective than tba corresponding to their different reaction rates with the oh radical k ipa 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 k tba 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 moreover in a fenton reaction system bp 1 can be rapidly degraded with different fenton reagent dosages as shown in fig s5 thus we can preliminarily speculate that oh should participate in decomposing bps the superoxide radical o2 is another ros produced during the photolysis of nitrate and the epr spectral signal of dmpo o2 adducts can prove the species did exist in this system as shown in fig s3b therefore in this work we selected superoxide dismutase sod to evaluate the role of o2 in removing bp 1 as illustrated in fig 3b two concentrations of sod 400 and 4000 u l 1 were chosen to investigate the role of superoxide radicals in the nitrate photolysis system it has been suggested that o2 inefficiently effects the transformation of bp 1 and instead other reactive species may contribute to the enhanced removal of bp 1 according to scheme 1 the accompanying generations of o2 and no were observed under this condition in the presence of sod o2 can be eliminated and the generation of no is increased due to the chemical equilibrium therefore the enhanced degradation rate of bp 1 with the addition of sod could be attributed to the increasing no radical concentration which suggested that no is also involved in the degradation of bps furthermore both pbq and ffa tremendously inhibited the removal of bp 1 depending on their dosages in this case their shadowing effects are negligible as shown in fig s6 previous studies have shown that pbq can primarily scavenge o2 an et al 2014 wang et al 2018b which is inconsistent with the aforementioned results of sod thus we had to divert our attention to other ros in the system such as no and no2 which may be quenched by pbq and ffa therefore we can speculate that the reactive nitrogen species rns no and no2 should participate in the transformation of bps to further ascertain the transformation mechanisms of the bps driven by these reactive species we monitored the yields of four early intermediate products with the addition of various scavengers as shown in fig 4 and 5 the lc ms intensities of p1 hydroxylation p2 nitrosylation p3 nitration and p4 dimerization were obtained from eic using hplc tof ms ms with the addition of ipa to the bp 1 nitrate system the yield of p1 was almost completely suppressed as shown in fig 4a however a negligible change was observed for the formation of p2 which indicated that the formation of the n nitroso bp 1 was independent of oh however for p3 and p4 the peak areas were reduced in the presence of ipa suggesting that oh radicals had a positive effect on the formation of nitrated and dimer products one possibility for the decrease in nitration and dimer products is that oh radicals first reacted with bp 1 to form the organic free radical of bp 1 bp 1 eq 3 which was followed by the reaction with other radicals such as no2 and bp 1 to generate p3 nitrated products no2 bp 1 eq 4 and p4 dimers bp 1 2 eq 5 3 oh bp 1 bp 1 oh 4 no2 bp 1 no2 bp 1 5 bp 1 bp 1 bp 1 2 dimer another possible explanation is that formed no2 was firstly reacted with oh and convert to no2 under this conditions eq 6 goldstein and rabani 2007 shankar et al 2007 then no2 can directly react with bp 1 to form no2 bp 1 eq 7 or bp 1 eq 8 6 oh no2 no2 oh k 10 1 0 1010 m 1s 1 7 no2 bp 1 no2 bp 1 8 no2 bp 1 bp 1 no2 h nevertheless when pbq was introduced to the reaction all transformation pathways were completely inhibited except for hydroxylation in the presence of pbq we regarded that oh was the only active species in solution however from fig 4d the formation of dimers was also completely suppressed indicating that oh was not the reactive species firsthand to converting bp 1 into bp 1 but no2 therefore the reduced yields of p3 and p4 was due to part of no2 converted by oh was cut off in the presence of ipa but the negligible change of p2 indicated that oh not participating in the formation of no furthermore ffa exhibited a multi effect on the transformation of bp 1 and all these products were suppressed finally it is also worth noting that the time to peak of these early intermediates were further delayed and this suggests that the following evolution profiles of these species would be limited in the absence of oh moreover the contribution rate of oh radicals to the photolysis of bps was further investigated first we obtained the second order reaction rate constants for bp 1 with oh in a photo fenton system k bp 1 4 16 109 m 1 s 1 the detailed information were shown in supporting information text s2 in the no3 solution 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid htpa was usually used to calculate φ oh charbouillot et al 2011 tafer et al 2016 because it is a primary product of the reaction of tpa and oh additionally the hydroxylation yield of tpa into htpa defined as yhtpa is usually 35 chen et al 2018 page et al 2010 and here the steady state concentration of oh oh ss can be calculated based on eqs 9 11 9 r d h t p a d t k t p a t p a o h s s y h t p a 10 l i m t 0 d h t p a d t l i m t 0 k t p a t p a o h s s y h t p a 11 k 0 h t p a k t p a t p a 0 o h s s y h t p a where k 0 h t p a is the initial formation rate of htpa as shown fig s7 and k 0 h t p a 3 89 0 03 10 2 μm min 1 furthermore k tpa is the second order kinetics constant of the tpa reaction with oh and it is usually 4 4 109 m 1s 1 charbouillot et al 2011 when tpa 0 is the initial concentration of tpa then the oh ss of this system can be obtained as 4 21 10 14 m according to fig 1b the degradation rate constant k obs of bp 1 at ph 8 was calculated as 3 27 10 2 min 1 herein the quasi first order rate constant of bp 1 induced by oh in the nitrate photolysis system is defined as γ o h which could be calculated via eq 12 12 γ o h k b p 1 o h s s n i t r a t e 1 05 10 2 m i n 1 therefore the contribution of oh in the photolysis of bp 1 accounted for 32 1 of the conversion in the nitrate system 13 γ o h γ o h k o b s 32 1 3 2 3 gaussian calculation and elucidation of possible pathways recently density functional theory dft has increasingly been used to show the conversion behavior of contaminants during environmental treatment processes dang et al 2015 qu et al 2016 xiao et al 2014 electrophilic addition reactions of hydroxyl radicals usually occur at positions with higher fed 2 homo lumo luo et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 as shown in fig s8 and table s3 c11 was determined to be the most prioritized location for hydroxylation coincidentally two fragment ions m z 109 0296 and 135 0083 in ms ms spectrum of p1 fig s4 verified this result then c3 was determined to be the second prioritized location therefore yielding two isomers p1 in pathway i afterwards p1 was rapidly converted into p5 and will undergo further oxidation to form p6 which is a ring opening product finally these intermediates gradually disappeared as shown in fig s9 therefore this is a path that can mineralize bp 1 and the total organic carbon toc of the solution data exactly matched this result fig s10 in pathway ii and pathway iii no and no2 as electrophiles can readily attack locations with a high electron density such as c1 c3 and o16 because of their higher 2fed homo2 the fragment ions at m z 120 0090 for p2 and m z 179 9932 for p3 proved that its reaction does occur in the right benzene ring in pathway iv bp 1 was converted into three phenoxy free radicals r1 r3 by no2 which can undergo coupling reactions at different positions via cc or c o c bonds and then on to form four dimers after this initial reaction these dimers were the substituted products p7 p8 and p9 via the attack of oh no and no2 for these products as seen from fig s9 their peak areas p2 p3 p4 p7 p8 and p9 gradually increased within 1 2 h and then they decreased over the irradiation time which indicated that these intermediates are not part of a continuous cumulative process in actual aqueous environments as long as is sufficient irradiation time 3 3 acute toxicity to evaluate the potential ecological risk of bp 1 and its products the toxicity changes of the reaction solutions were assessed using p phosphoreum liu et al 2015 as shown in fig 6 the relative toxicity of the reaction solution containing bp 1 was gradually enhanced with the irradiation time to be specific the inhibition rate on p phosphoreum increased from 31 1 at 0 h to 81 3 at 8 h while the inhibition rate slightly decreased to 77 1 after 24 h irradiation this indicated that the intermediates generated from the irradiation solution are more toxic than the parent compound bp 1 hence the phototransformation of bps in nitrate solution could enhance the potential ecological risks to aquatic organisms 3 4 photolysis of bp 1 in actual waters in natural aquatic environments the concentration of nitrate ranges from 0 01 to 1 mm we selected three water bodies as reaction solutions to explore the transformation of bps these systems were from jiuxiang river water jrw aerobic tank water atw ph 7 55 and secondary clarifier water scw from the donggang sewage treatment plant nanjing china as shown in table s3 the concentrations of nitrate were 0 26 0 07 and 0 18 mm the amount of bp 1 10 μm decreased by 66 0 14 5 and 40 4 in the three waters which was consistent with the background concentration of nitrate however when 10 mm nitrate was added to these real waters as shown in fig 7 b the removal rates observed in atw and scw were lower than that in jrw and pure water this indicated that a large amount of organic matter such as nom existed in these two water bodies and competitively consumed the ros thus slowing the reaction rate between ros and bps brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 lam et al 2003 4 conclusions nitrate is an abundant component of surface water the photolysis of no3 leads to abundant ros such as oh no and no2 which play important roles in the conversion fate of the widely occurring contaminants in aquatic environments in this study we systematically investigated the photochemical behavior of bps by irradiated nitrate in aquatic environments 1 our results showed that bps can be completely removed under the simulated sunlight irradiation and bp 1 has a 31 6 degradation rate of toc after 12 h irradiation in a 10 mm nitrate solution 2 some environmental factors such as intrinsic no3 concentration do ph and dissolved organic matter in actual water can affect the reaction kinetics of bps 3 we proved that there were three reactive oxygen species ros oh no and no2 that participated in this photolysis of bps and the contribution of oh accounted for 32 1 4 four main transformation pathways were proposed in this photolysis of bps via lc q tof ms analysis and dft these include hydroxylation nitrosylation nitration and dimerization according to the mechanism these early intermediates were generated from transformations in which oh no and no2 directly participated this study provides theoretical and experimental insights into the nitrate induced phototransformation of organic pollutants in an aquatic environment 5 the early intermediate products in this photolysis exhibited more toxicity than the parent compound therefore this result can remind us that we should pay attention to the potential ecological risks of the photochemical

19013,estimation of phytoplankton biomass noted as phytoplankton carbon c phyto and evaluation of phytoplankton physiology is central to the estimation of primary productivity and the carbon cycle this issue has been widely considered in oceans but not in inland water here we develop experiential and semi analytical models which validated by independent in situ measurement data respectively to derive c phyto and phytoplankton absorption coefficient at 675 nm a ph 675 from modis the effects of nutrients and temperature on the seasonal variation of phytoplankton physiology were assessed through a novel proxy of c phyto to a ph 675 ratio c phyto a ph 675 over the lake taihu the third largest lake in china significant seasonal climatological cycles of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 were observed in lake taihu especially in meiliang bay and zhushan bay where algal blooms occur frequently the highest c phyto and a ph 675 values were observed in summer due to the growth of phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a concentration lower values were observed in winter and spring which are characterized by relatively high total nitrogen levels and low irradiance owing to the low temperature astricts the algae growth however the c phyto a ph 675 shows an opposite trend compared to c phyto and a ph 675 which have high values in winter and low values in summer the analysis of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 with total phosphorus tp levels and temperature indicates that tp are the main positive driver of the increase in c phyto and a ph 675 and negatively regulate c phyto a ph 675 warming promotes an increase in c phyto and a ph 675 and restricts c phyto a ph 675 in summer biomass and nutrient levels are the primary drivers of the decrease of c phyto a ph 675

and fragmented distribution 117 106 lakes with area bigger than 0 002 km2 of lakes verpoorter et al 2015 should be taken seriously especially because of the dramatically increased phytoplankton

photoacclimation of phytoplankton chakraborty et al 2017 therefore c phyto a ph which also regulated by light temperature and nutrients can be used to investigate the physiology of phytoplankton and a ph is analytically related to satellite measurements of remote sensing reflectance lee et al 1996 in this study an nir red band ratio empirical algorithm of c phyto and semi analytical algorithm of a ph 675 were developed based on in situ measurement data in lake taihu the algorithms of c phyto and a ph 675 were then applied to modis satellite data to investigate the long term variation of c phyto and a ph 675 combined with temperature nutrient concentration and light an novel proxy of c phyto a ph 675 in the high turbid inland water was used to reveal the regulation of climate change and trophic state due to the biomass and physiology of phytoplankton in inland lake water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and in situ sampling strategy lake taihu is an extremely turbid eutrophic lake in china with a surface area of 2338 km2 and a mean water depth of 1 9 m fig 1 a algal blooms have been a major problem in the lake since the 1980s the most eutrophic region in lake taihu is meiliang bay mlb in fig 1a and zhushan bay zsb in fig 1a huang et al 2015 chl a concentration and algal density show clear seasonal patterns with higher values in summer fig 1b data from environmental monitoring center of wuxi city jiangsu province china field measurements from more than 23 cruises between 2003 and 2017 were conducted to develop and validate the nir red band ratio empirical algorithm of c phyto and the semi analytical algorithm of a ph sampling site is shown in fig 1a table 1 a detailed description of the in situ measurements of optical properties and water qualities was described in huang et al 2014 the collection and analyses technique of water samples are consistent with each sampling cruise briefly remote sensing reflectance r rs λ measurements were obtained using fieldspec spectroradiometer 350 1050 nm range with a sampling interval of 1 nm asd usa the optical properties including absorption of phytoplankton a ph λ tripton a d λ colored dissolved organic matter a g λ and total suspended matter a λ were measured by filtered and analyzed water samples via a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3600 with the quantitative filter technique cleveland and weidemann 1993 the concentrations of total suspended matter spm were measured by measuring the mass differences between the pre combusted 550 c for 4 h and dried 105 c for 4 h glass fiber filters gf f 0 7 μm before and after filtration of water samples chl a was extracted with ethanol 90 at 80 c for 6 h in darkness and then was analyzed using a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3600 the concentration of particulate organic carbon poc was obtained by carbon elemental analyzer toc l ssm 5000a shimadzu corporation parsons et al 1984 2 2 supplemental data collection the coupled data of poc and chl a in oceans 5284 eutrophic lakes 1084 lakes 712 coastal waters 936 and rivers 167 collected from a previous study huang et al 2018b were used to calibration the estimation method of c phyto the data of poc and chl a from algal culture 380 unpublished data for green scenedesmus obliquus and blue algae microcystis aeruginosa were also used in the model calibration of c phyto estimation the concentrations of total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn and temperature were measured by the environmental monitoring center of wuxi city jiangsu province china the weather data of temperature were downloaded from climatic data center national meteorological information center china meteorological administration http cdc cma gov cn 2 3 accuracy assessment the root mean square percentage error rmsp relative

level 0 images with 250 m spatial resolution from june 2002 to january 2017 with minimal or no cloud cover total of 1493 images fig 2 were chosen and download from the u s nasa goddard flight space center gsfc http oceancolor gsfc nasa gov seadas 7 3 was used to generate radiometric and geometric correction of modis aqua and output the satellite angles ozone and water vapor content as parameters of atmospheric correction the corresponding modis cloud mask products mod35 were used to perform the cloud masking the improved land target based atmospheric correction method guanter et al 2010 liu et al 2016a was chosen to derive the reflectance from the modis aqua data over lake taihu sampling site with 2 2 pixels over a 2 h time interval were used similar to cédric et al 2011 to evaluate the accuracy of atmospheric correction the rmsp between retrieved and measured r rs λ are 22 6 and 40 2 for r rs 645 and r rs 859 respectively the rmsp of r rs 859 r rs 645 is 29 6 the accuracy of atmospheric correction and its effect on the single band and band ratio algorithm were detailed discussed in our previous study huang et al 2017 2 5 ensemble empirical mode decomposition method eemd empirical mode decomposition emd is a method that decompose an original signal sequence x t into n components noted as intrinsic mode functions imf i i 1 2 n and a residue r according to local temporal and structural characteristics of original signal sequence huang et al 1998 2a x t i 0 n i m f i r however emd cannot overcome the interruption from the mixing mode signal leading to an overestimation of the noise in the signal wu and huang 2009 chen et al 2017 the ensemble emd eemd method was developed by wu and huang 2009 to decompose new time signal x j t which added numbers j it adopted as 1000 in this paper of gaussian white noise p j t into the original signal sequence x t to obtain the each imf i j and r j of x j t 2b x j t x t p j t j 1 2 3 1000 2c x j t i 0 n i m f i j r

the quasi periods of long term remote sensing data in previous studies liu et al 2018 pan et al 2018 3 model development calibration and validation 3 1 estimation of c phyto 3 1 1 estimation of c phyto from chl a the ability to measure phytoplankton organic carbon concentrations c phyto or differentiate it from other suspended particulate matter remains a challenge martínez vicente et al 2013 c phyto is also not easily distinguished from other types of carbon previous studies proposed that c phyto can be estimated well from particulate backscattering coefficient b bp and chlorophyll a behrenfeld et al 2005 sathyendranath et al 2009 martínez vicente et al 2013 thomalla et al 2017 however suspended particulate matter is the dominant contributor to b bp and thus b bp is proportional to the spm not to the c phyto in high turbid inland water such as taihu lake shi et al 2018 consequently in this study the estimation of c phyto from chl a based on the large dataset of chl a and poc is proposed sathyendranath et al 2009 thomalla et al 2017 for inland turbid water the coupled data of poc and chl a from lakes rivers coastal waters eutrophic lakes and algal cultures were used to determine the 1 quantile regression to represent the relationship between c phyto and chl a first the 1 quantile of poc for different chl a concentration representing the c phyto for each chl a was selected from total poc data then this data set include 324 samples coupled by poc and chl a was used to fit the 1 quantile regression see sathyendranath et al 2009 following equation is the 1 quantile regression function of the inland turbid water the black line in fig 3 3 c phyto 0 1424 c h l a 0 6589 r 2 0 95 n 324 this 1 quantile regression function was used to convert the in situ measured chl a to the c phyto the coupled data of poc and chl a from the ocean and the relationships derived by buck et al 1996 sathyendranath et al 2009 and thomalla et al 2017 are exhibited in fig 3 for comparison the comparison indicates that c phyto in turbid inland water will be slightly underestimated from chl a according to buck et al 1996 in all ranges of chl a and will be significantly underestimated according to thomalla et al 2017 in low chl a and according to sathyendranath et al 2009 in high chl a 3 1 2 calibration and validation of cphyto model for remote sensing data the c phyto retrieval algorithm relies on the relationship between estimated c phyto from chl a and r rs λ the nir and red modis bands wavelengths 859 nm and 645 nm which were proposed to estimate chl a in our previous studies huang et al 2014 shi et al 2015 were used to construct the c phyto estimation model fig 4 a the linear logarithmic first order kinetic equation with and without constant were used to model c phyto and nir red band ratio r rs 859 r rs 645 the first order kinetic equation with constant with highest determined coefficient r 2 0 69 lowest rmsp 52 98 and mape 46 15 33 81 was chosen as the retrieval algorithm of c phyto 4 c phyto 142 5985 1 exp 0 026359 r rs 859 r rs 645 0 12706 r 2 0 69 n 851 the validation result from independent data indicates that the rmsp mape and nrmse of the validation dataset were 26 37 32 49 19 28 and 11 77 respectively the estimated c phyto and retrieved c phyto show good agreement and a significant linear correlation r 0 73 p 0 005 n 231 fig 4b 3 2 a ph 675 estimation algorithm calibration and validation r rs λ can be related to the inherent optical properties through radiative transfer simulation and validated relationships eq 5a 5c have been proposed by lee and carder 1999 according to the band set of modis the total absorption coefficient of water constituents a 675 can be modeled by following equations 5a 5e via estimated a 645 5a a 645 1 u 645 u 645 b b 645 a w 645 5b u 645 0 084 0 084 2 4 0 17 r rs 645 1 2 2 0 17 5c r rs 645 r rs 645 0 52 1 7 r rs 645 where r rs 645 is the remote sensing reflectance just beneath the water surface at 645 nm a 645 is the total absorption coefficient of water constituents at 645 nm and b b 645 is total backscattering coefficient at 645 nm b b 645 can be expressed the sum of particulate b bp 645 and pure water b bw 645 backscattering coefficients 5d b b 645 b bp 645 b bw 645 a 0 r rs 859 a 1 b bw 645 5e a 675 1 5382 a 645 1 0972 r 2 0 97 n 736 where b bp 645 can be modeled by r rs 859 according to the previous studies suggesting that b bp λ has a high correlation to r rs at near infrared wavelengths in turbid water doron et al 2007 wang et al 2009a a 675 was modeled by a 645 according to the in situ measured absorption coefficient due to the no wavelenth of 675 nm in the modis bandset the model parameters a 1 and a 0 can be solved via the calibration dataset with the objective equation for optimal computation 6 f obj i 1 n a 675 measured a 675 modeled 2 n where a 1 and a 0 were optimally set as 22 204 and 0 883 respectively with the highest determined coefficient r 2 0 71 lowest rmsp 18 59 mape 13 92 12 36 and nrmse 7 82 of calibration data fig 5 a the estimated b bp 675 is significantly correlated to the spm along with the relationship of b bp 675 0 0284 spm 0 6336 r 2 0 57 p 0 005 n 851 fig 5b the total absorption coefficient of water constituents can be separated into three segments 7 a 675 a ph 675 a d 675 a g 675 a d λ and a g λ are the coefficients of non pigment particle matter and chromophoric dissolved organic matter and very low in near infrared wavelengths a ph λ is the dominant optical factor at 675 nm with the high mean value of a ph 675 a 675 75 85 17 08 thus a ph 675 is highly correlated to a 675 in eq 8 some data of a ph 675 is disabled due to the extremely low pigment of phytoplankton and high non pigment particle in winter thus the number of this dataset is minified in order to keep the consistency in the establishment of eq 5e and eq 8 the experiential estimation formula of a ph 675 from a 675 is 8 a ph 675 0 6679 a 675 1 0442 r 2 0 96 n 736 a ph 675 can be calculated via the experiential formula eq 8 and retieved a 675 which estimated from eqs 5a 5d the estimated a ph 675 presents a high correlation r 0 83 to the in situ measured a ph 675 with rmsp 40 80 mape 29 89 56 45 and nrmse 7 34 fig 6 a the validation results of a ph 675 and a 675 from independent data show a highly linear correlation r 0 83 between measured and estimated a 675 with rmsp 40 40 mape 21 52 25 26 and nrmse 9 68 as well as a ph 675 with the highly linear correlation r 0 85 n 233 rmsp 40 28 mape 31 99 30 51 and nrmse 12 49 fig 6b 4 results and discussion 4 1 reconstruction of c phyto and a ph 675 from modis the long term distribution of c phyto and a ph 675 extracted from modis derived r rs via the c phyto and a ph 675 retrieval algorithms suggests that c phyto and a ph 675 in meiliang bay and zhushan bay maintain a relatively higher level than in lake taihu fig 7 the high algal biomass caused by frequently algal blooms serious eutrophication in meiliang bay and zhushan bay huang et al 2013 is the primary driver for the appearance of high value of c phyto and a ph 675 c phyto and a ph 675 show fluctuations with a period of one year may include small scale time period see section 4 3 for the monthly mean value which is especially remarkable in meiliang bay and zhushan bay fig 7 the relatively high c phyto and a ph 675 values mainly occurred in the summer and low values appeared in winter this periodic fluctuation of c phyto and a ph 675 in lake taihu is much weaker than in meiliang bay and zhushan bay fig 7 shows a similar trend for c phyto and a ph 675 in lake taihu correlation coefficient between c phyto and a ph 675 r 0 94 meiliang bay r 0 98 and zhushan bay r 0 99 corresponding to previous studies bellacicco et al 2016 behrenfeld et al 2014a 2016 the annual means of c phyto and a ph 675 in lake taihu indicate an uptrend from 2002 to 2007 c phyto 2 13 2 44 mg l 1 a ph 675 1 06 to 1 27 m 1 and downtrend from 2007 to 2015 c phyto 2 44 to 1 21 mg l 1 a ph 675 1 27 to 0 51 m 1 and then a slight increase in 2016 c phyto 1 5 mg l 1 a ph 675 0 67 m 1 the trend of c phyto and a ph 675 during 2002 2011 is very similar to the distribution of algal blooms in previous study huang et al 2013 this time variation of c phyto and a ph 675 could also regulated by nutrients and climate change due to the high dependence of c phyto and a ph 675 to the algal growth huang et al 2013 additionally the warmer winter in 2007 also contributes the relative higher value of c phyto and a ph 675 than other years during the study period duan et al 2009 the mean values of each month computed after merging results from all years from 2002 to 2016 demonstrated that the highest monthly mean c phyto and a ph 675 were observed in august with average values of 4 5 1 3 mg l 1 and 3 17 1 4 m 1 respectively nearly 2 0 and 2 7 times higher than the lowest values of 2 2 0 5 mg l 1 and 1 1 0 3 m 1 respectively in january 4 2 analysis of reconstructed c phyto a ph 675 the modis derived long term c phyto a ph 675 presented in fig 8 shows a similarly fluctuating trend with c phyto and a ph 675 over a period of one year however the relatively high c phyto a ph 675 was primarily distributed in the winter and low values appeared in summer contrasting to the monthly distribution of c phyto correlation coefficient r between c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto r 0 92 0 85 and 0 91 for taihu lake meiliang bay and zhushan bay respectively and a ph 675 r 0 92 0 89 and 0 91 the climatological annual cycle fig 8 of c phyto a ph 675 was compared to the monthly distinction of c phyto and a ph 675 δc phyto and δa ph 675 which was calculated by following equation a ph 675 2 a ph 675 m 1 a ph 675 m0 a ph 675 m 1 a ph 675 m0 and c phyto 2 c phyto m 1 c phyto m0 c phyto m 1 c phyto m0 where a ph 675 m1 and c phyto m1 are a ph 675 and c phyto for one time point and a ph 675 m0 and c phyto m0 are the a ph 675 and c phyto one month earlier the decrease of δc phyto and δa ph 675 from autumn to spring corresponds to the decreases of a ph 675 and c phyto accumulation rate correspondently the increase of δc phyto and δa ph 675 from spring to autumn illustrates the accelerating accumulation of a ph 675 and c phyto the change of δa ph 675 is bigger than that of δc phyto amplitude of the blue line is higher than the green line which indicates that the consumption and amassing of a ph 675 is much stronger than c phyto this is consistent with the finding that chlorophyll is signally regulated by light and nutrient concentration through photoacclimation laws and bannister 1980 behrenfeld et al 2016 jakobsen and markager 2016 the deviation between δc phyto and δa ph 675 regulated by physiology significantly emerged in the variation of c phyto a ph 675 with r of 0 35 lake taihu 0 19 meiliang bay and 0 46 zhushan bay for δc phyto correlation coefficients r between c phyto a ph 675 and δc phyto and 0 38 lake taihu 0 23 meiliang bay and 0 47 zhushan bay for δa ph 675 correlation coefficients r between c phyto a ph 675 and δa ph 675 4 3 variation trends of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 the monthly mean values of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 merged results from the study duration 2002 2016 in the representative regions meiliang bay and zhushan bay exhibiting a monthly cycle of c phyto and a ph 675 with peak values occurring in summer july or august fig 9 the corresponding c phyto a ph 675 had a high value in winter and a low value in summer fig 9 this variation trend of c phyto a ph 675 is contrary to previous studies in oceans behrenfeld et al 2016 jakobsen and markager 2016 where peak values of c phyto a ph 675 consistently occurred in summer however this agrees with findings that c phyto a ph 675 is negatively correlated to the concentration of c phyto and chlorophyll a behrenfeld et al 2005 bellacicco et al 2016 the physiological mechanism and laboratory cultures of algae suggest that low light and high nutrient concentrations cause low c phyto a ph 675 and high light and low nutrient concentrations lead to high c phyto a ph 675 behrenfeld et al 2002 halsey and jones 2015 jakobsen and markager 2016 however the relationships between c phyto a ph 675 nutrient concentration and light are much more complex than summarized above behrenfeld et al 2016 high biomass or high productivity especially during algal blooms which are extremely serious in summer in lake taihu huang et al 2014 hu et al 2010 will significantly decrease c phyto a ph 675 for the faster growing cells need more chlorophyll to meet demands for photosynthesis behrenfeld et al 2016 considering the underestimation of a ph 675 compared to chlorophyll a due to the package effect c phyto a ph 675 in summer should be lower than presented in fig 9 thus the biomass driven decrease in c phyto a ph 675 is remarkable in a typical eutrophic lake the monthly sequence data of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 were decomposed into six imfs and residue by eemd method fig 10 and table 2 the variance contributions vc of imf4 to imf6 were very small table 2 and thus were not analyzed in the following content the seasonal periods imf1 3 0 0 16 months of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 in taihu lake meilaing bay and zhushan bay are evident which variance contributions are bigger than 20 9 the seasonal periods of c phyto a ph 675 in meiliang bay and zhushan bay is the most significant with the variance contributions of 35 6 and 39 9 respectively the imf2 7 8 0 78 months of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 in meilaing bay and zhushan bay are approximately two months longer than that in taihu lake 6 0 0 17 months the variance contributions of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 in meilaing bay and zhushan bay are bigger than 20 5 much more significant than that in taihu lake vc smaller than 10 8 this relative longer duration and higher variance contributions of imf2 in meilaing bay and zhushan bay are mainly due to the more suitable habitat of algal growth due to much more sufficient nutrients and stable hydrodynamic conditions in the bay duan et al 2009 hu et al 2010 huang et al 2014 the interannual period 12 5 0 79 months of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 in taihu lake meilaing bay and zhushan bay are not very distinct vc smaller than 11 3 except the c phyto a ph 675 in meilaing bay vc is 24 9 the high variance contributions of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 in taihu lake vc are 43 4 45 8 and 42 6 suggests that quasi periods of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 were dominated by long term trends the long term decrease trends of c phyto and a ph 675 indicate the downward trend of phytoplankton in taihu lake contrary c phyto a ph 675 presents a long term increase trends in taihu lake the relatively low variance contributions of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 in meilaing bay and zhushan bay manifest that seasonal semiannual and interannual period are the dominant trends but not the long term trend the light conditions in lake taihu were similar to those reported by jakobsen and markager 2016 high light is distributed in summer and low light occurs in winter the nutrients total phosphorus and nitrogen tp and tn were selected to investigate the variation of c phyto a ph 675 for the apparent relationship between them the monthly mean values of tp and tn compared with c phyto a ph 675 manifest that low nutrients in winter correspond to high c phyto a ph 675 which is particularly significant in zhushan bay fig 11 agreeing with results in coastal and ocean waters jakobsen and markager 2016 the tp and tn in meiliang bay mean values standard deviation during 2000 2011 0 11 0 02 mg l 1 and 3 6 1 3 mg l 1 were lower than in zhushan bay 0 14 0 02 mg l 1 and 4 6 0 4 mg l 1 supporting the higher c phyto a ph 675 2 6 0 2 in meiliang bay compared to zhushan bay 1 7 0 1 faster growing of algae during algal blooms will significantly drop c phyto a ph 675 in eutrophic lakes lake taihu which was observed in laboratory cultures of a photoacclimation experiment behrenfeld et al 2016 4 4 regulation of nutrients and meteorological factors the time series of nutrients tp and tn and meteorological factors temperature mean relative humidity insolation duration windspeed and precipitation were compared to c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 to reveal the responses of phytoplankton biomass and physiology to nutrients and meteorological factors a significantly positive correlation was found between phytoplankton biomass c phyto and a ph 675 and tp similar to a previous study jakobsen and markager 2016 c phyto a ph 675 was negatively correlated to tp tn precipitation and insolation duration have a slightly impact on c phyto r 0 19 0 25 and 0 34 for tn and insolation duration a ph 675 r 0 17 0 21 and 0 24 and c phyto a ph 675 r 0 20 0 19 and 0 25 temperature has a significant positive effect on c phyto and a ph 675 especially in meiliang bay r 0 43 p 0 005 and r 0 52 p 0 005 for a ph 675 and c phyto respectively and zhushan bay r 0 66 p 0 005 and r 0 69 p 0 001 the mean relative humidity and windspeed almost has no correlation to c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 according to the correlation analysis r 0 15 4 4 1 nutrients phosphorus the positive relationship between c phyto and chl a and tp suggests that nutrients accelerate the growth of phytoplankton biomass through the synthesis of chlorophyll for photosynthesis in lake taihu laws 2013 fig 12 a c the power function relationships p restricted function of algal growth smith 1982 2006 guildford and hecky 2000 between c phyto chl a and tp assert that p restricted algal growth increase of c phyto and chl a will very significantly when tp smaller than 0 1 mg l 1 and will wear off with the increase of tp the power exponent of the regression function for a ph 675 is bigger than for c phyto fig 12a f 0 44 vs 0 34 in lake taihu 0 40 vs 0 23 in meiliang bay 0 37 vs 0 27 in zhushan bay the lower power exponent of c phyto indicates that c phyto is much more sensitive to tp the growth rate of c phyto is bigger than a ph 675 with the increase of tp under low level phosphorus loading usually occurs in spring and winter in fig 11 leading to relatively high c phyto a ph 675 this phytoplankton physiology caused a negative relationship between c phyto a ph 675 and tp fig 12d f this negative relationship was also observed in coastal water fig 7 in jakobsen and markager 2016 the regulation of phosphorus to c phyto and c phyto a ph 675 in lake taihu is much more distinct than in meiliang bay and zhushan bay fig 12 relating to the spatial and temporal variation of nutrient limitation huang et al 2015 the best fit formula of c phyto c phyto a ph 675 and tp was found in lake taihu and can be expressed as c phyto 2 5 tp0 44 r 2 0 41 n 174 and c phyto a ph 675 0 29 ln tp 1 45 r 2 0 46 n 174 respectively fig 12g i the regulation of nutrients to c phyto and c phyto a ph 675 probably means that nutrients can be treated as an indicator of c phyto and c phyto a ph 675 when nutrients are limited thus the decrease of c phyto a ph 675 caused by limited nutrients in lake taihu is significant but is weaken in the bay with sufficient nutrient 4 4 2 climate warming temperature temperature is a critical ecological factor impacting the growth of phytoplankton and regulating c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 for the temperature correlated asynchronous variation in chlorophyll and c phyto productivity behrenfeld 2014 our results suggest that warming temperature increase could increase a ph 675 and c phyto productivity linearly particularly in zhushan bay and meiliang bay when there are sufficient nutrients fig 13 a f however the promoting effect of temperature on c phyto is stronger than on a ph 675 in meiliang bay and zhushan bay 0 038 vs 0 016 in meiliang bay 0 079 vs 0 065 in zhushan bay the high correlation between c phyto and temperature in zhushan bay was observed to be c phyto 0 079 t 1 85 r 2 0 48 n 174 fig 13c also for a ph 675 and temperature with a ph 675 0 065 t 0 85 r 2 0 43 n 174 fig 13f nevertheless warming temperature increase significantly reduced c phyto a ph 675 in zhushan bay with the relationship c phyto a ph 675 0 014 t 1 946 r 2 0 43 n 174 fig 13i the initial blooming date and duration of algal blooms in lake taihu are directly dependent on the temperature duan et al 2009 and are strongly regulated by warming geider 1987 however the temperature driven decrease of c phyto a ph 675 has still been challenged by recent satellite and in situ studies behrenfeld et al 2005 2013 2014b wang et al 2009b jakobsen and markager 2016 thomas et al 2017 5 conclusions and prospects the empirical and semi analytical remote sensing estimation of c phyto and a ph 675 from modis was conducted based on satellite derived remote sensing reflectance and in situ

phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 were generated from modis satellite images gathered from 2002 to 2016 significant climatologic annual fluctuations of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 were observed based on long term monitoring c phyto and a ph 675 values in the summer were significantly higher than those recorded in other seasons c phyto a ph 675 presented an opposite trend to c phyto and a ph 675 with a low value in summer nutrients and temperature promote the growth of algae and then increases in c phyto and a ph 675 however a ph 675 is much more sensitive to nutrient concentration than c phyto which in order to get more pigment prepared for photosynthetic carbon production and then lead low c phyto a ph 675 the biomass driven variation of c phyto a ph 675 is much stronger than nutrient and light driven variation in such a typical seriously eutrophic lake acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos

19013,estimation of phytoplankton biomass noted as phytoplankton carbon c phyto and evaluation of phytoplankton physiology is central to the estimation of primary productivity and the carbon cycle this issue has been widely considered in oceans but not in inland water here we develop experiential and semi analytical models which validated by independent in situ measurement data respectively to derive c phyto and phytoplankton absorption coefficient at 675 nm a ph 675 from modis the effects of nutrients and temperature on the seasonal variation of phytoplankton physiology were assessed through a novel proxy of c phyto to a ph 675 ratio c phyto a ph 675 over the lake taihu the third largest lake in china significant seasonal climatological cycles of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 were observed in lake taihu especially in meiliang bay and zhushan bay where algal blooms occur frequently the highest c phyto and a ph 675 values were observed in summer due to the growth of phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll a concentration lower values were observed in winter and spring which are characterized by relatively high total nitrogen levels and low irradiance owing to the low temperature astricts the algae growth however the c phyto a ph 675 shows an opposite trend compared to c phyto and a ph 675 which have high values in winter and low values in summer the analysis of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 with total phosphorus tp levels and temperature indicates that tp are the main positive driver of the increase in c phyto and a ph 675 and negatively regulate c phyto a ph 675 warming promotes an increase in c phyto and a ph 675 and restricts c phyto a ph 675 in summer biomass and nutrient levels are the primary drivers of the decrease of c phyto a ph 675 in such a typical eutrophic lake the results present some new findings compared to previous oceanic studies and expand our knowledge in the study of phytoplankton biomass and physiology in eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image 1 keywords eutrophic lake phytoplankton absorption coefficient satellite data retrieval algorithms 1 introduction lakes have been shown to be a significant source of carbon dioxide and methane co2 and ch4 and also act as a significant organic carbon oc trap during the transportation process of terrestrial oc from soil to ocean wilkinson et al 2013 galy et al 2015 recent studies have proposed that lake eutrophication which is known to increase primary productivity phytoplankton carbon c phyto significantly increases oc burial in lake sediment heathcote and downing 2012 anderson et al 2014 huang et al 2018a besides the effect of terrestrial oc input heathcote et al 2015 furthermore c phyto which is considered to be labile organic matter strongly regulates oc mineralization and the subsequent loss of sedimentary oc with c phyto degrading at a higher rate than terrestrial oc or aged oc recalcitrant oc gudasz et al 2012 watanabe and kuwae 2015 chmiel et al 2015 and has positive priming effect to recalcitrant oc battin et al 2008 guenet et al 2010 2012 bianchi 2011 kuzyakov and bol 2006 guillemette et al 2017 finally approximately 2 8 93 1 noted burial efficiency of burial oc is permanently stored in lake sediment after being steadily mineralized over several decades though the exact mineralization time depends on the burial conditions sobek et al 2014 almeida et al 2016 huang et al 2018a c phyto provides important insight into oc burial and mineralization in lake sediment thereby modulating the global carbon cycle and climate change tranvik et al 2009 wallhead et al 2014 westberry et al 2016 consequently c phyto in lakes which has long been overlooked in the global carbon cycle due to the relatively small area 5 106 km2 and fragmented distribution 117 106 lakes with area bigger than 0 002 km2 of lakes verpoorter et al 2015 should be taken seriously especially because of the dramatically increased phytoplankton biomass caused by worldwide lake eutrophication meanwhile the impacts of nutrient concentrations and climate geider et al 1997 behrenfeld et al 2014a 2016 on biomass and the physiology of phytoplankton are also vital to mediate variations in c phyto spatial and temporal variation of c phyto has been widely studied due to its importance in biogeochemistry and the carbon cycle in oceans e g sathyendranath et al 2009 graff et al 2015 westberry et al 2016 jackson et al 2017 chlorophyll a chl a is the primary pigment used by phytoplankton to photosynthesize biomass and has been found to correlate highly to c phyto jakobsen and markager 2016 thomalla et al 2017 the relationship between c phyto and chl a influenced by factors such as light temperature and nutrient concentration li et al 2010 béchet et al 2013 can be used to calculate the phytoplankton biomass from the traditional monitoring parameter of chl a concentration sathyendranath et al 2009 jakobsen and markager 2016 the ratio of c phyto and chl a c phyto chl a can be used to help with the determination of the photoacclimation physiology and growth rate of phytoplankton behrenfeld et al 2005 westberry et al 2008 regnier et al 2013 yet c phyto is not a traditional water parameter and is difficult to measure graff et al 2015 martínez vicente et al 2017 thus c phyto was rarely investigated by satellite until behrenfeld et al 2005 developed an estimation method of c phyto based on the light backscattering coefficient b b in oceans however because of the inaccurate measurement of b b and non dominance of c phyto in highly turbid inland waters ma et al 2009 it is difficult to determine a valid relationship between b b and c phyto such as in behrenfeld et al 2005 bellacicco et al 2016 the growth rate of phytoplankton μ delegated by c phyto chl a can be used to evaluate the physiology of phytoplankton behrenfeld 2014 bellacicco et al 2016 graff et al 2016 in the carbon based models of net phytoplankton production npp c phyto μ behrenfeld et al 2005 behrenfeld and boss 2014 μ is a function of c phyto chl a and regulated by light temperature and nutrients the absorption based models of npp npp q par ϕ μ max tanh ek e q par is energy absorption of pigment ϕ μ max is the maximum converted efficiency from energy to cphyto tanh ek e is the variation of photosynthetic efficiency with water depth have been recommended to estimate npp in global ocean water for it provides a more complete accessory pigment than chl a alone lee et al 2011 2015 silsbe et al 2016 combining the carbon based and absorption based models cphyto μ q par ϕ μ max tanh ek e the c phyto q par of phytoplankton can be yielded as a function of μ and light dependent quantum yield of net carbon fixation cphyto q par ϕ μ max tanh ek e μ silsbe et al 2016 q par is highly depended by phytoplankton absorption coefficient a ph and the light absorption coefficient and pigment characteristics can reflect photoacclimation of phytoplankton chakraborty et al 2017 therefore c phyto a ph which also regulated by light temperature and nutrients can be used to investigate the physiology of phytoplankton and a ph is analytically related to satellite measurements of remote sensing reflectance lee et al 1996 in this study an nir red band ratio empirical algorithm of c phyto and semi analytical algorithm of a ph 675 were developed based on in situ measurement data in lake taihu the algorithms of c phyto and a ph 675 were then applied to modis satellite data to investigate the long term variation of c phyto and a ph 675 combined with temperature nutrient concentration and light an novel proxy of c phyto a ph 675 in the high turbid inland water was used to reveal the regulation of climate change and trophic state due to the biomass and physiology of phytoplankton in inland lake water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and in situ sampling strategy lake taihu is an extremely turbid eutrophic lake in china with a surface area of 2338 km2 and a mean water depth of 1 9 m fig 1 a algal blooms have been a major problem in the lake since the 1980s the most eutrophic region in lake taihu is meiliang bay mlb in fig 1a and zhushan bay zsb in fig 1a huang et al 2015 chl a concentration and algal density show clear seasonal patterns with higher values in summer fig 1b data from environmental monitoring center of wuxi city jiangsu province china field measurements from more than 23 cruises between 2003 and 2017 were conducted to develop and validate the nir red band ratio empirical algorithm of c phyto and the semi analytical algorithm of a ph sampling site is shown in fig 1a table 1 a detailed description of the in situ measurements of optical properties and water qualities was described in huang et al 2014 the collection and analyses technique of water samples are consistent with each sampling cruise briefly remote sensing reflectance r rs λ measurements were obtained using fieldspec spectroradiometer 350 1050 nm range with a sampling interval of 1 nm asd usa the optical properties including absorption of phytoplankton a ph λ tripton a d λ colored dissolved organic matter a g λ and total suspended matter a λ were measured by filtered and analyzed water samples via a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3600 with the quantitative filter technique cleveland and weidemann 1993 the concentrations of total suspended matter spm were measured by measuring the mass differences between the pre combusted 550 c for 4 h and dried 105 c for 4 h glass fiber filters gf f 0 7 μm before and after filtration of water samples chl a was extracted with ethanol 90 at 80 c for 6 h in darkness and then was analyzed using a spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 3600 the concentration of particulate organic carbon poc was obtained by carbon elemental analyzer toc l ssm 5000a shimadzu corporation parsons et al 1984 2 2 supplemental data collection the coupled data of poc and chl a in oceans 5284 eutrophic lakes 1084 lakes 712 coastal waters 936 and rivers 167 collected from a previous study huang et al 2018b were used to calibration the estimation method of c phyto the data of poc and chl a from algal culture 380 unpublished data for green scenedesmus obliquus and blue algae microcystis aeruginosa were also used in the model calibration of c phyto estimation the concentrations of total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn and temperature were measured by the environmental monitoring center of wuxi city jiangsu province china the weather data of temperature were downloaded from

level 0 images with 250 m spatial resolution from june 2002 to january 2017 with minimal or no cloud cover total of 1493 images fig 2 were chosen and download from the u s nasa goddard flight space center gsfc http oceancolor gsfc nasa gov seadas 7 3 was used to generate radiometric and geometric correction of modis aqua and output the satellite angles ozone and water vapor content as parameters of atmospheric correction the corresponding modis cloud mask products mod35 were used to perform the cloud masking the improved land target based atmospheric correction method guanter et al 2010 liu et al 2016a was chosen to derive the reflectance from the modis aqua data over lake taihu sampling site with 2 2 pixels over a 2 h time interval were used similar to cédric et al 2011 to evaluate the accuracy of atmospheric correction the rmsp between retrieved and measured r rs λ are 22 6 and 40 2 for r rs 645 and r rs 859 respectively the rmsp of r rs 859 r rs 645 is 29 6 the accuracy of atmospheric correction and its effect on the single band and band ratio algorithm were detailed discussed in our previous study huang et al 2017 2 5 ensemble empirical mode decomposition method eemd empirical mode decomposition emd is a method that decompose an original signal sequence x t into n components noted as intrinsic mode functions imf i i 1 2 n and a residue r according to local temporal and structural characteristics of original signal sequence huang et al 1998 2a x t i 0 n i m f i r however emd cannot overcome the interruption from the mixing mode signal leading to an overestimation of the noise in the signal wu and huang 2009 chen et al 2017 the ensemble emd eemd method was developed by wu and huang 2009 to decompose new time signal x j t which added numbers j it adopted as 1000 in this paper of gaussian white noise p j t into the original signal sequence x t to obtain the each imf i j and r j of x j t 2b x j t x t p j t j 1 2 3 1000 2c x j t i 0 n i m f i j r j the finally imf i and r are the mean value of imf i j and r j the detailed information and application can be found in our previous studies liu et al 2016b 2018 eemd has been widely used to extract the quasi periods of long term remote sensing data in previous studies liu et al 2018 pan et al 2018 3 model development calibration and validation 3 1 estimation of c phyto 3 1 1 estimation of c phyto from chl a the ability to measure phytoplankton organic carbon concentrations c phyto or differentiate it from other suspended particulate matter remains a challenge martínez vicente et al 2013 c phyto is also not easily distinguished from other types of carbon previous studies proposed that c phyto can be estimated well from particulate backscattering coefficient b bp and chlorophyll a behrenfeld et al 2005 sathyendranath et al 2009 martínez vicente et al 2013 thomalla et al 2017 however suspended particulate matter is the dominant contributor to b bp and thus b bp is proportional to the spm not to the c phyto in high turbid inland water such as taihu lake shi et al 2018 consequently in this study the estimation of c phyto from chl a based on the large dataset of chl a and poc is proposed sathyendranath et al 2009 thomalla et al 2017 for inland turbid water the coupled data of poc and chl a from lakes rivers coastal waters eutrophic lakes and algal cultures were used to determine the 1 quantile regression to represent the relationship between c phyto and chl a first the 1 quantile of poc for different chl a concentration representing the c phyto for each chl a was selected from total poc data then this data set include 324 samples coupled by poc and chl a was used to fit the 1 quantile regression see sathyendranath et al 2009 following equation is the 1 quantile regression function of the inland turbid water the black line in fig 3 3 c phyto 0 1424 c h l a 0 6589 r 2 0 95 n 324 this 1 quantile regression function was used to convert the in situ measured chl a to the c phyto the coupled data of poc and chl a from the ocean and the relationships derived by buck et al 1996 sathyendranath et al 2009 and thomalla et al 2017 are exhibited in fig 3 for comparison the comparison indicates that c phyto in turbid inland water will be slightly underestimated from chl a according to buck et al 1996 in all ranges of chl a and will be significantly underestimated according to thomalla et al 2017 in low chl a and according to sathyendranath et al 2009 in high chl a 3 1 2 calibration and validation of cphyto model for remote sensing data the c phyto retrieval algorithm relies on the relationship between estimated c phyto from chl a and r rs λ the nir and red modis bands wavelengths 859 nm and 645 nm which were proposed to estimate chl a in our previous studies huang et al 2014 shi et al 2015 were used to construct the c phyto estimation model fig 4 a the linear logarithmic first order kinetic equation with and without constant were used to model c phyto and nir red band ratio r rs 859 r rs 645 the first order kinetic equation with constant with highest determined coefficient r 2 0 69 lowest rmsp 52 98 and mape 46 15 33 81 was chosen as the retrieval algorithm of c phyto 4 c phyto 142 5985 1 exp 0 026359 r rs 859 r rs 645 0 12706 r 2 0 69 n 851 the validation result from independent data indicates that the rmsp mape and nrmse of the validation dataset were 26 37 32 49 19 28 and 11 77 respectively the estimated c phyto and retrieved c phyto show good agreement and a significant linear correlation r 0 73 p 0 005 n 231 fig 4b 3 2 a ph 675 estimation algorithm calibration and validation r rs λ can be related to the inherent optical properties through radiative transfer simulation and validated relationships eq 5a 5c have been proposed by lee and carder 1999 according to the band set of modis the total absorption coefficient of water constituents a 675 can be modeled by following equations 5a 5e via estimated a 645 5a a 645 1 u 645 u 645 b b 645 a w 645 5b u 645 0 084 0 084 2 4 0 17 r rs 645 1 2 2 0 17 5c r rs 645 r rs 645 0 52 1 7 r rs 645 where r rs 645 is the remote sensing reflectance just beneath the water surface at 645 nm a 645 is the total absorption coefficient of water constituents at 645 nm and b b 645 is total backscattering coefficient at 645 nm b b 645 can be expressed the sum of particulate b bp 645 and pure water b bw 645 backscattering coefficients 5d b b 645 b bp 645 b bw 645 a 0 r rs 859 a 1 b bw 645 5e a 675 1 5382 a 645 1 0972 r 2 0 97 n 736 where b bp 645 can be modeled by r rs 859 according to the previous studies suggesting that b bp λ has a high correlation to r rs at near infrared wavelengths in turbid water doron et al 2007 wang et al 2009a a 675 was modeled by a 645 according to the in situ measured absorption coefficient due to the no wavelenth of 675 nm in the modis bandset the model parameters a 1 and a 0 can be solved via the calibration dataset with the objective equation for optimal computation 6 f obj i 1 n a 675 measured a 675 modeled 2 n where a 1 and a 0 were optimally set as 22 204 and 0 883 respectively with the highest determined coefficient r 2 0 71 lowest rmsp 18 59 mape 13 92 12 36 and nrmse 7 82 of calibration data fig 5 a the estimated b bp 675 is significantly correlated to the spm along with the relationship of b bp 675 0 0284 spm 0 6336 r 2 0 57 p 0 005 n 851 fig 5b the total absorption coefficient of water constituents can be separated into three segments 7 a 675 a ph 675 a d 675 a g 675 a d λ and a g λ are the coefficients of non pigment particle matter and chromophoric dissolved organic matter and very low in near infrared wavelengths a ph λ is the dominant optical factor at 675 nm with the high mean value of a ph 675 a 675 75 85 17 08 thus a ph 675 is highly correlated to a 675 in eq 8 some data of a ph 675 is disabled due to the extremely low pigment of phytoplankton and high non pigment particle in winter thus the number of this dataset is minified in order to keep the consistency in the establishment of eq 5e and eq 8 the experiential estimation formula of a ph 675 from a 675 is 8 a ph 675 0 6679 a 675 1 0442 r 2 0 96 n 736 a ph 675 can be calculated via the experiential formula eq 8 and retieved a 675 which estimated from eqs 5a 5d the estimated a ph 675 presents a high correlation r 0 83 to the in situ measured a ph 675 with rmsp 40 80 mape 29 89 56 45 and nrmse 7 34 fig 6 a the validation results of a ph 675 and a 675 from independent data show a highly linear correlation r 0 83 between measured and estimated a 675 with rmsp 40 40 mape 21 52 25 26 and nrmse 9 68 as well as a ph 675 with the highly linear correlation r 0 85 n 233 rmsp 40 28 mape 31 99 30 51 and nrmse 12 49 fig 6b 4 results and discussion 4 1 reconstruction of c phyto and a ph 675 from modis the long term distribution of c phyto and a ph 675 extracted from modis derived r rs via the c phyto and a ph 675 retrieval algorithms suggests that c phyto and a ph 675 in meiliang bay and zhushan bay maintain a relatively higher level than in lake taihu fig 7 the high algal biomass caused by frequently algal blooms serious eutrophication in meiliang bay and zhushan bay huang et al 2013 is the primary driver for the appearance of high value of c phyto and a ph 675 c phyto and a ph 675 show fluctuations with a period of one year may include small scale time period see section 4 3 for the monthly mean value which is especially remarkable in meiliang bay and zhushan bay fig 7 the relatively high c phyto and a ph 675 values mainly occurred in the summer and low values appeared in winter this periodic fluctuation of c phyto and a ph 675 in lake taihu is much weaker than in meiliang bay and zhushan bay fig 7 shows a similar trend for c phyto and a ph 675 in lake taihu correlation coefficient between c phyto and a ph 675 r 0 94 meiliang bay r 0 98 and zhushan bay r 0 99 corresponding to previous studies bellacicco et al 2016 behrenfeld et al 2014a 2016 the annual means of c phyto and a ph 675 in lake taihu indicate an uptrend from 2002 to 2007 c phyto 2 13 2 44 mg l 1 a ph 675 1 06 to 1 27 m 1 and downtrend from 2007 to 2015 c phyto 2 44 to 1 21 mg l 1 a ph 675 1 27 to 0 51 m 1 and then a slight increase in 2016 c phyto 1 5 mg l 1 a ph 675 0 67 m 1 the trend of c phyto and a ph 675 during 2002 2011 is very similar to the distribution of algal blooms in previous study huang et al 2013 this time variation of c phyto and a ph 675 could also regulated by nutrients and climate change due to the high dependence of c phyto and a ph 675 to the algal growth huang et al 2013 additionally the warmer winter in 2007 also contributes the relative higher value of c phyto and a ph 675 than other years during the study period duan et al 2009 the mean values of each month computed after merging results from all years from 2002 to 2016 demonstrated that the highest monthly mean c phyto and a ph 675 were observed in august with average values of 4 5 1 3 mg l 1 and 3 17 1 4 m 1 respectively nearly 2 0 and 2 7 times higher than the lowest values of 2 2 0 5 mg l 1 and 1 1 0 3 m 1 respectively in january 4 2 analysis of reconstructed c phyto a ph 675 the modis derived long term c phyto a ph 675 presented in fig 8 shows a similarly fluctuating trend with c phyto and a ph 675 over a period of one year however the relatively high c phyto a ph 675 was primarily distributed in the winter and low values appeared in summer contrasting to the monthly distribution of c phyto correlation coefficient r between c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto r 0 92 0 85 and 0 91 for taihu lake meiliang bay and zhushan bay respectively and a ph 675 r 0 92 0 89 and 0 91 the climatological annual cycle fig 8 of c phyto a ph 675 was compared to the monthly distinction of c phyto and a ph 675 δc phyto and δa ph 675 which was calculated by following equation a ph 675 2 a ph 675 m 1 a ph 675 m0 a ph 675 m 1 a ph 675 m0 and c phyto 2 c phyto m 1 c phyto m0 c phyto m 1 c phyto m0 where a ph 675 m1 and c phyto m1 are a ph 675 and c phyto for one time point and a ph 675 m0 and c phyto m0 are the a ph 675 and c phyto one month earlier the decrease of δc phyto and δa ph 675 from autumn to spring corresponds to the decreases of a ph 675 and c phyto accumulation rate correspondently the increase of δc phyto and δa ph 675 from spring to autumn illustrates the accelerating accumulation of a ph 675 and c phyto the change of δa ph 675 is bigger than that of δc phyto amplitude of the blue line is higher than the green line which indicates that the consumption and amassing of a ph 675 is much stronger than c phyto this is consistent with the finding that chlorophyll is signally regulated by light and nutrient concentration through photoacclimation laws and bannister 1980 behrenfeld et al 2016 jakobsen and markager 2016 the deviation between δc phyto and δa ph 675 regulated by physiology significantly emerged in the variation of c phyto a ph 675 with r of 0 35 lake taihu 0 19 meiliang bay and 0 46 zhushan bay for δc phyto correlation coefficients r between c phyto a ph 675 and δc phyto and 0 38 lake taihu 0 23 meiliang bay and 0 47 zhushan bay for δa ph 675 correlation coefficients r between c phyto a ph 675 and δa ph 675 4 3 variation trends of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 the monthly mean values of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 merged results from the study duration 2002 2016 in the representative regions meiliang bay and zhushan bay exhibiting a monthly cycle of c phyto and a ph 675 with peak values occurring in summer july or august fig 9 the corresponding c phyto a ph 675 had a high value in winter and a low value in summer fig 9 this variation trend of c phyto a ph 675 is contrary to previous studies in oceans behrenfeld et al 2016 jakobsen and markager 2016 where peak values of c phyto a ph 675 consistently occurred in summer however this agrees with findings that c phyto a ph 675 is negatively correlated to the concentration of c phyto and chlorophyll a behrenfeld et al 2005 bellacicco et al 2016 the physiological mechanism and laboratory cultures of algae suggest that low light and high nutrient concentrations cause low c phyto a ph 675 and high light and low nutrient concentrations lead to high c phyto a ph 675 behrenfeld et al 2002 halsey and jones 2015 jakobsen and markager 2016 however the relationships between c phyto a ph 675 nutrient concentration and light are much more complex than summarized above behrenfeld et al 2016 high biomass or high productivity especially during algal blooms which are extremely serious in summer in lake taihu huang et al 2014 hu et al 2010 will significantly decrease c phyto a ph 675 for the faster growing cells need more chlorophyll to meet demands for photosynthesis behrenfeld et al 2016 considering the underestimation of a ph 675 compared to chlorophyll a due to the package effect c phyto a ph 675 in summer should be lower than presented in fig 9 thus the biomass driven decrease in c phyto a ph 675 is remarkable in a typical eutrophic lake the monthly sequence data of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 were decomposed into six imfs and residue by eemd method fig 10 and table 2 the variance contributions vc of imf4 to imf6 were very small table 2 and thus were not analyzed in the following content the seasonal periods imf1 3 0 0 16 months of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 in taihu lake meilaing bay and zhushan bay are evident which variance contributions are bigger than 20 9 the seasonal periods of c phyto a ph 675 in meiliang bay and zhushan bay is the most significant with the variance contributions of 35 6 and 39 9 respectively the imf2 7 8 0 78 months of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 in meilaing bay and zhushan bay are approximately two months longer than that in taihu lake 6 0 0 17 months the variance contributions of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 in meilaing bay and zhushan bay are bigger than 20 5 much more significant than that in taihu lake vc smaller than 10 8 this relative longer duration and higher variance contributions of imf2 in meilaing bay and zhushan bay are mainly due to the more suitable habitat of algal growth due to much more sufficient nutrients and stable hydrodynamic conditions in the bay duan et al 2009 hu et al 2010 huang et al 2014 the interannual period 12 5 0 79 months of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 in taihu lake meilaing bay and zhushan bay are not very distinct vc smaller than 11 3 except the c phyto a ph 675 in meilaing bay vc is 24 9 the high variance contributions of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 in taihu lake vc are 43 4 45 8 and 42 6 suggests that quasi periods of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 were dominated by long term trends the long term decrease trends of c phyto and a ph 675 indicate the downward trend of phytoplankton in taihu lake contrary c phyto a ph 675 presents a long term increase trends in taihu lake the relatively low variance contributions of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 in meilaing bay and zhushan bay manifest that seasonal semiannual and interannual period are the dominant trends but not the long term trend the light conditions in lake taihu were similar to those reported by jakobsen and markager 2016 high light is distributed in summer and low light occurs in winter the nutrients total phosphorus and nitrogen tp and tn were selected to investigate the variation of c phyto a ph 675 for the apparent relationship between them the monthly mean values of tp and tn compared with c phyto a ph 675 manifest that low nutrients in winter correspond to high c phyto a ph 675 which is particularly significant in zhushan bay fig 11 agreeing with results in coastal and ocean waters jakobsen and markager 2016 the tp and tn in meiliang bay mean values standard deviation during 2000 2011 0 11 0 02 mg l 1 and 3 6 1 3 mg l 1 were lower than in zhushan bay 0 14 0 02 mg l 1 and 4 6 0 4 mg l 1 supporting the higher c phyto a ph 675 2 6 0 2 in meiliang bay compared to zhushan bay 1 7 0 1 faster growing of algae during algal blooms will significantly drop c phyto a ph 675 in eutrophic lakes lake taihu which was observed in laboratory cultures of a photoacclimation experiment behrenfeld et al 2016 4 4 regulation of nutrients and meteorological factors the time series of nutrients tp and tn and meteorological factors temperature mean relative humidity insolation duration windspeed and precipitation were compared to c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 to reveal the responses of phytoplankton biomass and physiology to nutrients and meteorological factors a significantly positive correlation was found between phytoplankton biomass c phyto and a ph 675 and tp similar to a previous study jakobsen and markager 2016 c phyto a ph 675 was negatively correlated to tp tn precipitation and insolation duration have a slightly impact on c phyto r 0 19 0 25 and 0 34 for tn and insolation duration a ph 675 r 0 17 0 21 and 0 24 and c phyto a ph 675 r 0 20 0 19 and 0 25 temperature has a significant positive effect on c phyto and a ph 675 especially in meiliang bay r 0 43 p 0 005 and r 0 52 p 0 005 for a ph 675 and c phyto respectively and zhushan bay r 0 66 p 0 005 and r 0 69 p 0 001 the mean relative humidity and windspeed almost has no correlation to c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 according to the correlation analysis r 0 15 4 4 1 nutrients phosphorus the positive relationship between c phyto and chl a and tp suggests that nutrients accelerate the growth of phytoplankton biomass through the synthesis of chlorophyll for photosynthesis in lake taihu laws 2013 fig 12 a c the power function relationships p restricted function of algal growth smith 1982 2006 guildford and hecky 2000 between c phyto chl a and tp assert that p restricted algal growth increase of c phyto and chl a will very significantly when tp smaller than 0 1 mg l 1 and will wear off with the increase of tp the power exponent of the regression function for a ph 675 is bigger than for c phyto fig 12a f 0 44 vs 0 34 in lake taihu 0 40 vs 0 23 in meiliang bay 0 37 vs 0 27 in zhushan bay the lower power exponent of c phyto indicates that c phyto is much more sensitive to tp the growth rate of c phyto is bigger than a ph 675 with the increase of tp under low level phosphorus loading usually occurs in spring and winter in fig 11 leading to relatively high c phyto a ph 675 this phytoplankton physiology caused a negative relationship between c phyto a ph 675 and tp fig 12d f this negative relationship was also observed in coastal water fig 7 in jakobsen and markager 2016 the regulation of phosphorus to c phyto and c phyto a ph 675 in lake taihu is much more distinct than in meiliang bay and zhushan bay fig 12 relating to the spatial and temporal variation of nutrient limitation huang et al 2015 the best fit formula of c phyto c phyto a ph 675 and tp was found in lake taihu and can be expressed as c phyto 2 5 tp0 44 r 2 0 41 n 174 and c phyto a ph 675 0 29 ln tp 1 45 r 2 0 46 n 174 respectively fig 12g i the regulation of nutrients to c phyto and c phyto a ph 675 probably means that nutrients can be treated as an indicator of c phyto and c phyto a ph 675 when nutrients are limited thus the decrease of c phyto a ph 675 caused by limited nutrients in lake taihu is significant but is weaken in the bay with sufficient nutrient 4 4 2 climate warming temperature temperature is a critical ecological factor impacting the growth of phytoplankton and regulating c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 for the temperature correlated asynchronous variation in chlorophyll and c phyto productivity behrenfeld 2014 our results suggest that warming temperature increase could increase a ph 675 and c phyto productivity linearly particularly in zhushan bay and meiliang bay when there are sufficient nutrients fig 13 a f however the promoting effect of temperature on c phyto is stronger than on a ph 675 in meiliang bay and zhushan bay 0 038 vs 0 016 in meiliang bay 0 079 vs 0 065 in zhushan bay the high correlation between c phyto and temperature in zhushan bay was observed to be c phyto 0 079 t 1 85 r 2 0 48 n 174 fig 13c also for a ph 675 and temperature with a ph 675 0 065 t 0 85 r 2 0 43 n 174 fig 13f nevertheless warming temperature increase significantly reduced c phyto a ph 675 in zhushan bay with the relationship c phyto a ph 675 0 014 t 1 946 r 2 0 43 n 174 fig 13i the initial blooming date and duration of algal blooms in lake taihu are directly dependent on the temperature duan et al 2009 and are strongly regulated by warming geider 1987 however the temperature driven decrease of c phyto a ph 675 has still been challenged by recent satellite and in situ studies behrenfeld et al 2005 2013 2014b wang et al 2009b jakobsen and markager 2016 thomas et al 2017 5 conclusions and prospects the empirical and semi analytical remote sensing estimation of c phyto and a ph 675 from modis was conducted based on satellite derived remote sensing reflectance and in situ data the validated model proposed in this study exhibited robust performance for reconstruction of c phyto and a ph 675 with mape of 32 49 19 28 and 31 99 30 51 respectively long term variation of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 were generated from modis satellite images gathered from 2002 to 2016 significant climatologic annual fluctuations of c phyto a ph 675 and c phyto a ph 675 were observed based on long term monitoring c phyto and a ph 675 values in the summer were significantly higher than those recorded in other seasons c phyto a ph 675 presented an opposite trend to c phyto and a ph 675 with a low value in summer nutrients and temperature promote the growth of algae and then increases in c phyto and a ph 675 however a ph 675 is much more sensitive to nutrient concentration than c phyto which in order to get more pigment prepared for photosynthetic carbon production and then lead low c phyto a ph 675 the biomass driven variation of c phyto a ph 675 is much stronger than nutrient and light driven variation in such a typical seriously eutrophic lake acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos

19014,in this study a manganese iv oxide mediator mno2 mediator system for the abatement of sulfonamide antibiotics was evaluated two simple model humic constituents syringaldehyde sa and acetosyringone as could promote the transformation of sulfonamides at ph 5 8 two additional potential mediators tannic acid and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts had negligible enhancement on the transformation of sulfonamides by mno2 the enhancing effect was attributed to the reaction of the oxidized mediator i e phenoxy radical or benzoquinone like compounds produced from the oxidation of the mediators by mno2 with smx thereby cross coupling products from sulfamethoxazole smx with oxidized sa were formed in the mno2 sa system which was confirmed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry coexisting metal ions i e ca ii mg ii and mn ii showed inhibitory effects in the order of mn ii ca ii mg ii for repetitive runs of the mno2 sa smx system mno2 lost its oxidative capacity due to the sorption of mn ii on the reactive sites of the mno2 surface a full regeneration of partially deactivated mno2 by oxidation of the sorbed mn ii with mn vii could be achieved graphical abstract image 1 keywords manganese oxide mno2 sulfonamide antibiotics mediators cross coupling metal ions regeneration 1 introduction sulfonamide antibiotics consisting of synthetic sulfanilamide derivatives are widely used in both human medicine and livestock production mellon et al 2001 they include compounds such as sulfamethoxazole sulfacetamide sulfadoxine sulfadiazine sulfamethizole sulfasalazine sulfanilamide and sulfisoxazole mellon et al 2001 garoma et al 2010 the antibiotic effect is based on i a delay of the regeneration of bacterial cells and ii prevention of cell growth via inhibition of the formation of folic acid craig and stitzel 2004 sulfonamide antibiotics have already been identified in soils and aquatic environments where they are emitted via several pathways kümmerer 2003 miao et al 2004 treating fields with manure from treated animals is a major pathway of sulfonamide antibiotics entering soils kümmerer 2003 sulfonamides in soils are introduced into groundwater or surface water via infiltration or runoff respectively in addition sulfonamides from domestic and hospital applications are discharged into municipal wastewater gao and pedersen 2005 it has been reported previously that sulfonamides are not readily biodegradable ingerslev and halling sørensen 2000 hence chemical oxidation processes such as ozonation huber et al 2005 chlorination dodd and huang 2004 and chloramination chamberlain and adams 2006 are promising for the transformation of sulfonamides furthermore it has been demonstrated that the relative antimicrobial potency of sulfamethoxazole decreases proportionally with its relative residual concentration for oxidation with ozone and hydroxyl radical dodd et al 2009 this demonstrates that oxidation processes are promising options for the treatment of this class of antibiotics manganese oxides mno2 are abundant natural oxidants in sediments and soils and can affect the transformation of organic pollutants through direct oxidation adsorption and surface catalysis stone 1987 wang et al 1999 recently mno2 has been suggested as a passive barrier against micropollutants during recharge of stormwaters grebel et al 2016 charbonnet et al 2018 it is well documented that mno2 can oxidize phenols and anilines stone 1987 laha and luthy 1990 ukrainczyk and mcbride 1993 furthermore it has been shown that various types of antimicrobial agents such as fluoroquinolone tetracyclines and phenols can be transformed by mno2 zhang and huang 2005 zhang et al 2008 forrez et al 2011 the following general reaction mechanism has been proposed i precursor complex formation on the mno2 surface ii electron transfer from the target compound to mno2 and iii release of the reaction products including the organic transformation products and partially mn ii zhang and huang 2005 zhang et al 2008 a previous study gao et al 2012 reported that a transformation of sulfamethazine smz by mno2 occurred at acidic ph 4 5 and 5 6 while no transformation was observed at higher ph i e ph 6 3 and 7 6 due to the decreasing reduction potential of mno2 depending on the reactive surface sites on the mno2 surface with increasing ph zhang et al 2008 therefore strategies for an enhanced transformation of sulfonamides by mno2 over a wide ph range need to be developed in a previous study it has been demonstrated that the transformation of chloroanilines by birnessite was considerably enhanced by adding phenolic humic constituents at ph 5 6 phenolic humic constituents in natural organic matter are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment containing numerous moieties such as syringaldehyde acetosyringone ferulic acid and protocatechuic acid park et al 1999 the mechanism of the mediated transformation of chloroanilines involves two stages i free radicals including phenoxy and aniline radicals are produced from the oxidation of the phenolic humic constituents and the target compounds i e chloroanilines respectively by mno2 ii cross coupling reactions including radical radical coupling between different oxidation products or nucleophilic addition to aromatic amines occur resulting in the formation of quinones dimers and polymeric oxidation products stone 1987 dec et al 2001 wang et al 2002 thorn and kennedy 2002 similarly an enhanced transformation of sulfonamides by laccase in the presence of several mediators such as syringaldehyde sa acetosyringone as and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid diammonium abts with the formation of cross coupling products from the free radicals and amine moieties has been reported margot et al 2015 and the toxicity of product mixtures was found to be lower than for untreated sulfonamides margot et al 2015 based on this information the present study examines the feasibility of model humic constituents i e sa as tannic acid or synthetic electron shuttles i e abts to enhance the transformation of smx which is normally not abated by mno2 in mno2 mediator systems sa as and tannic acid were selected as natural mediators which were classified as common natural organic matter constituents in aquatic environments park et al 1999 abts was the most commonly used synthetic electron shuttle which can be oxidized forming the abts radical song et al 2015 the potential of mno2 mediated transformations of other selected sulfonamides including smz sulfamethizole smzo sulfathiazole stz sulfapyridine spd and sulfadiazine sdz was also investigated transformation products of smx in the mno2 sa system were identified and a reaction mechanism is proposed furthermore influencing factors such as mediator concentrations ph and metal ions e g ca ii mg ii and mn ii on smx transformation in mno2 mediator systems were investigated since permanganate mn vii reacts rapidly with mn ii van benschoten et al 1992 song et al 2017 mn vii was tested as a regeneration agent to recover the oxidizing capacity of mno2 in this study finally the potential of the application of mno2 mediator systems for the treatment of sulfonamides in a wastewater effluent was assessed 2

borate buffer 10 mm and stored at 4 c 2 2 mno2 preparation mno2 was prepared by the method of murray 1974 by the stoichiometric reaction between potassium permanganate mn vii and manganese ii chloride mncl2 the permanganate stock solution ca 0 24 m in ultrapurified water was diluted and then standardized spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 525 nm ε 2500 m 1 cm 1 song et al 2015 to synthesize mno2 suspensions permanganate and sodium hydroxide naoh were added to nitrogen purged ultrapurified water followed by a dropwise addition of a solution of mncl2 under constant stirring the formed mno2 was settled and the supernatant was replaced with ultrapurified water several times until the conductivity of the supernatant was less than 2 μs cm the mno2 suspensions were characterized by determination of the total manganese concentration after dissolution by ascorbic acid by i an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes and ii the 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid diammonium abts spectrophotometric method jiang et al 2012 the mno2 suspensions were stored in the dark at 4 c until use within a week 2 3 reaction kinetics all the experiments were performed for ph values of 5 6 7 and 8 at 25 1 c sodium acetate and sodium borate buffers 10 mm were used for ph 5 6 and ph 7 8 respectively the mno2 stock slurry was kept stirring before use to obtain a homogeneous mno2 suspensions sample reactions were initiated by spiking a certain volume of a mno2 stock slurry into ph buffered solutions containing one selected sulfonamide and a mediator at desired concentrations mno2 was dosed in excess of sulfonamides to warrant pseudo first order conditions at specific time intervals samples were collected and quenched by dosing 10 μl 0 5 m ascorbic acid to measure the concentration of sulfonamides by high performance liquid chromatography hplc with uv detection further experiments were performed to examine the effects of metal ions i e ca ii mg ii and mn ii on transformation of smx in mno2 mediator system following the same procedure as described above 2 4 mno2 regeneration the partially deactivated mno2 with adsorbed mn ii was regenerated as follows the spent mno2 particles were separated by centrifugation and washed with ultrapurified water after an additional centrifugation step of the mno2 suspension the supernatant was decanted and replaced with an aqueous mn vii solution to regenerate mno2 finally the regenerated mno2 was recovered by centrifugation and then washed with ultrapurified water several times 2 5 analytical methods selected sulfonamides and dom model moieties were determined using a hplc dionex ultimate 3000 equipped with a uv detector see detailed information in table s1 to

detailed information on the applied analytical methods is presented in text s2 with method detection limits relative standard deviations and measuring ranges 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of the abatement of sulfonamides by mno2 in the presence of various mediators the effect of mediators i e sa as tannic acid and abts on the transformation of sulfamethoxazole smx in a mno2 mediator system was examined fig 1 a shows that smx reacts very slowly with mno2 at ph 7 in the absence of mediators when the initial smx and mno2 concentrations were 6 μm and 120 μm respectively no significant enhancement effect on smx abatement was observed in the mno2 tannic acid or the mno2 abts systems in another study abts could promote the transformation of smx in the presence of laccase which was attributed to the formation of abts2 rather than abts from the reaction between laccase and abts margot et al 2015 however we found that abts a green stable radical rather than abts2 was produced from the oxidation of abts by mno2 and abts reacted only slowly with smx in contrast the presence of sa and as significantly enhanced the abatement of smx by mno2 at ph 7 fig 1a and sa and as were rapidly consumed in these systems fig 1b a similar enhancement effect of sa was also observed for the abatement of the other selected sulfonamides i e smzo stz spd smz and sdz in presence of mno2 at ph 7 fig s1 fig 2 shows a schematic representation of the promoting effect of sa and as on the transformation of sulfonamides in presence of mno2 the suggested mechanism is similar to the previously investigated laccase sa and laccase as systems margot et al 2015 the rate of the abatement of sa as decreased with increasing reaction time and deviated from pseudo first order kinetics fig 1b this might be attributable to i the loss of active surface sites on mno2 by gradual accumulation of reaction products on the surface zhang and huang 2003 and ii the decreasing amount of sa as fig 1b this effect also leads to the gradual decrease of the rate of smx abatement in the mno2 sa as systems fig 1a 3 2 reaction mechanism for smx transformation in the mno2 sa system 3 2 1 transformation products transformation products of smx treated by mno2 in the presence of sa were detected using hplc esi qqqms in full scan mode table 2 fig s2a shows that two transformation products product id i and ii appear at retention times of 35 00 and 37 83 min respectively compared to the control ph buffered solution containing smx and sa without mno2 shown in fig s2b product iii at 30 81 min smx product iv at 28 15 min sa product i had molecular ions of m z 404 and 426 m h 404 and m na 426 fig s2c and it was proposed as a coupling product between 2 6 dimethoxy 1 4 benzoquinone dmbq and smx i e smx dmbq m z 403 based on a similar product identified in a laccase based system margot et al 2015 according to previous studies the molecular ions of product ii m z 319 and 341 m h 319 and m na 341 fig s2d was likely a dimeric product of sa i e sa sa m z 318 bialk et al 2005 ibrahim et al 2013 3 2 2 reaction mechanism based on the suggested products i e smx dmbq and sa sa formed during abatement of smx in the mno2 sa system a mno2 mediated oxidation model is proposed and shown in scheme s1 and the graphical abstract first mno2 oxidizes sa producing a sa radical i e the phenoxy radical sa followed by the formation of dmbq according to previous studies bialk et al 2005 margot et al 2015 1 mno2 sa sa dmbq the sa radical also reacts by a radical radical coupling reaction forming the sa sa coupling product eq 2 2 sa sa sa sa dmbq formed from the sa radical eq 1 can react as a nucleophile with amines wang et al 2002 the anilinic nitrogen of smx participates in a nucleophilic addition to the quinone group in dmbq leading to the formation of the unprotonated imine quinone thorn et al 1996 eq 3 3 dmbq smx smx dmbq this mechanism is similar to laccase mediator and h2o2 peroxidase mediator systems bialk et al 2005 margot et al 2015 for the abatement of smx by mno2 sa mn iii could be formed from the reaction of mno2 with sa via a one electron transfer since the cross coupling reaction product smx dmbq was the final product which cannot be formed by reaction with mn iii it can be concluded that mn iii has little effect on the abatement of smx in addition the effect of the mediator i e sa on the transformation of sulfamethoxazole smx was tested with mn vii fig s3 shows no enhancement of the transformation of smx in the mn vii sa system this result may be attributed to the fact that no benzoquinone like compounds are formed during mn vii oxidation of humic constituents matsuda and schnitzer 1972 instead organic acids i e dicarboxylic benzenecarboxylic or phenolic acids are observed 3 3 influencing factors on the abatement efficiency of sulfonamides in the mno2 mediator system 3 3 1 effect of mediator concentration the promoting effect of sa at different concentrations 0 6 and 12 μm was evaluated by comparing the degree of abatement of smx under otherwise identical conditions fig 3 a d shows that the rate of the relative abatement of smx increases with increasing sa concentrations for the ph range 5 8 for example at ph 6 the extent of smx abatement at 60 min was roughly proportional to the sa concentration with 49 at 12 μm 27 at 6 μm and 4 at 0 μm respectively fig 3b for a given ph high initial concentrations of sa result in a fast formation of saox which in turn leads to a faster transformation of smx a similar concentration dependent enhancing effect was observed for as in a system containing mno2 and smx figs s4a d 3 3 2 effect of ph for 12 μm sa at 60 min the extent of smx abatement at different ph followed the order of ph 6 49 ph 7 29 ph 5 27 ph 8 14 fig 3a d the ph effect can be explained as follows the oxidation rate of sa by mno2 decreases with increasing ph fig s5a because mno2 is a stronger oxidant at lower ph according to a previous study dodd and huang 2004 sulfonamides exhibit two acid dissociation constants one involving deprotonation of the anilinium n and the other corresponding to the deprotonation of the sulfonamide nh the deprotonation of the latter leads to an anionic form of smx at higher ph values smx has a pk a2 of 5 6 lin et al 1997 and changes from a neutral to negatively charged species with increasing ph i e 5 8 the anionic smx species is considerably more reactive than the neutral species dodd and huang 2004 therefore smx becomes more reactive when the ph increases from 5 to 8 whereas the formation rate of dmbq became lower fig s5a these two factors could explain the maximum rate of smx abatement at ph 6 fig 3 in the mno2 as system the rate of as abatement decreased with increasing ph fig s5b and the order of the extent of smx abatement in the mno2 as system at different ph values was similar to the mno2 sa system figs s4a d 3 3 3 comparison of the extent of abatement of the various sulfonamides figs s6 s7 s8 s9 and s10 show the effect of sa on the abatement of smzo stz spd smz and sdz in the presence of mno2 in the ph range 5 8 the kinetics of the abatement of the various sulfonamides were compared by examining the extent of transformation at a certain reaction time and ph value for 12 μm sa and ph 6 at 30 min the extent of the abatement of various sulfonamides decreased in the order smx 38 stz 35 smz 30 smzo 28 spd 28 sdz 24 the order of the extents of abatement of smx stz smz and smzo at ph 6 was in reasonable agreement with the data of apparent second order rate constants for the reaction of sulfonamides with chlorine chamberlain and adams 2006 based on previous studies the reactive functional group in sulfonamides is the aniline moiety jenkins et al 1978 huber et al 2005 the differences in the extent of the abatement of various sulfonamides might be caused by i the effect of electron donating withdrawing of five six membered heterocyclic aromatic moiety on sulfonamides and ii the various pk a2 values of the selected sulfonamides ranging from 5 6 smx lin et al 1997 to 8 4 spd lo and hayton 1981 which are shown in table 1 anionic species of sulfonamides are more reactive than their neutral species huber et al 2005 chamberlain and adams 2006 in contrast to spd 99 6 neutral form smx is mainly present in its anionic form 72 however spd had higher extent of relative abatement than sdz 34 anionic form this might be due to the fact that the diazine moiety in sdz should have a stronger electron withdrawing effect than pyridine in spd rendering the latter more easily oxidizable similar effects could also explain the higher extent of the relative abatement of smz 3 anionic form than sdz 34 anionic form because the methazine moiety on smz has two methyl groups electron donating compared to the diazine moiety on sdz 3 3 4 effects of metal ions the effect of metal ions i e ca ii mg ii and mn ii on the transformation of smx in the mno2 sa system at ph 7 was examined fig 4 and figure s11 show that the smx abatement in the mno2 sa system is generally inhibited by metal ions compared to the relative abatement of smx after 240 min in absence of metals ca 40 the relative abatements were 18 14 31 24 30 and 8 for 10 mm ca ii 50 mm ca ii 10 mm mg ii 50 mm mg ii 10 μm mn ii and 50 μm mn ii respectively this result may be attributed to the inhibiting effect of metal ions on sa oxidation and eventually dmbq formation from the reaction of mno2 with sa for example the addition of ca ii could suppress the oxidation of sa by mno2 significantly fig s12 in a previous study it was reported that the oxidation efficiency of mno2 for organic compounds was inhibited by adsorption of metal ions on negatively charged reactive sites on the mno2 surface lin et al 2009b the inhibiting effect of metal ions varied with metal type and concentrations fig 4 and figure s11 higher metal concentrations led to higher inhibiting effects the inhibitory effect of the metal ions followed the order of mn ii ca ii mg ii which can be ascribed to their affinity to mno2 surfaces morgan and stumm 1964 murray 1975 lin et al 2009a 3 4 mno2 regeneration with permanganate experiments were conducted to test the long term oxidative performance of mno2 in four consecutive smx abatement experiments in the mno2 sa system 30 min at ph 7 its efficiency dropped gradually from 56 to 27 fig 5 a this can be ascribed to a progressively decreasing oxidation efficiency from 99 to 38 of sa by mno2 fig s13a as shown above mn ii which is formed during sa oxidation could partially inhibit the oxidation of sa by adsorption to the mno2 surface permanganate was chosen as a regenerating agent due to the fast oxidation of mn ii by mn vii and the concomitant regeneration of fresh mno2 on the surface song et al 2017 after regeneration the extent of abatement of smx remained at 50 for all four runs 30 min similar to the first run i e 54 fig 5b in addition sa was completely oxidized in each run fig s13b hence mn vii a non toxic and inexpensive regenerating agent can be applied to recover the oxidative capacity of mno2 3 5 mno2 mediator systems for wastewater treatment for wastewater treatment a mno2 mediator system may offer an option for the transformation of micropollutants such as sulfonamide antibiotics fig s14a shows that sa could also enhance the extent kinetics of smx during mno2 oxidation in eppww albeit the effect is significantly smaller than in synthetic water this result may be ascribed to the fact that effluent organic matter may also consume the sa radical formed from the reaction between mno2 and sa resulting in a lower efficiency of the mno2 sa system in addition metal ions in eppww ca

19014,in this study a manganese iv oxide mediator mno2 mediator system for the abatement of sulfonamide antibiotics was evaluated two simple model humic constituents syringaldehyde sa and acetosyringone as could promote the transformation of sulfonamides at ph 5 8 two additional potential mediators tannic acid and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts had negligible enhancement on the transformation of sulfonamides by mno2 the enhancing effect was attributed to the reaction of the oxidized mediator i e phenoxy radical or benzoquinone like compounds produced from the oxidation of the mediators by mno2 with smx thereby cross coupling products from sulfamethoxazole smx with oxidized sa were formed in the mno2 sa system which was confirmed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry coexisting metal ions i e ca ii mg ii and mn ii showed inhibitory effects in the order of mn ii ca ii mg ii for repetitive runs of the mno2 sa smx system mno2 lost its oxidative capacity due to the sorption of mn ii on the reactive sites of the mno2 surface a full regeneration of partially deactivated mno2 by oxidation of the sorbed mn ii with mn vii could be achieved graphical abstract image 1 keywords manganese oxide mno2 sulfonamide antibiotics mediators cross coupling metal ions regeneration 1 introduction sulfonamide antibiotics consisting of synthetic sulfanilamide derivatives are widely used in both human medicine and livestock production mellon et al 2001 they include compounds such as sulfamethoxazole sulfacetamide sulfadoxine sulfadiazine sulfamethizole sulfasalazine sulfanilamide and sulfisoxazole mellon et al 2001 garoma et al 2010 the antibiotic effect is based on i a delay of the regeneration of bacterial cells and ii prevention of cell growth via inhibition of the formation of folic acid craig and stitzel 2004 sulfonamide antibiotics have already been identified in soils and aquatic environments where they are emitted via several pathways kümmerer 2003 miao et al 2004 treating fields with manure from treated animals is a major pathway of sulfonamide antibiotics entering soils kümmerer 2003 sulfonamides in soils are introduced into groundwater or surface water via infiltration or runoff respectively in addition sulfonamides from domestic and hospital applications are discharged into municipal wastewater gao and pedersen 2005 it has been reported previously that sulfonamides are not readily biodegradable ingerslev and halling sørensen 2000 hence chemical oxidation processes such as ozonation huber et al 2005 chlorination dodd and huang 2004 and chloramination chamberlain and adams 2006 are promising for the transformation of sulfonamides furthermore it has been demonstrated that the relative antimicrobial potency of sulfamethoxazole decreases proportionally with its relative residual concentration for oxidation with ozone and hydroxyl radical dodd et al 2009 this demonstrates that oxidation processes are promising options for the treatment of this class of antibiotics manganese oxides mno2 are abundant natural oxidants in sediments and soils and can affect the transformation of organic pollutants through direct oxidation adsorption and surface catalysis stone 1987 wang et al 1999 recently mno2 has been suggested as a passive barrier against micropollutants during recharge of stormwaters grebel et al 2016 charbonnet et al 2018 it is well documented that mno2 can oxidize phenols and anilines stone 1987 laha and luthy 1990 ukrainczyk and mcbride 1993 furthermore it has been shown that various types of antimicrobial agents such as fluoroquinolone tetracyclines and phenols can be transformed by mno2 zhang and huang 2005 zhang et al 2008 forrez et al 2011 the following general reaction mechanism has been proposed i precursor complex formation on the mno2 surface ii electron transfer from the target compound to mno2 and iii release of the reaction products including the organic transformation products and partially mn ii zhang and huang 2005 zhang et al 2008 a previous study gao et al 2012 reported that a transformation of sulfamethazine smz by mno2 occurred at acidic ph 4 5 and 5 6 while no transformation was observed at higher ph i e ph 6 3 and 7 6 due to the decreasing reduction potential of mno2 depending on the reactive surface sites on the mno2 surface with increasing ph zhang et al 2008 therefore strategies for an enhanced transformation of sulfonamides by mno2 over a wide ph range need to be developed in a previous study it has been demonstrated that the transformation of chloroanilines by birnessite was considerably enhanced by adding phenolic humic constituents at ph 5 6 phenolic humic constituents in natural organic matter are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment containing numerous moieties such as syringaldehyde acetosyringone ferulic acid and protocatechuic acid park et al 1999 the mechanism of the mediated transformation of chloroanilines involves two stages i free radicals including phenoxy and aniline radicals are produced from the oxidation of the phenolic humic constituents and the target compounds i e chloroanilines respectively by mno2 ii cross coupling reactions including radical radical coupling between different oxidation products or nucleophilic addition to aromatic amines occur resulting in the formation of quinones dimers and polymeric oxidation products stone 1987 dec et al 2001 wang et al 2002 thorn and kennedy 2002 similarly an enhanced transformation of sulfonamides by laccase in the presence of several mediators such as syringaldehyde sa acetosyringone as and 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid diammonium abts with the formation of cross coupling products from the free radicals and amine moieties has been reported margot et al 2015 and the toxicity of product mixtures was found to be lower than for untreated sulfonamides margot et al 2015 based on this information the present study examines the feasibility of model humic constituents i e sa as tannic acid or synthetic electron shuttles i e abts to enhance the transformation of smx which is normally not abated by mno2 in mno2 mediator systems sa as and tannic acid were selected as natural mediators which were classified as common natural organic matter constituents in aquatic environments park et al 1999 abts was the most commonly used synthetic electron shuttle which can be oxidized forming the abts radical song et al 2015 the potential of mno2 mediated transformations of other selected sulfonamides including smz sulfamethizole smzo sulfathiazole stz sulfapyridine spd and sulfadiazine sdz was also investigated transformation products of smx in the mno2 sa system were identified and a reaction mechanism is proposed furthermore influencing factors such as mediator concentrations ph and metal ions e g ca ii mg ii and mn ii on smx transformation in mno2 mediator systems were investigated since permanganate mn vii reacts rapidly with mn ii van benschoten et al 1992 song et al 2017 mn vii was tested as a regeneration agent to recover the oxidizing capacity of mno2 in this study finally the potential of the application of mno2 mediator systems for the treatment of sulfonamides in a wastewater effluent was assessed 2

borate buffer 10 mm and stored at 4 c 2 2 mno2 preparation mno2 was prepared by the method of murray 1974 by the stoichiometric reaction between potassium permanganate mn vii and manganese ii chloride mncl2 the permanganate stock solution ca 0 24 m in ultrapurified water was diluted and then standardized spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 525 nm ε 2500 m 1 cm 1 song et al 2015 to synthesize mno2 suspensions permanganate and sodium hydroxide naoh were added to nitrogen purged ultrapurified water followed by a dropwise addition of a solution of mncl2 under constant stirring the formed mno2 was settled and the supernatant was replaced with ultrapurified water several times until the conductivity of the supernatant was less than 2 μs cm the mno2 suspensions were characterized by determination of the total manganese concentration after dissolution by ascorbic acid by i an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes and ii the 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid diammonium abts spectrophotometric method jiang et al 2012 the mno2 suspensions were stored in the dark at 4 c until use within a week 2 3 reaction kinetics all the experiments were performed for ph values of 5 6 7 and 8 at 25 1 c sodium acetate and sodium borate buffers 10 mm were used for ph 5 6 and ph 7 8 respectively the mno2 stock slurry was kept stirring before use to obtain a homogeneous mno2 suspensions sample reactions were initiated by spiking a certain volume of a mno2 stock slurry into ph buffered solutions containing one selected sulfonamide and a mediator at desired concentrations mno2 was dosed in excess of sulfonamides to warrant pseudo first order conditions at specific time intervals samples were collected and quenched by dosing 10 μl 0 5 m ascorbic acid to measure the concentration of sulfonamides by high performance liquid chromatography hplc with uv detection further experiments were performed to examine the effects of metal ions i e ca ii mg ii and mn ii on transformation of smx in mno2 mediator system following the same procedure as described above 2 4 mno2 regeneration the partially deactivated mno2 with adsorbed mn ii was regenerated as follows the spent mno2 particles were separated by centrifugation and washed with ultrapurified water after an additional centrifugation step of the mno2 suspension the supernatant was decanted and replaced with an aqueous mn vii solution to regenerate mno2 finally the regenerated mno2 was recovered by centrifugation and then washed with ultrapurified water several times 2 5 analytical methods selected sulfonamides and dom model moieties were determined using a hplc dionex ultimate 3000 equipped with a uv detector see detailed information in table s1 to

detailed information on the applied analytical methods is presented in text s2 with method detection limits relative standard deviations and measuring ranges 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of the abatement of sulfonamides by mno2 in the presence of various mediators the effect of mediators i e sa as tannic acid and abts on the transformation of sulfamethoxazole smx in a mno2 mediator system was examined fig 1 a shows that smx reacts very slowly with mno2 at ph 7 in the absence of mediators when the initial smx and mno2 concentrations were 6 μm and 120 μm respectively no significant enhancement effect on smx abatement was observed in the mno2 tannic acid or the mno2 abts systems in another study abts could promote the transformation of smx in the presence of laccase which was attributed to the formation of abts2 rather than abts from the reaction between laccase and abts margot et al 2015 however we found that abts a green stable radical rather than abts2 was produced from the oxidation of abts by mno2 and abts reacted only slowly with smx in contrast the presence of sa and as significantly enhanced the abatement of smx by mno2 at ph 7 fig 1a and sa and as were rapidly consumed in these systems fig 1b a similar enhancement effect of sa was also observed for the abatement of the other selected sulfonamides i e smzo stz spd smz and sdz in presence of mno2 at ph 7 fig s1 fig 2 shows a schematic representation of the promoting effect of sa and as on the transformation of sulfonamides in presence of mno2 the suggested mechanism is similar to the previously investigated laccase sa and laccase as systems margot et al 2015 the rate of the abatement of sa as decreased with increasing reaction time and deviated from pseudo first order kinetics fig 1b this might be attributable to i the loss of active surface sites on mno2 by gradual accumulation of reaction products on the surface zhang and huang 2003 and ii the decreasing amount of sa as fig 1b this effect also leads to the gradual decrease of the rate of smx abatement in the mno2 sa as systems fig 1a 3 2 reaction mechanism for smx transformation in the mno2 sa system 3 2 1 transformation products transformation products of smx treated by mno2 in the presence of sa were detected using hplc esi qqqms in full scan mode table 2 fig s2a shows that two transformation products product id i and ii appear at retention times of 35 00 and 37 83 min respectively compared to the control ph buffered solution containing smx and sa without mno2 shown in fig s2b product iii at 30 81 min smx product iv at 28 15 min sa product i had molecular ions of m z 404 and 426 m h 404 and m na 426 fig s2c and it was proposed as a coupling product between 2 6 dimethoxy 1 4 benzoquinone dmbq and smx i e smx dmbq m z 403 based on a similar product identified in a laccase based system margot et al 2015 according to previous studies the molecular ions of product ii m z 319 and 341 m h 319 and m na 341 fig s2d was likely a dimeric product of sa i e sa sa m z 318 bialk et al 2005 ibrahim et al 2013 3 2 2 reaction mechanism based on the suggested products i e smx dmbq and sa sa formed during abatement of smx in the mno2 sa system a mno2 mediated oxidation model is proposed and shown in scheme s1 and the graphical abstract first mno2 oxidizes sa producing a sa radical i e the phenoxy radical sa followed by the formation of dmbq according to previous studies bialk et al 2005 margot et al 2015 1 mno2 sa sa dmbq the sa radical also reacts by a radical radical coupling reaction forming the sa sa coupling product eq 2 2 sa sa sa sa dmbq formed from the sa radical eq 1 can react as a nucleophile with amines wang et al 2002 the anilinic nitrogen of smx participates in a nucleophilic addition to the quinone group in dmbq leading to the formation of the unprotonated imine quinone thorn et al 1996 eq 3 3 dmbq smx smx dmbq this mechanism is similar to laccase mediator and h2o2 peroxidase mediator systems bialk et al 2005 margot et al 2015 for the abatement of smx by mno2 sa mn iii could be formed from the reaction of mno2 with sa via a one electron transfer since the cross coupling reaction product smx dmbq was the final product which cannot be formed by reaction with mn iii it can be concluded that mn iii has little effect on the abatement of smx in addition the effect of the mediator i e sa on the transformation of sulfamethoxazole smx was tested with mn vii fig s3 shows no enhancement of the transformation of smx in the mn vii sa system this result may be attributed to the fact that no benzoquinone like compounds are formed during mn vii oxidation of humic constituents matsuda and schnitzer 1972 instead organic acids i e dicarboxylic benzenecarboxylic or phenolic acids are observed 3 3 influencing factors on the abatement efficiency of sulfonamides in the mno2 mediator system 3 3 1 effect of mediator concentration the promoting effect of sa at different concentrations 0 6 and 12 μm was evaluated by comparing the degree of abatement of smx under otherwise identical conditions fig 3 a d shows that the rate of the relative abatement of smx increases with increasing sa concentrations for the ph range 5 8 for example at ph 6 the extent of smx abatement at 60 min was roughly proportional to the sa concentration with 49 at 12 μm 27 at 6 μm and 4 at 0 μm respectively fig 3b for a given ph high initial concentrations of sa result in a fast formation of saox which in turn leads to a faster transformation of smx a similar concentration dependent enhancing effect was observed for as in a system containing mno2 and smx figs s4a d 3 3 2 effect of ph for 12 μm sa at 60 min the extent of smx abatement at different ph followed the order of ph 6 49 ph 7 29 ph 5 27 ph 8 14 fig 3a d the ph effect can be explained as follows the oxidation rate of sa by mno2 decreases with increasing ph fig s5a because mno2 is a stronger oxidant at lower ph according to a previous study dodd and huang 2004 sulfonamides exhibit two acid dissociation constants one involving deprotonation of the anilinium n and the other corresponding to the deprotonation of the sulfonamide nh the deprotonation of the latter leads to an anionic form of smx at higher ph values smx has a pk a2 of 5 6 lin et al 1997 and changes from a neutral to negatively charged species with increasing ph i e 5 8 the anionic smx species is considerably more reactive than the neutral species dodd and huang 2004 therefore smx becomes more reactive when the ph increases from 5 to 8 whereas the formation rate of dmbq became lower fig s5a these two factors could explain the maximum rate of smx abatement at ph 6 fig 3 in the mno2 as system the rate of as abatement decreased with increasing ph fig s5b and the order of the extent of smx abatement in the mno2 as system at different ph values was similar to the mno2 sa system figs s4a d 3 3 3 comparison of the extent of abatement of the various sulfonamides figs s6 s7 s8 s9 and s10 show the effect of sa on the abatement of smzo stz spd smz and sdz in the presence of mno2 in the ph range 5 8 the kinetics of the abatement of the various sulfonamides were compared by examining the extent of transformation at a certain reaction time and ph value for 12 μm sa and ph 6 at 30 min the extent of the abatement of various sulfonamides decreased in the order smx 38 stz 35 smz 30 smzo 28 spd 28 sdz 24 the order of the extents of abatement of smx stz smz and smzo at ph 6 was in reasonable agreement with the data of apparent second order rate constants for the reaction of sulfonamides with chlorine chamberlain and adams 2006 based on previous studies the reactive functional group in sulfonamides is the aniline moiety jenkins et al 1978 huber et al 2005 the differences in the extent of the abatement of various sulfonamides might be caused by i the effect of electron donating withdrawing of five six membered heterocyclic aromatic moiety on sulfonamides and ii the various pk a2 values of the selected sulfonamides ranging from 5 6 smx lin et al 1997 to 8 4 spd lo and hayton 1981 which are shown in table 1 anionic species of sulfonamides are more reactive than their neutral species huber et al 2005 chamberlain and adams 2006 in contrast to spd 99 6 neutral form smx is mainly present in its anionic form 72 however spd had higher extent of relative abatement than sdz 34 anionic form this might be due to the fact that the diazine moiety in sdz should have a stronger electron withdrawing effect than pyridine in spd rendering the latter more easily oxidizable similar effects could also explain the higher extent of the relative abatement of smz 3 anionic form than sdz 34 anionic form because the methazine moiety on smz has two methyl groups electron donating compared to the diazine moiety on sdz 3 3 4 effects of metal ions the effect of metal ions i e ca ii mg ii and mn ii on the transformation of smx in the mno2 sa system at ph 7 was examined fig 4 and figure s11 show that the smx abatement in the mno2 sa system is generally inhibited by metal ions compared to the relative abatement of smx after 240 min in absence of metals ca 40 the relative abatements were 18 14 31 24 30 and 8 for 10 mm ca ii 50 mm ca ii 10 mm mg ii 50 mm mg ii 10 μm mn ii and 50 μm mn ii respectively this result may be attributed to the inhibiting effect of metal ions on sa oxidation and eventually dmbq formation from the reaction of mno2 with sa for example the addition of ca ii could suppress the oxidation of sa by mno2 significantly fig s12 in a previous study it was reported that the oxidation efficiency of mno2 for organic compounds was inhibited by adsorption of metal ions on negatively charged reactive sites on the mno2 surface lin et al 2009b the inhibiting effect of metal ions varied with metal type and concentrations fig 4 and figure s11 higher metal concentrations led to higher inhibiting effects the inhibitory effect of the metal ions followed the order of mn ii ca ii mg ii which can be ascribed to their affinity to mno2 surfaces morgan and stumm 1964 murray 1975 lin et al 2009a 3 4 mno2 regeneration with permanganate experiments were conducted to test the long term oxidative performance of mno2 in four consecutive smx abatement experiments in the mno2 sa system 30 min at ph 7 its efficiency dropped gradually from 56 to 27 fig 5 a this can be ascribed to a progressively decreasing oxidation efficiency from 99 to 38 of sa by mno2 fig s13a as shown above mn ii which is formed during sa oxidation could partially inhibit the oxidation of sa by adsorption to the mno2 surface permanganate was chosen as a regenerating agent due to the fast oxidation of mn ii by mn vii and the concomitant regeneration of fresh mno2 on the surface song et al 2017 after regeneration the extent of abatement of smx remained at 50 for all four runs 30 min similar to the first run i e 54 fig 5b in addition sa was completely oxidized in each run fig s13b hence mn vii a non toxic and inexpensive regenerating agent can be applied to recover the oxidative capacity of mno2 3 5 mno2 mediator systems for wastewater treatment for wastewater treatment a mno2 mediator system may offer an option for the transformation of micropollutants such as sulfonamide antibiotics fig s14a shows that sa could also enhance the extent kinetics of smx during mno2 oxidation in eppww albeit the effect is significantly smaller than in synthetic water this result may be ascribed to the fact that effluent organic matter may also consume the sa radical formed from the reaction between mno2 and sa resulting in a lower efficiency of the mno2 sa system in addition metal ions in eppww ca ii 2 58 mm mg ii 0 79 mm mn ii 0 14 μm more water quality parameters are given in section 2 1 could inhibit the oxidation of sa in the mno2 sa system fig s14b which was discussed in detail in section 3 3 4 in a previous study the residual antibiotic activity during oxidative abatement of smx by ozone and hydroxyl radicals was related to the residual concentrations of the parent antibacterial smx dodd et al 2009 based on this study only slight changes in the molecular structure are necessary to lose the antibiotic activity hence it can be expected that the antibiotic activity in the mno2 sa system decreases proportionally with the residual smx concentration a previous study reported that an active filter bed consisting of mno2 loaded sand was feasible for treating water contaminated with arsenite iii driehaus et al 1995 also manganese oxides could be used as a geomedia amendment for the abatement of organic contaminants in engineered stormwater infiltration systems grebel et al 2016

agent for recovering the oxidation capacity of spent mno2 however in this case the regeneration effect was based on only mn ii oxidation in clean systems and it is unclear yet if it would also work for dom loaded mno2 4 conclusions reaction kinetics and products of mno2 mediated transformations of sulfonamides with model humic mediators were assessed in this study the following conclusions can be drawn mno2 mediated transformation of sulfonamides occurs in the presence of syringaldehyde sa and acetosyringone as while mno2 alone has only a limited effect on the transformation of these
