19555,microalgae biotechnology is a promising tool for many applications including the elimination of nutrients and other contaminants from wastewater in this work we measured the removal efficiency of two wastewater treatment processes an activated sludge based conventional process and another based on microalgae biotechnology using high rate algae ponds hraps the latter was tested using two different configurations in the first one hraps were placed after an uasb reactor and used as a tertiary treatment to remove nutrients in the second the uasb reactor was disconnected so the hraps were directly fed with pretreated wastewater additional treatment was performed using dissolved air flotation daf the performances of both configurations uasb hrap and hrap daf were compared to that of the conventional line including primary and secondary biological treatments and operating in parallel within the same wastewater treatment plant wwtp sixty four out of 81 target phacs were detected in the influent of the wwtp at an average concentration of 223 μg l 1 whereas 55 and 54 were measured in the conventional 14 μg l 1 and non conventional 17 μg l 1 effluents average removal efficiencies were similar 94 vs 92 for both treatment lines when comparing total phacs concentrations the compositional patterns of the resulting effluents however were not suggesting the occurrence of differential removal mechanisms depending on the chemicals and wastewater treatments considered highly consumed compounds such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen were predominant in the non conventional effluent 1 μg l 1 denoting lower removal than in the conventional line on the other hand elimination of diclofenac and some specific antibiotics and diuretics e g hydrochlorothiazide was between 15 and 50 higher using hraps overall the efficiency of the microalgae technology removing phacs was found to be comparable to that used in conventional wwtps this combined with a higher efficiency removing nutrients shows the potential of hrap technology for wastewater treatment as an alternative or addition as tertiary treatment to more conventional approaches based on activated sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords microalgae pharmaceuticals wastewater nutrient removal 1 introduction emerging contaminants are a myriad of trace organic compounds including veterinary prescription and over the counter pharmaceuticals as well as personal care products such as cosmetics sunscreens and fragrances field et al 2006 over the last decade the scientific interest and public awareness about the occurrence fate and effects of these chemicals have increased due to their presence in the environment and lack of information on their effects previous studies show the existence of emerging contaminants lara martín et al 2014 in aquatic systems at ng l 1 and low μg l 1 levels and point out wastewater discharges as one of the main pollution sources kümmerer 2008 focusing on pharmaceuticals they are designed to be biologically active at low doses and therefore they may pose a significant ecotoxicological risk towards aquatic organisms even at environmentally relevant concentrations once in the environment many pharmaceuticals can be potentially biotransformed and or degraded and in general they are not intrinsically persistent compounds however due to their continuous input into the receiving waters these compounds have become ubiquitous and are often considered to be pseudo persistent barra caracciolo et al 2015 one of the most effective ways of preventing or minimizing the discharge of pharmaceuticals into the environment is by investing in efficient wastewater treatment technologies according to norman network at least 1000 substances have been identified in the european aquatic environments http www norman network net recently directive 2013 39 eu included diclofenac along with two other pharmaceuticals in the eu water framework directive watch list which has to be updated every 2 years however the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in europe is regulated by 91 271 ecc and 98 15 ecc only in terms of organic matter suspended solids and nutrient removal as there is not a consolidated regulatory framework for emerging pollutants most of the studies on the efficiency of pharmaceutical removal during wastewater treatment are focused on the analysis of influent and effluent samples in conventional wwtps after primary and secondary activated sludge treatments collado et al 2014 papageorgiou et al 2016 wang and wang 2016 recently reviewed the available data and gathered 29 emerging contaminants with concentrations measured in influent samples between 10 ng l 1 and 350 mg l 1 and in dry sludge between 5 μg kg 1 and 8 mg kg 1 according to this review carbamazepine an antiepileptic drug is one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in effluent wastewater showing concentrations in the same order than in the influent as its removal efficiency after conventional biological treatment is usually below 23 the removal of other widely used drugs such as analgesics and anti inflammatories e g ibuprofen naproxen ketoprofen and diclofenac exhibited a high variation depending on the study carballa et al 2004 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 due to the lack of efficiency of conventional wastewater treatment plants to remove many emerging contaminants additional and alternative strategies may be explored to improve water quality examples are the addition of tertiary treatments such as ozonation and advanced oxidation processes to the conventional wastewater line which may accelerate the degradation of most organic contaminants huber et al 2003 another promising strategy is using microalgae biotechnology for wastewater treatment this is a clean sustainable and environmentally friendly technology due to the photosynthetic capability of algae to capture co2 and their adaptability to grow in different domestic and industrial wastewater types abinandan shanthakumar 2015 in addition its operation simplifies and decreases the cost of sludge management as it generates algae biomass a byproduct that can be later be transformed into various products more than 15 000 novel compounds have been associated with algae biomass which can be also anaerobically digested to obtain biogas bhatt et al 2014 other uses of the algae biomass obtained in wastewater treatment include biofertilizers renuka et al 2016 and biopolymers rahman et al 2015 microalgae technology can also be used in wastewater treatment for different purposes such as reduction of the biological oxygen demand bod and removal of nutrients n and p mennaa et al 2015 coliforms parasite eggs el hamouri et al 1994 and heavy metals bulgariu and gavrilescu 2015 alternatively the hrap technology can be applied as a tertiary treatment in a conventional wwtps reducing the environmental risk of the effluent towards aquatic species díaz garduño et al 2017 currently wastewater treatment by microalgae biotechnology has been proved to be technically possible at laboratory scale mennaa et al 2017 pilot scale arbib et al 2017 and demo scale arbib et al 2015a the costs associated to this technology however have to be carefully analyzed to achieve the same levels of cost as conventional wastewater plants 0 2 m 3 gouveia et al 2016 both the photobioreactor used in the production step and the harvesting strategy employed have a major influence on the final treatment cost power consumption on the other hand is a significant factor only when using closed photobioreactors instead of raceway reactors arbib et al 2015b very recently the capability of microalgae to remove specific pharmaceuticals was also tested showing high removal rates for salicylic acid acetaminophen ibuprofen and cephalosporin antibiotics although low removal rates were measured for carbamazepine escapa et al 2015 matamoros et al 2015 all these studies were performed in the laboratory and or used synthetic wastewater the aim of this study was to analyze for the first time the efficiency of a pilot scale microalgae biotechnology system for wastewater treatment fed with urban wastewater to remove a wide range of pharmaceuticals n 81 under real operational conditions this research was performed in a wwtp in cadiz sw spain equipped with an experimental hrap line and its performance was compared to that of the conventional line operating in parallel and fed with the same influent wastewater as the microalgae biotechnology system this system based on high rate algae ponds hraps was tested using two different configurations one as a tertiary treatment coupled to an uasb reactor and another as a secondary treatment fed directly with raw wastewater an extensive monitoring campaign was carried out over 6 months at several stages during the wastewater treatment to account for the variability in performance of the different processes involved 2 material and methods 2 1 wwtp description the wwtp el torno is located in chiclana de la frontera cadiz sw spain and serves a population of 84 000 equivalent inhabitants treating an average wastewater flow rate of 8500 m3 d 1 there are two different treatment lines operating in the plant both working in parallel the conventional main line includes pretreatment screening plus grit and grease removal phosphorous pre precipitation with ferric sulphate primary settling and secondary treatments a modified ludzack ettinger process and auto thermophilic aerobic sludge digestion atad the operational and design parameters of the wwtp are presented in table 1 fig 1 also shows a diagram of the conventional treatment line and the different sampling points considered in this study the non conventional treatment line is a pilot scale installation within the wwtp eu fp7 all gas project aqualia all gas 2016 consisting on three upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors operated at ambient temperature 18 6 5 7 c followed by six hrap reactors these are open shallow ponds with a paddle wheel to provide circulation around 0 3 m s 1 of the microalgae and the culture media the dominant species of the bloom during sampling period was coelastrum sp 90 after grit and grease removal the wwtp influent is diverted from the conventional to the non conventional line the latter therefore receiving an average flow rate of 4 m3 h 1 the wastewater can either go through the uasb reactors before entering the hrap february to april 2015 or directly to the hrap may to july 2015 additionally harvest of the microalgae biomass can be performed through dissolved air flotation daf may to july 2015 the operational and design parameters of the non conventional treatment line are presented in table 2 fig 2 also shows a diagram of this line and the different sampling points considered in this study 2 2 monitoring program six monthly monitoring campaigns were carried out between february and july 2015 sampling points are represented in figs 1 and 2 time integrated samples were collected at different times of the day always on a weekday within the second week of the sampling month to compensate for the hydraulic retention time hrt of each treatment step sampling points 1 2 3 and 4 figs 1 and 2 were monitored during six months february to july 2015 whereas samples at point 5 were only taken between may and july when daf was operating during sample collection auto samplers were covered with ice to minimize pharmaceutical degradation samples aliquots 700 ml were transported to the laboratory at 4 c and filtered through whatman glass fiber filters 0 45 μm pore size these aliquots were separated into several fractions to perform different analyses including identification and quantification of pharmaceuticals total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod total dissolved nitrogen tdn and total dissolved phosphorous tdp 2 3 chemical analyses biomass dry weight and suspended solids were determined gravimetrically according to the standard method 2540 d apha awwa wpcf 2008 samples for the analysis of nutrients tdp and tdn and organic matter cod were previously stored at 4 c in 100 ml plastic jars phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were determined in duplicate using the method proposed by köthe and bitsch 1992 it consists in mixing 10 ml of the sample and 1 5 micro spoons of oxisolv merck kgaa darmstadt germany and incubating the mixture at 105 c during 1 h once samples were cooled down and completely oxidized determination of nutrients was performed using spectroquant colorimetric test kits cod 1 14773 0001 cod 1 14848 0001 merck cod was also measured in duplicate using the spectroquant test kit cod 1 14540 0001 merck following the standard method 5220 d apha awwa wpcf 2008 the absorbance was measured on a thermo genesys 10μv spectrophotometer analysis of pharmaceuticals was carried out in duplicate according to the method developed by baena nogueras et al 2016 briefly compounds were extracted from water samples 100 ml by solid phase extraction spe using 500 mg oasis hlb cartridges waters sample ph was previously adjusted to 7 or 2 5 depending on the different classes of pharmaceuticals analyzed elution was performed with 10 ml of methanol and after evaporation samples were reconstituted in 1 ml of methanol water 25 75 and filtered through 0 22 μm ptfe filters teknochroma deuterated internal standards were then added to account for ionization suppression due to matrix effects separation identification and quantification of target pharmaceuticals n 81 were achieved by ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms on a bruker evoq instrument calibration curves containing target compounds included several anti inflammatories and analgesics anti hypertensives lipid regulators psychiatric drugs antibiotics and other widely used pharmaceuticals e g glibenclamide and furosemide the extraction efficiency of the analytical method was between 70 and 100 for most target compounds determined by analysis of water samples fortified with target compounds regarding the limits of detection of the method they were determined from these spiked water samples as the minimum detectable amount of analytes with a signal to noise ratio of 3 these limits were between 0 01 and 1 ng l 1 for all target compounds except for nitrofurantoin and salycilic acid which were 1 5 and 1 3 ng l 1 respectively further details on the used methodology and suppliers for the different pharmaceutical standards can be found in baena nogueras et al 2016 2 4 data analysis for all statistical analyses we obtained total concentrations of all measured nutrients and pharmaceuticals we first calculated the average concentration across the two replicates per compound analyzed we then summed this average for each treatment technology and time of sampling to define main patterns in the variation of pollutant concentrations we performed a principal component analysis pca on the total concentrations of five main groups of nutrients phacs pca reduces the dimensionality of data by quantifying the main axes that are necessary to explain a given percentage of variation of the data the concentrations were scaled to μ 0 and sd 1 to agree with pca assumptions we used the prcomp function in r r core team 2016 to implement the pca we then applied the kaiser criterion to explore how many pc axes sufficiently explained the variation observed in the data this criterion is based on keeping only pc axes with associated eigenvalues 1 lastly we performed a variance maximizing rotation of the significant pca axes using the principal function within the r package psych revelle 2016 to calculate the pollutant removal efficiency of each wastewater treatment technology techn we estimated the change in concentration relative to initial concentration in the influent inf for each compound detected using the following formula removal 100 concentration inf concentration techn concentration inf then for each individual removal percentage agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis hca was performed for classification and information retrieval using ward s minimum variance method which is based on variance analysis we used the daisy and hclust from the cluster r package to perform the hca as suggested by chiaia hernandez and co workers chiaia hernandez et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the different wastewater treatment processes results for the physicochemical parameters analyzed in influent and effluent samples are shown in table 3 in the influent greatest variability in concentration among the six months of sampling was observed for cod and tss while lowest variability was observed for tdn and tdp around 10 the robustness between conventional primary treatment followed by activated sludge and non conventional processes uasb hrap and daf differed coefficients of variation were between 9 6 for cod and 38 for tss in the case of the conventional effluent in contrast the non conventional processes showed higher variations ranging from 25 for phosphorous removal to 121 for tss which was directly associated with changes in the efficiency of the daf process one explanation for these results is the different scales of the two wastewater treatment lines although both are operating under continuous fed and ambient conditions the non conventional treatment line is at pilot scale with smaller reactors than the conventional line which are therefore more susceptible to variation redda and kruzic 2008 the removal efficiency of both treatments was studied by comparing the concentrations of the physicochemical parameters in table 3 in influent and effluent samples this comparison was performed in the framework of the requirements imposed by the 91 271 eec and 98 15 eec directives for urban wwtp effluents in europe the concentrations of cod and tss in the conventional effluent were below the limits established by these normatives and therefore met the requirements for discharge in the case of the non conventional processes average cod removal efficiency was 64 and in one of the samples the concentration was above the upper limit of the 91 271 ecc directive 125 mg l 1 this result is similar to that reported by matamoros et al 2015 who achieved cod removal efficiencies between 66 and 85 on smaller hraps in our case there was also another sample that showed a higher value for tss and a removal efficiency lower than those established in the normative for urban agglomerations higher than 10 000 population equivalent 35 mg l 1 or 90 of removal efficiency on the other hand the conventional treatment removed satisfactorily phosphorus but not nitrogen in all the effluent samples analyzed from this line more than 75 of the total nitrogen was in the form of ammonium this means that the nitrification and therefore the denitrification processes did not work properly which can be attributed to the insufficient volume and hrt of the biological reactor table 1 considering that the yields for cod and tss removal were above the limits of directive 91 271 eec we can conclude that the biological reactor was working as activated sludge without nitrification this was due to the values of bod nkt which were above 5 in the aerobic reactor metcalf and eddy 2003 the non conventional line showed better results as it removed 74 and 92 of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorous respectively summing up the nutrient contribution derived from the particulate matter formed mainly by microalgae and taking into account that the microalgae nitrogen and phosphorous contents are around 16 and 1 redfield et al 1963 respectively the non conventional effluent complied for nitrogen and showed that overall hrap was a better choice for the removal of nutrients than the conventional treatment these results also confirm those previously reported in batch experiments by zhou et al 2014 where removals between 77 92 and 68 82 were measured for nitrogen and phosphorous using freshwater green microalgae results of the principal component analysis pca performed on concentrations of five main pollutant groups indicated that the variation in concentrations was captured by two main axes together explaining 86 of the variation fig 3 pca axis 1 largely corresponded to differences in concentrations of cod tdp and phacs with highest positive loadings of these compound groups onto pca 1 variation along pca axis 2 was largely determined by tss tdn loaded equally onto both axes the distribution of samples along the two pca axes allowed us to discriminate between treatment technologies in terms of pollutant concentrations sample taken at the influent of the wwtp were located at highest positive scores along pca 1 followed by i e decreasing in pca 1 scores samples taken at uasb hrap and daf effluent as well as the conventional wwtp effluent the location of hrap and daf effluents at the most negative pca 1 scores indicated that in general terms the microalgae system worked similarly to the conventional system in eliminating pharmaceuticals sampling points corresponding to hrap and conventional effluents were located at the upper and lower end of pca 2 respectively indicating relatively high hrap and low concentrations of tss conventional effluent the non conventional line was less efficient regarding the removal of suspended solids tss this is due to the lack of robustness of daf derived from its low scale since the operating parameters of the harvesting process were correct appropriate air solids ratio and thr in the case of total phacs and tdp our pca results show that differences between non conventional effluent daf and conventional effluent in the removal of these groups were non significant we will discuss the data on specific pharmaceuticals more in detail in the next section an in depth analysis of the variability of the microalgae technology fig 4 shows that its performance changed seasonally as it was affected by a combination of different modes of operation and environmental variables such as temperature precipitation and irradiance there was an improvement in the quality of the effluent related to a progressive decrease in tdn and tdp concentrations when moving from february towards warmer months in contrast from may onwards the cod and pharmaceutical concentrations were substantially higher from april onwards the hrap reactor was fed directly with pre treated water this implied an increase in the cod and pharmaceutical mass flow but not in the nutrients as the removal of nitrogen and phosphorous in uasb was low as fig 4 shows this cod load resulted in a loss of effluent quality but there was no significant decrease in phacs removal performance from 96 to 88 in the case of nutrients there was an increase in the removal efficiency of the reactor presumably due to the increase in radiation 37 and temperature 39 compared to previous months february to april and therefore increasing photosynthetic activity table s1 supplementary material 3 2 removal of pharmaceuticals using conventional and non conventional technologies 3 2 1 sample characterization and efficiency of the conventional treatment line sixty four out of 81 target pharmaceutically active compounds were detected in the influent of the wastewater treatment plant accounting for an average concentration of 223 μg l 1 whereas 55 and 54 were observed in the conventional 14 μg l 1 and non conventional 17 μg l 1 effluents respectively there were also some compounds that were occasionally detected only in the effluent but not in the influent e g phenylbutazone fenofibrate and propranolol this has been previously reported sun et al 2014 and attributed to desorption from the sludge and or the cleavage of pharmaceutical conjugates during wastewater treatment the complete dataset is in tables s2 s7 supplementary material average removal efficiencies were similar 94 vs 92 for both treatment lines when comparing total phacs concentrations the compositional patterns of the resulting effluents however were not suggesting the occurrence of differential removal mechanisms depending on the chemicals and wastewater treatments considered specifically figs 5 and 6 show the average concentration of different therapeutic classes of pharmaceuticals and the top ten compounds with higher abundances respectively in the different types of samples analyzed during this study analgesics and anti inflammatories were the predominant group in the influent 100 μg l 1 due their highest consumption and the fact that most of them do not need any medical prescription before use thus acetaminophen ibuprofen salicylic acid and naproxen were the chemicals showing the highest concentrations in the raw wastewater fig 6 this is in agreement with previous publications reporting high levels of pharmaceuticals in untreated municipal wastewater not only in spain fernández et al 2014 but also in other parts of the world castiglioni et al 2006 lara martín et al 2014 sun et al 2014 analgesic and anti inflammatory concentrations above 100 ng l 1 per compound are commonly measured in influent samples from urban wwtps vieno et al 2005 sun et al 2014 their removal although compound dependent is overall very efficient in conventional wwtps using activated sludge reactors or similar technologies as secondary treatment removal efficiencies for ibuprofen and other drugs belonging to this therapeutical class are usually above 80 except for diclofenac which persisted in spanish wwtp effluents together with the antiepileptic carbamazepine at similar or even higher concentration than those measured in the influent fernández et al 2014 in our case the average removal efficiency for this therapeutic class was 98 in the conventional line this high efficiency is illustrated in fig 6 where analgesics and anti inflammatories were no longer the compounds having the highest concentrations in treated wastewater and compounds such as salicylic acid were then excluded from the list of the top ten most abundant pharmaceuticals the rest of therapeutic classes were removed with poor 30 or moderate efficiency 40 70 from the wastewater independently of the technology used fig 5 many of the compounds belonging to these classes were within the top ten most abundant phacs in the effluent of the conventional line fig 6 and also detected after hrap and daf treatments some of them have been already described to be predominant and persistent drugs in effluent samples from other european wwtps vieno et al 2005 castiglioni et al 2006 as well as in the united states lara martín et al 2014 and china sun et al 2014 the relatively higher concentrations of carbamazepine hydrochlorothiazide used to treat kidney diseases gemfibrozil used to lower blood triglyceride levels or ranitidine a histamine receptor in effluents collado et al 2014 lara martín et al 2014 were derived from their high solubility and low biodegradability both features minimize their losses by sorption on sludge microalgae and biodegradation by microbial communities microalgae respectively this leads to their later persistence in the receiving aquatic ecosystems baena nogueras et al 2017 benotti and brownawell 2009 3 2 2 removal of pharmaceuticals by microalgae available data on the capability of hrap to remove phacs of different therapeutical classes from wastewater is still severely limited previous experiments carried out in batch reactors using freshwater green microalgae zhou et al 2014 have demonstrated the capability of these organisms to remove not only nutrients and other inorganic components e g metals from wastewater but also selected organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds edcs in our case the non conventional line showed high removal efficiencies between 88 and 94 depending on whether we consider just hrap alone or combined with the daf treatment for most analgesics and anti inflammatories these values were however slightly lower than those for the conventional line as a consequence and in spite of achieving average removal rates between 89 4 and 99 8 for ibuprofen salicylic acid and acetaminophen after the hrap treatment and up to 92 in the uasb reactor these compounds were still the most abundant in samples from the non conventional line effluent fig 6 on the other hand a significant improvement was observed in the elimination of diclofenac one of the priority substances included in the eu water framework directive watch list the average removal efficiency of this compound in the conventional line was 19 and it is commonly never exceeding 30 after secondary treatment using active sludge collado et al 2014 evgenidou et al 2015 kermia et al 2016 however after hrap and daf treatments the average removal percentage was 55 and 71 respectively it has been demonstrated that the main degradation pathway of this compound in the environment is through photocatalysis baena nogueras et al 2017 indicating that light during microalgae treatment may play a key role in its removal recent data from laboratory studies also suggest that this compound can be metabolized more efficiently by microalgae than by bacteria escapa et al 2016 further experiments out of the scope of this manuscript would be needed to discern whether photodegradation or biotransformation play the major role in diclofenac removal in hrap the efficiency of microalgae was also higher than that of the conventional line for other therapeutic classes such as antibiotics 63 and other drugs 77 more specifically we measured an increase in the average removal efficiency between 15 and 50 compared to the conventional line for macrolides e g roxithromycin and erythromycin histamine blockers ranitidine and diuretics furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide similar results were obtained in laboratory experiments by zhou et al 2014 using specific phacs in that study the removal efficiencies were satisfactory 70 for most target contaminants 32 out of 50 target compounds after conventional activated sludge treatment but some pharmaceuticals such as the antibiotics clarithromycin and roxithromycin were barely eliminated 50 however batch microalgae reactors could raise these percentages to over 80 for these chemicals another study performed in a hrap fed with synthetic wastewater containing 2 mg l 1 of tetracycline for 46 days achieved removal efficiencies up to 69 de godos et al 2012 whereas we observed occasionally complete removal 100 of this drug in our reactors these losses were attributed apart from biodegradation and sorption tiwari et al 2017 yu et al 2011 also occurring during conventional treatments to photodegradation which may play a major role in the elimination of these and other organic contaminants from the algae ponds baena nogueras et al 2017 de laurentiis et al 2014 3 2 3 seasonal trends the loads table s2 s6 and removal efficiencies figure s1 of many phacs considered in this study varied depending on the wastewater treatment technology used and the sampling period considered although the sampling interval one sampling campaign per month was not adequate to assess short term pollutant variations e g differences among weekdays and weekends ort et al 2010 we still could infer seasonal patterns as so the highest total concentrations in influent samples were measured in february and march up to 292 μg l 1 during the winter period we observed maximum values for analgesics and anti inflammatories 276 μg l 1 and antibiotics 11 μg l 1 decreasing two and three fold respectively in summer on the other hand specific pharmaceuticals such as the histamine receptor antagonist ranitidine were predominant in may and june concentrations of other pharmaceuticals fluctuated less and showed no clear seasonal patterns these variations reflect changes in the consumption of pharmaceuticals in the population served by the wwtp and are comparable to those previously reported in other regions as an example fernández et al 2014 observed that concentrations of selected analgesics and anti inflammatories except for paracetamol were higher in winter than in summer in wwtps from the north of spain in italian wwtps castiglioni et al 2006 the total influent loads in summer were about half of those in winter which was attributed to a lower use of pharmaceuticals particularly antibiotics and ibuprofen in summer than in winter for other drugs e g atenolol hydrochlorothiazide furosemide and ranitidine however the extent of contamination was continuous during the year similarly higher total concentrations of pharmaceuticals were also reported in influents collected in december compared with those measured in august in xiamen china sun et al 2014 hierarchical cluster analysis hca fig 7 reveals different groups of pharmaceuticals depending on their removal efficiency from this analysis it becomes evident that during the whole sampling period there were some specific compounds such as the psychiatric drug carbamazepine or the antibiotic sulfamethizole that were barely removed by any of the technologies used whereas other contaminants such as acetaminophen or clarithromycin were easily eliminated the efficiency of the different wastewater treatment technologies also varies with seasonal changes in temperature precipitation and irradiance and the effects of these changes on the different chemical physical and biological processes occurring in the wwtp for relatively easily biodegradable compounds such as salicylic acid naproxen ibuprofen and cefaclor no significant changes in concentrations were observed between february and july achieving removal efficiencies higher than 90 in all cases after conventional wastewater treatment fig 7 the same was also true for persistent phacs such as carbamazepine or hydrochlorothiazide with poor constant removal efficiencies 50 all year round there were however many other chemicals e g sulfonamide antibiotics beta blockers furosemide etc for which in general terms removal was improved in june and or july in that sense removal rates between 0 and 64 generally higher in summer in line with a temperature dependent increase of microbial activity were reported by castiglioni et al 2006 in conventional wwtps analgesics and anti inflammatories such as ketoprofen and diclofenac showed relatively higher removal efficiencies in summer due to increased microbial activity in the secondary treatment in china and finland vieno et al 2005 sun et al 2014 the lower efficiency at lower temperatures resulted in increasing concentrations of these chemicals in the effluent in wintertime the receiving surface waters could be directly influenced by this effect as it was observed in mar menor se spain where highest concentrations of analgesics and anti inflammatories and antibiotics were measured in autumn and winter moreno gonzález et al 2014 on the other hand psychiatric drugs diuretics and antihypertensives were more abundant in summer regarding the influence of environmental factors on the efficiency of the microalgae technology a previous study by matamoros et al 2015 states that the effect of seasonality on the overall pollutant removal performance of hrap in a mild climate such as the mediterranean is very low 10 20 in our case however key parameters such temperature and irradiance increased by more than 10 c and 20 mj m 2 d 1 respectively from february to july higher temperatures towards summer resulted in an increase in the removal efficiency of phacs such as mefenamic acid naproxen and other analgesics and anti inflammatories in the uasb on the other hand the hrap was disconnected from the uasb during the warmer months and fed directly with raw influent counteracting the possible benefits in terms of improved removal efficiency of phacs fig 4 that were observed for nutrients in this sense the elimination of most target compounds decreased either moderately 10 20 e g acetaminophen ibuprofen and furosemide or abruptly 50 e g atenolol clofibric acid and chloramphenicol resulting in higher concentrations in the non conventional effluent in summer the previous studies using hrap at pilot scale were limited to tetracycline de godos et al 2012 acetaminophen ibuprofen ketoprofen naproxen carbamazepine and diclofenac matamoros et al 2015 most of the target analgesics and anti inflammatories there showed very high removals 90 under both cold and warm seasons these compounds have been previously described as easily biodegradable in batch experiments performed with synthetic wastewater matamoros et al 2016 the removal efficiency of that hrap however decreased abruptly between two and three fold during the cold season for two pharmaceuticals carbamazepine and diclofenac which was not the case in our study both compounds are biologically persistent and the main degradation pathway for diclofenac in natural waters is photodegradation baena nogueras et al 2017 a third mechanism removing emerging contaminants is volatilization presumably more effective at higher temperature this was not considered in our work due to the very low henry s law constants of our target pharmaceuticals but it has been previously reported to be significant for substances such as synthetic fragrances matamoros et al 2015 4 conclusions in this study the performance of the microalgae technology using hraps as both secondary hrap daf and tertiary uasb hrap treatments has been demonstrated to be suitable to remove both nutrients and pharmaceuticals under real operational conditions the removal efficiencies for tdn were higher than in the conventional wwtp and they improved in months with higher temperature and irradiance regarding phacs both non conventional and conventional treatment lines were equally effective lowering the concentrations of these chemicals by 90 nevertheless there were significant differences in the removal of specific chemicals the most commonly used analgesics and anti inflammatories e g ibuprofen and acetaminophen were slightly better removed in the conventional wwtp whereas hrap was more efficient eliminating some pharmaceuticals that are of environmental concern such as a diclofenac and antibiotics the higher relevance of processes such as photodegradation and microalgae absorption and or metabolization in hrap not evaluated in this research may account for these differences on the other hand some phacs that were not appreciably removed in activated sludge e g carbamazepine not biodegradable with very low sorption capacity and resistant to photolysis were not eliminated by hrap either the results presented here show that microalgae technology can be efficiently employed as a realistic alternative for other more conventional approaches used in wastewater treatment specific studies on this matter are therefore needed for a better understanding of the role of the different processes accounting for micro pollutant removal to optimize their efficiency and to assess further disposal and or reuse of the biomass generated acknowledgments this work was carried out within a regional research project rnm 6613 funded by

of two wastewater treatment processes an activated sludge based conventional process and another based on microalgae biotechnology using high rate algae ponds hraps the latter was tested using two different configurations in the first one hraps were placed after an uasb reactor and used as a tertiary treatment to remove nutrients in the second the uasb reactor was disconnected so the hraps were directly fed with pretreated wastewater additional treatment was performed using dissolved air flotation daf the performances of both configurations uasb hrap and hrap daf were compared to that of the conventional line including primary and secondary biological treatments and operating in parallel within the same wastewater treatment plant wwtp sixty four out of 81 target phacs were detected in the influent of the wwtp at an average concentration of 223 μg l 1 whereas 55 and 54 were measured in the conventional 14 μg l 1 and non conventional 17 μg l 1 effluents average removal efficiencies were similar 94 vs 92 for both treatment lines when comparing total phacs concentrations the compositional patterns of the resulting effluents however were not suggesting the occurrence of differential removal mechanisms depending on the chemicals and wastewater treatments considered highly consumed compounds such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen were predominant in the non conventional effluent 1 μg l 1 denoting lower removal than in the conventional line on the other hand elimination of diclofenac and some specific antibiotics and diuretics e g hydrochlorothiazide was between 15 and 50 higher using hraps overall the efficiency of the microalgae technology removing phacs was found to be comparable to that used in conventional wwtps this combined with a higher efficiency removing nutrients shows the potential of hrap technology for wastewater treatment as an alternative or addition as tertiary treatment to more conventional approaches based on activated sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords microalgae pharmaceuticals wastewater nutrient removal 1 introduction emerging contaminants are a myriad of trace organic compounds including veterinary prescription and over the counter pharmaceuticals as well as personal care products such as cosmetics sunscreens and fragrances field et al 2006 over the last decade the scientific interest and public awareness about the occurrence fate and effects of these chemicals have increased due to their presence in the environment and lack of information on their effects previous studies show the existence of emerging contaminants lara martín et al 2014 in aquatic systems at ng l 1 and low μg l 1 levels and point out wastewater discharges as one of the main pollution sources kümmerer 2008 focusing on pharmaceuticals they are designed to be biologically active at low doses and therefore they may pose a significant ecotoxicological risk towards aquatic organisms even at environmentally relevant concentrations once in the environment many pharmaceuticals can be potentially biotransformed and or degraded and in general they are not intrinsically persistent compounds however due to their continuous input into the receiving waters these compounds have become ubiquitous and are often considered to be pseudo persistent barra caracciolo et al 2015 one of the most effective ways of preventing or minimizing the discharge of pharmaceuticals into the environment is by investing in efficient wastewater treatment technologies according to norman network at least 1000 substances have been identified in the european aquatic environments http www norman network net recently directive 2013 39 eu included diclofenac along with two other pharmaceuticals in the eu water framework directive watch list which has to be updated every 2 years however the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in europe is regulated by 91 271 ecc and 98 15 ecc only in terms of organic matter suspended solids and nutrient removal as there is not a consolidated regulatory framework for emerging pollutants most of the studies on the efficiency of pharmaceutical removal during wastewater treatment are focused on the analysis of influent and effluent samples in conventional wwtps after primary and secondary activated sludge treatments collado et al 2014 papageorgiou et al 2016 wang and wang 2016 recently reviewed the available data and gathered 29 emerging contaminants with concentrations measured in influent samples between 10 ng l 1 and 350 mg l 1 and in dry sludge between 5 μg kg 1 and 8 mg kg 1 according to this review carbamazepine an antiepileptic drug is one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in effluent wastewater showing concentrations in the same order than in the influent as its removal efficiency after conventional biological treatment is usually below 23 the removal of other widely used drugs such as analgesics and anti inflammatories e g ibuprofen naproxen ketoprofen and diclofenac exhibited a high variation depending on the study carballa et al 2004 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 due to the lack of efficiency of conventional wastewater treatment plants to remove many emerging contaminants additional and alternative strategies may be explored to improve water quality examples are the addition of tertiary treatments such as ozonation and advanced oxidation processes to the conventional wastewater line which may accelerate the degradation of most organic contaminants huber et al 2003 another promising strategy is using microalgae biotechnology for wastewater treatment this is a clean sustainable and environmentally friendly technology due to the photosynthetic capability of algae to capture co2 and their adaptability to grow in different domestic and industrial wastewater types abinandan shanthakumar 2015 in addition its operation simplifies and decreases the cost of sludge management as it generates algae biomass a byproduct that can be later be transformed into various products more than 15 000 novel compounds have been associated with algae biomass which can be also anaerobically digested to obtain biogas bhatt et al 2014 other uses of the algae biomass obtained in wastewater treatment include biofertilizers renuka et al 2016 and biopolymers rahman et al 2015 microalgae technology can also be used in wastewater treatment for different purposes such as reduction of the biological oxygen demand bod and removal of nutrients n and p mennaa et al 2015 coliforms parasite eggs el hamouri et al 1994 and heavy metals bulgariu and gavrilescu 2015 alternatively the hrap technology can be applied as a tertiary treatment in a conventional wwtps reducing the environmental risk of the effluent towards aquatic species díaz garduño et al 2017 currently wastewater treatment by microalgae biotechnology has been proved to be technically possible at laboratory scale mennaa et al 2017 pilot scale arbib et al 2017 and demo scale arbib et al 2015a the costs associated to this technology however have to be carefully analyzed to achieve the same levels of cost as conventional wastewater plants 0 2 m 3 gouveia et al 2016 both the photobioreactor used in the production step and the harvesting strategy employed have a major influence on the final treatment cost power consumption on the other hand is a significant factor only when using closed photobioreactors instead of raceway reactors arbib et al 2015b very recently the capability of microalgae to remove specific pharmaceuticals was also tested showing high removal rates for salicylic acid acetaminophen ibuprofen and cephalosporin antibiotics although low removal rates were measured for carbamazepine escapa et al 2015 matamoros et al 2015 all these studies were performed in the laboratory and or used synthetic wastewater the aim of this study was to analyze for the first time the efficiency of a pilot scale microalgae biotechnology system for wastewater treatment fed with urban wastewater to remove a wide range of pharmaceuticals n 81 under real operational conditions this research was performed in a wwtp in cadiz sw spain equipped with an experimental hrap line and its performance was compared to that of the conventional line operating in parallel and fed with the same influent wastewater as the microalgae biotechnology system this system based on high rate algae ponds hraps was tested using two different configurations one as a tertiary treatment coupled to an uasb reactor and another as a secondary treatment fed directly with raw wastewater an extensive monitoring campaign was carried out over 6 months at several stages during the wastewater treatment to account for the variability in performance of the different processes involved 2 material and methods 2 1 wwtp description the wwtp el torno is located in chiclana de la frontera cadiz sw spain and serves a population of 84 000 equivalent inhabitants treating an average wastewater flow rate of 8500 m3 d 1 there are two different treatment lines operating in the plant both working in parallel the conventional main line includes pretreatment screening plus grit and grease removal phosphorous pre precipitation with ferric sulphate primary settling and secondary treatments a modified ludzack ettinger process and auto thermophilic aerobic sludge digestion atad the operational and design parameters of the wwtp are presented in table 1 fig 1 also shows a diagram of the conventional treatment line and the different sampling points considered in this study the non conventional treatment line is a pilot scale installation within the wwtp eu fp7 all gas project aqualia all gas 2016 consisting on three upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors operated at ambient temperature 18 6 5 7 c followed by six hrap reactors these are open shallow ponds with a paddle wheel to provide circulation around 0 3 m s 1 of the microalgae and the culture media the dominant species of the bloom during sampling period was coelastrum sp 90 after grit and grease removal the wwtp influent is diverted from the conventional to the non conventional line the latter therefore receiving an average flow rate of 4 m3 h 1 the wastewater can either go through the uasb reactors before entering the hrap february to april 2015 or directly to the hrap may to july 2015 additionally harvest of the microalgae biomass can be performed through dissolved air flotation daf may to july 2015 the operational and design parameters of the non conventional treatment line are presented in table 2 fig 2 also shows a diagram of this line and the different sampling points considered in this study 2 2 monitoring program six monthly monitoring campaigns were carried out between february and july 2015 sampling points are represented in figs 1 and 2 time integrated samples were collected at different times of the day always on a weekday within the second week of the sampling month to compensate for the hydraulic retention time hrt of each treatment step sampling points 1 2 3 and 4 figs 1 and 2 were monitored during six months february to july 2015 whereas samples at point 5 were only taken between may and july when daf was operating during sample collection auto samplers were covered with ice to minimize pharmaceutical degradation samples aliquots 700 ml were transported to the laboratory at 4 c and filtered through whatman glass fiber filters 0 45 μm pore size these aliquots were separated into several fractions to perform different analyses including identification and quantification of pharmaceuticals total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod total dissolved nitrogen tdn and total dissolved phosphorous tdp 2 3 chemical analyses biomass dry weight and suspended solids were determined gravimetrically according to the standard method 2540 d apha awwa wpcf 2008 samples for the analysis of nutrients tdp and tdn and organic matter cod were previously stored at 4 c in 100 ml plastic jars phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were determined in duplicate using the method proposed by köthe and bitsch 1992 it consists in mixing 10 ml of the sample and 1 5 micro spoons of oxisolv merck kgaa darmstadt germany and incubating the mixture at 105 c during 1 h once samples were cooled down and completely oxidized determination of nutrients was performed using spectroquant colorimetric test kits cod 1 14773 0001 cod 1 14848 0001 merck cod was also measured in duplicate using the spectroquant test kit cod 1 14540 0001 merck following the standard method 5220 d apha awwa wpcf 2008 the absorbance was measured on a thermo genesys 10μv spectrophotometer analysis of pharmaceuticals was carried out in duplicate according to the method developed by baena nogueras et al 2016 briefly compounds were extracted from water samples 100 ml by solid phase extraction spe using 500 mg oasis hlb cartridges waters sample ph was previously adjusted to 7 or 2 5 depending on the different classes of pharmaceuticals analyzed elution was performed with 10 ml of methanol and after evaporation samples were reconstituted in 1 ml of methanol water 25 75 and filtered through 0 22 μm ptfe filters teknochroma deuterated internal standards were then added to account for ionization suppression due to matrix effects separation identification and quantification of target pharmaceuticals n 81 were achieved by ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry uplc ms ms on a bruker evoq instrument calibration curves containing target compounds included several anti inflammatories and analgesics anti hypertensives lipid regulators psychiatric drugs antibiotics and other widely used pharmaceuticals e g glibenclamide and furosemide the extraction efficiency of the analytical method was between 70 and 100 for most target compounds determined by analysis of water samples fortified with target compounds regarding the limits of detection of the method they were determined from these spiked water samples as the minimum detectable amount of analytes with a signal to noise ratio of 3 these limits were between 0 01 and 1 ng l 1 for all target compounds except for nitrofurantoin and salycilic acid which were 1 5 and 1 3 ng l 1 respectively further details on the used methodology and suppliers for the different pharmaceutical standards can be found in baena nogueras et al 2016 2 4 data analysis for all statistical analyses we obtained total concentrations of all measured nutrients and pharmaceuticals we first calculated the average concentration across the two replicates per compound analyzed we then summed this average for each treatment technology and time of sampling to define main patterns in the variation of pollutant concentrations we performed a principal component analysis pca on the total concentrations of five main groups of nutrients phacs pca reduces the dimensionality of data by quantifying the main axes that are necessary to explain a given percentage of variation of the data the concentrations were scaled to μ 0 and sd 1 to agree with pca assumptions we used the prcomp function in r r core team 2016 to implement the pca we then applied the kaiser criterion to explore how many pc axes sufficiently explained the variation observed in the data this criterion is based on keeping only pc axes with associated eigenvalues 1 lastly we performed a variance maximizing rotation of the significant pca axes using the principal function within the r package psych revelle 2016 to calculate the pollutant removal efficiency of each wastewater treatment technology techn we estimated the change in concentration relative to initial concentration in the influent inf for each compound detected using the following formula removal 100 concentration inf concentration techn concentration inf then for each individual removal percentage agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis hca was performed for classification and information retrieval using ward s minimum variance method which is based on variance analysis we used the daisy and hclust from the cluster r package to perform the hca as suggested by chiaia hernandez and co workers chiaia hernandez et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the different wastewater treatment processes results for the physicochemical parameters analyzed in influent and effluent samples are shown in table 3 in the influent greatest variability in concentration among the six months of sampling was observed for cod and tss while lowest variability was observed for tdn and tdp around 10 the robustness between conventional primary treatment followed by activated sludge and non conventional processes uasb hrap and daf differed coefficients of variation were between 9 6 for cod and 38 for tss in the case of the conventional effluent in contrast the non conventional processes showed higher variations ranging from 25 for phosphorous removal to 121 for tss which was directly associated with changes in the efficiency of the daf process one explanation for these results is the different scales of the two wastewater treatment lines although both are operating under continuous fed and ambient conditions the non conventional treatment line is at pilot scale with smaller reactors than the conventional line which are therefore more susceptible to variation redda and kruzic 2008 the removal efficiency of both treatments was studied by comparing the concentrations of the physicochemical parameters in table 3 in influent and effluent samples this comparison was performed in the framework of the requirements imposed by the 91 271 eec and 98 15 eec directives for urban wwtp effluents in europe the concentrations of cod and tss in the conventional effluent were below the limits established by these normatives and therefore met the requirements for discharge in the case of the non conventional processes average cod removal efficiency was 64 and in one of the samples the concentration was above the upper limit of the 91 271 ecc directive 125 mg l 1 this result is similar to that reported by matamoros et al 2015 who achieved cod removal efficiencies between 66 and 85 on smaller hraps in our case there was also another sample that showed a higher value for tss and a removal efficiency lower than those established in the normative for urban agglomerations higher than 10 000 population equivalent 35 mg l 1 or 90 of removal efficiency on the other hand the conventional treatment removed satisfactorily phosphorus but not nitrogen in all the effluent samples analyzed from this line more than 75 of the total nitrogen was in the form of ammonium this means that the nitrification and therefore the denitrification processes did not work properly which can be attributed to the insufficient volume and hrt of the biological reactor table 1 considering that the yields for cod and tss removal were above the limits of directive 91 271 eec we can conclude that the biological reactor was working as activated sludge without nitrification this was due to the values of bod nkt which were above 5 in the aerobic reactor metcalf and eddy 2003 the non conventional line showed better results as it removed 74 and 92 of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorous respectively summing up the nutrient contribution derived from the particulate matter formed mainly by microalgae and taking into account that the microalgae nitrogen and phosphorous contents are around 16 and 1 redfield et al 1963 respectively the non conventional effluent complied for nitrogen and showed that overall hrap was a better choice for the removal of nutrients than the conventional treatment these results also confirm those previously reported in batch experiments by zhou et al 2014 where removals between 77 92 and 68 82 were measured for nitrogen and phosphorous using freshwater green microalgae results of the principal component analysis pca performed on concentrations of five main pollutant groups indicated that the variation in concentrations was captured by two main axes together explaining 86 of the variation fig 3 pca axis 1 largely corresponded to differences in concentrations of cod tdp and phacs with highest positive loadings of these compound groups onto pca 1 variation along pca axis 2 was largely determined by tss tdn loaded equally onto both axes the distribution of samples along the two pca axes allowed us to discriminate between treatment technologies in terms of pollutant concentrations sample taken at the influent of the wwtp were located at highest positive scores along pca 1 followed by i e decreasing in pca 1 scores samples taken at uasb hrap and daf effluent as well as the conventional wwtp effluent the location of hrap and daf effluents at the most negative pca 1 scores indicated that in general terms the microalgae system worked similarly to the conventional system in eliminating pharmaceuticals sampling points corresponding to hrap and conventional effluents were located at the upper and lower end of pca 2 respectively indicating relatively high hrap and low concentrations of tss conventional effluent the non conventional line was less efficient regarding the removal of suspended solids tss this is due to the lack of robustness of daf derived from its low scale since the operating parameters of the harvesting process were correct appropriate air solids ratio and thr in the case of total phacs and tdp our pca results show that differences between non conventional effluent daf and conventional effluent in the removal of these groups were non significant we will discuss the data on specific pharmaceuticals more in detail in the next section an in depth analysis of the variability of the microalgae technology fig 4 shows that its performance changed seasonally as it was affected by a combination of different modes of operation and environmental variables such as temperature precipitation and irradiance there was an improvement in the quality of the effluent related to a progressive decrease in tdn and tdp concentrations when moving from february towards warmer months in contrast from may onwards the cod and pharmaceutical concentrations were substantially higher from april onwards the hrap reactor was fed directly with pre treated water this implied an increase in the cod and pharmaceutical mass flow but not in the nutrients as the removal of nitrogen and phosphorous in uasb was low as fig 4 shows this cod load resulted in a loss of effluent quality but there was no significant decrease in phacs removal performance from 96 to 88 in the case of nutrients there was an increase in the removal efficiency of the reactor presumably due to the increase in radiation 37 and temperature 39 compared to previous months february to april and therefore increasing photosynthetic activity table s1 supplementary material 3 2 removal of pharmaceuticals using conventional and non conventional technologies 3 2 1 sample characterization and efficiency of the conventional treatment line sixty four out of 81 target pharmaceutically active compounds were detected in the influent of the wastewater treatment plant accounting for an average concentration of 223 μg l 1 whereas 55 and 54 were observed in the conventional 14 μg l 1 and non conventional 17 μg l 1 effluents respectively there were also some compounds that were occasionally detected only in the effluent but not in the influent e g phenylbutazone fenofibrate and propranolol this has been previously reported sun et al 2014 and attributed to desorption from the sludge and or the cleavage of pharmaceutical conjugates during wastewater treatment the complete dataset is in tables s2 s7 supplementary material average removal efficiencies were similar 94 vs 92 for both treatment lines when comparing total phacs concentrations the compositional patterns of the resulting effluents however were not suggesting the occurrence of differential removal mechanisms depending on the chemicals and wastewater treatments considered specifically figs 5 and 6 show the average concentration of different therapeutic classes of pharmaceuticals and the top ten compounds with higher abundances respectively in the different types of samples analyzed during this study analgesics and anti inflammatories were the predominant group in the influent 100 μg l 1 due their highest consumption and the fact that most of them do not need any medical prescription before use thus acetaminophen ibuprofen salicylic acid and naproxen were the chemicals showing the highest concentrations in the raw wastewater fig 6 this is in agreement with previous publications reporting high levels of pharmaceuticals in untreated municipal wastewater not only in spain fernández et al 2014 but also in other parts of the world castiglioni et al 2006 lara martín et al 2014 sun et al 2014 analgesic and anti inflammatory concentrations above 100 ng l 1 per compound are commonly measured in influent samples from urban wwtps vieno et al 2005 sun et al 2014 their removal although compound dependent is overall very efficient in conventional wwtps using activated sludge reactors or similar technologies as secondary treatment removal efficiencies for ibuprofen and other drugs belonging to this therapeutical class are usually above 80 except for diclofenac which persisted in spanish wwtp effluents together with the antiepileptic carbamazepine at similar or even higher concentration than those measured in the influent fernández et al 2014 in our case the average removal efficiency for this therapeutic class was 98 in the conventional line this high efficiency is illustrated in fig 6 where analgesics and anti inflammatories were no longer the compounds having the highest concentrations in treated wastewater and compounds such as salicylic acid were then excluded from the list of the top ten most abundant pharmaceuticals the rest of therapeutic classes were removed with poor 30 or moderate efficiency 40 70 from the wastewater independently of the technology used fig 5 many of the compounds belonging to these classes were within the top ten most abundant phacs in the effluent of the conventional line fig 6 and also detected after hrap and daf treatments some of them have been already described to be predominant and persistent drugs in effluent samples from other european wwtps vieno et al 2005 castiglioni et al 2006 as well as in the united states lara martín et al 2014 and china sun et al 2014 the relatively higher concentrations of carbamazepine hydrochlorothiazide used to treat kidney diseases gemfibrozil used to lower blood triglyceride levels or ranitidine a histamine receptor in effluents collado et al 2014 lara martín et al 2014 were derived from their high solubility and low biodegradability both features minimize their losses by sorption on sludge microalgae and biodegradation by microbial communities microalgae respectively this leads to their later persistence in the receiving aquatic ecosystems baena nogueras et al 2017 benotti and brownawell 2009 3 2 2 removal of pharmaceuticals by microalgae available data on the capability of hrap to remove phacs of different therapeutical classes from wastewater is still severely limited previous experiments carried out in batch reactors using freshwater green microalgae zhou et al 2014 have demonstrated the capability of these organisms to remove not only nutrients and other inorganic components e g metals from wastewater but also selected organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds edcs in our case the non conventional line showed high removal efficiencies between 88 and 94 depending on whether we consider just hrap alone or combined with the daf treatment for most analgesics and anti inflammatories these values were however slightly lower than those for the conventional line as a consequence and in spite of achieving average removal rates between 89 4 and 99 8 for ibuprofen salicylic acid and acetaminophen after the hrap treatment and up to 92 in the uasb reactor these compounds were still the most abundant in samples from the non conventional line effluent fig 6 on the other hand a significant improvement was observed in the elimination of diclofenac one of the priority substances included in the eu water framework directive watch list the average removal efficiency of this compound in the conventional line was 19 and it is commonly never exceeding 30 after secondary treatment using active sludge collado et al 2014 evgenidou et al 2015 kermia et al 2016 however after hrap and daf treatments the average removal percentage was 55 and 71 respectively it has been demonstrated that the main degradation pathway of this compound in the environment is through photocatalysis baena nogueras et al 2017 indicating that light during microalgae treatment may play a key role in its removal recent data from laboratory studies also suggest that this compound can be metabolized more efficiently by microalgae than by bacteria escapa et al 2016 further experiments out of the scope of this manuscript would be needed to discern whether photodegradation or biotransformation play the major role in diclofenac removal in hrap the efficiency of microalgae was also higher than that of the conventional line for other therapeutic classes such as antibiotics 63 and other drugs 77 more specifically we measured an increase in the average removal efficiency between 15 and 50 compared to the conventional line for macrolides e g roxithromycin and erythromycin histamine blockers ranitidine and diuretics furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide similar results were obtained in laboratory experiments by zhou et al 2014 using specific phacs in that study the removal efficiencies were satisfactory 70 for most target contaminants 32 out of 50 target compounds after conventional activated sludge treatment but some pharmaceuticals such as the antibiotics clarithromycin and roxithromycin were barely eliminated 50 however batch microalgae reactors could raise these percentages to over 80 for these chemicals another study performed in a hrap fed with synthetic wastewater containing 2 mg l 1 of tetracycline for 46 days achieved removal efficiencies up to 69 de godos et al 2012 whereas we observed occasionally complete removal 100 of this drug in our reactors these losses were attributed apart from biodegradation and sorption tiwari et al 2017 yu et al 2011 also occurring during conventional treatments to photodegradation which may play a major role in the elimination of these and other organic contaminants from the algae ponds baena nogueras et al 2017 de laurentiis et al 2014 3 2 3 seasonal trends the loads table s2 s6 and removal efficiencies figure s1 of many phacs considered in this study varied depending on the wastewater treatment technology used and the sampling period considered although the sampling interval one sampling campaign per month was not adequate to assess short term pollutant variations e g differences among weekdays and weekends ort et al 2010 we still could infer seasonal patterns as so the highest total concentrations in influent samples were measured in february and march up to 292 μg l 1 during the winter period we observed maximum values for analgesics and anti inflammatories 276 μg l 1 and antibiotics 11 μg l 1 decreasing two and three fold respectively in summer on the other hand specific pharmaceuticals such as the histamine receptor antagonist ranitidine were predominant in may and june concentrations of other pharmaceuticals fluctuated less and showed no clear seasonal patterns these variations reflect changes in the consumption of pharmaceuticals in the population served by the wwtp and are comparable to those previously reported in other regions as an example fernández et al 2014 observed that concentrations of selected analgesics and anti inflammatories except for paracetamol were higher in winter than in summer in wwtps from the north of spain in italian wwtps castiglioni et al 2006 the total influent loads in summer were about half of those in winter which was attributed to a lower use of pharmaceuticals particularly antibiotics and ibuprofen in summer than in winter for other drugs e g atenolol hydrochlorothiazide furosemide and ranitidine however the extent of contamination was continuous during the year similarly higher total concentrations of pharmaceuticals were also reported in influents collected in december compared with those measured in august in xiamen china sun et al 2014 hierarchical cluster analysis hca fig 7 reveals different groups of pharmaceuticals depending on their removal efficiency from this analysis it becomes evident that during the whole sampling period there were some specific compounds such as the psychiatric drug carbamazepine or the antibiotic sulfamethizole that were barely removed by any of the technologies used whereas other contaminants such as acetaminophen or clarithromycin were easily eliminated the efficiency of the different wastewater treatment technologies also varies with seasonal changes in temperature precipitation and irradiance and the effects of these changes on the different chemical physical and biological processes occurring in the wwtp for relatively easily biodegradable compounds such as salicylic acid naproxen ibuprofen and cefaclor no significant changes in concentrations were observed between february and july achieving removal efficiencies higher than 90 in all cases after conventional wastewater treatment fig 7 the same was also true for persistent phacs such as carbamazepine or hydrochlorothiazide with poor constant removal efficiencies 50 all year round there were however many other chemicals e g sulfonamide antibiotics beta blockers furosemide etc for which in general terms removal was improved in june and or july in that sense removal rates between 0 and 64 generally higher in summer in line with a temperature dependent increase of microbial activity were reported by castiglioni et al 2006 in conventional wwtps analgesics and anti inflammatories such as ketoprofen and diclofenac showed relatively higher removal efficiencies in summer due to increased microbial activity in the secondary treatment in china and finland vieno et al 2005 sun et al 2014 the lower efficiency at lower temperatures resulted in increasing concentrations of these chemicals in the effluent in wintertime the receiving surface waters could be directly influenced by this effect as it was observed in mar menor se spain where highest concentrations of analgesics and anti inflammatories and antibiotics were measured in autumn and winter moreno gonzález et al 2014 on the other hand psychiatric drugs diuretics and antihypertensives were more abundant in summer regarding the influence of environmental factors on the efficiency of the microalgae technology a previous study by matamoros et al 2015 states that the effect of seasonality on the overall pollutant removal performance of hrap in a mild climate such as the mediterranean is very low 10 20 in our case however key parameters such temperature and irradiance increased by more than 10 c and 20 mj m 2 d 1 respectively from february to july higher temperatures towards summer resulted in an increase in the removal efficiency of phacs such as mefenamic acid naproxen and other analgesics and anti inflammatories in the uasb on the other hand the hrap was disconnected from the uasb during the warmer months and fed directly with raw influent counteracting the possible benefits in terms of improved removal efficiency of phacs fig 4 that were observed for nutrients in this sense the elimination of most target compounds decreased either moderately 10 20 e g acetaminophen ibuprofen and furosemide or abruptly 50 e g atenolol clofibric acid and chloramphenicol resulting in higher concentrations in the non conventional effluent in summer the previous studies using hrap at pilot scale were limited to tetracycline de godos et al 2012 acetaminophen ibuprofen ketoprofen naproxen carbamazepine and diclofenac matamoros et al 2015 most of the target analgesics and anti inflammatories there showed very high removals 90 under both cold and warm seasons these compounds have been previously described as easily biodegradable in batch experiments performed with synthetic wastewater matamoros et al 2016 the removal efficiency of that hrap however decreased abruptly between two and three fold during the cold season for two pharmaceuticals carbamazepine and diclofenac which was not the case in our study both compounds are biologically persistent and the main degradation pathway for diclofenac in natural waters is photodegradation baena nogueras et al 2017 a third mechanism removing emerging contaminants is volatilization presumably more effective at higher temperature this was not considered in our work due to the very low henry s law constants of our target pharmaceuticals but it has been previously reported to be significant for substances such as synthetic fragrances matamoros et al 2015 4 conclusions in this study the performance of the microalgae technology using hraps as both secondary hrap daf and tertiary uasb hrap treatments has been demonstrated to be suitable to remove both nutrients and pharmaceuticals under real operational conditions the removal efficiencies for tdn were higher than in the conventional wwtp and they improved in months with higher temperature and irradiance regarding phacs both non conventional and conventional treatment lines were equally effective lowering the concentrations of these chemicals by 90 nevertheless there were significant differences in the removal of specific chemicals the most commonly used analgesics and anti inflammatories e g ibuprofen and acetaminophen were slightly better removed in the conventional wwtp whereas hrap was more efficient eliminating some pharmaceuticals that are of environmental concern such as a diclofenac and antibiotics the higher relevance of processes such as photodegradation and microalgae absorption and or metabolization in hrap not evaluated in this research may account for these differences on the other hand some phacs that were not appreciably removed in activated sludge e g carbamazepine not biodegradable with very low sorption capacity and resistant to photolysis were not eliminated by hrap either the results presented here show that microalgae technology can be efficiently employed as a realistic alternative for other more conventional approaches used in wastewater treatment specific studies on this matter are therefore needed for a better understanding of the role of the different processes accounting for micro pollutant removal to optimize their efficiency and to assess further disposal and or reuse of the biomass generated acknowledgments this work was carried out within a regional research project rnm 6613 funded by

19556,chaoborus spp phantom midge are prevalent in eutrophic inland waters in lake soppen switzerland c flavicans larvae diurnally migrate between the methane rich oxygen depleted hypolimnion and sediments and the methane poor oxygen rich epilimnion using a combination of experiments and system modelling this study demonstrated that the larvae s burrowing activities in and out of the sediment perturbed the sediment and re introduced sequestered phosphorus into the overlying water at a rate of 0 022 μg p ind 1 d 1 thereby exacerbating internal nutrient loading in the water column fluxes of sediment methane and other reduced solutes enhanced by the larval bioturbation would consume oxygen and sustain the hypoxic anoxic condition below the thermocline in addition to increasing diffusive fluxes migrating larvae also directly transported methane in their gas vesicles from the deep water and release it in the surface water at a rate of 0 99 nmol ch4 ind 1 d 1 potentially contributing to methane emission to air as nutrient pollution and climate warming persist or worsen in the coming decades proliferation of chaoborus could intensify this positive feedback loop and delay lake recovery

frustrate scientists and resource managers ibelings et al 2016 we hypothesize that the successful colonization of inland waters i e lakes by the phantom midge larvae chaoborus spp drives internal processes that counteract external mitigation efforts and maintains the status quo the prevalence of chaoborus larvae in eutrophic inland waters with population densities up to 130 000 ind m 2 gosselin and hare 2003 sweetman and smol 2006 may be attributed to the larvae s tolerance of low oxygen environments and even toxic hydrogen sulfide that characterize the hypolimnion and sediment in eutrophic lakes many chaoborus spp larvae perform diurnal vertical migration where they reside at depth i e sediment or anoxic deep water to avoid planktivorous fish and ascend to the epilimnion at night to prey on other zooplankton dawidowicz et al 1990 bezerra neto et al 2012 in tropical lakes this process may divert energy from planktivorus fish and suppress the production of the latter hecky

hare 2003 were the first to observe in the laboratory the bioturbation effects of individual chaoborus larvae as they burrow in and out of the sediment based on subsequent experimental and modelling studies it is hypothesized that this bioturbation activity would release sequestered nutrients and ch4 into the overlying water at an enhanced rate thereby pushing the system over an ecological tipping point where the eutrophic state may self sustain indefinitely mcginnis et al 2017 tang et al 2017 this hypothesis has not been empirically tested but would have important implications for lake

rate hajdas skowronek 1993 here we used a combination of experiments and system modelling to demonstrate the quantitative effect exerted by c flavicans larvae on internal nutrient loading in lake soppen in addition by taking up ch4 in the porewater and releasing it in the water column migrating chaoborus larvae are expected to accelerate the upward ch4 flux over passive diffusion and affect the ambient ch4 carbon isotope composition in the epilimnion we therefore also investigated how c flavicans larvae affect ch4 transport and isotope composition in lake soppen taken together this study provides novel insights into how migratory chaoborus larvae could drive a positive feedback loop between eutrophication methane transport and deoxygenation in inland waters 2 material and methods 2 1 sediment incubation experiment sediment was collected from lake soppen by a gravity corer on shore the sediment was thoroughly mixed with an electric drill mixer to standardize the initial conditions among all replicates incubations were performed in 12 plexiglass cylinders diameter 5 6 cm length 29 cm with bottom caps the caps were used to measure out ca 73 ml of the mixed sediment ca 4 cm thick the cylinders were then pushed into the sediment containing caps surface lake water was gently siphoned into each cylinder letting the water overflow to replace ca 3 times its volume to standardize the initial water condition among the replicates the final volume of the overlying water was ca 0 5 l c flavicans larvae instar 3 4 were collected from ca 20 m depth rinsed with lake water and sorted into cups in different numbers 0 30 60 90 120 and 180 in duplicates equivalent to an in situ areal density of 0 73 000 ind m 2 each cup was randomly assigned to a cylinder and the larvae were gently poured into the cylinder the cylinders were secured in a basket which was fastened to pilings and partially submerged in the lake to maintain the temperature the cylinders remained open and exposed to the natural day light fig s1 the incubation lasted from 12th june night until 22nd june 2017 morning 9 5 d total on the last day the cylinders were removed one at a time in random order for processing first we measured the water temperature and dissolved oxygen hach portable multi meter model hq40d the color appearance of the water was recorded afterward 50 ml of the water was taken from the top with a syringe and stored refrigerated in an opaque plastic bottle for total phosphorus tp see below 300 400 ml of the remaining water was gently siphoned without disturbing the sediment into a glass bottle to measure co2 and ch4 concentrations and δ13c ch4 see below 2 2 water column measurements total phosphorus and dissolved gases water column profiles were measured with a seabird sbe 19plus v2 seacat profiler ctd sea bird scientific bellevue washington usa at a sampling frequency of 4hz the profiler was lowered in the water at 10 cm s 1 and recorded temperature pressure conductivity and dissolved oxygen with about a 3 cm resolution lake water was sampled with a niskin bottle 5 l at the deepest point on 22nd may for total phosphorus tp and on 13th june 2017 for water column dissolved gases for tp water samples were preserved in the cold until measurements tp was measured spectrophotometrically after potassium persulfate k2s2o8 digestion 45 min at 130 c the same method was used to measure tp in the sediment incubation experiment water for dissolved gases ch4 and co2 measurements was gently drained from the niskin bottle into a 1 l glass bottle and let overflow until the volume was replaced 2 3 times donis et al 2017 about half of the water was replaced by atmospheric air the bottle was immediately capped to create a headspace then shaken vigorously for at least 2 min to equilibrate the dissolved gases with the headspace afterward the headspace was extracted through a top valve into a gas sample bag supel inert multi layer foil gas sampling bags by slowly injecting lake water into the bottom of the bottle through a rubber tubing co2 and ch4 concentrations and δ13c ch4 of the gas bag content were measured within one day on a cavity ringdown spectrometer piccaro g2201 i initial concentrations of co2 and ch4 in the sampled water was calculated accounting for initial headspace ch4 and co2 concentrations before equilibrium assuming atmospheric concentration of 2 and 400 ppmv for ch4 and co2 respectively volume ratio i e headspace water air and water temperatures in situ barometric pressure and lake water total alkalinity the same method was used to measure dissolved gases in the sediment incubation experiment 2 3 day night sampling of chaoborus chaoborus flavicans larvae were sampled with an open close net 0 3 m diameter 200 μm mesh through discrete vertical strata 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 20 25 m max depth ca 27 m upon retrieval of the net the cod end content was washed into a container c flavicans larvae were counted on shore immediately afterward the mesh size was not suitable for capturing the small instars 1 2 hence only instars 3 4 were counted between 13th and 14th june 2017 sampling was done at sunset ca 21 00 h local time sunrise ca 05 00 h and mid morning between 21st and 22nd june 2017 we increased the sampling frequency to better capture the nighttime ascent of the larvae 2 4 bottle incubation experiments surface lake water was aerated for several hours using an aquarium type air pump to equilibrate its background ch4 with ambient air the aerated water was used for washing and for the blank c flavicans larvae were collected from depths where they were most abundant at the time of the experiment 15 20 m in day 0 5 m at night the experiments were done three times 13th june at 16 30 22nd june at 02 40 22nd june at 14 30 for the first experiment the larvae were brought back to shore rinsed with the aerated lake water and unknown numbers were added to 120 ml serum bottles for the latter experiments the larvae were immediately concentrated on a 1 mm mesh on the boat briefly rinsed with the aerated lake water and immediately added to the serum bottles all serum bottles were topped off with the aerated lake water and crimp sealed bottles with only aerated lake water were used as the blank the sealed bottles were left overnight to allow the release of ch4 from c flavicans gas vesicles afterward synthetic air carbagas 80 n2 20 o2 1 was injected to create headspace ca 50 ml the bottles were shaken vigorously for ca 2 min to equilibrate headspace and dissolved gases the headspace gas was then displaced into a gas tight syringe by slowly injecting lake water into the bottle the gas was then injected immediately into the picarro spectrometer to measure ch4 concentration and carbon isotopic signature of ch4 total ch4 was calculated by accounting for dissolved ch4 in the displaced headspace water afterward the numbers of larvae in the serum bottles were counted stable carbon isotope data are reported in

assuming the system was at steady state at the end of the experiment i e c c h 4 t 0 input output we then derive the relative ch4 increase against the control due to c flavicans bioturbation effective diffusivity error associated with the system modelling was assessed with a monte carlo analysis using the standard deviations of specific ch4 oxidation c flavicans gas vesicles transport and air water gas exchange suppl materials 3 results 3 1 water column chemistry the study was conducted on 12th 22nd june 2017 when the lake was thermally stratified at 5 9 m fig 1 a with a strong oxycline at 5 6 m separating the oxygen rich epilimnion and the nearly anoxic water below 6 m fig 1b dissolved ch4 was low ca 1 μmol l 1 at the surface and increased with depth in the hypolimnion to a maximum of 700 μmol l 1 fig 1c the average δ13c ch4 was 51 0 in 0 5 m and was more negative below the thermocline reaching 65 1 within 10 25 m fig 1d phosphorus concentration increased by an order of magnitude between the surface 14 9 μg l 1 and the bottom 289 6 μg l 1 fig 1e 3 2 chaoborus effects on sediment water exchange to test the hypothesis that migrating c flavicans larvae enhance sediment water exchange of dissolved substances i e phosphorus and ch4 we conducted an experiment where homogenized lake sediment was incubated in plexiglas cylinders with surface lake water and different number of larvae instars 3 4 added because the cylinders were uncapped during the experiment some water 8 96 4 95 was lost to evaporation at the end of the experiment the water was increasingly more turbid and green with increasing number of added larvae with one exception table s1 a fair amount of dissolved oxygen remained 76 1 98 7 sat with one exception 38 6 sat table s1 total phosphorus in the overlaying water increased linearly by a factor of 5 with increasing number of larvae fig 2 the amount of phosphorus added to the overlying water by the larvae slope of regression line was 0 21 μg p ind 1 over the course of the experiment 9 5 d or 0 022 μg p ind 1 d 1 because one cylinder was approaching hypoxia its gas dynamics e g respiration ch4 oxidation were not comparable with the others and was excluded from further data analysis final dissolved ch4 concentrations increased linearly by a factor of ca 5 with increasing number of larvae however δ13c ch4 was quite stable at an average of 49 9 fig 3 a and b concurrently dissolved pco2 decreased exponentially fig 3c 3 3 diurnal migration of chaoborus on 13th 14th june net sampling showed the integrated density of c flavicans larvae instars 3 4 was quite consistent throughout the sampling cycle mean sd 9229 1393 ind m 2 but their vertical distribution showed marked diurnal changes fig 4 at 21 00 h most of them were at 5 15 m 87 5 of the total at 05 00 h almost all were concentrated at 5 10 m as the day progressed the majority descended to 10 15 m fig 4 the second sampling cycle 21st 22nd june was conducted at a higher frequency to better capture the nighttime ascent of the larvae before sunset most of the larvae were at 10 20 m they ascended at sunset ca 21 00 h and occupied the 0 5 m layer at night between 00 00 h and 02 15 h the larvae descended again in the morning and reached 15 20 m by mid day fig 4 the integrated density was more variable than the first sampling cycle however the average value 9344 4497 ind m 2 was very comparable 3 4 methane release from chaoborus gas vesicles bottle incubation experiments to measure the release of ch4 from the larvae s gas vesicles instars 3 4 were performed three times using larvae collected from the deep 15 20 m and shallow layers 0 5 m the total ch4 released was linearly correlated with number of larvae i e the amount of ch4 released per individual was quite constant within each trial fig 5 a the amounts of ch4 released per individual were almost identical between the two trials with deep water larvae 0 97 and 1 02 nmol ind 1 because the shallow water larvae would have already lost some of their ch4 to the surrounding water before capture as expected the amount of ch4 was much lower for them at 0 19 nmol ind 1 both trials with deep water larvae gave similar δ13c ch4 of 65 5 to 62 9 which is very close to that of the bottom water 65 4 fig 1d shallow water larvae showed a wider range of values from 66 15 up to 58 fig 5b 3 5 system dynamics of methane and oxygen the ch4 oxidation rate was measured to be 0 03 d 1 table s2 emission to air was calculated using a measured fickian diffusion coefficient k600 of 0 23 m d 1 suppl materials and the final dissolved ch4 concentrations average ch4 transport by c flavicans gas vesicles was 0 99 nmol ind 1 d 1 fig 5 under a steady state condition our model predicts a linear relative increase in ch4 as a function of c flavicans abundance fig 6 the accuracy of our model can be checked by using the phosphorus data as reference for bioturbation influence on diffusivity in our case the model outcome for the relative ch4 increase due to bioturbation regression slope 0 035 ind 1 closely matches the observed relative increase in tp regression slope 0 032 ind 1 i e c flavicans bioturbation increased the effective diffusion of tp and ch4 by nearly equal magnitude fig 6 the model performance was not sensitive to ch4 oxidation rate for example decreasing and increasing the specific oxidation rate by 10 fold to 0 003 and 0 3 d 1 respectively will change the regression slope by 6 the percent contribution by gas vesicle transport of sediment ch4 to the overlying water increased with the number of larvae and asymptotically approached 18 of the total ch4 input fig 6 in other words the percent contributions of ch4 by both bioturbation and vesicle transport would approach constant as c flavicans abundance increases though both rates would presumably continue to increase 4 discussion 4 1 bioturbation and nutrient internal loading in the sediment incubation experiment final total phosphorus tp concentrations in the control cylinders without added c flavicans averaged 15 4 μg l 1 almost identical to the in situ surface water value 14 9 μg l 1 fig 1 in contrast tp increased at a rate of 0 022 μg p ind 1 d 1 in the cylinders with added c flavicans larvae because we measured tp particulate dissolved the observed increase in tp cannot be attributed to nutrient recycling within the water e g via excretion or remineralization while we did not count the final number of larvae we did not observe any dead floating larvae in the experiment which may have contributed to tp via decomposition to the contrary live and active larvae were seen in the treatments from the data we can infer that bioturbation by c flavicans increased the effective sediment diffusivity and re introduced sequestered phosphorus to the overlying water as has been previously hypothesized gosselin and hare 2003 and is further supported by our ch4 data and system modelling as expected this extra nutrient stimulated primary production and co2 drawdown in the experiment as indicated by the observed pco2 values fig 3c and the color appearance of the water in the cylinders table s1 extrapolating the experimental results to the observed in situ population density ca 9300 ind m 2 c flavicans bioturbation would add ca 205 μg p m 2 d 1 to the water column this extra phosphorus is likely to first accumulate in the hypolimnion and become available for primary production during spring turnover lake remediation strategies often focus on curbing external phosphorus input schindler 2006 our results however suggest that c flavicans bioturbation is a powerful mechanism to release nutrients from within the sediments and may explain in some cases the ineffectiveness of external nutrient management for improving water clarity mccrackin et al 2017 4 2 breaking the diffusive barrier oxygen loss from the water column to the sediment is generally limited by diffusion across the sediment water interface bryant et al 2010 however hypolimnetic oxygen demand would increase due to increased ch4 oxidation as a result of enhanced introduction of sediment ch4 to the overlying water via bioturbation in the present study the in situ c flavicans larvae population 9300 ind m 2 was equivalent to 23 larvae added to the incubation cylinder which according to our model would increase water column ch4 by 79 over the baseline value via bioturbation alone the in situ hypolimnetic ch4 concentrations averaged 445 μmol l 1 assuming a steady state condition c flavicans bioturbation would increase hypolimnetic ch4 concentration by 352 μmol l 1 and an extra o2 demand of ca 703 μmol l 1 or 22 mg l 1 assuming 1 mol ch4 2 mol o2 for complete oxidation more than sufficient to deplete all hypolimnetic o2 100 saturation at 12 8 mg l 1 at 5 c the chaoborus driven o2 demand would be even stronger when we consider other reduced solutes and organic carbon re introduced by bioturbation plus ch4 release and respiration by the larvae themselves tang et al 2017 taken together c flavicans can greatly increase the hypolimnetic o2 demand and maintain the hypoxic anoxic condition below the thermocline as well as enhance phosphorus loading which may explain why artificial aeration often fails to restore lake quality gächter and wehrli 1998 4 3 a positive feedback loop on climate warming it is estimated that globally lakes account for 6 16 of natural ch4 emissions 7 11 300 mmol m 2 yr 1 driven mainly by physical processes such as ebullition and diffusion whereas the roles of biota besides a small contribution from rooted vegetation are largely ignored bastviken et al 2004 in light of our findings it would be interesting to consider how chaoborus may contribute to ch4 emission the enhanced ch4 flux across the sediment water interface by bioturbation certainly has immediate implications for hypolimnetic oxygen demand the added hypolimnic ch4 due to chaoborus bioturbation would not be captured by conventional flux measurements at the air water interface and the eventual emission of this ch4 to the atmosphere depends on how fast the lake would overturn the lake bathymetry surface area to volume ratio and oxidation rates an additional route by which c flavicans can mediate ch4 flux is by enhancing bubble release through bioturbation bezerra neto et al 2012 which is expected to be the strongest when the larvae perturb the sediment during burrowing at dawn and at dusk likewise the amount of methane directly transported and released by their gas vesicles to the surface water is expected to be the highest during nighttime upward migration both of these processes are unlikely to be resolved by conventional daytime flux measurements the observed c flavicans in situ population density instars 3 4 was ca 9300 ind m 2 based on the bottle incubation experiments with deep water larvae averaged 0 99 nmol ch4 ind 1 we estimate that the amount of deep water ch4 transported by gas vesicles would be ca 9 2 μmol m 2 d 1 the actual amount would likely vary in time and in space as the chaoborus population density and activity change for example tang et al 2017 measured a higher population density of 34 000 ind m 2 for lake soppen in an earlier year likewise mcginnis et al 2017 estimated that in some lakes migrating chaoborus larvae may transport up to 2000 mmol ch4 m 2 yr 1 from the sediment to the overlying water it is likely that some of this methane would be lost to oxidation within the water column and only a small fraction would contribute to emission to air in a recent study carey et al 2018 estimated that direct transport by migratory chaoborus spp mainly c punctipennis in their study accounted for 1 of the diffusive ch4 flux to air although it should be noted that they observed an order of magnitude lower population density than ours eutrophication of inland waters is expected to persist or worsen due to growing human populations and increasing agricultural activities tilman et al 2001 smith 2003 mccrackin et al 2017 compounding the problem global warming will exacerbate eutrophication symptoms for example rising temperature will increase nutrient remineralization in the catchment and sediment and thermal stratification will intensify deoxygenation of the bottom layer jeppesen et al 2009 moss et al 2011 these conditions are inducive to sediment methanogenesis and favor range expansion and proliferation of chaoborus teraguchi 1975 taylor et al 2016 as shown in the present study bioturbation by chaoborus larvae would significantly increase diffusivity at the sediment water interface and re introduce sequestered nutrients organic carbon and ch4 to the overlying water concurrently the migrating larvae enhance the direct transport of sediment ch4 to the surface water for water air gaseous exchange by linking the nutrient and ch4 dynamics in eutrophic lakes chaoborus can thereby play a unique role in driving a positive feedback loop between lake eutrophication ch4 transport and climate warming in the coming decades 4 4 the chaoborus curse in lake restoration the long history of eutrophication has led to a host of public health concerns such as nuisance algal blooms water quality deterioration and wildlife die off causing substantial economic damages pretty et al 2003 dodds et al 2008 studies in eutrophic coastal systems have shown that nutrient reduction often fails to revert the systems to the pre eutrophication state duarte et al 2009 at least in the short term similarly aggressive lake management and restoration strategies have a checkered record of success gächter and wehrli 1998 mccrackin et al 2017 these observations suggest that the systems may have passed the ecological tipping point such that internal forcing tends to maintain the new status quo despite external interventions such as reducing nutrient runoff and artificial aeration as shown in this and earlier studies mcginnis et al 2017 tang et al 2017 chaoborus larvae that have successfully colonized eutrophic inland water bodies drive a positive feedback loop to sustain or even intensify eutrophication and deoxygenation hindering the system s recovery we therefore argue that remediation measures will remain limited until sediment ch4 concentrations drop and chaoborus abundance is greatly reduced understanding this internal chaoborus feedback mechanism may allow resource managers to devise more effective lake restoration strategies 5 conclusion the phantom midge larvae chaoborus spp are prevalent in eutrophic lakes by virtue of their diurnal migration in and out of the sediment they significantly perturb the sediment and reintroduce sequestered nutrients and pollutants to the overlying water essentially maintaining eutrophic lakes in the status quo despite external efforts to curb nutrient inputs and re oxygenate the water column understanding this chaoborus driven positive feedback mechanism may prove critical in effective lake restoration and in predicting lake ecosystem response to intensifying eutrophication and climate change authors contributions kwt sf

the cylinders were then pushed into the sediment containing caps surface lake water was gently siphoned into each cylinder letting the water overflow to replace ca 3 times its volume to standardize the initial water condition among the replicates the final volume of the overlying water was ca 0 5 l c flavicans larvae instar 3 4 were collected from ca 20 m depth rinsed with lake water and sorted into cups in different numbers 0 30 60 90 120 and 180 in duplicates equivalent to an in situ areal density of 0 73 000 ind m 2 each cup was randomly assigned to a cylinder and the larvae were gently poured into the cylinder the cylinders were secured in a basket which was fastened to pilings and partially submerged in the lake to maintain the temperature the cylinders remained open and exposed to the natural day light fig s1 the incubation lasted from 12th june night until 22nd june 2017 morning 9 5 d total on the last day the cylinders were removed one at a time in random order for processing first we measured the water temperature and dissolved oxygen hach portable multi meter model hq40d the color appearance of the water was recorded afterward 50 ml of the water was taken from the top with a syringe and stored refrigerated in an opaque plastic bottle for total phosphorus tp see below 300 400 ml of the remaining water was gently siphoned without disturbing the sediment into a glass bottle to measure co2 and ch4 concentrations and δ13c ch4 see below 2 2 water column measurements total phosphorus and dissolved gases water column profiles were measured with a seabird sbe 19plus v2 seacat profiler ctd sea bird scientific bellevue washington usa at a sampling frequency of 4hz the profiler was lowered in the water at 10 cm s 1 and recorded temperature pressure conductivity and dissolved oxygen with about a 3 cm resolution lake water was sampled with a niskin bottle 5 l at the deepest point on 22nd may for total phosphorus tp and on 13th june 2017 for water column dissolved gases for tp water samples were preserved in the cold until measurements tp was measured spectrophotometrically after potassium persulfate k2s2o8 digestion 45 min at 130 c the same method was used to measure tp in the sediment incubation experiment water for dissolved gases ch4 and co2 measurements was gently drained from the niskin bottle into a 1 l glass bottle and let overflow until the volume was replaced 2 3 times donis et al 2017 about half of the water was replaced by atmospheric air the bottle was immediately capped to create a headspace then shaken vigorously for at least 2 min to equilibrate the dissolved gases with the headspace afterward the headspace was extracted through a top valve into a gas sample bag supel inert multi layer foil gas sampling bags by slowly injecting lake water into the bottom of the bottle through a rubber tubing co2 and ch4 concentrations and δ13c ch4 of the gas bag content were measured within one day on a cavity ringdown spectrometer piccaro g2201 i initial concentrations of co2 and ch4 in the sampled water was calculated accounting for initial headspace ch4 and co2 concentrations before equilibrium assuming atmospheric concentration of 2

dissolved gases in the sediment incubation experiment 2 3 day night sampling of chaoborus chaoborus flavicans larvae were sampled with an open close net 0 3 m diameter 200 μm mesh through discrete vertical strata 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 20 25 m max depth ca 27 m upon retrieval of the net the cod end content was washed into a container c flavicans larvae were counted on shore immediately afterward the mesh size was not suitable for capturing the small instars 1 2 hence only instars 3 4 were counted between 13th and 14th june 2017 sampling was done at sunset ca 21 00 h local time sunrise ca 05 00 h and mid morning between 21st and 22nd june 2017 we increased the sampling frequency to better capture the nighttime ascent of the larvae 2 4 bottle incubation experiments surface lake water was aerated for several hours using an aquarium type air pump to equilibrate its background ch4 with ambient air the aerated water was used for washing and for the blank c flavicans larvae were collected from depths where they were most abundant at the time of the experiment 15 20 m in day 0 5 m at night the experiments were done three times 13th june at 16 30 22nd june at 02 40 22nd june at 14 30 for the first experiment the larvae were brought back to shore rinsed with the aerated lake water and unknown numbers were added to 120 ml serum bottles for the latter experiments the larvae were immediately concentrated on a 1 mm mesh on the boat briefly rinsed with the aerated lake water and immediately added to the serum bottles all serum bottles were topped off with the aerated lake water and crimp sealed bottles with only aerated lake water were used as the blank the sealed bottles were left overnight to allow the release of ch4 from c flavicans gas vesicles afterward synthetic air carbagas 80 n2 20 o2 1 was injected to create headspace ca 50 ml the bottles were shaken vigorously for ca 2 min to equilibrate headspace and dissolved gases the headspace gas was then displaced into a gas tight syringe by slowly injecting lake water into the bottle the gas was then injected immediately into the picarro spectrometer to measure ch4 concentration and carbon isotopic signature of ch4 total ch4 was calculated by accounting for dissolved ch4 in the displaced headspace water afterward the numbers of larvae in the serum bottles were counted stable carbon isotope data are reported in

assuming the system was at steady state at the end of the experiment i e c c h 4 t 0 input output we then derive the relative ch4 increase against the control due to c flavicans bioturbation effective diffusivity error associated with the system modelling was assessed with a monte carlo analysis using the standard deviations of specific ch4 oxidation c flavicans gas vesicles transport and air water gas exchange suppl materials 3 results 3 1 water column chemistry the study was conducted on 12th 22nd june 2017 when the lake was thermally stratified at 5 9 m fig 1 a with a strong oxycline at 5 6 m separating the oxygen rich epilimnion and the nearly anoxic water below 6 m fig 1b dissolved ch4 was low ca 1 μmol l 1 at the surface and increased with depth in the hypolimnion to a maximum of 700 μmol l 1 fig 1c the average δ13c ch4 was 51 0 in 0 5 m and was more negative below the thermocline reaching 65 1 within 10 25 m fig 1d phosphorus concentration increased by an order of magnitude between the surface 14 9 μg l 1 and the bottom 289 6 μg l 1 fig 1e 3 2 chaoborus effects on sediment water exchange to test the hypothesis that migrating c flavicans larvae enhance sediment water exchange of dissolved substances i e phosphorus and ch4 we conducted an experiment where homogenized lake sediment was incubated in plexiglas cylinders with surface lake water and different number of larvae instars 3 4 added because the cylinders were uncapped during the experiment some water 8 96 4 95 was lost to evaporation at the end of the experiment the water was increasingly more turbid and green with increasing number of added larvae with one exception table s1 a fair amount of dissolved oxygen remained 76 1 98 7 sat with one exception 38 6 sat table s1 total phosphorus in the overlaying water increased linearly by a factor of 5 with increasing number of larvae fig 2 the amount of phosphorus added to the overlying water by the larvae slope of regression line was 0 21 μg p ind 1 over the course of the experiment 9 5 d or 0 022 μg p ind 1 d 1 because one cylinder was approaching hypoxia its gas dynamics e g respiration ch4 oxidation were not comparable with the others and was excluded from further data analysis final dissolved ch4 concentrations increased linearly by a factor of ca 5 with increasing number of larvae however δ13c ch4 was quite stable at an average of 49 9 fig 3 a and b concurrently dissolved pco2 decreased exponentially fig 3c 3 3 diurnal migration of chaoborus on 13th 14th june net sampling showed the integrated density of c flavicans larvae instars 3 4 was quite consistent throughout the sampling cycle mean sd 9229 1393 ind m 2 but their vertical distribution showed marked diurnal changes fig 4 at 21 00 h most of them were at 5 15 m 87 5 of the total at 05 00 h almost all were concentrated at 5 10 m as the day progressed the majority descended to 10 15 m fig 4 the second sampling cycle 21st 22nd june was conducted at a higher frequency to better capture the nighttime ascent of the larvae before sunset most of the larvae were at 10 20 m they ascended at sunset ca 21 00 h and occupied the 0 5 m layer at night between 00 00 h and 02 15 h the larvae descended again in the morning and reached 15 20 m by mid day fig 4 the integrated density was more variable than the first sampling cycle however the average value 9344 4497 ind m 2 was very comparable 3 4 methane release from chaoborus gas vesicles bottle incubation experiments to measure the release of ch4 from the larvae s gas vesicles instars 3 4 were performed three times using larvae collected from the deep 15 20 m and shallow layers 0 5 m the total ch4 released was linearly correlated with number of larvae i e the amount of ch4 released per individual was quite constant within each trial fig 5 a the amounts of ch4 released per individual were almost identical between the two trials with deep water larvae 0 97 and 1 02 nmol ind 1 because the shallow water larvae would have already lost some of their ch4 to the surrounding water before capture as expected the amount of ch4 was much lower for them at 0 19 nmol ind 1 both trials with deep water larvae gave similar δ13c ch4 of 65 5 to 62 9 which is very close to that of the bottom water 65 4 fig 1d shallow water larvae showed a wider range of values from 66 15 up to 58 fig 5b 3 5 system dynamics of methane and oxygen the ch4 oxidation rate was measured to be 0 03 d 1 table s2 emission to air was calculated using a measured fickian diffusion coefficient k600 of 0 23 m d 1 suppl materials and the final dissolved ch4 concentrations average ch4 transport by c flavicans gas vesicles was 0 99 nmol ind 1 d 1 fig 5 under a steady state condition our model predicts a linear relative increase in ch4 as a function of c flavicans abundance fig 6 the accuracy of our model can be checked by using the phosphorus data as reference for bioturbation influence on diffusivity in our case the model outcome for the relative ch4 increase due to bioturbation regression slope 0 035 ind 1 closely matches the observed relative increase in tp regression slope 0 032 ind 1 i e c flavicans bioturbation increased the effective diffusion of tp and ch4 by nearly equal magnitude fig 6 the model performance was not sensitive to ch4 oxidation rate for example decreasing and increasing the specific oxidation rate by 10 fold to 0 003 and 0 3 d 1 respectively will change the regression slope by 6 the percent contribution by gas vesicle transport of sediment ch4 to the overlying water increased with the number of larvae and asymptotically approached 18 of the total ch4 input fig 6 in other words the percent contributions of ch4 by both bioturbation and vesicle transport would approach constant as c flavicans abundance increases though both rates would presumably continue to increase 4 discussion 4 1 bioturbation and nutrient internal loading in the sediment incubation experiment final total phosphorus tp concentrations in the control cylinders without added c flavicans averaged 15 4 μg l 1 almost identical to the in situ surface water value 14 9 μg l 1 fig 1 in contrast tp increased at a rate of 0 022 μg p ind 1 d 1 in the cylinders with added c flavicans larvae because we measured tp particulate dissolved the observed increase in tp cannot be attributed to nutrient recycling within the water e g via excretion or remineralization while we did not count the final number of larvae we did not observe any dead floating larvae in the experiment which may have contributed to tp via decomposition to the contrary live and active larvae were seen in the treatments from the data we can infer that bioturbation by c flavicans increased the effective sediment diffusivity and re introduced sequestered phosphorus to the overlying water as has been previously hypothesized gosselin and hare 2003 and is further supported by our ch4 data and system modelling as expected this extra nutrient stimulated primary production and co2 drawdown in the experiment as indicated by the observed pco2 values fig 3c and the color appearance of the water in the cylinders table s1 extrapolating the experimental results to the observed in situ population density ca 9300 ind m 2 c flavicans bioturbation would add ca 205 μg p m 2 d 1 to the water column this extra phosphorus is likely to first accumulate in the hypolimnion and become available for primary production during spring turnover lake remediation strategies often focus on curbing external phosphorus input schindler 2006 our results however suggest that c flavicans bioturbation is a powerful mechanism to release nutrients from within the sediments and may explain in some cases the ineffectiveness of external nutrient management for improving water clarity mccrackin et al 2017 4 2 breaking the diffusive barrier oxygen loss from the water column to the sediment is generally limited by diffusion across the sediment water interface bryant et al 2010 however hypolimnetic oxygen demand would increase due to increased ch4 oxidation as a result of enhanced introduction of sediment ch4 to the overlying water via bioturbation in the present study the in situ c flavicans larvae population 9300 ind m 2 was equivalent to 23 larvae added to the incubation cylinder which according to our model would increase water column ch4 by 79 over the baseline value via bioturbation alone the in situ hypolimnetic ch4 concentrations averaged 445 μmol l 1 assuming a steady state condition c flavicans bioturbation would increase hypolimnetic ch4 concentration by 352 μmol l 1 and an extra o2 demand of ca 703 μmol l 1 or 22 mg l 1 assuming 1 mol ch4 2 mol o2 for complete oxidation more than sufficient to deplete all hypolimnetic o2 100 saturation at 12 8 mg l 1 at 5 c the chaoborus driven o2 demand would be even stronger when we consider other reduced solutes and organic carbon re introduced by bioturbation plus ch4 release and respiration by the larvae themselves tang et al 2017 taken together c flavicans can greatly increase the hypolimnetic o2 demand and maintain the hypoxic anoxic condition below the thermocline as well as enhance phosphorus loading which may explain why artificial aeration often fails to restore lake quality gächter and wehrli 1998 4 3 a positive feedback loop on climate warming it is estimated that globally lakes account for 6 16 of natural ch4 emissions 7 11 300 mmol m 2 yr 1 driven mainly by physical processes such as ebullition and diffusion whereas the roles of biota besides a small contribution from rooted vegetation are largely ignored bastviken et al 2004 in light of our findings it would be interesting to consider how chaoborus may contribute to ch4 emission the enhanced ch4 flux across the sediment water interface by bioturbation certainly has immediate implications for hypolimnetic oxygen demand the added hypolimnic ch4 due to chaoborus bioturbation would not be captured by conventional flux measurements at the air water interface and the eventual emission of this ch4 to the atmosphere depends on how fast the lake would overturn the lake bathymetry surface area to volume ratio and oxidation rates an additional route by which c flavicans can mediate ch4 flux is by enhancing bubble release through bioturbation bezerra neto et al 2012 which is expected to be the strongest when the larvae perturb the sediment during burrowing at dawn and at dusk likewise the amount of methane directly transported and released by their gas vesicles to the surface water is expected to be the highest during nighttime upward migration both of these processes are unlikely to be resolved by conventional daytime flux measurements the observed c flavicans in situ population density instars 3 4 was ca 9300 ind m 2 based on the bottle incubation experiments with deep water larvae averaged 0 99 nmol ch4 ind 1 we estimate that the amount of deep water ch4 transported by gas vesicles would be ca 9 2 μmol m 2 d 1 the actual amount would likely vary in time and in space as the chaoborus population density and activity change for example tang et al 2017 measured a higher population density of 34 000 ind m 2 for lake soppen in an earlier year likewise mcginnis et al 2017 estimated that in some lakes migrating chaoborus larvae may transport up to 2000 mmol ch4 m 2 yr 1 from the sediment to the overlying water it is likely that some of this methane would be lost to oxidation within the water column and only a small fraction would contribute to emission to air in a recent study carey et al 2018 estimated that direct transport by migratory chaoborus spp mainly c punctipennis in their study accounted for 1 of the diffusive ch4 flux to air although it should be noted that they observed an order of magnitude lower population density than ours eutrophication of inland waters is expected to persist or worsen due to growing human populations and increasing agricultural activities tilman et al 2001 smith 2003 mccrackin et al 2017 compounding the problem global warming will exacerbate eutrophication symptoms for example rising temperature will increase nutrient remineralization in the catchment and sediment and thermal stratification will intensify deoxygenation of the bottom layer jeppesen et al 2009 moss et al 2011 these conditions are inducive to sediment methanogenesis and favor range expansion and proliferation of chaoborus teraguchi 1975 taylor et al 2016 as shown in the present study bioturbation by chaoborus larvae would significantly increase diffusivity at the sediment water interface and re introduce sequestered nutrients organic carbon and ch4 to the overlying water concurrently the migrating larvae enhance the direct transport of sediment ch4 to the surface water for water air gaseous exchange by linking the nutrient and ch4 dynamics in eutrophic lakes chaoborus can thereby play a unique role in driving a positive feedback loop between lake eutrophication ch4 transport and climate warming in the coming decades 4 4 the chaoborus curse in lake restoration the long history of eutrophication has led to a host of public health concerns such as nuisance algal blooms water quality deterioration and wildlife die off causing substantial economic damages pretty et al 2003 dodds et al 2008 studies in eutrophic coastal systems have shown that nutrient reduction often fails to revert the systems to the pre eutrophication state duarte et al 2009 at least in the short term similarly aggressive lake management and restoration strategies have a checkered record of success gächter and wehrli 1998 mccrackin et al 2017 these observations suggest that the systems may have passed the ecological tipping point such that internal forcing tends to maintain the new status quo despite external interventions such as reducing nutrient runoff and artificial aeration as shown in this and earlier studies mcginnis et al 2017 tang et al 2017 chaoborus larvae that have successfully colonized eutrophic inland water bodies drive a positive feedback loop to sustain or even intensify eutrophication and deoxygenation hindering the system s recovery we therefore argue that remediation measures will remain limited until sediment ch4 concentrations drop and chaoborus abundance is greatly reduced understanding this internal chaoborus feedback mechanism may allow resource managers to devise more effective lake restoration strategies 5 conclusion the phantom midge larvae chaoborus spp are prevalent in eutrophic lakes by virtue of their diurnal migration in and out of the sediment they significantly perturb the sediment and reintroduce sequestered nutrients and pollutants to the overlying water essentially maintaining eutrophic lakes in the status quo despite external efforts to curb nutrient inputs and re oxygenate the water column understanding this chaoborus driven positive feedback mechanism may prove critical in effective lake restoration and in predicting lake ecosystem response to intensifying eutrophication and climate change authors contributions kwt sf

19557,to address the management of eutrophication in aquatic systems the behavioral mechanisms that drive change at the individual level must be considered when designing policy interventions this analysis identifies the beliefs that are critical to behavioral change and explores the likelihood that farmers will adopt two management practices believed to be critical to reducing nutrient loading to recommended levels in lake erie we find that there is potential for farmers to adopt key infield practices needed to reduce nutrient inputs and further that increased adoption of such practices is possible by increasing the perceived efficacy of the majority of farmers who are motivated to take action integrating these findings with physical models of nutrient movement indicates that adoption of these practices in combination with edge of field practices can attain phosphorus reduction targets for the lake future research should focus on measuring the effectiveness of education and outreach programs aimed at engaging farmers and promoting adoption of recommended practices such programs may only be effective if they are successfully building farmer confidence in their ability to implement the practices i e perceived self efficacy and increasing farmer s belief in the effectiveness of the practices at reducing nutrient loss and improving local water quality i e perceived response efficacy graphical abstract image 1 keywords nutrient loss best management practices farmer decision making phosphorus communication 1 introduction eutrophication of aquatic systems is a significant challenge across the globe brooks et al 2016 johnk et al 2008 brookes and carey 2011 from lake erie to the gulf of mexico to the baltic sea aquatic systems and the people who rely on them have suffered from excessive nutrient loading nutrient loading in marine systems is caused primarily by nitrogen and leads to hypoxia eutrophication in freshwater systems is caused primarily by phosphorus and leads to harmful algal blooms that restrict recreational opportunities change the taste and odor of local water supplies and pose a public health threat through an increase in toxic microcystin bejankiwar et al 2013 managing eutrophication will require significant changes in farmer behavior as eutrophication is often driven by non point source pollution from agricultural lands i e phosphorus and nitrogen from fertilizer applications key to addressing this challenge is knowing 1 what behaviors or management practices need to change 2 the probability of those changes occurring in response to different policy interventions and 3 the impact of such changes on the downstream ecological system this requires an integrated modeling approach that collectively addresses potential changes in farmer behavior and resulting changes in nutrient inputs into tributaries and the lakes as a result of changing land management decisions recent studies in the great lakes have provided insight into the practices that need to be implemented to help meet the 40 reduction targets set for lakes like lake erie and thus provide insight into the farmer behaviors that need to change keitzer et al 2016 natural resoures conservation service 2016 scavia et al 2017 however these studies have not addressed the likelihood that a sufficient number of farmers will change their behavior to achieve the desired levels of implementation suggested by these watershed and lake ecosystem models there are many factors that can affect a farmer s decision to adopt recommended management practices generally speaking behavioral theories that aim to explain why one might change their behavior in response to a potential threat suggest that the individual must first perceive a threat i e high perceived risk or personal concern and that they must then believe there are effective actions available to reduce the risk i e high perceived efficacy floyd et al 2000 armitage and conner 2001 prior evidence from the western lake erie basin suggests that farmers are highly motivated to reduce nutrient loss on their farm wilson et al 2014 prokup et al 2017 this motivation stems from concern about a variety of perceived threats or problems including the impact of nutrient loss on water quality as well as the economic costs of nutrient loss to the farm and concern about future regulation prokup et al 2017 according to behavioral theories these concerned and motivated farmers must then evaluate the suite of actions available to them in order to identify what practices they can successfully implement on their farm to reduce nutrient loss prior evidence from western lake erie also suggests that farmers perception of their ability to successfully implement recommended practices i e perceived self efficacy or confidence and their perception of how successful each practice will be at mitigating the risks i e perceived response efficacy or perceived effectiveness of the behavior is highly variable and particularly low for those who have not yet adopted the recommenced practices prokup et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 burnett et al 2018 these prior findings suggest that farmers do not lack the motivation to act rather they lack the appropriate levels of perceived efficacy to take action specifically they may lack the confidence in their ability to use recommended practices on their farm i e self efficacy and or the ability of such practices to effectively solve the identified problem i e response efficacy we might expect that only farmers with high levels of perceived efficacy are using the recommended practices according to previous research see markowitz 2013 for a review these individuals are likely those with positive past experience with the practice who have the resources to innovate i e more education older a tolerance for risk who are not limited by external factors i e low farm income and who likely have higher levels of specific knowledge about the recommended behavior herein we assess the probability of farmers in the western lake erie basin adopting two in field practices that have been identified as important to reducing nutrient inputs into the lake scavia et al 2017 specifically we identify what factors influence the likelihood of adopting these two practices focusing on concern and perceived efficacy and the degree to which phosphorus loading would decrease given increased levels of adoption in response to these factors we pose the following overarching research questions what is the likelihood that farmers in the western lake erie basin will adopt cover crops and subsurface application of fertilizer what set of beliefs are most likely to influence the likelihood of adoption and to what extent would changing these beliefs actually increase adoption and reduce nutrient loading to recommended levels our results provide insight into the likely impact of targeted outreach and education on phosphorus loading in the downstream system by examining the extent to which changing critical beliefs may increase adoption of recommended practices and improve water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study context the location of this study was the western lake erie basin wleb watersheds see fig 1 this includes a total of 10 huc 8 watershed boundaries spanning much of northwestern ohio and extending into southern michigan and eastern indiana lake erie is the most biologically and economically productive of the great lakes however this productivity is increasingly threatened by harmful algal blooms habs ohio lake erie phosphorus task force 2013 while phosphorus can enter the lake through a variety of sources and take multiple forms the primary source is dissolved reactive or soluble phosphorus from non point sources entering the lake through the maumee river ohio lake erie phosphorus task force 2013 in the western basin nonpoint sources from the agroecosystem are estimated to contribute over 80 of the annual total phosphorus load driving harmful algal blooms ohio lake erie phosphorus task force 2013 in many ways the current issues with habs in lake erie are a climate adaptation problem or a function of current agricultural management practices not being sufficient given changes in the physical climate system bosch et al 2014 michalak 2013 current nutrient application and retention practices may need to improve or increase given the increased frequency of spring storm events and warmer lake temperatures in the summer ohio lake erie phosphorus task force 2013 the great lakes water quality agreement glwqa nutrients annex subcommittee recommends a 40 phosphorus load reduction in the maumee river from 2008 values to reduce the frequency and severity of habs annex 4 objectives and targets task team 2015 furthermore recent physical models of the watershed indicate that such a reduction is possible with the increased adoption of particular practices across the watershed e g in field practices like cover crops and subsurface placement as well as edge of field practices like filter strips scavia et al 2017 in our analysis we were particularly interested in examining likely farmer adoption of cover crops and subsurface placement in contrast to filter strips it is possible that cover crops and subsurface placement provide enough on farm benefits to justify their adoption without targeted financial investments from the government or other entities to off set short term costs in other words there is the potential to motivate a voluntary change in behavior by relying solely on cognitive tools or interventions for practices that do not negatively impact farm yields and revenue 2 2 survey methods we conducted a representative mail survey of farm households in the western lake erie basin the survey was developed in 2015 and then pilot tested with two farmer focus groups to assess face validity the survey draft was then finalized and mailed to farmers between december 2015 and march 2016 names and mailing addresses for 3273 farmers living in the western lake erie basin were obtained from the company farm market id http www farmmarketid com the sample was stratified based on farm size to ensure that we could represent the farmers managing the largest proportion of acreage as opposed to representing the population of farmers 1 1 this was particularly important as over 50 of the farmers in the basin own small farms covering only 2 3 of the total acreage in the basin the sample was divided by farms 50 249 acres 15 250 499 acres 13 500 999 acres 22 1000 1999 acres 31 and 2000 plus acres 19 the final sample closely matched census data for farms over 50 acres with approximately 28 of the respondents in the under 500 category 22 in the 500 999 category and 50 in the 1000 plus category the census reports 34 24 and 40 in each category respectively survey implementation followed the tailored design method dillman 2007 farmers were first sent a postcard informing them that a survey was coming this postcard also contained a web address for the survey in case they wished to complete the survey online one week after the postcards were mailed out potential participants were mailed a paper copy of the survey a couple of weeks after the first mailing farmers were mailed a second post card reminding them to complete the survey lastly a second copy of the survey was mailed out to the farmers who had not responded 2 3 survey measurement respondents were asked to indicate whether or not they used a particular practice on a given representative field yes no 2 2 respondents were specifically asked to identify a field with a productivity level typical for their farm where a crop was harvested the previous year they then answered the field management questions with this field in mind the specific wording for the two practices we focus on in this analysis was 1 planting cover crops after fall harvest assuming the weather is favorable and 2 subsurface placement of fertilizer via banding or in furrow with seed respondents were then asked to indicate their plans for the upcoming year on that same field for each practice selecting from four categories i will not use it i am unlikely to use it i am likely to use it or i will definitely use it we created a categorical dependent variable for the analysis with three levels using the measure of intention for the upcoming year individuals who reported an intention to definitely use the practice next year were categorized as innovators while those who reported being likely to use the practice next year became the future adopters finally those that indicated they will not use it next year or are unlikely to use it were categorized as the laggards although intentions are not a perfect measure of future behavior prior meta analyses suggest that behavioral intentions and actual behavior correlate around 0 50 sheeran 2002 and a medium to large change in intention leads to a small to medium change in behavior webb and sheeran 2006 regardless we are not assuming intentions perfectly represent future behavior but rather that they serve as an indicator of a motivated audience who would consider acting in the future given the appropriate amount of behavioral control armitage and conner 2001 ajzen 2002 respondents were asked to provide their exact age and indicate their highest level of education from a selection of categories for the analysis the responses were aggregated to represent three categories those with a high school degree or equivalent those with some college or an associate s degree and those with a bachelor s or graduate degree respondents were asked to indicate their annual net farm income from a selection of categories for the analysis the responses were aggregated to represent four categories less than 50 000 50 000 to 99 999 100 00 to 249 999 and 250 000 or greater respondents also indicated the total size of their farm in acres including both rented and owned land finally we collected data on whether or not the representative field was rented and what type of tillage practice was being used on that field during the last growing season for the analysis the tillage type was aggregated to represent two categories no till or other conventional conservation tillage respondents were asked to answer a set of questions meant to measure issue attentiveness as a proxy for awareness and engagement with the issue nutrient loss concern as a proxy for perceived risk perceived efficacy for the particular practice and perceived barriers associated with the particular practice see table 1 for the specific items included in the survey issue attentiveness was measured by averaging three items capturing to what extent the respondent had heard about several agricultural and environmental issues over the past three years nutrient loss concern was measured by averaging nine items capturing to what extent the respondent was concerned about nutrient loss the perceived efficacy of each practice was measured by combining three separate measures in the survey that aimed to capture response efficacy at the field and watershed scale as well as self efficacy at the field scale the two measures of response efficacy were averaged and multiplied by the measure of self efficacy this score was then divided by 40 to create a normalized score of 0 10 for the analysis where 0 no perceived efficacy and 10 strong perceived efficacy the perceived barriers for each practice were unique to the practice for cover crops respondents were asked to indicate to what extent they disagreed or agreed with four statements for subsurface placement respondents responded to two statements for each practice the responses were averaged to create a final measure of perceived barriers unique to each practice 2 4 survey analyses we assessed the internal consistency of the proposed scales using cronbach s alpha this reliability analysis indicated that the proposed measures were acceptable measures of the intended constructs based on a threshold of 0 700 for acceptability kline 2013 we used exploratory factor analysis to further assess the dimensionality of the proposed measures for all of the proposed measures except nutrient loss concern the factor analysis confirmed that the items composed one factor eigenvalue greater than 1 for nutrient loss there were two factors or dimensions with the two items related to concern about regulation and lawsuits forming their own dimension of concern these two items were pulled out into their own measure of legal concern while the remaining seven items were combined into a measure of general nutrient loss concern for the analysis all four of the belief measures were recoded into two categories based on a median split so that they could be treated as nominal independent variables in the analysis all analyses and results are based on the final sample for analysis using listwise deletion we used descriptive statistics to summarize the responses for each category of adoption and one way anova and chi square to assess the initial differences between the groups we then conducted a multinomial logistic regression analysis to assess the impact of farm and farmer characteristics and relevant beliefs on current and future adoption of the two recommended practices we ran a separate model for both cover crops and subsurface placement we then calculated the predicted probability of adoption given an increase in one key independent variable that was highly predictive of adoption i e perceived efficacy 2 5 swat model analyses one of the maumee river watershed swat models used in the scavia et al 2017 multi model study was then applied to estimate total phosphorus load reductions associated with adoption level increases predicted by the behavioral models the baseline representations of cover crops and subsurface placement in the watershed model were adjusted according to the behavioral survey results for adoption of those practices in 2015 i e 14 cover crops and 32 subsurface placement model scenarios were then created that combined the predicted cover crop and subsurface placement adoption levels associated with 20 40 60 80 and 100 increases in perceived efficacy for each of the iterative increases in perceived efficacy and the baseline case three different filter strip adoption levels were assumed estimated current adoption 30 and increases in adoption to cover an additional 25 and 50 of cropland area these combinations generated a total of 18 watershed model simulations i e six levels of cover crop and subsurface placement adoption simulated for three levels of filter strip adoption all management practices were randomly assigned to cropland as opposed to targeting areas with higher phosphorus export filter strips in the baseline scenario were assumed to be of field border quality when generating the updated filter strip placement scenarios the randomizing function was allowed to select agricultural fields that already had these lower quality filter strips in place as well as fields with no filter strips newly placed filter strips were represented with higher treatment efficiencies in the model 3 results 3 1 descriptive results of the 3273 farmers who were mailed a survey 70 addresses were returned unopened as being invalid and 278 farmers contacted us asking to be removed from the study another 351 farmers indicated on their survey that they were either no longer farming or did not plan to farm in the next year these were also removed from the study of the remaining 2574 farmers that we contacted 748 returned usable surveys accounting for an adjusted response rate of 29 1 on average our farmers were 56 years old ranging from 19 to 95 approximately 45 of our sample had a high school education while 30 had some college and 25 had a bachelors or graduate degree the median farm size was 350 owned acres and 500 rented acres ranging from a combined 50 to 6100 acres overall 26 of the respondents had farms under 500 acres 24 had farms between 500 and 1000 acres 30 had farms between 1000 and 2000 acres and 20 had farms over 2000 acres in terms of annual farm income 21 of our final sample had an income under 50 000 25 between 50 000 and 99 999 25 between 100 000 and 249 999 and 28 over 250 000 across our sample 73 of the representative fields were owned and the tillage practices ranged from conventional tillage 22 to conservation tillage 45 and rotational or continuous no till 33 for the 2015 season 14 of respondents indicated they used cover crops on their representative field while 32 reported using some form of subsurface placement for the 2016 season 23 of respondents reported an intention to use cover crops on their representative field while 36 reported an intention to use subsurface placement another 30 reported they were likely to use subsurface placement in the upcoming year while 41 reported the same for cover crops a respective 35 for subsurface placement and 37 for over crops can be considered laggards reporting that they will never use them or are unlikely to use the practice in the upcoming year the mean responses for each of these three categories of respondents across the independent variables of interest are summarized in tables 2 and 3 we used a one way anova and chi square to assess the initial differences between the groups p 05 for cover crops the innovators had significantly higher issue attentiveness than the laggards while both the innovators and the future adopters had greater general nutrient loss concern than the laggards the innovators were also significantly more likely to use no till practices on their chosen field than the other two groups in terms of perceived efficacy and barriers all of the groups were significantly different from one another with innovators having the highest perceived efficacy and lowest perceived barriers followed by the future adopters and then laggards for subsurface placement the innovators had significantly higher issue attentiveness general nutrient loss concern and specific legal concern when compared to the future adopters interestingly the laggards were similar to the innovators the innovators perceived significantly fewer barriers relative to both other groups while all of the groups were different in regards to perceived efficacy with innovators indicating the greatest perceived efficacy followed by the future adopters and the laggards 3 2 regression and swat model results the data met the assumptions for a multinomial logistic regression namely the observations were independent and there was no evidence of multicollinearity the pearson

with high perceived efficacy were 14 9 times more likely to be an innovator than a laggard ci for exp b 6 645 33 508 in addition respondents using no till on their chosen field as opposed to

for exp b 1 005 1 080 3 2 3 to what extent would increasing perceived efficacy increase adoption and reduce nutrient loading to recommended levels given the relative importance of perceived efficacy at differentiating between levels of adoption we then modeled the predicted probability of adoption given incremental increases in perceived efficacy e g 10 increase from baseline measures 20 increase etc up to a 100 increase in perceived efficacy fig 2 a and b 3 3 baseline measures for adoption were based on actual past behavior or the use of the practice on the representative field during the past growing season for example increasing efficacy by 50 for cover crops results in an increase in adoption from 14 at baseline levels to 27 a similar increase in efficacy for subsurface placement results in an increase from 32 to 51 we know that 64 of our sample for cover crops and 66 for subsurface placement constitute our motivated or willing audience i e those who reported the potential use of cover crops in the future according to the predicted probabilities reaching these levels of adoption would require an increase in efficacy of over 90 for cover crops and an increase in efficacy of about 80 for subsurface placement this suggests that on average to move future adopters to the innovation stage we would need to raise their perceived efficacy by approximately 2 points for subsurface placement but approximately 5 points for cover crops on our standardized scale of perceived efficacy from 0 to 10 following the approach described in scavia et al 2017 the results of the watershed model scenarios were evaluated against the 860 mt march july maumee river total phosphorus loading target recommended by the annex 4 objectives and targets task team 2015 by averaging model predicted march july loads for the 2005 2014 period with no increase in filter strip adoption from baseline conditions model results suggest that a combined perceived efficacy increase of approximately 70 for both cover crops and subsurface placement may achieve the march july total phosphorus loading target fig 3 this would correspond with total adoption levels of 34 for cover crops and 60 for subsurface placement well within the potential for adoption among our motivated or willing audience as adoption of filter strips increases the necessary increases in perceived efficacy for cover crops and subsurface placement required to change behavior and achieve the loading target lessens the combination of 25 additional filters i e for a total of 55 of the fields with filter strips lessens the need for perceived efficacy increases to 50 i e for a total of 27 of fields in cover crops and 51 in subsurface placement while 50 additional filters i e for a total of 80 filters lessens the increased need in perceived efficacy to 20 i e for a total of 18 of the fields in cover crops and 39 in subsurface placement both scenarios would result in the loading target being met on average according to the watershed model fig 3 it is important to note that meeting the 860 mt total phosphorus loading target on average over the 2005 2014 period does not ensure that the target will be met for each individual year in fact model results for the 25 filters plus 60 efficacy increase scenario suggest that phosphorus loads will still exceed the target in five out of the ten years simulated 2008 2010 2011 2013 and 2014 it is also important to note that because these simulations relied on single randomization assignments load reduction predictions may vary with alternative or multiple randomization assignments 4 discussion an understanding of the behavioral mechanisms driving decision making are critical to solving eutrophication challenges our data suggest that cognitive solutions or outreach based interventions could be an effective means of achieving the recommended 40 reduction in total phosphorus to western lake erie technological solutions to these challenges often bypass the human behavior at the root of the problem one such example would be geoengineering to reduce nutrients in aquatic systems such as adding aluminum which is perhaps most effective in deep lakes with small watersheds mackay et al 2014 while structural solutions aimed at changing the real costs and benefits of a behavior e g economic incentives are a popular and often effective tool in the agroecosystem limited funding and the tendency for cost sharing programs to be a short term solution leads many practitioners to rely on informational interventions aimed at increasing intrinsic motivation deci et al 1999 these cognitive solutions are designed to educate and inform the target audience ultimately changing the perceived value of costs and benefits over time in an attempt to change behavior our data indicate that farmers in the western lake erie basin are highly motivated to adjust their land management practices from a communication standpoint we know the only individuals who are likely to adjust their beliefs about a particular issue are those that are currently indifferent or do not have a strong position on the issue at stake pomerantz et al 1995 o keefe 2015 using that logic to think about behavioral intentions we might expect that a cognitive intervention would only be effective for those individuals who are already likely to change their behavior i e the 30 to 40 of individuals for the two recommended practices who have not used the practice yet but report a likelihood of using it in the future these are individuals who are considering adopting a particular practice and are most likely to be receptive to efforts meant to inform them about the benefits of the practice in an attempt to motivate a change achieving a change among just these motivated individuals appears to go a long way toward meeting phosphorus reduction targets set for lake erie to engage these individuals the question then becomes what set of beliefs need to change and how likely is it that a change in those beliefs might actually result in a change in behavior and an improvement in environmental conditions as mentioned previously behavioral theories tend to suggest that the last piece of the puzzle before a behavior change occurs relates to the idea of perceived efficacy and individual agency floyd et al 2000 armitage and conner 2001 ajzen 2002 specifically that an individual must perceive both an ability and capacity to take action and that those actions will actually help the individual achieve his or her specific goals our results indicate that this idea of perceived efficacy is especially critical to promoting the recommended behaviors and that increasing perceived efficacy through outreach and education has the potential to meet the phosphorus loading target on average in lake erie this finding is consistent with a recent meta analysis of the farmer adoption literature that indicates the three best determinants of adoption are access to quality information about recommended practices financial capacity and being connected to the right social networks baumgart getz et al 2012 increases in the quality of information and one s financial and social capital are likely to reduce many of the relevant barriers and increase perceived efficacy in our study we measured both the perception that one could perform the behavior i e self efficacy as well as the perception that the performed behavior would actually work at multiple scales i e field and watershed level response efficacy we found that these two constructs were positively related that individuals with greater confidence in their ability to take action were also more likely to believe that the recommended actions would work from a practical standpoint this indicates that it is a combination of not knowing how to implement a practice and not believing it will be effective that seems to inhibit change in the agroecosystem although in many ways the issue of eutrophication in agricultural landscapes is a collective action problem there are also on farm benefits of the recommended actions that may be relevant to individual actors farmers are not just stymied by a concern that the collective will is lacking to improve water quality in lake erie they are similarly concerned about their own ability to implement the practice and achieve on farm benefits e g decreased nutrient loss improved soil health etc the relatively low levels of perceived efficacy that we see for the laggards relative to the future adopters and for the future adopters relative to the innovators suggest that increasing perceived efficacy is a promising solution to increase adoption and achieve the 40 reduction in total phosphorus taking cover crops as example the agronomic literature is rather mixed on the effectiveness of the practice in some cases cover crops in combination with a practice like continuous no till are believed to be an effective tool for phosphorus retention bosch et al 2014 kovar et al 2011 however contradictory studies suggest that cover crops are an ineffective tool for improving surface water quality sharpley and smith 1991 partially due to the benefits being so context dependent dagel et al 2014 duiker and curran 2005 therefore it is not surprising that the perceived efficacy of cover crops is wide ranging among farmers due to the mixed messages they are receiving about this particular strategy in addition cover crops relative to many other recommended practices are recognized as particularly complex to manage this increasing complexity in the decision to use cover crops relative to a practice like subsurface placement results in a higher threshold of efficacy needed to elicit a change in behavior specifically increasing adoption by building perceived efficacy requires twice as large an increase for cover crops as it does for subsurface placement generally speaking this suggests that motivating adoption of subsurface placement as a means of addressing this complex systems challenge may be possible through outreach focused on building perceived efficacy while cover crops may require some combination of efficacy building and cost sharing to decrease the real up front costs and perceived risks associated with adoption previous research indicates that past experience seems to be of particular importance to building perceived efficacy where prior success with a practice builds efficacy and failures decrease efficacy bandura 2002 as a result building perceived efficacy among farmers may be as simple as creating low risk opportunities for individuals to test out a practice at a small scale on their farm we do see evidence in our data that perceived efficacy and the perceived barriers are inversely correlated meaning as one perceives the practice specific barriers as more challenging i e too complex too expensive too time consuming their perceived efficacy decreases this challenge could perhaps be addressed by applying previous research that indicates observing others performing the action can build one s own sense of efficacy and decrease the perceived barriers bandura 1986 this strategy is fairly common in agricultural outreach and education efforts where peer learning is used as a means of educating individuals about conservation practices field days and demonstration farms are often used to demonstrate how a practice has been successfully implemented by a peer with the idea being that this social modeling may encourage adoption among others by increasing the belief that the practice can be successfully adopted on one s own farm rogers 2003 although peer to peer learning is an effective method for building perceived efficacy leveraging other effective strategies from behavioral science could enhance such opportunities for example we know that one way to decrease perceived uncertainty about a behavior is to acknowledge the uncertainty while demonstrating what is known palenchar and heath 2007 while allowing participants to engage in group deliberation about the best actions given the uncertainty roncoli et al 2011 greater opportunities at field days and demonstration events to engage the attendees in discussion about the costs and benefits of the practices and ways to adapt a specific practice to a particular farming context could be very valuable the literature on goal setting also recommends that a concrete written plan be in place to ensure that an individual is able to act on their good intentions locke and latham 2002 ending an outreach event with a planning exercise that helps the attendee map out the steps it will take to implement a particular practice could help each individual realize such a change despite the wealth of knowledge in the behavioral sciences most of these strategies have not been explicitly identified or evaluated to assess to what extent they can successfully alter behavior in complex systems nor has there been serious consideration given to the importance of these behavioral mechanisms in designing policy aimed at achieving ecological outcomes this study is an attempt to consider those behavioral mechanisms and assess to what extent the practices that are physically promising as a solution are also behaviorally realistic future research should design and evaluate interventions aimed at building perceived efficacy to document how to design education and outreach efforts that will be more effective at removing barriers to change at the individual level and increasing adoption of recommended practices in the agricultural landscape 5 conclusions using western lake erie as a case study for eutrophication policy design the evidence suggests that behavioral solutions could play an important role in meeting water quality challenges the in field management practices that have been identified as important to meeting the 40 reduction target have a high probability of being adopted by the target audience and in levels that are necessary to meet the target furthermore increasing adoption of these practices among the motivated future adopters may be possible by building perceived efficacy past failures to engage the agricultural community in voluntary adoption of conservation practices may be due less to a lack of motivation and concern and more a lack of high quality science based outreach communicating how to successfully implement the necessary practices intersecting the results of the behavioral models with the watershed model provides significant benefits as it allows for optimizing the application of limited resources budget and time across bmp implementation and cognitive solutions to increase adoption rates moving forward it is important to consider the likelihood of recommended practice adoption when designing policy but it is also critical to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions at both a local and watershed scale acknowledgments

19557,to address the management of eutrophication in aquatic systems the behavioral mechanisms that drive change at the individual level must be considered when designing policy interventions this analysis identifies the beliefs that are critical to behavioral change and explores the likelihood that farmers will adopt two management practices believed to be critical to reducing nutrient loading to recommended levels in lake erie we find that there is potential for farmers to adopt key infield practices needed to reduce nutrient inputs and further that increased adoption of such practices is possible by increasing the perceived efficacy of the majority of farmers who are motivated to take action integrating these findings with physical models of nutrient movement indicates that adoption of these practices in combination with edge of field practices can attain phosphorus reduction targets for the lake future research should focus on measuring the effectiveness of education and outreach programs aimed at engaging farmers and promoting adoption of recommended practices such programs may only be effective if they are successfully building farmer confidence in their ability to implement the practices i e perceived self efficacy and increasing farmer s belief in the effectiveness of the practices at reducing nutrient loss and improving local water quality i e perceived response efficacy graphical abstract image 1 keywords nutrient loss best management practices farmer decision making phosphorus communication 1 introduction eutrophication of aquatic systems is a significant challenge across the globe brooks et al 2016 johnk et al 2008 brookes and carey 2011 from lake erie to the gulf of mexico to the baltic sea aquatic systems and the people who rely on them have suffered from excessive nutrient loading nutrient loading in marine systems is caused primarily by nitrogen and leads to hypoxia eutrophication in freshwater systems is caused primarily by phosphorus and leads to harmful algal blooms that restrict recreational opportunities change the taste and odor of local water supplies and pose a public health threat through an increase in toxic microcystin bejankiwar et al 2013 managing eutrophication will require significant changes in farmer behavior as eutrophication is often driven by non point source pollution from agricultural lands i e phosphorus and nitrogen from fertilizer applications key to addressing this challenge is knowing 1 what behaviors or management practices need to change 2 the probability of those changes occurring in response to different policy interventions and 3 the impact of such changes on the downstream ecological system this requires an integrated modeling approach that collectively addresses potential changes in farmer behavior and resulting changes in nutrient inputs into tributaries and the lakes as a result of changing land management decisions recent studies in the great lakes have provided insight into the practices that need to be implemented to help meet the 40 reduction targets set for lakes like lake erie and thus provide insight into the farmer behaviors that need to change keitzer et al 2016 natural resoures conservation service 2016 scavia et al 2017 however these studies have not addressed the likelihood that a sufficient number of farmers will change their behavior to achieve the desired levels of implementation suggested by these watershed and lake ecosystem models there are many factors that can affect a farmer s decision to adopt recommended management practices generally speaking behavioral theories that aim to explain why one might change their behavior in response to a potential threat suggest that the individual must first perceive a threat i e high perceived risk or personal concern and that they must then believe there are effective actions available to reduce the risk i e high perceived efficacy floyd et al 2000 armitage and conner 2001 prior evidence from the western lake erie basin suggests that farmers are highly motivated to reduce nutrient loss on their farm wilson et al 2014 prokup et al 2017 this motivation stems from concern about a variety of perceived threats or problems including the impact of nutrient loss on water quality as well as the economic costs of nutrient loss to the farm and concern about future regulation prokup et al 2017 according to behavioral theories these concerned and motivated farmers must then evaluate the suite of actions available to them in order to identify what practices they can successfully implement on their farm to reduce nutrient loss prior evidence from western lake erie also suggests that farmers perception of their ability to successfully implement recommended practices i e perceived self efficacy or confidence and their perception of how successful each practice will be at mitigating the risks i e perceived response efficacy or perceived effectiveness of the behavior is highly variable and particularly low for those who have not yet adopted the recommenced practices prokup et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 burnett et al 2018 these prior findings suggest that farmers do not lack the motivation to act rather they lack the appropriate levels of perceived efficacy to take action specifically they may lack the confidence in their ability to use recommended practices on their farm i e self efficacy and or the ability of such practices to effectively solve the identified problem i e response efficacy we might expect that only farmers with high levels of perceived efficacy are using the recommended practices according to previous research see markowitz 2013 for a review these individuals are likely those with positive past experience with the practice who have the resources to innovate i e more education older a tolerance for risk who are not limited by external factors i e low farm income and who likely have higher levels of specific knowledge about the recommended behavior herein we assess the probability of farmers in the western lake erie basin adopting two in field practices that have been identified as important to reducing nutrient inputs into the lake scavia et al 2017 specifically we identify what factors influence the likelihood of adopting these two practices focusing on concern and perceived efficacy and the degree to which phosphorus loading would decrease given increased levels of adoption in response to these factors we pose the following overarching research questions what is the likelihood that farmers in the western lake erie basin will adopt cover crops and subsurface application of fertilizer what set of beliefs are most likely to influence the likelihood of adoption and to what extent would changing these beliefs actually increase adoption and reduce nutrient loading to recommended levels our results provide insight into the likely impact of targeted outreach and education on phosphorus loading in the downstream system by examining the extent to which changing critical beliefs may increase adoption of recommended practices and improve water quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study context the location of this study was the western lake erie basin wleb watersheds see fig 1 this includes a total of 10 huc 8 watershed boundaries spanning much of northwestern ohio and extending into southern michigan and eastern indiana lake erie is the most biologically and economically productive of the great lakes however this productivity is increasingly threatened by harmful algal blooms habs ohio lake erie phosphorus task force 2013 while phosphorus can enter the lake through a variety of sources and take multiple forms the primary source is dissolved reactive or soluble phosphorus from non point sources entering the lake through the maumee river ohio lake erie phosphorus task force 2013 in the western basin nonpoint sources from the agroecosystem are estimated to contribute over 80 of the annual total phosphorus load driving harmful algal blooms ohio lake erie phosphorus task force 2013 in many ways the current issues with habs in lake erie are a climate adaptation problem or a function of current agricultural management practices not being sufficient given changes in the physical climate system bosch et al 2014 michalak 2013 current nutrient application and retention practices may need to improve or increase given the increased frequency of spring storm events and warmer lake temperatures in the summer ohio lake erie phosphorus task force 2013 the great lakes water quality agreement glwqa nutrients annex subcommittee recommends a 40 phosphorus load reduction in the maumee river from 2008 values to reduce the frequency and severity of habs annex 4 objectives and targets task team 2015 furthermore recent physical models of the watershed indicate that such a reduction is possible with the increased adoption of particular practices across the watershed e g in field practices like cover crops and subsurface placement as well as edge of field practices like filter strips scavia et al 2017 in our analysis we were particularly interested in examining likely farmer adoption of cover crops and subsurface placement in contrast to filter strips it is possible that cover crops and subsurface placement provide enough on farm benefits to justify their adoption without targeted financial investments from the government or other entities to off set short term costs in other words there is the potential to motivate a voluntary change in behavior by relying solely on cognitive tools or interventions for practices that do not negatively impact farm yields and revenue 2 2 survey methods we conducted a representative mail survey of farm households in the western lake erie basin the survey was developed in 2015 and then pilot tested with two farmer focus groups to assess face validity the survey draft was then finalized and mailed to farmers between december 2015 and march 2016 names and mailing addresses for 3273 farmers living in the western lake erie basin were obtained from the company farm market id http www farmmarketid com the sample was stratified based on farm size to ensure that we could represent the farmers managing the largest proportion of acreage as opposed to representing the population of farmers 1 1 this was particularly important as over 50 of the farmers in the basin own small farms covering only 2 3 of the total acreage in the basin the sample was divided by farms 50 249 acres 15 250 499 acres 13 500 999 acres 22 1000 1999 acres 31 and 2000 plus acres 19 the final sample closely matched census data for farms over 50 acres with approximately 28 of the respondents in the under 500 category 22 in the 500 999 category and 50 in the 1000 plus category the census reports 34 24 and 40 in each category respectively survey implementation followed the tailored design method dillman 2007 farmers were first sent a postcard informing them that a survey was coming this postcard also contained a web address for the survey in case they wished to complete the survey online one week after the postcards were mailed out potential participants were mailed a paper copy of the survey a couple of weeks after the first mailing farmers were mailed a second post card reminding them to complete the survey lastly a second copy of the survey was mailed out to the farmers who had not responded 2 3 survey measurement respondents were asked to indicate whether or not they used a particular practice on a given representative field yes no 2 2 respondents were specifically asked to identify a field with a productivity level typical for their farm where a crop was harvested the previous year they then answered the field management questions with this field in mind the specific wording for the two practices we focus on in this analysis was 1 planting cover crops after fall harvest assuming the weather is favorable and 2 subsurface placement of fertilizer via banding or in furrow with seed respondents were then asked to indicate their plans for the upcoming year on that same field for each practice selecting from four categories i will not use it i am unlikely to use it i am likely to use it or i will definitely use it we created a categorical dependent variable for the analysis with three levels using the measure of intention for the upcoming year individuals who reported an intention to definitely use the practice next year were categorized as innovators while those who reported being likely to use the practice next year became the future adopters finally those that indicated they will not use it next year or are unlikely to use it were categorized as the laggards although intentions are not a perfect measure of future behavior prior meta analyses suggest that behavioral intentions and actual behavior correlate around 0 50 sheeran 2002 and a medium to large change in intention leads to a small to medium change in behavior webb and sheeran 2006 regardless we are not assuming intentions perfectly represent future behavior but rather that they serve as an indicator of a motivated audience who would consider acting in the future given the appropriate amount of behavioral control armitage and conner 2001 ajzen 2002 respondents were asked to provide their exact age and indicate their highest level of education from a selection of categories for the analysis the responses were aggregated to represent three categories those with a high school degree or equivalent those with some college or an associate s degree and those with a bachelor s or graduate degree respondents were asked to indicate their annual net farm income from a selection of categories for the analysis the responses were aggregated to represent four categories less than 50 000 50 000 to 99 999 100 00 to 249 999 and 250 000 or greater respondents also indicated the total size of their farm in acres including both rented and owned land finally we collected data on whether or not the representative field was rented and what type of tillage practice was being used on that field during the last growing season for the analysis the tillage type was aggregated to represent two categories no till or other conventional conservation tillage respondents were asked to answer a set of questions meant to measure issue attentiveness as a proxy for awareness and engagement with the issue nutrient loss concern as a proxy for perceived risk perceived efficacy for the particular practice and perceived barriers associated with the particular practice see table 1 for the specific items included in the survey issue attentiveness was measured by averaging three items capturing to what extent the respondent had heard about several agricultural and environmental issues over the past three years nutrient loss concern was measured by averaging nine items capturing to what extent the respondent was concerned about nutrient loss the perceived efficacy of each practice was measured by combining three separate measures in the survey that aimed to capture response efficacy at the field and watershed scale as well as self efficacy at the field scale the two measures of response efficacy were averaged and multiplied by the measure of self efficacy this score was then divided by 40 to create a normalized score of 0 10 for the analysis where 0 no perceived efficacy and 10 strong perceived efficacy the perceived barriers for each practice were unique to the practice for cover crops respondents were asked to indicate to what extent they disagreed or agreed with four statements for subsurface placement respondents responded to two statements for each practice the responses were averaged to create a final measure of perceived barriers unique to each practice 2 4 survey analyses we assessed the internal consistency of the proposed scales using cronbach s alpha this reliability analysis indicated that the proposed measures were acceptable measures of the intended constructs based on a threshold of 0 700 for acceptability kline 2013 we used exploratory factor analysis to further assess the dimensionality of the proposed measures for all of the proposed measures except nutrient loss concern the factor analysis confirmed that the items composed one factor eigenvalue greater than 1 for nutrient loss there were two factors or dimensions with the two items related to concern about regulation and lawsuits forming their own dimension of concern these two items were pulled out into their own measure of legal concern while the remaining seven items were combined into a measure of general nutrient loss concern for the analysis all four of the belief measures were recoded into two categories based on a median split so that they could be treated as nominal independent variables in the analysis all analyses and results are based on the final sample for analysis using listwise deletion we used descriptive statistics to summarize the responses for each category of adoption and one way anova and chi square to assess the initial differences between the groups we then conducted a multinomial logistic regression analysis to assess the impact of farm and farmer characteristics and relevant beliefs on current and future adoption of the two recommended practices we ran a separate model for both cover crops and subsurface placement we then calculated the predicted probability of adoption given an increase in one key independent variable that was highly predictive of adoption i e perceived efficacy 2 5 swat model analyses one of the maumee river watershed swat models used in the scavia et al 2017 multi model study was then applied to estimate total phosphorus load reductions associated with adoption level increases predicted by the behavioral models the baseline representations of cover crops and subsurface placement in the watershed model were adjusted according to the behavioral survey results for adoption of those practices in 2015 i e 14 cover crops and 32 subsurface placement model scenarios were then created that combined the predicted cover crop and subsurface placement adoption levels associated with 20 40 60 80 and 100 increases in perceived efficacy for each of the iterative increases in perceived efficacy and the baseline case three different filter strip adoption levels were assumed estimated current adoption 30 and increases in adoption to cover an additional 25 and 50 of cropland area these combinations generated a total of 18 watershed model simulations i e six levels of cover crop and subsurface placement adoption simulated for three levels of filter strip adoption all management practices were randomly assigned to cropland as opposed to targeting areas with higher phosphorus export filter strips in the baseline scenario were assumed to be of field border quality when generating the updated filter strip placement scenarios the randomizing function was allowed to select agricultural fields that already had these lower quality filter strips in place as well as fields with no filter strips newly placed filter strips were represented with higher treatment efficiencies in the model 3 results 3 1 descriptive results of the 3273 farmers who were mailed a survey 70 addresses were returned unopened as being invalid and 278 farmers contacted us asking to be removed from the study another 351 farmers indicated on their survey that they were either no longer farming or did not plan to farm in the next year these were also removed from the study of the remaining 2574 farmers that we contacted 748 returned usable surveys accounting for an adjusted response rate of 29 1 on average our farmers were 56 years old ranging from 19 to 95 approximately 45 of our sample had a high school education while 30 had some college and 25 had a bachelors or graduate degree the median farm size was 350 owned acres and 500 rented acres ranging from a combined 50 to 6100 acres overall 26 of the respondents had farms under 500 acres 24 had farms between 500 and 1000 acres 30 had farms between 1000 and 2000 acres and 20 had farms over 2000 acres in terms of annual farm income 21 of our final sample had an income under 50 000 25 between 50 000 and 99 999 25 between 100 000 and 249 999 and 28 over 250 000 across our sample 73 of the representative fields were owned and the tillage practices ranged from conventional tillage 22 to conservation tillage 45 and rotational or continuous no till 33 for the 2015 season 14 of respondents indicated they used cover crops on their representative field while 32 reported using some form of subsurface placement for the 2016 season 23 of respondents reported an intention to use cover crops on their representative field while 36 reported an intention to use subsurface placement another 30 reported they were likely to use subsurface placement in the upcoming year while 41 reported the same for cover crops a respective 35 for subsurface placement and 37 for over crops can be considered laggards reporting that they will never use them or are unlikely to use the practice in the upcoming year the mean responses for each of these three categories of respondents across the independent variables of interest are summarized in tables 2 and 3 we used a one way anova and chi square to assess the initial differences between the groups p 05 for cover crops the innovators had significantly higher issue attentiveness than the laggards while both the innovators and the future adopters had greater general nutrient loss concern than the laggards the innovators were also significantly more likely to use no till practices on their chosen field than the other two groups in terms of perceived efficacy and barriers all of the groups were significantly different from one another with innovators having the highest perceived efficacy and lowest perceived barriers followed by the future adopters and then laggards for subsurface placement the innovators had significantly higher issue attentiveness general nutrient loss concern and specific legal concern when compared to the future adopters interestingly the laggards were similar to the innovators the innovators perceived significantly fewer barriers relative to both other groups while all of the groups were different in regards to perceived efficacy with innovators indicating the greatest perceived efficacy followed by the future adopters and the laggards 3 2 regression and swat model results the data met the assumptions for a multinomial logistic regression namely the observations were independent and there was no evidence of multicollinearity the pearson s correlation coefficient did not exceed 0 6 for any pairwise comparisons of the independent variables similarly the tolerance and vif statistics were acceptable using linear regression as a proxy i e tolerance 0 2 menard 1995 and average vif not substantially greater than 1 bowerman and o connell 1990 there were also over 30 cases or survey responses per independent variable in the final model 3 2

were 10 727 times more likely to be an innovator than a laggard ci for exp b 5 929 19 410 3 2 2 what is the likelihood that farmers will adopt cover crops what set of beliefs influence their likelihood of adoption for cover crops we found that 322 of our 748 cases were missing at least one of the variables in the analysis using listwise deletion that left us with 426 valid responses for analysis the final model was statistically significant χ2 26 n 426 177 96 p 000 indicating that the model was able to distinguish between different categories of adoption the model as a whole explained between 34 cox and snell and 39 nagelkerke of the variance in adoption the likelihood ratio tests indicated that there was a significant effect of cover crop barriers χ2 2 n 426 25 66 p 000

efficacy were 3 4 times more likely to be a future adopter as opposed to a laggard ci for exp b 1 969 5 876 there were several other effects differentiating innovators from laggards in addition to the two identified for future adopters similarly respondents with high perceived barriers were 0 17 times more likely to be a laggard as opposed to an innovator ci for exp b 0 079 0 375 while respondents with high perceived efficacy were 14 9 times more likely to be an innovator than a laggard ci for exp b 6 645 33 508 in addition respondents using no till on their chosen field as opposed to conventional or conservation tillage were 2 57 times more likely to be an innovator than a laggard ci for exp b 1 308 5 048 respondents with more than a high school education were 2 2 times more likely to be an innovator than a laggard ci for exp b 1 138 4 301 while every increase of total farm acreage by 100 acres made respondents 1 04 times more likely to be an innovator than a laggard ci for exp b 1 005 1 080 3 2 3 to what extent would increasing perceived efficacy increase adoption and reduce nutrient loading to recommended levels given the relative importance of perceived efficacy at differentiating between levels of adoption we then modeled the predicted probability of adoption given incremental increases in perceived efficacy e g 10 increase from baseline measures 20 increase etc up to a 100 increase in perceived efficacy fig 2 a and b 3 3 baseline measures for adoption were based on actual past behavior or the use of the practice on the representative field during the past growing season for example increasing efficacy by 50 for cover crops results in an increase in adoption from 14 at baseline levels to 27 a similar increase in efficacy for subsurface placement results in an increase from 32 to 51 we know that 64 of our sample for cover crops and 66 for subsurface placement constitute our motivated or willing audience i e those who reported the potential use of cover crops in the future according to the predicted probabilities reaching these levels of adoption would require an increase in efficacy of over 90 for cover crops and an increase in efficacy of about 80 for subsurface placement this suggests that on average to move future adopters to the innovation stage we would need to raise their perceived efficacy by approximately 2 points for subsurface placement but approximately 5 points for cover crops on our standardized scale of perceived efficacy from 0 to 10 following the approach described in scavia et al 2017 the results of the watershed model scenarios were evaluated against the 860 mt march july maumee river total phosphorus loading target recommended by the annex 4 objectives and targets task team 2015 by averaging model predicted march july loads for the 2005 2014 period with no increase in filter strip adoption from baseline conditions model results suggest that a combined perceived efficacy increase of approximately 70 for both cover crops and subsurface placement may achieve the march july total phosphorus loading target fig 3 this would correspond with total adoption levels of 34 for cover crops and 60 for subsurface placement well within the potential for adoption among our motivated or willing audience as adoption of filter strips increases the necessary increases in perceived efficacy for cover crops and subsurface placement required to change behavior and achieve the loading target lessens the combination of 25 additional filters i e for a total of 55 of the fields with filter strips lessens the need for perceived efficacy increases to 50 i e for a total of 27 of fields in cover crops and 51 in subsurface placement while 50 additional filters i e for a total of 80 filters lessens the increased need in perceived efficacy to 20 i e for a total of 18 of the fields in cover crops and 39 in subsurface placement both scenarios would result in the loading target being met on average according to the watershed model fig 3 it is important to note that meeting the 860 mt total phosphorus loading target on average over the 2005 2014 period does not ensure that the target will be met for each individual year in fact model results for the 25 filters plus 60 efficacy increase scenario suggest that phosphorus loads will still exceed the target in five out of the ten years simulated 2008 2010 2011 2013 and 2014 it is also important to note that because these simulations relied on single randomization assignments load reduction predictions may vary with alternative or multiple randomization assignments 4 discussion an understanding of the behavioral mechanisms driving decision making are critical to solving eutrophication challenges our data suggest that cognitive solutions or outreach based interventions could be an effective means of achieving the recommended 40 reduction in total phosphorus to western lake erie technological solutions to these challenges often bypass the human behavior at the root of the problem one such example would be geoengineering to reduce nutrients in aquatic systems such as adding aluminum which is perhaps most effective in deep lakes with small watersheds mackay et al 2014 while structural solutions aimed at changing the real costs and benefits of a behavior e g economic incentives are a popular and often effective tool in the agroecosystem limited funding and the tendency for cost sharing programs to be a short term solution leads many practitioners to rely on informational interventions aimed at increasing intrinsic motivation deci et al 1999 these cognitive solutions are designed to educate and inform the target audience ultimately changing the perceived value of costs and benefits over time in an attempt to change behavior our data indicate that farmers in the western lake erie basin are highly motivated to adjust their land management practices from a communication standpoint we know the only individuals who are likely to adjust their beliefs about a particular issue are those that are currently indifferent or do not have a strong position on the issue at stake pomerantz et al 1995 o keefe 2015 using that logic to think about behavioral intentions we might expect that a cognitive intervention would only be effective for those individuals who are already likely to change their behavior i e the 30 to 40 of individuals for the two recommended practices who have not used the practice yet but report a likelihood of using it in the future these are individuals who are considering adopting a particular practice and are most likely to be receptive to efforts meant to inform them about the benefits of the practice in an attempt to motivate a change achieving a change among just these motivated individuals appears to go a long way toward meeting phosphorus reduction targets set for lake erie to engage these individuals the question then becomes what set of beliefs need to change and how likely is it that a change in those beliefs might actually result in a change in behavior and an improvement in environmental conditions as mentioned previously behavioral theories tend to suggest that the last piece of the puzzle before a behavior change occurs relates to the idea of perceived efficacy and individual agency floyd et al 2000 armitage and conner 2001 ajzen 2002 specifically that an individual must perceive both an ability and capacity to take action and that those actions will actually help the individual achieve his or her specific goals our results indicate that this idea of perceived efficacy is especially critical to promoting the recommended behaviors and that increasing perceived efficacy through outreach and education has the potential to meet the phosphorus loading target on average in lake erie this finding is consistent with a recent meta analysis of the farmer adoption literature that indicates the three best determinants of adoption are access to quality information about recommended practices financial capacity and being connected to the right social networks baumgart getz et al 2012 increases in the quality of information and one s financial and social capital are likely to reduce many of the relevant barriers and increase perceived efficacy in our study we measured both the perception that one could perform the behavior i e self efficacy as well as the perception that the performed behavior would actually work at multiple scales i e field and watershed level response efficacy we found that these two constructs were positively related that individuals with greater confidence in their ability to take action were also more likely to believe that the recommended actions would work from a practical standpoint this indicates that it is a combination of not knowing how to implement a practice and not believing it will be effective that seems to inhibit change in the agroecosystem although in many ways the issue of eutrophication in agricultural landscapes is a collective action problem there are also on farm benefits of the recommended actions that may be relevant to individual actors farmers are not just stymied by a concern that the collective will is lacking to improve water quality in lake erie they are similarly concerned about their own ability to implement the practice and achieve on farm benefits e g decreased nutrient loss improved soil health etc the relatively low levels of perceived efficacy that we see for the laggards relative to the future adopters and for the future adopters relative to the innovators suggest that increasing perceived efficacy is a promising solution to increase adoption and achieve the 40 reduction in total phosphorus taking cover crops as example the agronomic literature is rather mixed on the effectiveness of the practice in some cases cover crops in combination with a practice like continuous no till are believed to be an effective tool for phosphorus retention bosch et al 2014 kovar et al 2011 however contradictory studies suggest that cover crops are an ineffective tool for improving surface water quality sharpley and smith 1991 partially due to the benefits being so context dependent dagel et al 2014 duiker and curran 2005 therefore it is not surprising that the perceived efficacy of cover crops is wide ranging among farmers due to the mixed messages they are receiving about this particular strategy in addition cover crops relative to many other recommended practices are recognized as particularly complex to manage this increasing complexity in the decision to use cover crops relative to a practice like subsurface placement results in a higher threshold of efficacy needed to elicit a change in behavior specifically increasing adoption by building perceived efficacy requires twice as large an increase for cover crops as it does for subsurface placement generally speaking this suggests that motivating adoption of subsurface placement as a means of addressing this complex systems challenge may be possible through outreach focused on building perceived efficacy while cover crops may require some combination of efficacy building and cost sharing to decrease the real up front costs and perceived risks associated with adoption previous research indicates that past experience seems to be of particular importance to building perceived efficacy where prior success with a practice builds efficacy and failures decrease efficacy bandura 2002 as a result building perceived efficacy among farmers may be as simple as creating low risk opportunities for individuals to test out a practice at a small scale on their farm we do see evidence in our data that perceived efficacy and the perceived barriers are inversely correlated meaning as one perceives the practice specific barriers as more challenging i e too complex too expensive too time consuming their perceived efficacy decreases this challenge could perhaps be addressed by applying previous research that indicates observing others performing the action can build one s own sense of efficacy and decrease the perceived barriers bandura 1986 this strategy is fairly common in agricultural outreach and education efforts where peer learning is used as a means of educating individuals about conservation practices field days and demonstration farms are often used to demonstrate how a practice has been successfully implemented by a peer with the idea being that this social modeling may encourage adoption among others by increasing the belief that the practice can be successfully adopted on one s own farm rogers 2003 although peer to peer learning is an effective method for building perceived efficacy leveraging other effective strategies from behavioral science could enhance such opportunities for example we know that one way to decrease perceived uncertainty about a behavior is to acknowledge the uncertainty while demonstrating what is known palenchar and heath 2007 while allowing participants to engage in group deliberation about the best actions given the uncertainty roncoli et al 2011 greater opportunities at field days and demonstration events to engage the attendees in discussion about the costs and benefits of the practices and ways to adapt a specific practice to a particular farming context could be very valuable the literature on goal setting also recommends that a concrete written plan be in place to ensure that an individual is able to act on their good intentions locke and latham 2002 ending an outreach event with a planning exercise that helps the attendee map out the steps it will take to implement a particular practice could help each individual realize such a change despite the wealth of knowledge in the behavioral sciences most of these strategies have not been explicitly identified or evaluated to assess to what extent they can successfully alter behavior in complex systems nor has there been serious consideration given to the importance of these behavioral mechanisms in designing policy aimed at achieving ecological outcomes this study is an attempt to consider those behavioral mechanisms and assess to what extent the practices that are physically promising as a solution are also behaviorally realistic future research should design and evaluate interventions aimed at building perceived efficacy to document how to design education and outreach efforts that will be more effective at removing barriers to change at the individual level and increasing adoption of recommended practices in the agricultural landscape 5 conclusions using western lake erie as a case study for eutrophication policy design the evidence suggests that behavioral solutions could play an important role in meeting water quality challenges the in field management practices that have been identified as important to meeting the 40 reduction target have a high probability of being adopted by the target audience and in levels that are necessary to meet the target furthermore increasing adoption of these practices among the motivated future adopters may be possible by building perceived efficacy past failures to engage the agricultural community in voluntary adoption of conservation practices may be due less to a lack of motivation and concern and more a lack of high quality science based outreach communicating how to successfully implement the necessary practices intersecting the results of the behavioral models with the watershed model provides significant benefits as it allows for optimizing the application of limited resources budget and time across bmp implementation and cognitive solutions to increase adoption rates moving forward it is important to consider the likelihood of recommended practice adoption when designing policy but it is also critical to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions at both a local and watershed scale acknowledgments

19558,due to the aeration system biological reactors are the most energy consuming facilities of convectional wwtps many biological reactors work under intermittent aeration regime the optimization of the aeration process air diffuser layout air flow rate per diffuser aeration length is necessary to ensure an efficient performance satisfying the effluent requirements with the minimum energy consumption this work develops a cfd modelling of an activated sludge reactor asr which works under intermittent aeration regime the model considers the fluid dynamic and biological processes within the asr the biological simulation which is transient takes into account the intermittent aeration regime the cfd modelling is employed for the selection of the aeration system of an asr two different aeration configurations are simulated the model evaluates the aeration power consumption necessary to satisfy the effluent requirements an improvement of 2 8 in terms of energy consumption is achieved by modifying the air diffuser layout an analysis of the influence of the air flow rate per diffuser on the asr performance is carried out the results show a reduction of 14 5 in the energy consumption of the aeration system when the air flow rate per diffuser is reduced the model provides an insight into the aeration inefficiencies produced within asrs graphical abstract image keywords wwtp cfd

efficiency wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction wastewater treatment involves a combination of physical chemical and biological processes in order to remove the different pollutants from the incoming wastewater to achieve it the process of aeration is a must in the majority of wastewater treatment plants wwtp however it represents the largest proportion of the plant energy consumption ranging from 45 to 75 of the plant energy expenditure reardon 1995 it is interesting to analyse the aeration system of biological reactors since it is the most important factor to achieve an optimal energy performance one of the most extended types of biological reactor configuration is the plug flow very common in large plants as well as in those where simplicity and robustness is a priority the application of accurate on off aeration cycles intensity and length can diminish a significant percentage of the energy costs so an efficient aeration strategy analysed previously to be applied in plant is convenient most of the design and operation wwtp handbooks focuses on the biological phenomena which occurs within the reactors without taking into account the fluid dynamic phenomena since biological modelling could provide enough information to satisfy quality standards of the effluent the series of activated sludge models asm henze et al 2000 developed by the international water association iwa are the most popular models for the design of activated reactors some commercial software i e west biowin solves the asm equations assuming that the flow behaves as a perfect mixed or plug flow however some authors ouedraogo et al 2016 point out the importance of fluid dynamics in the pollutant removal of a biological reactor a correct fluid dynamic design improves the reactor efficiency reducing operational costs in this context computational fluid dynamics cfd arises as an adequate tool for modelling fluid dynamic and biological processes which take place in wwtp reactors one of the reasons of the growth of the applications of cfd in wwtp analysis is its ability to combine mathematical models of phenomena from different nature fluid dynamics biological processes etc cfd has been widely employed to simulate the different hydraulic and biological phenomena which occurs within biological reactors many authors have developed numerical models to simulate the flow behaviour in biological reactors most of these works employed the k ε turbulence model i e yang et al 2011 stamou 2008 although some authors have also achieved good agreement with experimental data by using k ω models gresch et al 2011 the multiphase liquid air bubbles modelling has been extensively investigated in the literature there are two main alternative approaches to model bubble columns reactors euler euler gresch et al 2011 cockx et al 1997 or euler lagrange gong et al 2007 although euler lagrange approach allows the calculation of each single bubble trajectory it requires a high computational cost for this reason euler euler approach is more common in bubble flow simulations residence time distribution rtd analysis is commonly employed to evaluate the hydraulic efficiency of biological reactors teixeira and siqueira 2008 a mass of tracer is released at the reactor inlet the rtd curve of the reactor is obtained from the temporal evolution of tracer concentration at the reactor outlet there are some publications concerning pulse tracer rtd experiments to evaluate the hydraulic performance of asrs sánchez et al 2016 sarkar et al 2017 the rtd curve of a reactor can be calculated by cfd from the velocity field previously obtained using two different techniques particle tracking method stropky et al 2007 or solving the transport equation of a passive tracer talvy et al 2011 moullec et al 2008 compared both numerical rtd techniques achieving a good agreement between both numerical curves and the experimental one obtained in a bench scale reactor one of the major challenges in the activated sludge reactors asr modelling is the calculation of oxygen mass transfer from air bubbles to the liquid the oxygen mass transfer modelling requires the evaluation of the mass transfer coefficient kla traditional asr design software employs a global kla coefficient in each tank however cfd is able to calculate a kla field within the reactor from the local values of air volume fraction obtained in the multiphase simulation cockx et al 2001 incorporated the penetration theory of higbie 1935 equation to his cfd model to predict the local values of kla the numerical results were numerically validated in an airlift pilot plant fayolle et al 2007 also employs higbie equation to calculate numerically the oxygen mass transfer the results were experimentally validated and show a notable influence of the fluid dynamics on the oxygen mass transfer apart from fluid dynamics and mass transference cfd is able to incorporate biokinetic reactions into the reactor model few authors have integrated the biological processes by means of asm into cfd models by this way it is possible to analyse the influence of geometry wastewater flow rate air diffuser layout or aeration regime on the removal of pollutants glover et al 2006 developed a complete cfd asm1 model of an asr and used it to evaluate the performance of the reactor moullec et al 2010a developed and experimentally validated a complete cfd asm1 modelling of an activated sludge channel reactor under pseudo steady state one of the conclusion of the work was that a compromise between precision and grid size has to be found since the coupling with biokinetics is computationally expensive lei and ni 2014 developed a complete numerical modelling cfd asm1 of an oxidation ditch considering three different phases sewage sludge and air bubble the numerical results showed a good agreement with the experimental data more recently yang et al 2016 carried out a cfd modelling of a lab scale membrane bioreactor mbr they employed a simplified version of the asm1 model and considered a three phase flow the results showed pretty good consistency with the experimental data and the model was employed to evaluate the performance of a full scale mbr yang et al 2017 a complete review about the applications of cfd tools to asrs analysis can be found in the work of karpinska and bridgeman 2016 in the review of ho et al 2017 there are some examples of the application of cfd asm models for the analysis of waste stabilization pond systems all the above mentioned works correspond to cfd models where the biological simulation is carried out under steady conditions however many asrs operate under intermittent aeration regime switching on and off the aeration system the aim of this work is to develop a cfd modelling capable to simulate the biokinetics within an asr under intermittent aeration regime the cfd modelling also takes into account fluid dynamic and oxygen transfer phenomena the modelling is applied to the design of an asr the modelling is employed to find the aeration system which satisfies the standard quality effluent with the minimum energy consumption an analysis of the influence of the air flow rate per diffusor on the aeration energy consumption is also carried out 2 problem description an old wwtp needs to be restored in order to treat the wastewater of a village 2500 population before its discharge into the sea one of the most critical conditions imposed for the enlargement of the wwtp is to transform the actual storm tank 440 m3 into the biological reactor of the plant modified ludzack ettinger system there are two identical parallel asrs each one is formed by two zones anoxic chamber 91 m3 and oxic chamber 128 m3 they are separated by a partition wall which allows the pass of the water over it the anoxic chamber has a mixer impeller sulzer xrw210 and the floor of the oxic chamber is covered by air diffusers a fraction of the asr effluent internal recirculation of mixed liquor is returned to the anoxic chamber and the rest flows into a clarifier where the sludge is separated from the water most of the sludge from the settler is directly recycled to the asr inlet external recirculation however a small sludge fraction is conduced to the thickener and centrifuge where the liquid part is extracted and leaded to the wwtp inlet fig 1 shows the secondary treatment diagram of the considered wwtp two aeration configurations are considered for each one to the two asrs configuration 1 c1 consists of 48 air diffusers abs pik300 7 nm3 h diff distributed uniformly on the floor of the oxic chamber 8 rows 6 air diffusers per row fig 2 a shows the spatial distribution of the air diffusers in c1 configuration 2 c2 involves 80 air diffusers abs kki215 4 nm3 h diff with a heterogeneous layout the spatial distribution is formed by 10 rows with 8 air diffusers per row according to the specifications of the manufacturer the representative bubble diameter is 2 mm in both devices at the beginning of the chamber where the oxygen demand is higher the rows are closer than at the end of the chamber fig 2b shows the spatial distribution in c2 although c2 needs a higher initial investment some manuals epa 1989 point out that aeration efficiency improves by increasing air diffusers density more air diffusers per m2 for the same total air flow rate and by avoiding a uniform layout more air diffusers in the first part of the chamber where the oxygen demand is higher it is worthwhile to evaluate the improvement in the process performance and the savings produced by this aeration configuration regarding the operating conditions and effluent requirement parameters the wastewater flow rate treated in the reactor is qin 500 m3 d the characteristics of the influent are cod 525 mg l n no3 0 85 mg l n nh4 45 9 mg l and tss 209 mg l according to the european council directive 91 271 eec transposed to the spanish legislation rd 11 1995 applied for the local hydrographic confederation the effluent quality requirements are cod 50 mg l n no3 10 mg l n nh4 1 5 mg l and tss 20 mg l in order to satisfy the effluent requirements as observed in fig 1 the internal recirculation is set to qintr 500 1 m3 d per lane while the recycled sludge flow rate from the settler is qextr 490 m3 d the settler is assumed to have an efficiency defined as fraction of non settleable solids of ηset 0 995 thickener and centrifuge efficiency are 0 96 while their dry solids fraction are 3 4 and 21 respectively during the process the aeration pid controller based on an ammonia set point switches on and off the air blower a complete aeration cycle involves the on and the off sub cycles the controller is set to keep an average effluent ammonia concentration of 1 4 mg l below the standard requirement 1 5 mg l if the average effluent ammonia concentration during a cycle is above 1 4 mg l the pid controller increases the on sub cycle length and vice versa an excessive number of starts stops per hour can reduce the blower motor lifespan on the other hand the more time the aeration is activated the less efficiency of the oxygen transfer process oxygen concentration increases and therefore oxygen transmission rate decreases a compromise between motor lifespan and process efficiency is adopted the complete aeration cycle on off sub cycles is set to have 12 min length although the total duration of the aeration cycle is fixed the pid controller regulates the sub cycles duration in order to keep the ammonia set point 3 numerical modelling 3 1 domain the geometry of the numerical modelling includes one of the two identical lanes the geometry is formed by two chambers separated by a partition wall which allows the pass of the liquid over it the raw wastewater comes into the anoxic zone the domain outlet corresponds to the outlet weir of the oxic zone the mixer impeller of the anoxic zone includes the fix part where the engine is located treated as a standard wall and the blades which as in the work of yang et al 2011 are modelled as a plane area where a pressure jump occurs the air diffusers of the oxic chamber are included on the geometry a general view of the geometry of the problem can be observed in fig 2 where the mixer impeller and the air diffusers are also shown 3 2 governing equations two phases are considered in the numerical modelling continuous phase mixed liquor and dispersed phase air bubbles in a more rigorous approach the flocs phase should be approximated to another phase however a three phase flow simulation would increase considerably the computational cost making impossible to simulate the intermittent aeration regime conditions in a conventional wwtp there should not be sludge settlement in the asr it should be produced within the settlers so the two phase flow assumption can be taken nevertheless it is important to mention that some hydraulic inefficiencies e g stagnant zones could generate sludge sedimentation and there could be zones where the two phase flow assumption would not hold the multiphase flow is modelled by a euler euler approach a set of continuity and momentum conservation equations is applied to each phase p 1 α p ρ p u p 0 2 α p ρ p u p u p α p p α p τ p τ t p α p ρ p g i p q where α p is the volumetric fraction of the phase p i α i 1 the term i p q stands for the momentum exchange between the both phases drag and virtual mass forces drag forces are modelled by the schiller naumann model for spherical particles schiller and naumann 1935 the term τ p is the viscous stress and τ t p is the turbulent stress tensor which are defined as 3 τ p μ p u p u p t 2 3 μ p u p i 4 τ t p μ t p u p u p t 2 3 k p μ t p u p i being μ p and μ t p the laminar and turbulent viscosity of the phase respectively the term k p is the kinetic turbulent energy the mixture k ε turbulence model behzadi et al 2004 is employed to solve the closure problem this turbulence model solves a unique transport equation of kinetic turbulent energy k and a unique transport equation of its dissipation rate ε for the mixture formed by the two phases the physical properties of the mixture are calculated by the weighted average sum of the properties of each phase according to its volume fraction the value of the turbulent viscosity is calculated from the turbulent variables μ t p 0 09 ρ p k p 2 ε p the evaluation of the fluid dynamic efficiency of the asr is done by means of the simulation of a pulse rtd experiment a mass of passive tracer is released at the asr inlet and the evolution of the tracer concentration at the asr outlet provides the rtd curve the rtd analysis is done numerically by solving the unsteady tracer transport of the passive tracer c t on the continuous phase 5 c t t u i c t d e f c t where d e f is the effective diffusivity sum of laminar and turbulent diffusivity d e f d m t μ t ρ s c t the velocity and turbulent viscosity used in the transport equation are taken from the fluid dynamic simulation the turbulent schmidt number s c t is set to 0 7 the biological processes within the asr are calculated from the velocity air fraction and turbulence fields obtained in the fluid dynamic simulation eqs 1 and 2 biological model asm1 henze et al 2000 is employed to model the biochemical reactions a transport equation is solved for each one of the 12 biological components c k considered 6 c k t u i c k d e f c k υ k j ρ j being υ k j is the stoichiometric coefficient of the component c k in the reaction j whose kinetic velocity process rate is ρ j the turbulent schmidt number is set to 0 7 similarly to other cfd asm1 models le moullec et al 2010b karpinska 2013 as with the passive transport equation eq 5 the value of the turbulent diffusivity field within the asr above 10 3 m2 s is considerably greater than the molecular diffusivity of the components about 10 9 m2 s so the influence of molecular diffusion can be neglected special attention is given to the component dissolved oxygen s o the s o transport equation has an additional source term v t r o which mimics the oxygen transfer from the air bubbles to the mixed liquor the oxygen transfer ratio between air bubble and water is evaluated as 7 v t r o k l 6 α a d b 1 α a c s a t s o where α a is the air volume fraction d b the average bubble diameter c sat the oxygen saturation concentration in water and k l the mass transfer coefficient which is evaluated by means classical penetration theory higbie 1935 8 k l 2 d l v r π d b being v r the relative velocity between the phases and d l the diffusion coefficient at 20 c the alpha correction factor asselin et al 1998 is applied to transform the clean water k l to wastewater k l the oxygen saturation concentration c sat is calculated from the henry s law de gracia 2007 9 c s a t h c x o p being h c the henry coefficient at 20 c x o the volume fraction of oxygen in the air bubbles 20 9 and p the pressure in the bubble although the pressure in the bubble is the sum of hydrostatic and surface tension pressure the contribution of surface tension is much smaller than hydrostatic pressure and it is not taken into account 3 3 solver settings and boundary conditions the cfd simulation of the asr is performed in two stages using a freezing technique the first stage involves the resolution of the steady fluid dynamic equations multiphase flow with turbulence model the fluid dynamic simulation is carried out under two different aeration regimes with aeration and with the air diffusers disconnected so two velocity turbulent viscosity and air fraction fields are obtained once the fluid dynamic simulation is completed the biological simulation is done from the fields obtained the biological simulation must calculate the evolution of each one of the asm1 components during the aeration cycle the aeration cycle includes two sub cycles one with air diffusers running and another without aeration this issue is taken into account by switching the fluid dynamic fields used in the asm1 transport equations eq 6 a set of steady velocity turbulent viscosity and air fraction field is employed when the aeration is running the other set of fluid dynamic fields is employed when air diffusers are not running this procedure assumes that fluid dynamic fields remain steady during each aeration sub cycle an instantaneous switch of the fields is produced when aeration is connected or disconnected however in the actual asr the no air velocity field takes a lapse of time to evolve to the air velocity field when air diffusers activates in order to evaluate that transformation time a transient cfd simulation of the multiphase flow has been carried out starting from the no air state it has been found that due to the low depth of the asr 1 5 m the transformation time is approximately 10 s far less than the cycle duration 720 s so the assumption of only two fluid dynamic states during the aeration cycle can be taken a virtual aeration controller is included in the cfd model for the biological simulation the solver changes the fluid dynamic state according to the criteria specified in section 2 the transient simulation is running until reaching a pseudo steady state until the evolution of the asm1 variables repeats from one cycle to the next one the results presented in this paper correspond to the pseudo steady state since during the previous cycles from initial conditions to pseudo steady state the ammonia set point criteria specified in section 2 is not accomplished the cfd modelling was developed by means of the software openfoam v4 1 weller et al 1998 the simple algorithm is used in the fluid dynamic simulation under no air conditions since it is a steady state the pimple algorithm holzmann 2017 hybrid of simple and piso is employed for the fluid dynamic simulation under air conditions since this algorithm is intrinsically unsteady the simulation is running until finding and steady averaged flow over time which will be used in the biokinetic simulation the transient biokinetic simulation is carried out by solving sequentially the transport equation of each asm1 component for each time step the well known second order up wind differencing scheme is applied for the convective term of fluid dynamic simulations whereas second order central difference schemes are employed for the biological variables respecting the numerical convergence the normalized residuals for pressure velocity k and ε equations had to be below 10 4 while in the biokinetic simulation the convergence criterion for each time step was that the normalized residuals for each asm1 component below 10 5 using a time step δ t 0 5 s as above mentioned the biological simulation finished when the pseudo steady state is reached the boundary conditions for the fluid dynamic simulation where the following non slip wall for the ground and side surfaces the mixed liquor comes into the domain by its inlet with uniform velocity a constant air phase velocity and air fraction is fixed on the surfaces of the air diffusers the pressure of the outlet surface is set to the ambient pressure slip wall condition is selected for the upper surfaces degassing boundary condition is employed on the upper surfaces the concentration of each asm1 component at the asr inlet is not a steady function it depends on the asr outlet concentrations see fig 1 the inlet concentration of each component is the weighted sum of raw water asm1 concentration internal recirculation concentration recycled sludge concentration calculated by the settler efficiency and sludge return concentration from thickener and centrifuge 3 4 mesh details and gci the mesh is cartesian and structured in order to ensure the mesh independence of the numerical results a grid dependence study was performed by comparing the results obtained with three different meshes a b c 2 42 1 56 and 1 millions of elements respectively it was found that meshes a and b provide the same results so mesh a was selected to ensure the grid independence of the numerical results the size of the mesh is about 0 05 m in the core of the domain decreasing until 0 02 m in the zones where a higher spatial gradient is expected around mixer impeller air diffusers partition wall and asr outlet a numerical uncertainty estimation based on the grid convergence index roache 1997 was performed the three meshes with different representative sizes previously presented were employed for the estimation the representative size of meshes a b and c were δ a 45 m m f i n e δ b 52 m m m e d i u m and δ c 60 m m c o a r s e respectively two gci test are made δ a against δ b δ b against δ c the uncertainty of the pair of meshes involved in each test is 10 g c i i f i n e f s e a i j r i j n 1 g c i j c o a r s e f s r i j n e a i j r i j n 1 where f s is a safety coefficient 1 25 in this case e a i j is the relative error of the key variable φ average residence time in this case e a i j φ i φ j φ i r ij is the fraction of the two mesh sizes involved on the test r ij δ j δ i n is the apparent method order table 1 shows the gci values obtained after the two tests carried out note that the mesh selected in the grid dependence study mesh a has an uncertainty value g c i a f i n e 4 2 4 description of the flow within the asr flow behaviour has a notable influence on the biological processes that occurs within the asr since the transport of the asm1 components is made by velocity field convective term in eq 6 and the mixing level is determined by turbulence diffusive term in eq 6 as previously explained each complete numerical simulation fluid dynamics and biokinetics involves the simulation of the asr under two different flow conditions with and without aeration the effect of the mixer impeller has a notable influence on the flow pattern of the anoxic chamber as observed in fig 3 a the water jet generated by the impeller goes from the impeller left side of the chamber to the opposite wall where the jet impacts and rebounds as a result the mixing in the zone is considerably high and there are hardly any zones with very low velocity the flow behaviour in the oxic chamber is mainly due to the effect of the aeration bubble columns which arises from the air diffusers produces a vertical drag to the liquid resulting in a characteristic flow pattern of aeration zones upward velocity in the area of the columns downward velocity in the space between columns see fig 3b the aeration produces an acceptable degree of mixing avoiding stagnant zones however when air diffusers stop running as there are no other moment sources in the chamber velocity decreases as well as the mixing degree generating a velocity field with velocities in the range 0 0 2 m s an evaluation of the hydraulic efficiency of the asr is carried out the fluid dynamic efficiency is evaluated by means of the residence time distribution rtd curve by a pulse tracer simulation teixeira and siqueira 2008 a mass of tracer is released at the inlet of the asr at time t 0 the rtd curve of the asr is calculated from the evolution of the tracer concentration at the reactor outlet fig 4 shows the rtd curve commonly known as e curve of the rtd under two aeration regimes with and without aeration although the velocity field in the oxic chamber is very different under both regimes there is hardly any difference between the rtd curves of both regimes in order to check the validity of the model the rtd axial dispersion model equation of levenspiel adm levenspiel 1999 is compared to the curves provided by the cfd model adm is used to characterize reactors whose flow behaviour is between plug and mixed flow its equation is 11 e t 1 4 π d t 0 t e t t 0 2 4 d t 0 t being t0 the averaged residence time within the reactor and d the dimensionless axial dispersion parameters a least squared fitting is carried out to find the pair of parameters of the numerical curves under the two different aeration regimes the fitting is excellent in both cases with coefficients of regression r2 0 982 and r2 0 979 for non aeration and aeration cases respectively table 2 shows the coefficients calculated for the numerical curves it is found that aeration reduces slightly the asr hydraulic efficiency since it increases the dispersion and decreases the averaged residence time active volume renewed volume is calculated by dividing t0 by the ideal hydraulic residence time hrt q vol the employed dimensionless rtd parameters i e active volume and dispersion are useful to characterize the fluid dynamic performance of an asr regardless of its size they are universal parameters the value of the dimensionless rtd parameters depend on the flow behaviour within the reactor which is determined by its geometry and operating conditions for instance burrows et al 2001 carried out a pulse tracer experiment in a full scale oxidation ditch they concluded that an oxidation ditch may be considered nearly a complete mixed reactor which means active volume close to 100 and a high value of dispersion parameter ideally infinite those results are very different from the ones obtained in this work as expected from such a different geometry a pulse tracer rtd experiment of a full scale asr with a configuration similar to the one analysed in this work anoxic and oxic chambers separates by partition walls with impellers in the anoxic zone and air diffusers in the oxic chambers was carried out in the work of sánchez et al 2016 that experiment provided a value of the dimensionless parameters d and active volume of 0 25 and 70 5 respectively both of them similar to the ones obtained in this study 5 biological processes within the asr validation of the cfd model the biokinetic simulation of the asr with c1 aeration system is carried out from the fluid dynamic fields previously obtained according to the asm1 model wastewater is characterized in terms of 13 different components 6 particulate 6 dissolved and alkalinity which are involved in 8 kinetic processes from these 8 processes three are related to the growth of heterotrophic r1 r3 and autotrophic r2 organisms two describe the biomass decay r4 r5 and three are related to hydrolysis r6 r7 r8 special attention should be paid to processes r1 aerobic growth of heterotrophs xbh r2 anoxic growth of heterotrophs xbh and r3 aerobic growth of autotrophs xba since they command the rates of pollutants removal the anoxic chamber fed for three different streams influent external and internal recirculation will experiment a brief development of the reactions r1 and r3 in the first part of the chamber the remnants of dissolved oxygen so which comes with the internal recirculation from the oxic chamber and part of the soluble substrate ss from the raw wastewater are consumed once so has been consumed r2 process is performed within the rest of the chamber consuming ss as well as nitrates sno unlike the anoxic chamber the biological behaviour within the oxic chamber is highly influenced by the aeration cycle when the on sub cycle begins after a period of no aeration it is found a high concentration of ammonia nitrogen snh and low values of so so r1 and r3 do not take place both processes r1 and r3 start to take place just so appears in the mixed liquor and its rate is regulated depending on the amount of the different components at expense they develop as the concentration of so increases the concentration of snh diminishes as r3 consumes it generating sno at the same time r1 consumes ss as well as a little of snh at the end of the on sub cycle the concentration of so in the asr effluent has grown until values of 5 mg l see fig 5 a when the off sub cycle starts the so concentration in the chamber starts to decrease since the mixed liquor from the anoxic chamber with low so concentration advances through the bottom of the chamber see fig 5b as a result the rate of r1 and r3 also decreases allowing r2 to reproduce the anoxic growth of heterotrophs which use sno to remove ss in absence of so it has been detected a deficient mixture within the oxic chamber during the off sub cycle the mixed liquor from the anoxic chamber with high snh and low so drops into the oxic chamber over the weir of the partition wall this ammonia plume reaches the bottom of the chamber and advances through it see fig 6 in absence of so without r1 or r3 when air diffusers switch on the bubble columns drag the ammonia plume to the top of the chamber reaching the asr outlet in few seconds as a result at the beginning of the on sub cycle a fleeting snh rise in the effluent is detected this undesirable phenomenon is due to the absence of mixing in the oxic chamber when air diffusers are not working see section 4 fig 7 compares the evolution during a complete aeration cycle of the total mass of so within the reactor so concentration at the asr outlet and the oxygen transfer efficiency sote it is shown that at the beginning of the on sub cycle since the so concentration in the chamber is very low the sote value see eq 7 is relatively high 16 0 however as the cycle continues so concentration increases and sote value decreases until 10 8 the air diffuser datasheet provides under these conditions wastewater 1 5 m depth sote 19 at the end of the on sub cycle the so concentration in the effluent has been increased until 4 8 mg l see fig 5a this fact shows an inefficiency in the aeration performance part of the oxygen transferred from the bubbles to the water leaves the asr without having been consumed this is because in the last part of the chamber snh and ss concentration are so low that there is hardly any so demand low values of r1 and r3 this inefficiency can be avoided by modifying the air diffuser layout epa 1989 by increasing air diffuser density in the first part of the oxic chamber where so demand is higher high snh and ss concentration and decreasing it in the final part of the chamber the average values of cod tss n nh4 and n no3 obtained in the wwtp effluent after the settler are 40 79 16 33 1 40 and 7 77 mg l respectively all of them accomplish with clearance the effluent requirements 50 20 1 5 and 10 mg l respectively note that the virtual controller set the length of the on off sub cycles to 305 and 415 s respectively by doing this it satisfies the two proposed requirements cycle duration of 720 s keeping the ammonia nitrogen value in 1 40 mg l a longer length of the off sub cycle would have produced a higher ammonia nitrogen concentration even greater than the maximum allowed in order to check the validity of the biological results provided by the cfd model a model of the asr under the same operational parameters was implemented in the simulation platform west using the asm1temp model two perfect mixed zones are considered anoxic and oxic chamber see fig 1 the simulation is carried out under intermittent aeration conditions taking the global kla value and sub cycle lengths from the cfd simulation the value of kla is set to zero during the off sub cycle the sequence on off sub cycles is repeated until a stationary behaviour is reached table 3 shows the comparison between the asm1 component concentrations provided by the two models cfd and west for the effluent of the two considered chambers the differences in both chambers are relatively low special mention deserves so in the oxic chamber which shows a relatively high difference 0 71 mg l 26 2 this difference can be due to the fact that west model assumes a uniform so concentration within the oxic chamber however the biokinetic cfd simulation provides a non uniform so contour in the chamber see fig 5 although the so concentration at the asr outlet in the cfd model is 2 71 mg l the average value in the chamber during a cycle is lower the west simulation is not able to detect the accumulation of so in the last part of the oxic chamber previously explained 6 assessment of asr efficiency under different aeration regimes the cfd modelling is employed to evaluate the aeration energy consumption of the two aeration systems presented in section 2 after selecting which one of the two aeration systems will be installed in the asr an analysis of the influence of air flow rate per diffuser on the aeration efficiency is carried out aeration system selection the two aeration systems analysed were presented in section 2 see fig 2 conf 1 c1 48 diffusers abs pik 300 7 m3 h diff distributed uniformly in 8 rows along the oxic zone conf 2 c2 80 diffusers abs kki 215 4 m3 h diff distributed in 10 rows with variable distance between them both configurations provide a similar total air flow rate 336 m3 h and 320 m3 h although in c2 air diffusers density is higher in order to keep a lower so concentration in the bubble column and improve the sote see eq 7 c2 layout produces a higher oxygen injection at the beginning of the oxic chamber where the so demand is higher and a lower oxygen injection at the end of the chamber where the demand is low on the other hand the initial economic investment of c1 is lower as presented in the simulation is performed within two steps fluid dynamics and biokinetics controlling the aeration length to keep the average effluent snh 1 4 mg l with an aeration length on off sub cycles of 12 min the average power consumption of the blower can be calculated by multiplying the air flow rate by the pressure jump produced and diving it into the blower efficiency 12 w q t δ p η δ p is the sum of hydrostatic pressure pressure losses in pipes and pressure drop in diffusers the hydrostatic pressure on the surface of the diffusers 1 5 m depth is independent of the aeration configuration the pressure drop in the diffusers for a specific air flow rate is taken from the datasheets of the devices the blower efficiency is assumed to be η 60 table 4 shows the numerical results with both configurations it is observed that c2 is able to satisfy the effluent requirements by injecting 6 3 less air flow rate by the blower with 2 8 less power consumption this efficiency improvement is mainly due to two reasons the heterogeneous air diffusers distribution with less diffusors in the last part of the chamber provides a more efficient oxygen consumption by the biomass it is reflected in the maximum value of so registered in the effluent see fig 8 4 0 mg l lower than the 4 8 mg l registered in c1 see fig 5a it is also observed that c2 layout provides a so concentration more homogeneous than c1 since the air flow rate per diffuser is lower in c2 the so concentration in the bubble plume is lower increasing the oxygen transfer from the bubbles to the mixed liquor and consequently the sote fig 9 shows the comparison between sote provided by c1 and c2 c2a in the figure it is observed that the sote parameter in c2 during the on sub cycle is approximately 1 higher than with c1 influence of the air flow rate per diffuser on the aeration energy consumption an analysis of the influence of the air flow rate per diffuser on the power consumption is carried out a complete simulation fluid dynamics and biokinetics is performed with c2 aeration system but with the diffusers running at 62 5 load c2b 2 5 nm3 h diff instead at 100 load run c2a 4 nm3 h diff table 5 compares the results provided by c2a and c2b besides needing less average air flow rate c2b has a lower pressure drop through the diffusers as a result c2b satisfies the effluent requirements with 14 5 less power consumption the reasons for this improvement in the asr performance are the same that in the comparison between c1 and c2a the oxygen is injected gradually and properly adapted to the so demanded by r1 and r3 processes as a result the registered value of so in the oxic chamber remains far from the dissolved saturation point providing a higher sote value during the sub cycle see fig 9 c2b fig 10 shows the value of the effluent so concentration at the end of the on sub cycle which reaches a maximum of 2 9 mg l lower than the concentrations provided by c1 and c2a 7 conclusions a cfd modelling of an asr which works under intermittent aeration regime is carried out the cfd model simulates the evolution of the biological components concentration within the reactor during a complete aeration cycle on and off sub cycles the modelling involves the simulation of two steady fluid dynamic regimes with and without aeration in the transient biokinetic simulation the fluid dynamic fields employed for the transport and oxygen transfer equations changes based on if air diffusers are switched on or off the cfd model is used for the selection of the aeration system of an asr two aeration system are simulated c1 and c2 the model evaluates the power consumption necessary to satisfy the effluent requirements under both scenarios according to the numerical results c2 configuration which have a heterogeneous diffuser layout and more diffuser density than c1 needs 6 3 less air than c1 an analysis of the influence of the air flow rate per diffuser is carried out it is found that decreasing the air flow rate from 100 load to 62 5 load it is possible to increase the efficiency of the aeration system with a 14 5 less power consumption since the oxygen injection is properly adapted to the demand by r1 and r3 biological processes in conclusion this work develops a cfd modelling capable to evaluate the power consumption of the asr aeration system for a certain effluent requirements under intermittent aeration regime

19558,due to the aeration system biological reactors are the most energy consuming facilities of convectional wwtps many biological reactors work under intermittent aeration regime the optimization of the aeration process air diffuser layout air flow rate per diffuser aeration length is necessary to ensure an efficient performance satisfying the effluent requirements with the minimum energy consumption this work develops a cfd modelling of an activated sludge reactor asr which works under intermittent aeration regime the model considers the fluid dynamic and biological processes within the asr the biological simulation which is transient takes into account the intermittent aeration regime the cfd modelling is employed for the selection of the aeration system of an asr two different aeration configurations are simulated the model evaluates the aeration power consumption necessary to satisfy the effluent requirements an improvement of 2 8 in terms of energy consumption is achieved by modifying the air diffuser layout an analysis of the influence of the air flow rate per diffuser on the asr performance is carried out the results show a reduction of 14 5 in the energy consumption of the aeration system when the air flow rate per diffuser is reduced the model provides an insight into the aeration inefficiencies produced within asrs graphical abstract image keywords wwtp cfd

ranging from 45 to 75 of the plant energy expenditure reardon 1995 it is interesting to analyse the aeration system of biological reactors since it is the most important factor to achieve an optimal energy performance one of the most extended types of biological reactor configuration is the plug flow very common in large plants as well as in those where simplicity and robustness is a priority the application of accurate on off aeration cycles intensity and length can diminish a significant percentage of the energy costs so an efficient aeration strategy analysed previously to be applied in plant is convenient most of the design and operation wwtp handbooks focuses on the biological phenomena which occurs within the reactors without taking into account the fluid dynamic phenomena since biological modelling could provide enough information to satisfy quality standards of the effluent the series of activated sludge models asm henze et al 2000 developed by the international water association iwa are the most popular models for the design of activated reactors some commercial software i e west biowin solves the asm equations assuming that the flow behaves as a perfect mixed or plug flow however some authors ouedraogo et al 2016 point out the importance of fluid dynamics in the pollutant removal of a biological reactor a correct fluid dynamic design improves the reactor efficiency reducing operational costs in this context computational fluid dynamics cfd arises as an adequate tool for modelling fluid dynamic and biological processes which take place in wwtp reactors one of the reasons of the growth of the applications of cfd in wwtp analysis is its ability to combine mathematical models of phenomena from different nature fluid dynamics biological processes etc cfd has been widely employed to simulate the different hydraulic and biological phenomena which occurs within biological reactors many authors have developed numerical models to simulate the flow behaviour in biological reactors most of these works employed the k ε turbulence model i e yang et al 2011 stamou 2008 although some authors have also achieved good agreement with experimental data by using k ω models gresch et al 2011 the multiphase liquid air bubbles modelling has been extensively investigated in the literature there are two main alternative approaches to model bubble columns reactors euler euler gresch et al 2011 cockx et al 1997 or euler lagrange gong et al 2007 although euler lagrange approach allows the calculation of each single bubble trajectory it requires a high computational cost for this reason euler euler approach is more common in bubble flow simulations residence time distribution rtd analysis is commonly employed to evaluate the hydraulic efficiency of biological reactors teixeira and siqueira 2008 a mass of tracer is released at the reactor inlet the rtd curve of the reactor is obtained from the temporal evolution of tracer concentration at the reactor outlet there are some publications concerning pulse tracer rtd experiments to evaluate the hydraulic performance of asrs sánchez et al 2016 sarkar et al 2017 the rtd curve of a reactor can be calculated by cfd from the velocity field previously obtained using two different techniques particle tracking method stropky et al 2007 or solving the transport equation of a passive tracer talvy et al 2011 moullec et al 2008 compared both numerical rtd techniques achieving a good agreement between both numerical curves and the experimental one obtained in a bench scale reactor one of the major challenges in the activated sludge reactors asr modelling is the calculation of oxygen mass transfer from air bubbles to the liquid the oxygen mass transfer modelling requires the evaluation of the mass transfer coefficient kla traditional asr design software employs a global kla coefficient in each tank however cfd is able to calculate a kla field within the reactor from the local values of air volume fraction obtained in the multiphase simulation cockx et al 2001 incorporated the penetration theory of higbie 1935 equation to his cfd model to predict the local values of kla the numerical results were numerically validated in an airlift pilot plant fayolle et al 2007 also employs higbie equation to calculate numerically the oxygen mass transfer the results were experimentally validated and show a notable influence of the fluid dynamics on the oxygen mass transfer apart from fluid dynamics and mass transference cfd is able to incorporate biokinetic reactions into the reactor model few authors have integrated the biological processes by means of asm into cfd models by this way it is possible to analyse the influence of geometry wastewater flow rate air diffuser layout or aeration regime on the removal of pollutants glover et al 2006 developed a complete cfd asm1 model of an asr and used it to evaluate the performance of the reactor moullec et al 2010a developed and experimentally validated a complete cfd asm1 modelling of an activated sludge channel reactor under pseudo steady state one of the conclusion of the work was that a compromise between precision and grid size has to be found since the coupling with biokinetics is computationally expensive lei and ni 2014 developed a complete numerical modelling cfd asm1 of an oxidation ditch considering three different phases sewage sludge and air bubble the numerical results showed a good agreement with the experimental data more recently yang et al 2016 carried out a cfd modelling of a lab scale membrane bioreactor mbr they employed a simplified version of the asm1 model and considered a three phase flow the results showed pretty good consistency with the experimental data and the model was employed to evaluate the performance of a full scale mbr yang et al 2017 a complete review about the applications of cfd tools to asrs analysis can be found in the work of karpinska and bridgeman 2016 in the review of ho et al 2017 there are some examples of the application of cfd asm models for the analysis of waste stabilization pond systems all the above mentioned works correspond to cfd models where the biological simulation is carried out under steady conditions however many asrs operate under intermittent aeration regime switching on and off the aeration system the aim of this work is to develop a cfd modelling capable to simulate the biokinetics within an asr under intermittent aeration regime the cfd modelling also takes into account fluid dynamic and oxygen transfer phenomena the modelling is applied to the design of an asr the modelling is employed to find the aeration system which satisfies the standard quality effluent with the minimum energy consumption an analysis of the influence of the air flow rate per diffusor on the aeration energy consumption is also carried out 2 problem description an old wwtp needs to be restored in order to treat the wastewater of a village 2500 population before its discharge into the sea one of the most critical conditions imposed for the enlargement of the wwtp is to transform the actual storm tank 440 m3 into the biological reactor of the plant modified ludzack ettinger system there are two identical parallel asrs each one is formed by two zones anoxic chamber 91 m3 and oxic chamber 128 m3 they are separated by a partition wall which allows the pass of the water over it the anoxic chamber has a mixer impeller sulzer xrw210 and the floor of the oxic chamber is covered by air diffusers a fraction of the asr effluent internal recirculation of mixed liquor is returned to the anoxic chamber and the rest flows into a clarifier where the sludge is separated from the water most of the sludge from the settler is directly recycled to the asr inlet external recirculation however a small sludge fraction is conduced to the thickener and centrifuge where the liquid part is extracted and leaded to the wwtp inlet fig 1 shows the secondary treatment diagram of the considered wwtp two aeration configurations are considered for each one to the two asrs configuration 1 c1 consists of 48 air diffusers abs pik300 7 nm3 h diff distributed uniformly on the floor of the oxic chamber 8 rows 6 air diffusers per row fig 2 a shows the spatial distribution of the air diffusers in c1 configuration 2 c2 involves 80 air diffusers abs kki215 4 nm3 h diff with a heterogeneous layout the spatial distribution is formed by 10 rows with 8 air diffusers per row according to the specifications of the manufacturer the representative bubble diameter is 2 mm in both devices at the beginning of the chamber where the oxygen demand is higher the rows are closer than at the end of the chamber fig 2b shows the spatial distribution in c2 although c2 needs a higher initial investment some manuals epa 1989 point out that aeration efficiency improves by increasing air diffusers density more air diffusers per m2 for the same total air flow rate and by avoiding a uniform layout more air diffusers in the first part of the chamber where the oxygen demand is higher it is worthwhile to evaluate the improvement in the process performance and the savings produced by this aeration configuration regarding the operating conditions and effluent requirement parameters the wastewater flow rate treated in the reactor is qin 500 m3 d the characteristics of the influent are cod 525 mg l n no3 0 85 mg l n nh4 45 9 mg l and tss 209 mg l according to the european council directive 91 271 eec transposed to the spanish legislation rd 11 1995 applied for the local hydrographic confederation the effluent quality requirements are cod 50 mg l n no3 10 mg l n nh4 1 5 mg l and tss 20 mg l in order to satisfy the effluent requirements as observed in fig 1 the internal recirculation is set to qintr 500 1 m3 d per lane while the recycled sludge flow rate from the settler is qextr 490 m3 d the settler is assumed to have an efficiency defined as fraction of non settleable solids of ηset 0 995 thickener and centrifuge efficiency are 0 96 while their dry solids fraction are 3 4 and 21 respectively during the process the aeration pid controller based on an ammonia set point switches on and off the air blower a complete aeration cycle involves the on and the off sub cycles the controller is set to keep an average effluent ammonia concentration of 1 4 mg l below the standard requirement 1 5 mg l if the average effluent ammonia concentration during a cycle is above 1 4 mg l the pid controller increases the on sub cycle length and vice versa an excessive number of starts stops per hour can reduce the blower motor lifespan on the other hand the more time the aeration is activated the less efficiency of the oxygen transfer process oxygen concentration increases and therefore oxygen transmission rate decreases a compromise between motor lifespan and process efficiency is adopted the complete aeration cycle on off sub cycles is set to have 12 min length although the total duration of the aeration cycle is fixed the pid controller regulates the sub cycles duration in order to keep the ammonia set point 3 numerical modelling 3 1 domain the geometry of the numerical modelling includes one of the two identical lanes the geometry is formed by two chambers separated by a partition wall which allows the pass of the liquid over it the raw wastewater comes into the anoxic zone the domain outlet corresponds to the outlet weir of the oxic zone the mixer impeller of the anoxic zone includes the fix part where the engine is located treated as a standard wall and the blades which as in the work of yang et al 2011 are modelled as a plane area where a pressure jump occurs the air diffusers of the oxic chamber are included on the geometry a general view of the geometry of the problem can be observed in fig 2 where the mixer impeller and the air diffusers are also shown 3 2 governing equations two phases are considered in the numerical modelling continuous phase mixed liquor and dispersed phase air bubbles in a more rigorous approach the flocs phase should be approximated to another phase however a three phase flow simulation would increase considerably the computational cost making impossible to simulate the intermittent aeration regime conditions in a conventional wwtp there should not be sludge settlement in the asr it should be produced within the settlers so the two phase flow assumption can be taken nevertheless it is important to mention that some hydraulic inefficiencies e g stagnant zones could generate sludge sedimentation and there could be zones where the two phase flow assumption would not hold the multiphase flow is modelled by a euler euler approach a set of continuity and momentum conservation equations is applied to each phase p 1 α p ρ p u p 0 2 α p ρ p u p u p α p p α p τ p τ t p α p ρ p g i p q where α p is the volumetric fraction of the phase p i α i 1 the term i p q stands for the momentum exchange between the both phases drag and virtual mass forces drag forces are modelled by the schiller naumann model for spherical particles schiller and naumann 1935 the term τ p is the viscous stress and τ t p is the turbulent stress tensor which are defined as 3 τ p μ p u p u p t 2 3 μ p u p i 4 τ t p μ t p u p u p t 2 3 k p μ t p u p i being μ p and μ t p the laminar and turbulent viscosity of the phase respectively the term k p is the kinetic turbulent energy the mixture k ε turbulence model behzadi et al 2004 is employed to solve the closure problem this turbulence model solves a unique transport equation of kinetic turbulent energy k and a unique transport equation of its dissipation rate ε for the mixture formed by the two phases the physical properties of the mixture are calculated by the weighted average sum of the properties of each phase according to its volume fraction the value of the turbulent viscosity is calculated from the turbulent variables μ t p 0 09 ρ p k p 2 ε p the evaluation of the fluid dynamic efficiency of the asr is done by means of the simulation of a pulse rtd experiment a mass of passive tracer is released at the asr inlet and the evolution of the tracer concentration at the asr outlet provides the rtd curve the rtd analysis is done numerically by solving the unsteady tracer transport of the passive tracer c t on the continuous phase 5 c t t u i c t d e f c t where d e f is the effective diffusivity sum of laminar and turbulent diffusivity d e f d m t μ t ρ s c t the velocity and turbulent viscosity used in the transport equation are taken from the fluid dynamic simulation the turbulent schmidt number s c t is set to 0 7 the biological processes within the asr are calculated from the velocity air fraction and turbulence fields obtained in the fluid dynamic simulation eqs 1 and 2 biological model asm1 henze et al 2000 is employed to model the biochemical reactions a transport equation is solved for each one of the 12 biological components c k considered 6 c k t u i c k d e f c k υ k j ρ j being υ k j is the stoichiometric coefficient of the component c k in the reaction j whose kinetic velocity process rate is ρ j the turbulent schmidt number is set to 0 7 similarly to other cfd asm1 models le moullec et al 2010b karpinska 2013 as with the passive transport equation eq 5 the value of the turbulent diffusivity field within the asr above 10 3 m2 s is considerably greater than the molecular diffusivity of the components about 10 9 m2 s so the influence of molecular diffusion can be neglected special attention is given to the component dissolved oxygen s o the s o transport equation has an additional source term v t r o which mimics the oxygen transfer from the air bubbles to the mixed liquor the oxygen transfer ratio between air bubble and water is evaluated as 7 v t r o k l 6 α a d b 1 α a c s a t s o where α a is the air volume fraction d b the average bubble diameter c sat the oxygen saturation concentration in water and k l the mass transfer coefficient which is evaluated by means classical penetration theory higbie 1935 8 k l 2 d l v r π d b being v r the relative velocity between the phases and d l the diffusion coefficient at 20 c the alpha correction factor asselin et al 1998 is applied to transform the clean water k l to wastewater k l the oxygen saturation concentration c sat is calculated from the henry s law de gracia 2007 9 c s a t h c x o p being h c the henry coefficient at 20 c x o the volume fraction of oxygen in the air bubbles 20 9 and p the pressure in the bubble although the pressure in the bubble is the sum of hydrostatic and surface tension pressure the contribution of surface tension is much smaller than hydrostatic pressure and it is not taken into account 3 3 solver settings and boundary conditions the cfd simulation of the asr is performed in two stages using a freezing technique the first stage involves the resolution of the steady fluid dynamic equations multiphase flow with turbulence model the fluid dynamic simulation is carried out under two different aeration regimes with aeration and with the air diffusers disconnected so two velocity turbulent viscosity and air fraction fields are obtained once the fluid dynamic simulation is completed the biological simulation is done from the fields obtained the biological simulation must calculate the evolution of each one of the asm1 components during the aeration cycle the aeration cycle includes two sub cycles one with air diffusers running and another without aeration this issue is taken into account by switching the fluid dynamic fields used in the asm1 transport equations eq 6 a set of steady velocity turbulent viscosity and air fraction field is employed when the aeration is running the other set of fluid dynamic fields is employed when air diffusers are not running this procedure assumes that fluid dynamic fields remain steady during each aeration sub cycle an instantaneous switch of the fields is produced when aeration is connected or disconnected however in the actual asr the no air velocity field takes a lapse of time to evolve to the air velocity field when air diffusers activates in order to evaluate that transformation time a transient cfd simulation of the multiphase flow has been carried out starting from the no air state it has been found that due to the low depth of the asr 1 5 m the transformation time is approximately 10 s far less than the cycle duration 720 s so the assumption of only two fluid dynamic states during the aeration cycle can be taken a virtual aeration controller is included in the cfd model for the biological simulation the solver changes the fluid dynamic state according to the criteria specified in section 2 the transient simulation is running until reaching a pseudo steady state until the evolution of the asm1 variables repeats from one cycle to the next one the results presented in this paper correspond to the pseudo steady state since during the previous cycles from initial conditions to pseudo steady state the ammonia set point criteria specified in section 2 is not accomplished the cfd modelling was developed by means of the software openfoam v4 1 weller et al 1998 the simple algorithm is used in the fluid dynamic simulation under no air conditions since it is a steady state the pimple algorithm holzmann 2017 hybrid of simple and piso is employed for the fluid dynamic simulation under air conditions since this algorithm is intrinsically unsteady the simulation is running until finding and steady averaged flow over time which will be used in the biokinetic simulation the transient biokinetic simulation is carried out by solving sequentially the transport equation of each asm1 component for each time step the well known second order up wind differencing scheme is applied for the convective term of fluid dynamic simulations whereas second order central difference schemes are employed for the biological variables respecting the numerical convergence the normalized residuals for pressure velocity k and ε equations had to be below 10 4 while in the biokinetic simulation the convergence criterion for each time step was that the normalized residuals for each asm1 component below 10 5 using a time step δ t 0 5 s as above mentioned the biological simulation finished when the pseudo steady state is reached the boundary conditions for the fluid dynamic simulation where the following non slip wall for the ground and side surfaces the mixed liquor comes into the domain by its inlet with uniform velocity a constant air phase velocity and air fraction is fixed on the surfaces of the air diffusers the pressure of the outlet surface is set to the ambient pressure slip wall condition is selected for the upper surfaces degassing boundary condition is employed on the upper surfaces the concentration of each asm1 component at the asr inlet is not a steady function it depends on the asr outlet concentrations see fig 1 the inlet concentration of each component is the weighted sum of raw water asm1 concentration internal recirculation concentration recycled sludge concentration calculated by the settler efficiency and sludge return concentration from thickener and centrifuge 3 4 mesh details and gci the mesh is cartesian and structured in order to ensure the mesh independence of the numerical results a grid dependence study was performed by comparing the results obtained with three different meshes a b c 2 42 1 56 and 1 millions of elements respectively it was found that meshes a and b provide the same results so mesh a was selected to ensure the grid independence of the numerical results the size of the mesh is about 0 05 m in the core of the domain decreasing until 0 02 m in the zones where a higher spatial gradient is expected around mixer impeller air diffusers partition wall and asr outlet a numerical uncertainty estimation based on the grid convergence index roache 1997 was performed the three meshes with different representative sizes previously presented were employed for the estimation the representative size of meshes a b and c were δ a 45 m m f i n e δ b 52 m m m e d i u m and δ c 60 m m c o a r s e respectively two gci test are made δ a against δ b δ b against δ c the uncertainty of the pair of meshes involved in each test is 10 g c i i f i n e f s e a i j r i j n 1 g c i j c o a r s e f s r i j n e a i j r i j n 1 where f s is a safety coefficient 1 25 in this case e a i j is the relative error of the key variable φ average residence time in this case e a i j φ i φ j φ i r ij is the fraction of the two mesh sizes involved on the test r ij δ j δ i n is the apparent method order table 1 shows the gci values obtained after the two tests carried out note that the mesh selected in the grid dependence study mesh a has an uncertainty value g c i a f i n e 4 2 4 description of the flow within the asr flow behaviour has a notable influence on the biological processes that occurs within the asr since the transport of the asm1 components is made by velocity field convective term in eq 6 and the mixing level is determined by turbulence diffusive term in eq 6 as previously explained each complete numerical simulation fluid dynamics and biokinetics involves the simulation of the asr under two different flow conditions with and without aeration the effect of the mixer impeller has a notable influence on the flow pattern of the anoxic chamber as observed in fig 3 a the water jet generated by the impeller goes from the impeller left side of the chamber to the opposite wall where the jet impacts and rebounds as a result the mixing in the zone is considerably high and there are hardly any zones with very low velocity the flow behaviour in the oxic chamber is mainly due to the effect of the aeration bubble columns which arises from the air diffusers produces a vertical drag to the liquid resulting in a characteristic flow pattern of aeration zones upward velocity in the area of the columns downward velocity in the space between columns see fig 3b the aeration produces an acceptable degree of mixing avoiding stagnant zones however when air diffusers stop running as there are no other moment sources in the chamber velocity decreases as well as the mixing degree generating a velocity field with velocities in the range 0 0 2 m s an evaluation of the hydraulic efficiency of the asr is carried out the fluid dynamic efficiency is evaluated by means of the residence time distribution rtd curve by a pulse tracer simulation teixeira and siqueira 2008 a mass of tracer is released at the inlet of the asr at time t 0 the rtd curve of the asr is calculated from the evolution of the tracer concentration at the reactor outlet fig 4 shows the rtd curve commonly known as e curve of the rtd under two aeration regimes with and without aeration although the velocity field in the oxic chamber is very different under both regimes there is hardly any difference between the rtd curves of both regimes in order to check the validity of the model the rtd axial dispersion model equation of levenspiel adm levenspiel 1999 is compared to the curves provided by the cfd model adm is used to characterize reactors whose flow behaviour is between plug and mixed flow its equation is 11 e t 1 4 π d t 0 t e t t 0 2 4 d t 0 t being t0 the averaged residence time within the reactor and d the dimensionless axial dispersion parameters a least squared fitting is carried out to find the pair of parameters of the numerical curves under the two different aeration regimes the fitting is excellent in both cases with coefficients of regression r2 0 982 and r2 0 979 for non aeration and aeration cases respectively table 2 shows the coefficients calculated for the numerical curves it is found that aeration reduces slightly the asr hydraulic efficiency since it increases the dispersion and decreases the averaged residence time active volume renewed volume is calculated by dividing t0 by the ideal hydraulic residence time hrt q vol the employed dimensionless rtd parameters i e active volume and dispersion are useful to characterize the fluid dynamic performance of an asr regardless of its size they are universal parameters the value of the dimensionless rtd parameters depend on the flow behaviour within the reactor which is determined by its geometry and operating conditions for instance burrows et al 2001 carried out a pulse tracer experiment in a full scale oxidation ditch they concluded that an oxidation ditch may be considered nearly a complete mixed reactor which means active volume close to 100 and a high value of dispersion parameter ideally infinite those results are very different from the ones obtained in this work as expected from such a different geometry a pulse tracer rtd experiment of a full scale asr with a configuration similar to the one analysed in this work anoxic and oxic chambers separates by partition walls with impellers in the anoxic zone and air diffusers in the oxic chambers was carried out in the work of sánchez et al 2016 that experiment provided a value of the dimensionless parameters d and active volume of 0 25 and 70 5 respectively both of them similar to the ones obtained in this study 5 biological processes within the asr validation of the cfd model the biokinetic simulation of the asr with c1 aeration system is carried out from the fluid dynamic fields previously obtained according to the asm1 model wastewater is characterized in terms of 13 different components 6 particulate 6 dissolved and alkalinity which are involved in 8 kinetic processes from these 8 processes three are related to the growth of heterotrophic r1 r3 and autotrophic r2 organisms two describe the biomass decay r4 r5 and three are related to hydrolysis r6 r7 r8 special attention should be paid to processes r1 aerobic growth of heterotrophs xbh r2 anoxic growth of heterotrophs xbh and r3 aerobic growth of autotrophs xba since they command the rates of pollutants removal the anoxic chamber fed for three different streams influent external and internal recirculation will experiment a brief development of the reactions r1 and r3 in the first part of the chamber the remnants of dissolved oxygen so which comes with the internal recirculation from the oxic chamber and part of the soluble substrate ss from the raw wastewater are consumed once so has been consumed r2 process is performed within the rest of the chamber consuming ss as well as nitrates sno unlike the anoxic chamber the biological behaviour within the oxic chamber is highly influenced by the aeration cycle when the on sub cycle begins after a period of no aeration it is found a high concentration of ammonia nitrogen snh and low values of so so r1 and r3 do not take place both processes r1 and r3 start to take place just so appears in the mixed liquor and its rate is regulated depending on the amount of the different components at expense they develop as the concentration of so increases the concentration of snh diminishes as r3 consumes it generating sno at the same time r1 consumes ss as well as a little of snh at the end of the on sub cycle the concentration of so in the asr effluent has grown until values of 5 mg l see fig 5 a when the off sub cycle starts the so concentration in the chamber starts to decrease since the mixed liquor from the anoxic chamber with low so concentration advances through the bottom of the chamber see fig 5b as a result the rate of r1 and r3 also decreases allowing r2 to reproduce the anoxic growth of heterotrophs which use sno to remove ss in absence of so it has been detected a deficient mixture within the oxic chamber during the off sub cycle the mixed liquor from the anoxic chamber with high snh and low so drops into the oxic chamber over the weir of the partition wall this ammonia plume reaches the bottom of the chamber and advances through it see fig 6 in absence of so without r1 or r3 when air diffusers switch on the bubble columns drag the ammonia plume to the top of the chamber reaching the asr outlet in few seconds as a result at the beginning of the on sub cycle a fleeting snh rise in the effluent is detected this undesirable phenomenon is due to the absence of mixing in the oxic chamber when air diffusers are not working see section 4 fig 7 compares the evolution during a complete aeration cycle of the total mass of so within the reactor so concentration at the asr outlet and the oxygen transfer efficiency sote it is shown that at the beginning of the on sub cycle since the so concentration in the chamber is very low the sote value see eq 7 is relatively high 16 0 however as the cycle continues so concentration increases and sote value decreases until 10 8 the air diffuser datasheet provides under these conditions wastewater 1 5 m depth sote 19 at the end of the on sub cycle the so concentration in the effluent has been increased until 4 8 mg l see fig 5a this fact shows an inefficiency in the aeration performance part of the oxygen transferred from the bubbles to the water leaves the asr without having been consumed this is because in the last part of the chamber snh and ss concentration are so low that there is hardly any so demand low values of r1 and r3 this inefficiency can be avoided by modifying the air diffuser layout epa 1989 by increasing air diffuser density in the first part of the oxic chamber where so demand is higher high snh and ss concentration and decreasing it in the final part of the chamber the average values of cod tss n nh4 and n no3 obtained in the wwtp effluent after the settler are 40 79 16 33 1 40 and 7 77 mg l respectively all of them accomplish with clearance the effluent requirements 50 20 1 5 and 10 mg l respectively note that the virtual controller set the length of the on off sub cycles to 305 and 415 s respectively by doing this it satisfies the two proposed requirements cycle duration of 720 s keeping the ammonia nitrogen value in 1 40 mg l a longer length of the off sub cycle would have produced a higher ammonia nitrogen concentration even greater than the maximum allowed in order to check the validity of the biological results provided by the cfd model a model of the asr under the same operational parameters was implemented in the simulation platform west using the asm1temp model two perfect mixed zones are considered anoxic and oxic chamber see fig 1 the simulation is carried out under intermittent aeration conditions taking the global kla value and sub cycle lengths from the cfd simulation the value of kla is set to zero during the off sub cycle the sequence on off sub cycles is repeated until a stationary behaviour is reached table 3 shows the comparison between the asm1 component concentrations provided by the two models cfd and west for the effluent of the two considered chambers the differences in both chambers are relatively low special mention deserves so in the oxic chamber which shows a relatively high difference 0 71 mg l 26 2 this difference can be due to the fact that west model assumes a uniform so concentration within the oxic chamber however the biokinetic cfd simulation provides a non uniform so contour in the chamber see fig 5 although the so concentration at the asr outlet in the cfd model is 2 71 mg l the average value in the chamber during a cycle is lower the west simulation is not able to detect the accumulation of so in the last part of the oxic chamber previously explained 6 assessment of asr efficiency under different aeration regimes the cfd modelling is employed to evaluate the aeration energy consumption of the two aeration systems presented in section 2 after selecting which one of the two aeration systems will be installed in the asr an analysis of the influence of air flow rate per diffuser on the aeration efficiency is carried out aeration system selection the two aeration systems analysed were presented in section 2 see fig 2 conf 1 c1 48 diffusers abs pik 300 7 m3 h diff distributed uniformly in 8 rows along the oxic zone conf 2 c2 80 diffusers abs kki 215 4 m3 h diff distributed in 10 rows with variable distance between them both configurations provide a similar total air flow rate 336 m3 h and 320 m3 h although in c2 air diffusers density is higher in order to keep a lower so concentration in the bubble column and improve the sote see eq 7 c2 layout produces a higher oxygen injection at the beginning of the oxic chamber where the so demand is higher and a lower oxygen injection at the end of the chamber where the demand is low on the other hand the initial economic investment of c1 is lower as presented in the simulation is performed within two steps fluid dynamics and biokinetics controlling the aeration length to keep the average effluent snh 1 4 mg l with an aeration length on off sub cycles of 12 min the average power consumption of the blower can be calculated by multiplying the air flow rate by the pressure jump produced and diving it into the blower efficiency 12 w q t δ p η δ p is the sum of hydrostatic pressure pressure losses in pipes and pressure drop in diffusers the hydrostatic pressure on the surface of the diffusers 1 5 m depth is independent of the aeration configuration the pressure drop in the diffusers for a specific air flow rate is taken from the datasheets of the devices the blower efficiency is assumed to be η 60 table 4 shows the numerical results with both configurations it is observed that c2 is able to satisfy the effluent requirements by injecting 6 3 less air flow rate by the blower with 2 8 less power consumption this efficiency improvement is mainly due to two reasons the heterogeneous air diffusers distribution with less diffusors in the last part of the chamber provides a more efficient oxygen consumption by the biomass it is reflected in the maximum value of so registered in the effluent see fig 8 4 0 mg l lower than the 4 8 mg l registered in c1 see fig 5a it is also observed that c2 layout provides a so concentration more homogeneous than c1 since the air flow rate per diffuser is lower in c2 the so concentration in the bubble plume is lower increasing the oxygen transfer from the bubbles to the mixed liquor and consequently the sote fig 9 shows the comparison between sote provided by c1 and c2 c2a in the figure it is observed that the sote parameter in c2 during the on sub cycle is approximately 1 higher than with c1 influence of the air flow rate per diffuser on the aeration energy consumption an analysis of the influence of the air flow rate per diffuser on the power consumption is carried out a complete simulation fluid dynamics and biokinetics is performed with c2 aeration system but with the diffusers running at 62 5 load c2b 2 5 nm3 h diff instead at 100 load run c2a 4 nm3 h diff table 5 compares the results provided by c2a and c2b besides needing less average air flow rate c2b has a lower pressure drop through the diffusers as a result c2b satisfies the effluent requirements with 14 5 less power consumption the reasons for this improvement in the asr performance are the same that in the comparison between c1 and c2a the oxygen is injected gradually and properly adapted to the so demanded by r1 and r3 processes as a result the registered value of so in the oxic chamber remains far from the dissolved saturation point providing a higher sote value during the sub cycle see fig 9 c2b fig 10 shows the value of the effluent so concentration at the end of the on sub cycle which reaches a maximum of 2 9 mg l lower than the concentrations provided by c1 and c2a 7 conclusions a cfd modelling of an asr which works under intermittent aeration regime is carried out the cfd model simulates the evolution of the biological components concentration within the reactor during a complete aeration cycle on and off sub cycles the modelling involves the simulation of two steady fluid dynamic regimes with and without aeration in the transient biokinetic simulation the fluid dynamic fields employed for the transport and oxygen transfer equations changes based on if air diffusers are switched on or off the cfd model is used for the selection of the aeration system of an asr two aeration system are simulated c1 and c2 the model evaluates the power consumption necessary to satisfy the effluent requirements under both scenarios according to the numerical results c2 configuration which have a heterogeneous diffuser layout and more diffuser density than c1 needs 6 3 less air than c1 an analysis of the influence of the air flow rate per diffuser is carried out it is found that decreasing the air flow rate from 100 load to 62 5 load it is possible to increase the efficiency of the aeration system with a 14 5 less power consumption since the oxygen injection is properly adapted to the demand by r1 and r3 biological processes in conclusion this work develops a cfd modelling capable to evaluate the power consumption of the asr aeration system for a certain effluent requirements under intermittent aeration regime

19559,high electrical energy is required for the electro fenton process to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in wastewater the aim of this study was to develop a novel and more cost effective process specifically a microbial electro fenton cell mefc for treating ppcps in wastewater acetylene black was selected as the catalyst for h2o2 electrogeneration and fe mn binary oxide for hydroxyl radical production in addition to lowering energy needs the mefc produced a maximum power density of 112 11 mw m2 with 1 g l acetate as a representative substrate and 10 mg l carbamazepine cbz as a typical ppcp comparing with electro fenton process the cbz removal in the mefc was 38 higher within 24 h operation 90 vs 62 furthermore the cbz removal rate in the mefc was 10 100 times faster than that in other biological treatment processes such enhanced degradation of cbz in the mefc was attributed to the synergistic reactions between radical oxidation of cbz and biodegradation of degradative intermediates the mefc provides a promising method to remove ppcps from wastewater coupling with efficient removal of other biodegradable organics graphical abstract

radicals are produced via electrogeneration of hydrogen peroxide at the cathode and the addition of an iron catalyst using one or two compartment cells brillas et al 2009 the ef process has been used to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps from wastewater for its advantages of high efficiency automation and mild operation conditions brillas et al 2009 however high electricity consumption of the ef process greatly limits its wide application for wastewater treatment electrical consumption of the ef can reach from 19 kwh m3 to 530 kwh kg toc total organic carbon which is much higher than that for biological treatment processes brillas et al 2009 gueraini 2015 many ppcps such as ibuprofen naproxen and carbamazepine cbz have been detected in municipal wastewater although ppcp concentrations in municipal wastewater are very low they are still considered toxic and hazardous in municipal wastewater concentrations of other biodegradable organic compounds can be several hundred times higher than those of ppcps garcı a et al 2004 miralles cuevas et al 2014 these organic compounds rapidly consume oxidizing potentials in ef leaving little if any radicals are generated for treating low level compounds like ppcps therefore the ef process is often limited to treating ppcps in the secondary effluent in municipal wastewater nidheesh and gandhimathi 2012 the bio electro fenton process that is driven by microbial fuel cells mfc has been developed in recent years feng et al 2010 wang et al 2014 to reduce the energy consumption in the ef process electricity is produced by electrochemically active bacteria eabs via substrate biodegradation in the anode and coupled with refractory organics degradation in the cathode of mfc ling et al 2016 yong et al 2017 many refractory organics such as orange ii feng et al 2010 p nitrophenol tao et al 2013 17β estrodial xu et al 2015 and triphenyltin chloride yong et al 2017 can be efficiently mineralized through the bio electro fenton process a typical bio electro fenton system is composed of two chamber compartments i e anode and cathode with a separator such as a cation exchange membrane cem feng et al 2010

cathode chamber which potentially causes separator damage feng et al 2010 li et al 2017 ling et al 2016 tao et al 2013 yong et al 2017 currently biodegradable substrates e g acetate and glucose are widely used in the anode chamber of bio electro fenton systems while refractory organics are used in the cathode chamber however biodegradable and refractory organics often coexist in real world wastewaters such as in landfill leachate hassan et al 2017a 2017b therefore it is necessary to develop novel bio electro fenton processes for practical applications the electrogeneration of h2o2 can be produced using the gas diffusion cathode gdc in the ef process oxygen can efficiently pass through the gdc and react with h2o at the interface between the catalyst layer and electrolyte to produce h2o2 lu et al 2017 the ef process can occur at a neutral ph using modified iron based catalysts e g lepidocrocite to catalyze h2o2 into hydroxyl radicals feng et al 2010 therefore it was hypothesize that the ef process can take place under the same conditions as that in the anode chamber of mfc the objective of this study is to develop a novel bio electro fenton process named microbial electro fenton cell mefc and to examine its efficiency in degrading cbz as one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in municipal wastewater treatment plants cbz accounts for 96 of the total annual production in the global pharmaceutical market mohapatra et al 2012 due to its benzene ring and π bond cbz is difficult to biodegrade and conventional methods usually achieve low cbz removal in wastewater treatment vasiliadou et al 2013 wang et al 2017 the mefc was constructed with a single chamber cell integrated by the ef process and the mfc with fe mn catalyst in the cathode of a single

consumption was investigated along with the refractory i e cbz and biodegradable i e acetate organics in the same chamber 2 materials and methods 2 1 fe mn catalyst the fe mn binary oxide was used as the fenton catalyst under neutral condition the fe mn catalyst was synthesized according to the co precipitation method jiang et al 2016 each of the potassium permanganate kmno4 1 1185 g and iron ii sulfate feso4 7h2o 6 2555 g was dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water the feso4 solution was slowly added into the kmno4 solution with vigorous stirring the ph in the mixed solution was kept at 7 8 using 5 m naoh adjustment the mixed solution was aged for 12 h after washing with deionized water the mixture was dried at 105 c for 4 h the final mixture was grinded into a power and stored in a dryer prior to use all the chemicals used were analytical grade 2 2 gas diffusion cathode the carbon cloth with a gas diffusion layer covered by ptfe w1s1005 cetech co ltd was used as the gas

10 ml vial in sequence after vortex oscillating for 5 min the mixture was painted on the surface of the carbon cloth 4 cm 8 cm opposite to the gas diffusion layer and air dried for 24 h at room temperature the final carbon cloth was cut into two pieces and served as the gas diffusion cathode gdc in the mefc 2 3 mefc construction and operation mefc was made from a cube plexiglass 4 cm 4 cm 4

as the anode logan et al 2007 and the gdc as the cathode the projected area of the cathode was 7 cm2 started up as previously described by luo et al 2016 the mfc with an external resistance of 1000 ω produced stable voltage outputs 500 mv for at least three cycles 14 d then the matured single chamber air cathode mfc was shifted to the mefc by replacing the cathode with the gdc the mfc operated using 1 g l acetate as the substrate logan et al 2007 with an external resistance of 10 ω a stable electrical generation was achieved in the matured mfc with a maximum voltage output of 20 mv after shifting the mfc to the mefc the cell was refreshed by the following solution per liter 310 mg nh4cl 130 mg kcl 4 97 g nah2po4 h2o 2 75 g na2hpo4 h2o 12 5 ml mineral and 12 5 ml vitamin logan et al 2007 different concentrations of acetate i e 300 600 800 and 1000 mg l and cbz i e 5 8 and 10 mg l were added into the solution respectively the range of acetate concentrations was approximately equivalent to the cod range in the municipal wastewater i e 200 800 mg l mccarty et al 2011 ni et al 2009 trussell et al 2006 to compare the performance of different methods the ef process and the bio electron fenton were also constructed and tested a single chambered cell similar with mefc was employed for the ef process ti iro2 ta2o5 oxide baoji likun titanium industry co ltd china was used as anode with a projected area of 7 cm2 3 0 cm in diameter lu et al 2017 the new gdc was used as the cathode in the ef process the distance between the anode and cathode was 4 cm with a volume of 28 ml the current was controlled at 2 ma in the ef process which was close to the maximum current in the mefc two types of solutions were tested in the ef process a solution of 10 mg l cbz 5 g l na2so4 and the same solution tested in the mefc in the bio electro fenton electron fenton driven by the mfc the reactor was divided into two chambers with a pem membrane nafion 211 usa as the separator each of the anode and cathode chambers had a volume of 28 ml the anode and cathode in the electron fenton driven by the mfc were the same as those in the mefc an external resistance of 10 ω was used throughout the tests the anolyte in the reactor was the same as that in the mefc except that no cbz was added the catholyte was 5 g l na2so4 in 10 mg l cbz solution the choice of 10 mg l cbz was based on marco urrea et al 2009 all the experiments were carried out in duplicates at 30 3 c 2 4 analysis and calculations chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by using the standard method clesceri et al 1998 values of ph were measured by using a ph meter mettler toledo fe 30 switzerland the total organic carbon toc was measured by using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan output voltages across

liu and logan 2004 zhang et al 2011 high performance liquid chromatography hplc p230ii dalian yilite analytical instruments china was used to measure the concentrations of cbz and acetate for the cbz measurement the mobile phase was in the form of an acetonitrile solution 50 v v and the detection wavelength was 284 nm for the acetate measurement the mobile phase was in the form of a 0 09 m k2hpo4 solution with a detection wavelength of 210 nm solution samples in the mefc and ef were measured using a pro orbitrap high resolution lc ms system ltq orbitrap elte thermo fisher scientific inc usa to identify the by products of cbz lc separation was carried out with a c18 ion exchange analytical column 1 9 μm 100 mm 2 1 mm hypeisil gold thermo scientific usa the mobile phases consisted of a solution containing 0 1 formic acid and acetonitrile the procedure ran for 5 min with an initial ratio of formic acid to acetonitrile v v of 90 the ratios linearly decreased from 90 to 10 within 10 min and the procedure ran for each ration for 3 min the ratio was changed to 90 within 0 2 min and the column was regenerated for 3 8 min a flow rate of 0 3 ml min was kept with an injection volume of 1 0 μl the mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ionization mode ion source parameters included spray voltage 3 0 kv ion transfer tube temperature of 300 c and vaporizer temperature of 200 c mass spectra were obtained in the m z range of 100 2000 da the data was analyzed by the xcalibur software thermo fisher scientific inc usa deng et al 2016 monsalvo et al 2015 the cbz cod and acetate removals were calculated as follows 1 e 100 c 0 c 1 c 0 where e is the removal efficiency while c 0 and c 1 are the initial and final concentrations of cbz or acetate respectively mg l the average

discussions 3 1 electricity generation and cbz removal in the mefc the mefc could generate electricity with the different acetate concentrations and 10 mg l cbz respectively fig 1 the maximum voltage reached 13 8 0 3 mv in the mefc with 300 mg l of acetate and 10 mg l cbz the maximum voltages slightly increased from 15 2 0 4 mv with 600 mg l acetate to about 16 mv with 800 and 1000 mg l acetate the maximum power density of 81 8 mw m2 was achieved in the mefc using 300 mg l acetate the maximum power densities decreased from 112 11 mw m2 600 mg l and 95 9 mw m2 800 mg l to 68 7 mw m2 1000 mg l with the increase of acetate concentrations fig 2 the highest internal resistance was 135 30 ω in the mefc using 1000 mg l acetate while the lowest one was 112 20 ω in the mefc using 600 mg l acetate among the different acetate concentrations the operation time per cycle in the mefc increased from 6 0 1 0 h to 19 5 1 0 h with an increase of acetate concentrations table 1 correspondingly the coulombs increased from 21 2 c to 56 5c a linear relationship between the coulombs and acetate concentrations was observed coefficient of determination r 2 0 984 however the coulombic efficiency ce decreased from 31 5 with 300 mg l acetate to 24 3 with 1000 mg l acetate no acetate was detected at the end of each cycle throughout all the tests as shown in table 1 the highest cbz removal in the mefc changed from 40 within 6 0 h with 300 mg l acetate to 60 within 19 h with 1000 mg l acetate the cbz removal rates decreased with an increase of the acetate concentrations from 6 7 0 8 h 1 with 300 mg l to 3 2 0 5 h 1 with 1000 mg l acetate 3 2 effect of the cbz concentration on its removals in the mefc the acetate was added periodically into the mefc that contained an initial cbz concentration of 10 mg l i e 300 mg l acetate at 0 and 6 h of operation and 600 mg l at 12 h fig 3 a the acetate concentrations decreased from 300 to 45 3 mg l within 4 h of operation fig 3 b all acetate was utilized in the mefc in each cycle with electricity generation in the system cbz was efficiently removed with the different initial cbz concentrations fig 3c the highest cbz removal within 24 h reached 93 3 91 3 and 90 3 with initial cbz concentrations of 5 8 and 10 mg l respectively the lower cbz removal indicated that hydroxyl radicals in the cathode might not be enough to degrade the high concentrations of cbz moreover in the 1st cycle 6 0 0 6 h of operation the addition of 300 mg l of acetate resulted in 57 6 of cbz removal in the mefc containing 5 mg l cbz while the addition of 300 mg l of acetate in the 2nd cycle 12 0 1 0 h of operation improved the cbz removal by only 76 5 the results indicated that periodical addition of acetate did not greatly accelerate cbz degradation probably because of the presence of recalcitrant intermediates that scavenged the consumption of oxidants by the cbz molecules the increasing cbz concentrations did not significantly affect mefc efficiency indicating that other than fenton type reactions might happen in the cell which needs to be studied in the further 3 3 comparison of cbz removal among the different treatment processes the mefc the ef process and the electro fenton driven by mfc were tested with 10 mg l cbz and the periodical addition of acetate i e 300 mg l acetate at 0 and at 6 h and 600 mg l at 12 h fig 4 to distinguish the effects of the fenton type reactions from the processes of adsorption and biodegradation on the cbz removal the systems with open circuits were tested under the same initial conditions as those with the closed circuits in the closed circuit the cbz removal reached 60 6 in the electro fenton driven by mfc within 24 h which was 30 lower than that in the mefc the ef process had a stable current of 2 0 ma throughout the tests which was higher than those in the mefc fig 3a to improve cbz removal however even under the higher current the ef process could not efficiently remove the acetate the acetate concentrations reached 221 40 429 43 and 848 85 mg l at 6 12 and 24 h respectively fig 3b the cbz removal was 62 6 in the ef process within 24 h which was almost the same as that in the electro fenton driven by mfc indicating the same mechanism for the cbz removal in the processes the additional tests showed that only 5 4 1 0 of the cbz removal was attributed to the anodic oxidation in the ef indicating that the fenton type reactions on the cathode contributed the most to the cbz removal in the ef with 10 mg l cbz only the cbz was degraded by 85 3 within 3 h which was much faster than that in the ef with the periodical addition of acetate in the open circuit the cbz removal of the mefc was much lower than that in the closed circuit 31 vs 90 indicating that the cathode reaction played an important role in cbz degradation the cbz removal values of the electro fenton driven by mfc and the ef were 21 2 and 24 3 respectively in general the mefc performance was significantly better than that of the ef and electro fenton driven by mfc with the same electrolyte the toc reductions in the different processes with close circuits within 24 h are shown in fig 5 in the mefc the toc values decreased from 128 25 to 80 20 mg l within 6 h the toc slightly increased to 92 28 mg l within 12 h the final toc reached 120 32 mg l within 24 h in the ef and electro fenton driven by mfc similar toc reduction was achieved throughout the tests the final toc values were 318 44 and 303 40 mg l respectively in the ef and electro fenton driven by mfc within 24 h values of ce in the mefc and the electro fenton driven by mfc within 24 h were similar 33 6 vs 35 6 the current efficiency in the ef was 55 10 within 24 h stability tests for the mefc showed that the cbz removal was gradually decreased with increase of the operation time but was still maintained at 72 6 even after 18 cycles of operation this was partially due to the biofilm formation on the surface of the cathode data was not shown the results in the mefc and ef processes within 12 and 22 h of operation fig 3 were used to identify the cbz metabolites using the lc ms system fig 6 within 12 h of operation hydroxycarbamazepine m z 253 and acridone m z 196 were detected in the mefc and ef processes respectively table 3 within 22 h of operation acridone was detected in the ef process but not detected in the mefc indicating that acridone might have been biodegraded in the mefc 3 4 comparison on different processes and cbz degradation mechanism in the mefc the maximum power density of 112 11 mw m2 in the mefc was comparable to those in other bio electro fenton systems driven by the mfcs with different substrates such as 50 312 mw m2 with organe ii feng et al 2010 57 mw m2 with triphenyltin chloride yong et al 2017 and 135 mw m2 with arsenite wang et al 2014 the energy consumption in the ef process was changed in order to harvest electricity in the mefc during the cbz removal the harvested electricity from the mefc during the cbz removal was estimated to be 0 9 kwh kg cbz compared to the energy consumption of 415 kwh kg cbz in the ef process in this study brillas et al 2009 gueraini 2015 the cbz removal rate of the mefc was much higher than those of other biological treatment processes table 2 more specifically the cbz removal rate of the mefc was ten times higher than those in bioreactors with enriched fungi such as t versicolor rodríguez rodríguez et al 2010 0 375 vs 0 027 mg l h and g lucidum marco urrea et al 2009 0 375 vs 0 028 mg l h and more than 180 times higher than that in the mfc werner et al 2015 0 375 vs 0 002 mg l h it was difficult to compare cbz removal rates in the mefc with those in other ef processes in the literature because biodegradable substrates were not used in cbz removal for other ef processes this was the first report that detailed using mefc to generate electricity and effectively remove cbz simultaneously the distinguished performance of the mefc should be attributed to the synergistic mechanism in the anode and cathode the acetate was efficiently utilized by eabs which released the protons and electrons in the anode as follows 4 acetate eabs co 2 h e h 2 o the oxygen gas transferred from a gas diffusion layer in the gdc that could be used to produce h2o2 with acetylene black acting as a catalyst 5 o 2 h e h 2 o 2 the fenton like reaction could take place via the fe mn catalyst as follows jiang et al 2016 6 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii o hoh 7 fe iii h 2 o 2 fe ii o oh h 8 fe iii o oh fe ii o 2 h hydroxycarbamazepine had been identified as one of the starting intermediates during the oh oxidation of cbz monsalvo et al 2015 indicating that our mefc could produce enough oh to degrade the cbz the acridone could be produced by the intermediates such as 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine degradation in the advanced oxidation process kosjek et al 2009 indicating the oh produced in the mefc may oxidize the intermediates of cbz so as to form acridone acridone can be biodegraded 40 and 23 under aerobic and anoxic conditions respectively kosjek et al 2009 indicating that the anode biofilm may utilize acridone as the substrate and subsequently enhance its degradation the main pathways of cbz degradation are presented in fig 7 synergistic reactions between cbz oxidized by hydroxyl radicals and intermediates biodegraded by eabs may occur in the mefc gao et al 2015 jelic et al 2013 teixeira et al 2013 however the cbz degradation had to compete with the degradation of the acetate and cbz s intermediates in the ef process and the bioelectro fenton driven by mfc respectively resulting in much lower cbz removal than that in the mefc the production of hydroxyl radicals in the mefc can be further improved using new catalysts such as fe3o4 nanoparticles barros et al 2015 and hierarchically porous carbon liu et al 2015 nevertheless the cbz concentration in the real wastewater is lower than that in this study brezina et al 2017 hübner et al 2014 various biodegradable organic compounds in the real wastewater might result in the power generation of mefc lower than that using acetate as substrate pant et al 2010 the real wastewater should be tested in the mefc in future many types of ppcps such as dipyrone giri and golder 2014 and cefalexin estrada et al 2012 can be oxidized by hydroxyl radicals that will lead to the production of biodegradable intermediates langenhove 2011 eabs in the anodic biofilm of mefc may be capable of using such biodegradable intermediates as substrates pant et al 2010 the synergistic reaction between eabs utilization and ef oxidation in the mefc may occur on such types of ppcps treatment resulting in high ppcps removal therefore without additional electricity input the mefc has great potential for involvement in ppcps removals 4 conclusions the mefc was developed for removing cbz as a typical ppcp with efficient removal of acetate as other biodegradable organics in this study the cbz removal in the mefc was much higher than that in the conventional electro fenton process within 24 h operation 90 vs 62 the cbz removal rate in the mefc was 10 100 times faster than that in other biological treatment processes the electricity generation from the substrate utilization by eab on the anode enhanced the fenton like reaction on the cathode in the mefc resulting in the synergistic reaction between cbz oxidized by hydroxyl radicals and intermediates biodegraded by eabs in the mefc the mefc provides a promising method to remove

that the ef process can take place under the same conditions as that in the anode chamber of mfc the objective of this study is to develop a novel bio electro fenton process named microbial electro fenton cell mefc and to examine its efficiency in degrading cbz as one of the most frequently detected pharmaceuticals in municipal wastewater treatment plants cbz accounts for 96 of the total annual production in the global pharmaceutical market mohapatra et al 2012 due to its benzene ring and π bond cbz is difficult to biodegrade and conventional methods usually achieve low cbz removal in wastewater treatment vasiliadou et al 2013 wang et al 2017 the mefc was constructed with a single chamber cell integrated by the ef process and the mfc with fe mn catalyst in the cathode of a single chamber mfc it was the first time to demonstrate electricity generation from eabs and hydroxyl radical production from ef at the same time in the mefc electricity generation cbz removal and energy consumption was investigated along with the refractory i e cbz and biodegradable i e acetate organics in the same chamber 2 materials and methods 2 1 fe mn catalyst the fe mn binary oxide was used as the fenton catalyst under neutral condition the fe mn catalyst was synthesized according to the co precipitation method jiang et al 2016 each of the potassium permanganate kmno4 1 1185 g and iron ii sulfate feso4 7h2o 6 2555 g was dissolved in 100 ml of deionized water the feso4 solution was slowly added into the kmno4 solution with vigorous stirring the ph in the mixed solution was kept at 7 8 using 5 m naoh adjustment the mixed solution was aged for 12 h after washing with deionized water the mixture was dried at 105 c for 4 h the final mixture was grinded into a power and stored in a dryer prior to use all the chemicals used were analytical grade 2 2 gas diffusion cathode the carbon cloth with a gas diffusion layer covered by ptfe w1s1005 cetech co ltd was used as the gas

10 ml vial in sequence after vortex oscillating for 5 min the mixture was painted on the surface of the carbon cloth 4 cm 8 cm opposite to the gas diffusion layer and air dried for 24 h at room temperature the final carbon cloth was cut into two pieces and served as the gas diffusion cathode gdc in the mefc 2 3 mefc construction and operation mefc was made from a cube plexiglass 4 cm 4 cm 4 cm with a similar configuration as the single chamber air cathode mfc liu and logan 2004 the cell had an effective cylindrical volume of 28 ml 4 cm long and 3 cm in diameter the carbon brush was used as the anode logan et al 2007 and the gdc as the cathode the projected area of the cathode was 7 cm2 started up as previously described by luo et al 2016 the mfc with an external resistance of 1000 ω produced stable voltage outputs 500 mv for at least three cycles 14 d then the matured single chamber air cathode mfc was shifted to the mefc by replacing the cathode with the gdc the mfc operated using 1 g l acetate as the substrate logan et al 2007 with an external resistance of 10 ω a stable electrical generation was achieved in the matured mfc with a maximum voltage output of 20 mv after shifting the mfc to the mefc the cell was refreshed by the following solution per liter 310 mg nh4cl 130 mg kcl 4 97 g nah2po4 h2o 2 75 g na2hpo4 h2o 12 5 ml mineral and 12 5 ml vitamin logan et al 2007 different concentrations of acetate i e 300 600 800 and 1000 mg l and cbz i e 5 8 and 10 mg l were added into the solution respectively the range of acetate concentrations was approximately equivalent to the cod range in the municipal wastewater i e 200 800 mg l mccarty et al 2011 ni et al 2009 trussell et al 2006 to compare the performance of different methods the ef process and the bio electron fenton were also constructed and tested a single chambered cell similar with mefc was employed for the ef process ti iro2 ta2o5 oxide baoji likun titanium industry co ltd china was used as anode with a projected area of 7 cm2 3 0 cm in diameter lu et al 2017 the new gdc was used as the cathode in the ef process the distance between the anode and cathode was 4 cm with a volume of 28 ml the current was controlled at 2 ma in the ef process which was close to the maximum current in the mefc two types of solutions were tested in the ef process a solution of 10 mg l cbz 5 g l na2so4 and the same solution tested in the mefc in the bio electro fenton electron fenton driven by the mfc the reactor was divided into two chambers with a pem membrane nafion 211 usa as the separator each of the anode and cathode chambers had a volume of 28 ml the anode and cathode in the electron fenton driven by the mfc were the same as those in the mefc an external resistance of 10 ω was used throughout the tests the anolyte in the reactor was the same as that in the mefc except that no cbz was added the catholyte was 5 g l na2so4 in 10 mg l cbz solution the choice of 10 mg l cbz was based on marco urrea et al 2009 all the experiments were carried out in duplicates at 30 3 c 2 4 analysis and calculations chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by using the standard method clesceri et al 1998 values of ph were measured by using a ph meter mettler toledo fe 30 switzerland the total organic carbon toc was measured by using a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan output voltages across

liu and logan 2004 zhang et al 2011 high performance liquid chromatography hplc p230ii dalian yilite analytical instruments china was used to measure the concentrations of cbz and acetate for the cbz measurement the mobile phase was in the form of an acetonitrile solution 50 v v and the detection wavelength was 284 nm for the acetate measurement the mobile phase was in the form of a 0 09 m k2hpo4 solution with a detection wavelength of 210 nm solution samples in the mefc and ef were measured using a pro orbitrap high resolution lc ms system ltq orbitrap elte thermo fisher scientific inc usa to identify the by products of cbz lc separation was carried out with a c18 ion exchange analytical column 1 9 μm 100 mm 2 1 mm hypeisil gold thermo scientific usa the mobile phases consisted of a solution containing 0 1 formic acid and acetonitrile the procedure ran for 5 min with an initial ratio of formic acid to acetonitrile v v of 90 the ratios linearly decreased from 90 to 10 within 10 min and the procedure ran for each ration for 3 min the ratio was changed to 90 within 0 2 min and the column was regenerated for 3 8 min a flow rate of 0 3 ml min was kept with an injection volume of 1 0 μl the mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ionization mode ion source parameters included spray voltage 3 0 kv ion transfer tube temperature of 300 c and vaporizer temperature of 200 c

discussions 3 1 electricity generation and cbz removal in the mefc the mefc could generate electricity with the different acetate concentrations and 10 mg l cbz respectively fig 1 the maximum voltage reached 13 8 0 3 mv in the mefc with 300 mg l of acetate and 10 mg l cbz the maximum voltages slightly increased from 15 2 0 4 mv with 600 mg l acetate to about 16 mv with 800 and 1000 mg l acetate the maximum power density of 81 8 mw m2 was achieved in the mefc using 300 mg l acetate the maximum power densities decreased from 112 11 mw m2 600 mg l and 95 9 mw m2 800 mg l to 68 7 mw m2 1000 mg l with the increase of acetate concentrations fig 2 the highest internal resistance was 135 30 ω in the mefc using 1000 mg l acetate while the lowest one was 112 20 ω in the mefc using 600 mg l acetate among the different acetate concentrations the operation time per cycle in the mefc increased from 6 0 1 0 h to 19 5 1 0 h with an increase of acetate concentrations table 1 correspondingly the coulombs increased from 21 2 c to 56 5c a linear relationship between the coulombs and acetate concentrations was observed coefficient of determination r 2 0 984 however the coulombic efficiency ce decreased from 31 5 with 300 mg l acetate to 24 3 with 1000 mg l acetate no acetate was detected at the end of each cycle throughout all the tests as shown in table 1 the highest cbz removal in the mefc changed from 40 within 6 0 h with 300 mg l acetate to 60 within 19 h with 1000 mg l acetate the cbz removal rates decreased with an increase of the acetate concentrations from 6 7 0 8 h 1 with 300 mg l to 3 2 0 5 h 1 with 1000 mg l acetate 3 2 effect of the cbz concentration on its removals in the mefc the acetate was added periodically into the mefc that contained an initial cbz concentration of 10 mg l i e 300 mg l acetate at 0 and 6 h of operation and 600 mg l at 12 h fig 3 a the acetate concentrations decreased from 300 to 45 3 mg l within 4 h of operation fig 3 b all acetate was utilized in the mefc in each cycle with electricity generation in the system cbz was efficiently removed with the different initial cbz concentrations fig 3c the highest cbz removal within 24 h reached 93 3 91 3 and 90 3 with initial cbz concentrations of 5 8 and 10 mg l respectively the lower cbz removal indicated that hydroxyl radicals in the cathode might not be enough to degrade the high concentrations of cbz moreover in the 1st cycle 6 0 0 6 h of operation the addition of 300 mg l of acetate resulted in 57 6 of cbz removal in the mefc containing 5 mg l cbz while the addition of 300 mg l of acetate in the 2nd cycle 12 0 1 0 h of operation improved the cbz removal by only 76 5 the results indicated that periodical addition of acetate did not greatly accelerate cbz degradation probably because of the presence of recalcitrant intermediates that scavenged the consumption of oxidants by the cbz molecules the increasing cbz concentrations did not significantly affect mefc efficiency indicating that other than fenton type reactions might happen in the cell which needs to be studied in the further 3 3 comparison of cbz removal among the different treatment processes the mefc the ef process and the electro fenton driven by mfc were tested with 10 mg l cbz and the periodical addition of acetate i e 300 mg l acetate at 0 and at 6 h and 600 mg l at 12 h fig 4 to distinguish the effects of the fenton type reactions from the processes of adsorption and biodegradation on the cbz removal the systems with open circuits were tested under the same initial conditions as those with the closed circuits in the closed circuit the cbz removal reached 60 6 in the electro fenton driven by mfc within 24 h which was 30 lower than that in the mefc the ef process had a stable current of 2 0 ma throughout the tests which was higher than those in the mefc fig 3a to improve cbz removal however even under the higher current the ef process could not efficiently remove the acetate the acetate concentrations reached 221 40 429 43 and 848 85 mg l at 6 12 and 24 h respectively fig 3b the cbz removal was 62 6 in the ef process within 24 h which was almost the same as that in the electro fenton driven by mfc indicating the same mechanism for the cbz removal in the processes the additional tests showed that only 5 4 1 0 of the cbz removal was attributed to the anodic oxidation in the ef indicating that the fenton type reactions on the cathode contributed the most to the cbz removal in the ef with 10 mg l cbz only the cbz was degraded by 85 3 within 3 h which was much faster than that in the ef with the periodical addition of acetate in the open circuit the cbz removal of the mefc was much lower than that in the closed circuit 31 vs 90 indicating that the cathode reaction played an important role in cbz degradation the cbz removal values of the electro fenton driven by mfc and the ef were 21 2 and 24 3 respectively in general the mefc performance was significantly better than that of the ef and electro fenton driven by mfc with the same electrolyte the toc reductions in the different processes with close circuits within 24 h are shown in fig 5 in the mefc the toc values decreased from 128 25 to 80 20 mg l within 6 h the toc slightly increased to 92 28 mg l within 12 h the final toc reached 120 32 mg l within 24 h in the ef and electro fenton driven by mfc similar toc reduction was achieved throughout the tests the final toc values were 318 44 and 303 40 mg l respectively in the ef and electro fenton driven by mfc within 24 h values of ce in the mefc and the electro fenton driven by mfc within 24 h were similar 33 6 vs 35 6 the current efficiency in the ef was 55 10 within 24 h stability tests for the mefc showed that the cbz removal was gradually decreased with increase of the operation time but was still maintained at 72 6 even after 18 cycles of operation this was partially due to the biofilm formation on the surface of the cathode data was not shown the results in the mefc and ef processes within 12 and 22 h of operation fig 3 were used to identify the cbz metabolites using the lc ms system fig 6 within 12 h of operation hydroxycarbamazepine m z 253 and acridone m z 196 were detected in the mefc and ef processes respectively table 3 within 22 h of operation acridone was detected in the ef process but not detected in the mefc indicating that acridone might have been biodegraded in the mefc 3 4 comparison on different processes and cbz degradation mechanism in the mefc the maximum power density of 112 11 mw m2 in the mefc was comparable to those in other bio electro fenton systems driven by the mfcs with different substrates such as 50 312 mw m2 with organe ii feng et al 2010 57 mw m2 with triphenyltin chloride yong et al 2017 and 135 mw m2 with arsenite wang et al 2014 the energy consumption in the ef process was changed in order to harvest electricity in the mefc during the cbz removal the harvested electricity from the mefc during the cbz removal was estimated to be 0 9 kwh kg cbz compared to the energy consumption of 415 kwh kg cbz in the ef process in this study brillas et al 2009 gueraini 2015 the cbz removal rate of the mefc was much higher than those of other biological treatment processes table 2 more specifically the cbz removal rate of the mefc was ten times higher than those in bioreactors with enriched fungi such as t versicolor rodríguez rodríguez et al 2010 0 375 vs 0 027 mg l h and g lucidum marco urrea et al 2009 0 375 vs 0 028 mg l h and more than 180 times higher than that in the mfc werner et al 2015 0 375 vs 0 002 mg l h it was difficult to compare cbz removal rates in the mefc with those in other ef processes in the literature because biodegradable substrates were not used in cbz removal for other ef processes this was the first report that detailed using mefc to generate electricity and effectively remove cbz simultaneously the distinguished performance of the mefc should be attributed to the synergistic mechanism in the anode and cathode the acetate was efficiently utilized by eabs which released the protons and electrons in the anode as follows 4 acetate eabs co 2 h e h 2 o the oxygen gas transferred from a gas diffusion layer in the gdc that could be used to produce h2o2 with acetylene black acting as a catalyst 5 o 2 h e h 2 o 2 the fenton like reaction could take place via the fe mn catalyst as follows jiang et al 2016 6 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii o hoh 7 fe iii h 2 o 2 fe ii o oh h 8 fe iii o oh fe ii o 2 h hydroxycarbamazepine had been identified as one of the starting intermediates during the oh oxidation of cbz monsalvo et al 2015 indicating that our mefc could produce enough oh to degrade the cbz the acridone could be produced by the intermediates such as 10 11 epoxycarbamazepine degradation in the advanced oxidation process kosjek et al 2009 indicating the oh produced in the mefc may oxidize the intermediates of cbz so as to form acridone acridone can be biodegraded 40 and 23 under aerobic and anoxic conditions respectively kosjek et al 2009 indicating that the anode biofilm may utilize acridone as the substrate and subsequently enhance its degradation the main pathways of cbz degradation are presented in fig 7 synergistic reactions between cbz oxidized by hydroxyl radicals and intermediates biodegraded by eabs may occur in the mefc gao et al 2015 jelic et al 2013 teixeira et al 2013 however the cbz degradation had to compete with the degradation of the acetate and cbz s intermediates in the ef process and the bioelectro fenton driven by mfc respectively resulting in much lower cbz removal than that in the mefc the production of hydroxyl radicals in the mefc can be further improved using new catalysts such as fe3o4 nanoparticles barros et al 2015 and hierarchically porous carbon liu et al 2015 nevertheless the cbz concentration in the real wastewater is lower than that in this study brezina et al 2017 hübner et al 2014 various biodegradable organic compounds in the real wastewater might result in the power generation of mefc lower than that using acetate as substrate pant et al 2010 the real wastewater should be tested in the mefc in future many types of ppcps such as dipyrone giri and golder 2014 and cefalexin estrada et al 2012 can be oxidized by hydroxyl radicals that will lead to the production of biodegradable intermediates langenhove 2011 eabs in the anodic biofilm of mefc may be capable of using such biodegradable intermediates as substrates pant et al 2010 the synergistic reaction between eabs utilization and ef oxidation in the mefc may occur on such types of ppcps treatment resulting in high ppcps removal therefore without additional electricity input the mefc has great potential for involvement in ppcps removals 4 conclusions the mefc was developed for removing cbz as a typical ppcp with efficient removal of acetate as other biodegradable organics in this study the cbz removal in the mefc was much higher than that in the conventional electro fenton process within 24 h operation 90 vs 62 the cbz removal rate in the mefc was 10 100 times faster than that in other biological treatment processes the electricity generation from the substrate utilization by eab on the anode enhanced the fenton like reaction on the cathode in the mefc resulting in the synergistic reaction between cbz oxidized by hydroxyl radicals and intermediates biodegraded by eabs in the mefc the mefc provides a promising method to remove ppcps from wastewater coupling with efficient removal of other biodegradable organics acknowledgements this work was partially supported by grants from the national key r d program of china nos
