21670,field measurements of surface wind can provide valuable information for a wide range of research and practices however surface wind records are usually influenced by topographic terrain effects

vary noticeably with approaching wind field that is characterized by different z 0 m the validity of the proposed scheme is examined through comparison of the standardized wind measurements at two coastal stations keywords standardization surface wind topographic effect marine roughness coastal island 1 introduction in situ wind measurements are essential for a wide range of research and practices in many fields such as meteorology wind engineering and ocean engineering during the past decades several advanced observational instruments platforms have been put into use including wind profilers gps dropsondes and satellites however wind measurements collected at near ground levels are still most available and most widely utilized thus these wind records are of great interest in practices unfortunately surface wind measurements usually suffer from noticeable interference by local topography and terrain and direct use of the raw data may result in non ignorable errors in subsequent analyses and applications therefore there is a need to standardize surface wind speed measurements i e to correct the raw wind records to their potential values which refer to a given mean speed duration e g 10 min at a height of 10 m above an open flat reference terrain with a roughness length of 0 03 m wmo 2008 in recent years there has been a fast growth of human activities at coastal areas for many of these activities e g wind resistant design of offshore structures and marine wind energy harvesting shu et al 2016 field measurements of marine surface wind are often a necessity as it is sometimes required to collect marine wind measurements at coastal islands hills it is thus required to standardize the marine surface wind records on flat terrains a typical standardization process consists of the following four successive steps powell et al 1996 he et al 2016 1 adjust wind speed measurements to the mean wind speeds with a required mean wind duration 2 estimate the roughness length around the study site 3 convert between wind speeds with different terrains 4 convert between wind speeds with different heights during the above process a key step lies in the estimation of the roughness length scale z 0 there are three kinds of estimation methods micrometeorological methods he et al 2019 classification methods wieringa 1993 and morphometric methods grimmond and oke 1999 when field measurements of surface wind are available the micrometeorological methods are generally of preference since they are able to provide more objective and accurate estimation results when the concerned site is dominated by marine exposures special attention should be paid to the estimation of marine roughness length which varies with wind strength sempreviva et al 2010 he et al 2016 under rugged terrain conditions wind tunnel tests chock and cochran 2005 or numerical simulations yan et al 2016 are often required to quantify the topographic effects either a physical or a numerical model is established and then tested under the context of a predesigned approaching wind field recently he et al 2014a proposed a field measurement driven method for the standardization of surface wind under complex terrain conditions the effectiveness of the method has been validated via both wind tunnel tests he et al 2014a and numerical simulations yan et al 2016 hong kong hk is located in the southeast coast of china where typhoons and strong monsoons are of common occurrences to provide reference information for weather forecasting and other wind related practices hong kong observatory hko has established dozens of meteorological stations across the territory as there are numerous mountains and islands in the territory of hk several stations are situated on or around coastal hills previous studies have shown that both the topographic effects he et al 2013 2014b 2018 and the effects due to wind speed dependence of marine roughness he et al 2016 2019 may influence the surface wind records noticeably however there is a lack of means on the standardization of marine wind speed records collected at coastal islands hills by considering a combination of the two kinds of effects mentioned above this study focuses on the above mentioned issue a standardization scheme is proposed which takes into account the combined effects associated with topography and wind speed dependence of marine roughness the validity of the proposed scheme is examined through comparison of standardized wind measurements at two coastal stations 2 methodology statement 2 1 study site to illustrate the methodology for the standardization of marine wind speeds at coastal islands a case study for the cheung chau meteorological station cch hereafter is presented herein this station is built up at the top of the south part of an isolated island in hk i e the cheung chau island which is characterized by irregular contour the island is surrounded by shallow seawater in adjacent area whose depth is 14 m and by a number of islands and mountains to its north in farther distance the local ground of the station sits at 71 9 m above mean sea level amsl the station is equipped with both a cup type anemometer and a vane at 26 7 m above ground level agl or 98 6 m amsl fig 1 shows the location of the station and the surrounding topography the location of an offshore platform is also depicted in the figure wind measurements from these two stations will be compared in the following section to examine the validity of the proposed standardization method 2 2 standardization methodology the standardization process of raw wind speeds measured from a coastal island is illustrated in fig 2 the anemometer is installed at a height of z m agl the reference height is denoted as z r the reference terrain roughness length is denoted as z 0 r and the marine roughness is denoted as z 0 m respectively the standardization process aims to determine the correction factor cf 1 u z z r z 0 r u z z m c f by multiplying cf the mean wind speed measured by the anemometer i e u z z m can be converted to that at z z r above the reference terrain z 0 r it is clear that u z z m is governed by the approaching marine wind field u z z 0 m and the topographic effects of the island let s define 2 c f 1 u z z r z 0 r u z z m z 0 m 3 c f 2 u z z m z 0 m u z z m then c f can be described as 4 c f c f 1 c f 2 where c f 1 accounts for the conversion between wind speeds at z z r over the reference terrain z 0 r and those at z z m over a marine terrain z 0 m while c f 2 accounts for the conversion between wind speeds at z z m agl above the study site and those at z z m above the marine terrain because both u z z r z 0 r and u z z r z 0 m are associated with flat terrains c f 1 can be determined theoretically this study adopts the method documented in he et al 2016 5 u z z s z 0 s u s κ ln z s z 0 s s r m 6 u r 2 u m 2 c g n r c g n m ln u m f c z 0 m a 0 2 b 0 2 ln u r f c z 0 r a 0 2 b 0 2 where u is the friction velocity κ 0 4 is the von karman constant c g n is the geostrophic drag coefficient f c is the coriolis parameter and a 0 2 and b 0 4 5 are two universal constants equation 5 is the well known logarithm law and equation 6 is deduced from the drag law of the rossby number based on the assumption that the geostrophic wind speed remains unchanged above two adjacent terrains given the values of z 0 r usually 0 03 m z r usually 10 m z 0 m and z m c f 1 can be derived from equations 5 and 6 it is stressed that equations 5 and 6 only account for neutral stratification condition which is the major concern in this study for non neutral atmospheres the issues become much more complicated and it is difficult to develop a standardization method with high reliability thus the cases of non neutral atmospheres are not discussed herein readers can refer to zilitinkevich 2011 for details about the dynamics and modeling of non neutral atmospheres to determine the marine roughness length scale z 0 m the empirical relationship between the marine mean wind speed u z 10 z 0 m or denoted simply as u 10 m and the associated drag coefficient c d 10 m proposed by large and pond 1981 is adopted 7 c d 10 m a 1 a 2 u 10 m where a 1 and a 2 are two coefficients values of the two coefficients differ slightly in literature according to he et al 2016 they are correlated closely with the water depth around the study site field measurements at an offshore area with shallow water show that a 1 0 27 and a 2 0 116 smith et al 1992 these values will be utilized in this study consequently z 0 m can be computed from the following equation 8 z 0 m 10 exp κ c d 10 m equation 7 predicts that c d 10 m and therefore z 0 m increases linearly with increasing u 10 m however some results from field measurements have shown that c d 10 m and z 0 m would level off or even decrease when u 10 m exceeds a certain level powell et al 2003 it may be regarded that the values of c d 10 and z 0 m are capped for u 10 25 m s vickery et al 2009 fig 3 shows the results of c f 1 as function of u z z m z 0 m and z 0 m obtained via the above equations it is noted that several models have been proposed to estimate z 0 m based on varied theories and inputting parameters in this study the model documented in smith et al 1992 which is depicted by equation 7 and 8 is adopted as the preferred model since it has been found to be able to provide reasonable results of marine roughness at the study site he et al 2016 with regard to c f 2 it depends on a combined influence of the topographic effects of the island and the effects due to wind speed dependence of z 0 m however the combined influence has seldom investigated in previous studies in many cases with irregular hills islands as c f 2 cannot be derived theoretically either physical or numerical wind tunnel tests are usually required apparently a key point in wind tunnel tests lies in the simulation of approaching marine wind field whose roughness length varies with wind strength in this study a series of approaching wind fields are simulated whose roughness lengths span a typical range of z 0 m based on the wind tunnel testing results c f 2 associated with a given value of z 0 m can be estimated through interpolation 3 experimental tests 3 1 experimental setup the wind tunnel tests were conducted at the city university of hong kong fig 4 shows the experimental setup a 1 400 down scaled topographic model fig 4a was fabricated to reproduce the topographic features of the cheung chau island within a range of 800 m from cch marked by the red circle in fig 1b the model consisted of 36 layers of 5 mm 2 m in full scale thick foam plates and a cover layer of artificial turf scale models of the main buildings located in the vicinity of the station were also reproduced for the wind tunnel tests it is emphasized that the topographic features in the north and west parts of the cheung chau island were not incorporated in the model tests owing to the limited space of the wind tunnel to enlarge the modeling area a smaller model scale e g 1 800 might be adopted however as the model scale decreases the quality of the model and the simulated approaching wind fields would be degraded severely bowen 2003 it would also be considerably difficult to get accurate measurement of wind speed near the models the approaching wind fields were simulated by a combined use of a barrier plate and an array of roughness elements fig 4b the plate was 0 5 m in height which was placed vertically in the setting chamber of the wind tunnel above the tunnel floor while the length of the roughness elements could be adjusted through remote control altogether 5 approaching wind fields were simulated by changing the length of the roughness elements to account for a series of marine exposure conditions with z 0 m spanning from 0 25 mm to 29 mm in full scale details of the simulated wind fields are shown in fig 5 and table 1 for simplification each wind field is denoted by the length of associated roughness elements above the tunnel floor for example r60 denotes the length of the roughness elements is 60 cm which corresponds to an open flat terrain with z 0 m 0 03 m 3 2 experimental results wind velocities at 11 height levels above cch i e z 300 250 200 150 100 70 50 30 26 7 20 and 10 m agl were measured under the context of each of the 5 approaching wind fields for 16 directions that were stratified uniformly at 22 5 intervals fig 6 depicts the directional values of c f 2 or the ratios between the approaching wind speeds u z z r z 0 m at z r 10 m and the mean wind speeds at different heights above the station u z z m as shown in the figure the values of c f 2 within the lowest 100 m depth depend on a combination of the topographic effects and effects due to the wind speed dependence of marine roughness while the directional discrepancy of c f 2 associated with a given z 0 m e g r60 reflect the topographic effects the discrepancy of c f 2 associated with varied z 0 m at a given direction e g 180 reveal the effects due to the wind speed dependence of marine roughness meanwhile the results of c f 2 demonstrate a height dependent feature the directional discrepancy of c f 2 tends to vanish as the ascent of measurement height and the associated values approximate to unity suggesting the topographic effects become less significant at upper altitudes it is interesting to note that the values of c f 2 with different z 0 m or c f 2 rii ii 00 15 30 45 60 at the same height varies in a consistent pattern with respect to direction quantitative analysis further demonstrates that the ratio between c f 2 rii and c f 2 r 60 at a given height varies insignificantly with direction thus c f 2 rii c f 2 r 60 can be quantified as a function of height and z 0 m as shown in fig 7 from fig 7 it is straightforward that c f 2 increases with the decrease of height and z 0 m at the anemometer height above cch i e 26 7 m agl the value of c f 2 with z 0 m 0 25 mm or with r00 is about 12 larger than that with z 0 r 0 03 m or with r60 by c f 2 the values of c f can be readily derived fig 8 exhibits the directional values of cf at different heights and with varied z 0 m at upper altitudes e g 300 m due to c f 2 1 c f degrades to be governed by c f 1 then the results account only for a conversion from wind speeds at the measurement height above a marine terrain z 0 m to those at the reference height above the reference terrain as the test point gets close to the topography the contribution from c f 2 becomes evident and the values of c f are of directional dependence 3 3 comparison of results fig 9 compares the results of c f at 26 7 m agl via the method presented in this study and that proposed in he et al 2014 hereafter the data driven method which is denoted as dd in the figure it is stressed that the method proposed in he et al 2014 is driven by field measurements consequently the results via this method are expected to be able to reflect all typical effects of the cheung chau island and the topographies located farther away fig 1 however the results from the method proposed in this paper are based on wind tunnel tests during which the north and west parts of the island were not incorporated in the testing model the above discrepancy potentially explains the difference between the two kinds of the results in sector 0 90 in other sectors the results via the data driven method show good agreement with those associated with z 0 m 0 03 m or r60 from this study but differ noticeably from those with other values of z 0 m this is understandable since 1 the results via the data driven method are based on filed measurements collected during strong wind events i e the corresponding z 0 m should largely account for moderate to strong winds 2 there are a number of islands and hills located around the cheung chau island fig 1 and the exposure should be rougher than an open marine terrain one can refer to he et al 2014 for details about the data driven method and associated results 4 validation via field measurements to examine the validity of the proposed standardization scheme field measurements from cch and an offshore platform located in the vicinity of cch are analyzed the validation process is based on the assumption that wind speed records collected synchronously from the two sites should be similar after the standardization process he et al 2014 4 1 description of dataset the location of the offshore platform is marked in fig 1a by the solid circle this platform is established to the southeast of the cheung chau island where the water depth is 20 m the regional topography to the north half plane is complicated this study only considers the sector from east anticlockwise to west or 90 270 as shown in fig 1c the platform consists of two anemometers and a vane respectively for the detection of horizontal wind speed and direction the two anemometers are installed at 21 3 m amsl on a mast with one orientated toward northwest denoted as nw anemometer hereafter and the other toward southeast se anemometer hereafter the vane is installed at 18 6 m amsl just under the se anemometer measurements from the above mentioned instruments including mean wind speed and direction were recorded every 10 min a 4 years 2012 2015 dataset from both cch and the platform is available previous studies revealed that the mast can result in evident interference effects on downstream wind shu et al 2016 thus the records from the nw anemometer are not used in the following discussions 4 2 comparison of wind speeds at the two sites as the offshore platform is located with an open marine exposure the standardization method documented in he et al 2016 is adopted to convert the measured marine wind speeds at this site to the potential speed values that are associated with a 10 min average duration at 10 m above the reference terrain z 0 r 0 03 m on the other hand wind speed measurements from cch are standardized by the method proposed in this paper figs 10 and 11 show the comparison between the wind speed records from the two sites before denoted as raw speed and after corrected speed the standardization process results in fig 10 are presented in a form of normalized probability density function pdf those in fig 11 correspond to an episode of the time histories because the anemometers at the two sites are located at a comparable height the raw wind speeds from the two sites differ less distinctly under low to moderately strong wind conditions fig 10 even though there is a slight systematic bias between the two sets of raw wind speed records under strong wind conditions raw wind measurements from the two sites differ significantly fig 11 by contrast after the standardization process the results from the two stations agree well with each other which suggests the validity of the proposed standardization method 5 concluding remarks this paper presents a study on the standardization of marine surface wind speed records measured at coastal islands hills a standardization scheme was proposed which takes into account a combination of the topographic effects and effects due to the wind speed dependence of marine roughness a case study based on wind tunnel tests was presented to illustrate the proposed method and typical results obtained during the standardization process the results showed that the topographic effects are coupled with the characteristics of approaching wind fields the value of c f 2 by multiplying which the measured mean wind speed above the island can be converted to that at the same height above an open sea terrain can vary as far as over 10 for approaching wind fields with different roughness length scales this observation suggests the necessity of estimating the topographic effects under the context of different marine exposures associated with varied wind strengths field measurements from two coastal meteorological stations were analyzed the good agreement between the standardized wind speeds from the two sites demonstrated the validity of the proposed method acknowledgement the authors would like to express their gratitude to the technicians at the wind tunnel laboratory of the

of c f 2 associated with a given z 0 m e g r60 reflect the topographic effects the discrepancy of c f 2 associated with varied z 0 m at a given direction e g 180 reveal the effects due to the wind speed dependence of marine roughness meanwhile the results of c f 2 demonstrate a height dependent feature the directional discrepancy of c f 2 tends to vanish as the ascent of measurement height and the associated values approximate to unity suggesting the topographic effects become less significant at upper altitudes it is interesting to note that the values of c f 2 with different z 0 m or c f 2 rii ii 00 15 30 45 60 at the same height varies in a consistent pattern with respect to direction quantitative analysis further demonstrates that the ratio between c f 2 rii and c f 2 r 60 at a given height varies insignificantly with direction thus c f 2 rii c f 2 r 60 can be quantified as a function of height and z 0 m as shown in fig 7 from fig 7 it is straightforward that c f 2 increases with the decrease of height and z 0 m at the anemometer height above cch i e 26 7 m agl the value of c f 2 with z 0 m 0 25 mm or with r00 is about 12 larger than that with z 0 r 0 03 m or with r60 by c f 2 the values of c f can be readily derived fig 8 exhibits the directional values of cf at different heights and with varied z 0 m at upper altitudes e g 300 m due to c f 2 1 c f degrades to be governed by c f 1 then the results account only for a conversion from wind speeds at the measurement height above a marine terrain z 0 m to those at the reference height above the reference terrain as the test point gets close to the topography the contribution from c f 2 becomes evident and the values of c f are of directional dependence 3 3 comparison of results fig 9 compares the results of c f at 26 7 m agl via the method presented in this study and that proposed in he et al 2014 hereafter the data driven method which is denoted as dd in the figure it is stressed that the method proposed in he et al 2014 is driven by field measurements consequently the results via this method are expected to be able to reflect all typical effects of the cheung chau island and the topographies located farther away fig 1 however the results from the method proposed in this paper are based on wind tunnel tests during which the north and west parts of the island were not incorporated in the testing model the above discrepancy potentially explains the difference between the two kinds of the results in sector 0 90 in other sectors the results via the data driven method show good agreement with those associated with z 0 m 0 03 m or r60 from this study but differ noticeably from those with other values of z 0 m this is understandable since 1 the results via the data driven method are based on filed measurements collected during strong wind events i e the corresponding z 0 m should largely account for moderate to strong winds 2 there are a number of islands and hills located around the cheung chau island fig 1 and the exposure should be rougher than an open marine terrain one can refer to he et al 2014 for details about the data driven method and associated results 4 validation via field measurements to examine the validity of the proposed standardization scheme field measurements from cch and an offshore platform located in the vicinity of cch are analyzed the validation process is based on the assumption that wind speed records collected synchronously from the two sites should be similar after the standardization process he et al 2014 4 1 description of dataset the location of the offshore platform is marked in fig 1a by the solid circle this platform is established to the southeast of the cheung chau island where the water depth is 20 m the regional topography to the north half plane is complicated this study only considers the sector from east anticlockwise to west or 90 270 as shown in fig 1c the platform consists of two anemometers and a vane respectively for the detection of horizontal wind speed and direction the two anemometers are installed at 21 3 m amsl on a mast with one orientated toward northwest denoted as nw anemometer hereafter and the other toward southeast se anemometer hereafter the vane is installed at 18 6 m amsl just under the se anemometer measurements from the above mentioned instruments including mean wind speed and direction were recorded every 10 min a 4 years 2012 2015 dataset from both cch and the platform is available previous studies revealed that the mast can result in evident interference effects on downstream wind shu et al 2016 thus the records from the nw anemometer are not used in the following discussions 4 2 comparison of wind speeds at the two sites as the offshore platform is located with an open marine exposure the standardization method documented in he et al 2016 is adopted to convert the measured marine wind speeds at this site to the potential speed values that are associated with a 10 min average duration at 10 m above the reference terrain z 0 r 0 03 m on the other hand wind speed measurements from cch are standardized by the method proposed in this paper figs 10 and 11 show the comparison between the wind speed records from the two sites before denoted as raw speed and after corrected speed the standardization process results in fig 10 are presented in a form of normalized probability density function pdf those in fig 11 correspond to an episode of the time histories because the anemometers at the two sites are located at a comparable height the raw wind speeds from the two sites differ less distinctly under low to moderately strong wind conditions fig 10 even though there is a slight systematic bias between the two sets of raw wind speed records under strong wind conditions raw wind measurements from the two sites differ significantly fig 11 by contrast after the standardization process the results from the two stations agree well with each other which suggests the validity of the proposed standardization method 5 concluding remarks this paper presents a study on the standardization of marine surface wind speed records measured at coastal islands hills a standardization scheme was proposed which takes into account a combination of the topographic effects and effects due to the wind speed dependence of marine roughness a case study based on wind tunnel tests was presented to illustrate the proposed method and typical results obtained during the standardization process the results showed that the topographic effects are coupled with the characteristics of approaching wind fields the value of c f 2 by multiplying which the measured mean wind speed above the island can be converted to that at the same height above an open sea terrain can vary as far as over 10 for approaching wind fields with different roughness length scales this observation suggests the necessity of estimating the topographic effects under the context of different marine exposures associated with varied wind strengths field measurements from two coastal meteorological stations were analyzed the good agreement between the standardized wind speeds from the two sites demonstrated the validity of the proposed method acknowledgement the authors would like to express their gratitude to the technicians at the wind tunnel laboratory of the

is a viable solution to solve our ever growing energy demand albeit its easy availability immature energy extraction technology restricts the commercialization of wave energy converters wec renewables 2018 there are various types of wecs proposed and the oscillating water column owc is one of the most commonly used wec the owc consists of a partially submerged opening through which the incoming wave compresses and expands the entrapped air which drives the air turbine the airflow inside the owc is bi directional and the air turbine has to rotate in the same direction the commonly used air turbines for this application are the wells turbine and impulse turbine the wells turbine is an axial reaction turbine that has a symmetrical blade and rotates in the same direction without using guide vanes on the other hand the impulse turbine uses rectifying guide vanes to achieve unidirectional rotation for the oscillating flow the wells turbine has several limitations such as noisy operation low operating range and poor starting characteristics etc in the contrary impulse turbine has better starting characteristics and a wider operating range hence it is a better choice for wave energy extraction in owc setoguchi et al 1993 the impulse turbine consists of upstream and downstream guide vane gv rows to guide the flow and to increase the available kinetic energy to the rotor blade as the name suggests the impulse turbine uses the kinetic energy available in the airflow to rotate the rotor blade the fixed gv configuration of an impulse turbine has advantages such as simple construction and less maintenance cost several authors proposed various design modifications such as end plate hyun et al 2005 ring type blade hyun et al 2006 blade setting angle liu et al 2016 and blade lean ranjith et al 2018 etc to improve the efficiency of the impulse turbine moreover optimization is essential to improve the performance of the impulse turbine and most of the optimization process is performed on air turbines used in owc however most of them are focused on improving wells turbine performance table 1 provides the list of optimizations performed on impulse and wells turbines used in owc it is shown that the optimization of the impulse turbine is an immature state as compared to wells turbine optimization many authors tried to optimize the blade shape sweep and blade pitch angle of the wells turbine to enhance its performance however few authors have been reported to automated optimization mohamed et al mohamed et al 2008 2011 mohamed and shaaban 2013 coupled their in house code opal with cfd to automate the optimization of wells turbine which reduces the time consuming geometry modification and grid generation process kurtaran et al 2003 used ansys design optimization module to automate the optimization of laminated armor for better impact performance idahosa et al 2008 reported automated optimization of fan blade using bladegen bladegenplus with visualdoc for optimization to improve its efficiency similarly park and dang 2010 presented a coupled cad cae optimization with surrogate models for structural applications and reported that the automated approach saved the computational cost compared to the manual optimization method considering the advantages of the automated optimization framework a coupled cad cfd automated optimization using ansys design modeler geometry ansys turbogrid grid ansys cfx and ansys design exploration optimization is adopted to improve the impulse turbine performance only a handful of open literature is available in the area of impulse turbine optimization and a limited design parameter such as blade thickness parameters number of blades and gvs are optimized likewise identification and optimization of different potential design parameters are necessary to improve the performance of the impulse turbine the impulse turbine performance is very sensitive to the nature of fluid incidence at the inlet and exit of a rotor blade as it may lead to flow separation and increased aerodynamic losses to minimize the losses the fluid should enter and exit the rotor blade smoothly hence in this study the blade leading edge le and trailing edge te ratios are chosen as design parameters with efficiency maximization as the objective the le and te ratio is varied at both the hub and tip section the central composite design is used to create the design points and the response surface optimization is used to obtain the optimum design point in addition a detailed flow field analyses of the reference and optimized design is presented 2 numerical methodology initially the reference geometry for an impulse turbine with a fixed guide vane was selected from the open literature maeda et al 1999 fig 1 a and b shows the 2 d schematic profile and 3 d cad model the computational domain of the turbine is shown in fig 2 and the upstream and downstream domain length was kept as eight times the blade chord length the speed of the turbine was fixed as 600 rpm a single blade with a periodic interface was taken as flow domain for the numerical study the tip clearance was kept as 1 mm the rotor and guide vane consist of thirty and twenty six blades respectively the turbine has unidirectional rotation irrespective of the flow direction table 2 provides the reference geometry specifications fig 3 displays the computational mesh ansys turbo grid was used to discretize the flow domain with structured hexahedral elements a fine mesh was employed near the rotor blade and guide vane surface to capture the boundary layer flow the y plus value was kept greater than 30 table 3 shows the meshing details and the applied boundary conditions the ansys cfx v16 2 cfx ansys 2011 is a coupled solver and it was employed to simulate the flow by solving steady incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with the k epsilon turbulence model the high resolution advection scheme with second order accuracy was used for spatial discretization the residual convergence criteria and mass imbalance were fixed as 1 0e 5 and 0 001 respectively 3 numerical optimization the objective of present optimization is to determine the optimal blade leading and trailing edge ratio to enhance the rotor performance the optimization procedure is shown in fig 4 initially a reference guide vane and rotor blade profile was considered and the computational domain was created ansys turbogrid was used for grid generation including mesh quality check and cfd code ansys cfx was employed to calculate the flow field around the blade the aerodynamic performance was evaluated and validated with experimental results regarding optimization ansys design exploration module was used to automate the process it estimates the relationship between the design parameters and the objective function using a design of experiments and response surface approximation exploration ansys design 2013 once the design parameters and its bounds were selected the central composite design ccd sampling technique produced the design points in given design space and the geometry model of the design points were generated in ansys design modeler and they were coupled with ansys turbogrid and ansys cfx to discretize and to evaluate the objective function value after the initial setup no manual intervention was required for modeling meshing and solving new design points a response surface method was generated to estimate the optimum point in ansys design exploration module they run automatically as a repeated loop till the optimization convergence criteria were satisfied and finally the optimum design point was obtained a schematic diagram of the procedure mentioned above is provided below 3 1 central composite design to create the response surface model it is required to fill design points in the design space the central composite designs ccd is one of the techniques used to fill the design space exploration ansys design 2013 it is a five level fractional factorial design the design consists of three different types of points axial points 2 n cube points 2n and center points ccd ensure that all the points are distanced optimally from each other within the given design space fig 5 shows a central composite for design variables 3 2 response surface methodology rsm a second order polynomial regression model estimates the relation between design parameters and objective function using the cfd result of the design points based on the above estimation a response surface was generated it provides the continuous variation of the relation between the input design parameters and the objective function there are two different types of

variables were selected to modify the blade leading and trailing edge ratio the variables were varied in combination rather than varying only one at a time the leading and trailing edge ratio was defined at the hub and blade tip section of the blade the definition of the leading and trailing edge is shown in fig 6 table 4 shows the design space of the chosen design parameters the maximization of efficiency was chosen as the objective function to improve turbine performance 4 result and discussion 4 1 grid convergence study and numerical validation grid convergence index gci based on richardson extrapolation was used to estimate the numerical uncertainty caused by discretization error three grids with a different resolution such as fine 984 144 medium 784 458 and coarse 499 788 were selected for the convergence study the refinement of grids was done by varying the global size factor and the turbine torque t was chosen as the performance parameter to be evaluated the procedure given in celik et al 2008 was followed to determine gci initially the average grid size h for a three dimensional flow domain is calculated as 8 h 1 n i 1 n δ v i 1 3 where n is number of elements in the flow domain δ v i is the volume of ith element the subscripts 1 2 3 signify fine medium and coarse grids respectively the apparent order p is given by 9 p 1 ln r 21 l n ε 32 ε 21 q p where q p l n r 21 p s r 32 p s r 21 h 2 h 1 r 32 h 3 h 2 10 s 1 s i g n ε 32 ε 21 where ε 32 t 3 t 2 ε 21 t 2 t 1 the term q p will reduces to zero if the refinement factor between the successive grids are constant and the convergence ratio r is expressed as 11 r ε 21 ε 32 the nature of convergence depends on the value of r if the value of r lies in between 0 and 1 it is monotonic convergence and if it is less than 0 it is oscillatory convergence when the r value exceeds 1 then it is divergence the extrapolated values and realative error are obtained from 12 φ e x t 12 r 21 p t 1 t 2 r 21 p 1 13 e e x t 21 φ e x t 12 t 2 φ e x t 12 the approximate error and gci are given by 14 e a 21 t 1 t 2 t 1 15 g c i f i n e 21 1 25 e a 21 r 21 p 1 table 5 shows the uncertainty estimation using gci it can be seen that the numerical uncertainty reduces with refinement in grid size and gci for the fine and coarse grids are 0 50 and 0 95 respectively since the gci for coarse grids is less than 1 it can be considered that the solution is asymptotic and the coarse grid was retained for simulations to reduce computational time in addition the comparison of performance parameters using different grids is shown in fig 7 and the results show insignificant variation for different grids throughout the flow range the present computation results were compared with the experimental results available in the open literature maeda et al 1999 and reported in fig 8 the input coefficient torque coefficient and efficient are reported for a wider flow coefficient it is shown that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results the non dimensionless performance parameters are represented by 16 input coefficient c a 2 δ p q ρ a v a 2 u r 2 b l r z v a 17 torque coefficient c

6 shows the performance of design points with various leading edge and trailing edge ratio at tip and hub section for peak flow coefficient φ 1 13 the results imply that the leading edge and trailing edge ratio influences the turbine performance and the optimum leading and trailing edge ratio at hub and tip section calculated from rsa is shown in table 7 the low fidelity results obtained from rsa is validated with the high fidelity cfd results and it can be seen that the rsa model estimated the optimum design point with significant accuracy error 3 5 a detailed analysis of the reference and the optimum design is explained below 4 3 flowfield analysis fig 9 a and b shows reference blade and optimized blade le and te and their comparison of performance parameters between the reference and optimized blade as revealed in the figure the input coefficient increases with the flow coefficient for both cases the optimum blade exhibits a reduced pressured drop than the reference blade due to leading and trailing edge modification fig 9b on the other hand the torque coefficient is almost identical for both blades fig 9b the optimized blade shows enhanced efficiency for the entire flow range since the efficiency is inversely proportional to the pressure drop the optimum blade shows improved efficiency fig 10 shows the pressure distribution at two different planes along the blade spanwise direction at low flow coefficient 1 13 it is noticed that pressure distribution along the spanwise direction is almost the same for optimized and reference blade with an increase in flow coefficient the pressure increases at flow coefficient 1 88 the pressure is almost the same for upstream guide vane in case of optimum blade the high pressure region visible at rotor blade and downstream guide vane is slightly reduced compared to a reference blade likewise at higher flow coefficient 2 50 similar behavior can be noticed for the optimized blade this behavior reduces the severity of the adverse pressure gradient which deteriorates the turbine performance by flow separation additionally the optimum blade shows a reduced pressure drop at downstream guide vane due to le and te modification thereby enhancing efficiency fig 11 shows two different planes along the blade spanwise direction and streamlines along the blade passage as revealed in fig 11b plane 1 exhibits a significant difference in the flow pattern at te for optimum blade shows more streamlines clustered near blade surface compared to reference case and it signifies high fluid velocity at the exit the above said effect is more significant at higher flow coefficients in optimum blade the reduced adverse pressure gradient near te due to leading edge and trailing edge ratio modification is responsible for the increased velocity at the exit fig 10 on the other side it is shown that the flow behavior is almost identical at plane 2 for both reference and optimum blades fig 12 shows static pressure distribution along the blade midspan for reference and optimized blade as revealed in the figure for optimum blade the pressure in upstream guide vane is slightly lesser than the reference blade for all flow coefficients in case of a rotor blade the pressure at le is almost identical for both blades and only a marginal difference is noticed at φ 2 5 the optimum blade shows reduced static pressure at blade te compared to a reference blade for all flow coefficients additionally downstream guide vane losses are the reason behind the reduced efficiency of the impulse turbine the optimum blade shows reduced pressure at inlet of the downstream guide vane compared to the reference blade and this behavior is visible for all flow coefficients the optimized leading and trailing edge ratio altered the flow pattern and reduced the pressure drop and this is the reason behind the enhanced efficiency of the optimized blade for further understanding static pressure and velocity distribution along the streamwise direction for different flow coefficients is shown in fig 13 the static pressure drop occurs in the upstream guide vane which increases the velocity of the airflow before entering the rotor inside the rotor the fluid accelerates up to mid chord and then decelerates due to converging and a diverging cross section of the flow passage hence the flow is more prone to separation at diverging section due to adverse pressure gradient and a similar behavior can be noticed in both blades however the velocity of the optimum blade at divergent section is higher than the reference blade which resists flow separation due to higher momentum of the fluid the same phenomenon can be explained by the marginal decrease in pressure at blade te for the optimum blade moreover at the downstream guide vane the velocity decreases and the static pressure rises due to the diverging flow passage for both blades the variation in pressure and velocity is almost the same and no significant variation is observed fig 14 illustrates the axial velocity contours along the blade chordwise direction for the reference and optimum blades as explained above the optimum blade exhibits higher velocity at blade trailing edge than the reference blade for all flow coefficients this effect intensifies with an increase in flow coefficient the reason behind this flow behavior is the modified blade leading and trailing edge in the optimum blade and it alleviates the adverse pressure gradient along the blade ss to improve performance as revealed in fig 14 the low velocity region which signifies passage vortex is also reduced in optimum blade compared to the reference case the above results prove that the optimized leading and trailing edge parameters reduced the pressure drop and improved efficiency 5 conclusion this paper presents the coupled cad cfd automated optimization of blade leading edge and trailing edge ratio in impulse turbine using ansys design exploration

resolution advection scheme with second order accuracy was used for spatial discretization the residual convergence criteria and mass imbalance were fixed as 1 0e 5 and 0 001 respectively 3 numerical optimization the objective of present optimization is to determine the optimal blade leading and trailing edge ratio to enhance the rotor performance the optimization procedure is shown in fig 4 initially a reference guide vane and rotor blade profile was considered and the computational domain was created ansys turbogrid was used for grid generation including mesh quality check and cfd code ansys cfx was employed to calculate the flow field around the blade the aerodynamic performance was evaluated and validated with experimental results regarding optimization ansys design exploration module was used to automate the process it estimates the relationship between the design parameters and the objective function using a design of experiments and response surface approximation exploration ansys design 2013 once the design parameters and its bounds were selected the central composite design ccd sampling technique produced the design points in given design space and the geometry model of the design points were generated in ansys design modeler and they were coupled with ansys turbogrid and ansys cfx to discretize and to evaluate the objective function value after the initial setup no manual intervention was required for modeling meshing and solving new design points a response surface method was generated to estimate the optimum point in ansys design exploration module they run automatically as a repeated loop till the optimization convergence criteria were satisfied and finally the optimum design point was obtained a schematic diagram of the procedure mentioned above is provided below 3 1 central composite design to create the response surface model it is required to fill design points in the design space the central composite designs ccd is one of the techniques used to fill the design space exploration ansys design 2013 it is a five level fractional factorial design the design consists of three different types of points axial points 2 n cube points 2n and center points ccd ensure that all the points are distanced optimally from each other within the given design space fig 5 shows a central composite for design variables 3 2 response surface methodology rsm a second order polynomial regression model estimates the relation between design parameters and objective function using the cfd result of the design points based on the above estimation a response surface was generated it provides the continuous variation of the relation between the input design parameters and the objective function there are two different types of

variables were selected to modify the blade leading and trailing edge ratio the variables were varied in combination rather than varying only one at a time the leading and trailing edge ratio was defined at the hub and blade tip section of the blade the definition of the leading and trailing edge is shown in fig 6 table 4 shows the design space of the chosen design parameters the maximization of efficiency was chosen as the objective function to improve turbine performance 4 result and discussion 4 1 grid convergence study and numerical validation grid convergence index gci based on richardson extrapolation was used to estimate the numerical uncertainty caused by discretization error three grids with a different resolution such as fine 984 144 medium 784 458 and coarse 499 788 were selected for the convergence study the refinement of grids was done by varying the global size factor and the turbine torque t was chosen as the performance parameter to be evaluated the procedure given in celik et al 2008 was followed to determine gci initially the average grid size h for a three dimensional flow domain is calculated as 8 h 1 n i 1 n δ v i 1 3 where n is number of elements in the flow domain δ v i is the volume of ith element the subscripts 1 2 3 signify fine medium and coarse grids respectively the apparent order p is given by 9 p 1 ln r 21 l n ε 32 ε 21 q p where q p l n r 21 p s r 32 p s r 21 h 2 h 1 r 32 h 3 h 2 10 s 1 s i g n ε 32 ε 21 where ε 32 t 3 t 2 ε 21 t 2 t 1 the term q p will reduces to zero if the refinement factor between the successive grids are constant and the convergence ratio r is expressed as 11 r ε 21 ε 32 the nature of convergence depends on the value of r if the value of r lies in between 0 and 1 it is monotonic convergence and if it is less than 0 it is oscillatory convergence when the r value exceeds 1 then it is divergence the extrapolated values and realative error are obtained from 12 φ e x t 12 r 21 p t 1 t 2 r 21 p 1 13 e e x t 21 φ e x t 12 t 2 φ e x t 12 the approximate error and gci are given by 14 e a 21 t 1 t 2 t 1 15 g c i f i n e 21 1 25 e a 21 r 21 p 1 table 5 shows the uncertainty estimation using gci it can be seen that the numerical uncertainty reduces with refinement in grid size and gci for the fine and coarse grids are 0 50 and 0 95 respectively since the gci for coarse grids is less than 1 it can be considered that the solution is asymptotic and the coarse grid was retained for simulations to reduce computational time in addition the comparison of performance parameters using different grids is shown in fig 7 and the results show insignificant variation for different grids throughout the flow range the present computation results were compared with the experimental results available in the open literature maeda et al 1999 and reported in fig 8 the input coefficient torque coefficient and efficient are reported for a wider flow coefficient it is shown that the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results the non dimensionless performance parameters are represented by 16 input coefficient c a 2 δ p q ρ a v a 2 u r 2 b l r z v a 17 torque coefficient c

6 shows the performance of design points with various leading edge and trailing edge ratio at tip and hub section for peak flow coefficient φ 1 13 the results imply that the leading edge and trailing edge ratio influences the turbine performance and the optimum leading and trailing edge ratio at hub and tip section calculated from rsa is shown in table 7 the low fidelity results obtained from rsa is validated with the high fidelity cfd results and it can be seen that the rsa model estimated the optimum design point with significant accuracy error 3 5 a detailed analysis of the reference and the optimum design is explained below 4 3 flowfield analysis fig 9 a and b shows reference blade and optimized blade le and te and their comparison of performance parameters between the reference and optimized blade as revealed in the figure the input coefficient increases with the flow coefficient for both cases the optimum blade exhibits a reduced pressured drop than the reference blade due to leading and trailing edge modification fig 9b on the other hand the torque coefficient is almost identical for both blades fig 9b the optimized blade shows enhanced efficiency for the entire flow range since the efficiency is inversely proportional to the pressure drop the optimum blade shows improved efficiency fig 10 shows the pressure distribution at two different planes along the blade spanwise direction at low flow coefficient 1 13 it is noticed that pressure distribution along the spanwise direction is almost the same for optimized and reference blade with an increase in flow coefficient the pressure increases at flow coefficient 1 88 the pressure is almost the same for upstream guide vane in case of optimum blade the high pressure region visible at rotor blade and downstream guide vane is slightly reduced compared to a reference blade likewise at higher flow coefficient 2 50 similar behavior can be noticed for the optimized blade this behavior reduces the severity of the adverse pressure gradient which deteriorates the turbine performance by flow separation additionally the optimum blade shows a reduced pressure drop at downstream guide vane due to le and te modification thereby enhancing efficiency fig 11 shows two different planes along the blade spanwise direction and streamlines along the blade passage as revealed in fig 11b plane 1 exhibits a significant difference in the flow pattern at te for optimum blade shows more streamlines clustered near blade surface compared to reference case and it signifies high fluid velocity at the exit the above said effect is more significant at higher flow coefficients in optimum blade the reduced adverse pressure gradient near te due to leading edge and trailing edge ratio modification is responsible for the increased velocity at the exit fig 10 on the other side it is shown that the flow behavior is almost identical at plane 2 for both reference and optimum blades fig 12 shows static pressure distribution along the blade midspan for reference and optimized blade as revealed in the figure for optimum blade the pressure in upstream guide vane is slightly lesser than the reference blade for all flow coefficients in case of a rotor blade the pressure at le is almost identical for both blades and only a marginal difference is noticed at φ 2 5 the optimum blade shows reduced static pressure at blade te compared to a reference blade for all flow coefficients additionally downstream guide vane losses are the reason behind the reduced efficiency of the impulse turbine the optimum blade shows reduced pressure at inlet of the downstream guide vane compared to the reference blade and this behavior is visible for all flow coefficients the optimized leading and trailing edge ratio altered the flow pattern and reduced the pressure drop and this is the reason behind the enhanced efficiency of the optimized blade for further understanding static pressure and velocity distribution along the streamwise direction for different flow coefficients is shown in fig 13 the static pressure drop occurs in the upstream guide vane which increases the velocity of the airflow before entering the rotor inside the rotor the fluid accelerates up to mid chord and then decelerates due to converging and a diverging cross section of the flow passage hence the flow is more prone to separation at diverging section due to adverse pressure gradient and a similar behavior can be noticed in both blades however the velocity of the optimum blade at divergent section is higher than the reference blade which resists flow separation due to higher momentum of the fluid the same phenomenon can be explained by the marginal decrease in pressure at blade te for the optimum blade moreover at the downstream guide vane the velocity decreases and the static pressure rises due to the diverging flow passage for both blades the variation in pressure and velocity is almost the same and no significant variation is observed fig 14 illustrates the axial velocity contours along the blade chordwise direction for the reference and optimum blades as explained above the optimum blade exhibits higher velocity at blade trailing edge than the reference blade for all flow coefficients this effect intensifies with an increase in flow coefficient the reason behind this flow behavior is the modified blade leading and trailing edge in the optimum blade and it alleviates the adverse pressure gradient along the blade ss to improve performance as revealed in fig 14 the low velocity region which signifies passage vortex is also reduced in optimum blade compared to the reference case the above results prove that the optimized leading and trailing edge parameters reduced the pressure drop and improved efficiency 5 conclusion this paper presents the coupled cad cfd automated optimization of blade leading edge and trailing edge ratio in impulse turbine using ansys design exploration module the central composite method generated the design points and response surface methodology optimized the design parameters to maximize efficiency the numerical simulations were performed using commercial cfd code ansys cfx v16 2 the following conclusions are drawn from this study the blade leading and trailing edge ratio are potential design parameters to improve the efficiency of the impulse turbine the automated optimization method evaluated the optimum design point with considerable accuracy error 3 5 the optimized leading and trailing edge parameters altered the flow pattern and reduced the pressure drop thereby increasing efficiency the optimum design enhanced the relative efficiency and torque by 3 4 and 2 respectively and the relative pressure drop decreased by 1 6 the automated optimization approach reduced the optimization time by eliminating the manual geometry design grid generation process and solving moreover it can be extended to optimize other blade

21672,the present work investigates the possibility of using random field techniques in modelling the mechanical behaviour of corroded thick steel plate specimens the nonlinear finite element method employing the explicit dynamic solver is used to analyse the mechanical properties of typical specimens a material model considering full nonlinearity is used to evaluate the stress strain response the influence of major governing parameters of both specimen dimensions and random field is investigated through the sensitivity analysis in order to validate the proposed methodology results are compared with available experimental data showing an excellent agreement in both mechanical properties and stress strain relationships additionally the conclusion is made that the irregularities in the corroded surface are the main factor resulting in the decrease of mechanical properties in this way random field modelling appeared to be a practical and fast technique for modelling the corroded surfaces of steel structures in analysing their structural behaviour keywords corrosion mechanical properties finite element method random field 1 introduction all metal structures operating in atmospheric or marine conditions are subjected to corrosion degradation garbatov et al 2006 which leads to a thickness reduction nowadays different models to evaluate the corrosion loss as a function of time exist garbatov et al 2006 melchers 2008 paik et al 2004 nevertheless it is noticed that the mechanical properties of structural elements could be reduced with the corrosion degradation progress garbatov et al 2014b the combination of these two factors can severely reduce the strength of structures garbatov et al 2014a saad eldeen et al 2012 wang et al 2014 woloszyk et al 2018 woloszyk and garbatov 2019a in recent years different studies focused on the investigation experimentally and numerically of the mechanical properties reduction of steel specimens caused by corrosion degradation the experimental analysis of corroded steel bars in natural and laboratory environment was conducted in fernandez and berrocal 2019 kashani et al 2013 zhang et al 2006 the maximum reduction in the case of yield strength was up to 30 and 80 in the case of total elongation for the most severely corroded elements the measurements of the corrosion morphology shown that the minimum cross sectional area may govern the mechanical properties reduction when analysing ship and offshore structures the plates are more often used in their construction and thus the flat specimens are used in defining the mechanical properties and with this respect many specimens of different levels of severity were analysed in garbatov et al 2014b for the specimens with corrosion severity above 20 the reduction of mechanical properties revealed to be very significant the reduction is observed in all mechanical properties i e yield stress ultimate stress young modulus and total elongation other studies related to flat specimens were done in nie et al 2019 qin et al 2016 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2019b 2019a leading to similar conclusions nevertheless even for the lower level of corrosion degradation the decrease of mechanical properties was also observed the reduction was even magnified when the specimens were pre stressed and corroded li et al 2018 li et al 2019 the majority of the studies agreed that ideally uniform corrosion degradation would not cause a significant reduction of mechanical properties in this way the decrease is mostly caused by the non uniformity of the corroded surface cairns et al 2005 du et al 2005a 2005b palsson and mirza 2002 this hypothesis is supported by garbatov et al 2018 where specimens subjected to different cleaning methods compared to only corroded ones revealed to have higher values of the mechanical properties in the case of the ship and offshore structures the most common type of corrosion is the non uniform one and the above foundlings cannot be neglected different mathematical models for predicting the mechanical properties of structural members were developed recently ahmmad and sumi 2010 appuhamy et al 2011 fernandez et al 2016 flaks 1978 moreno et al 2014 nakai et al 2004 mostly they are based on the experimental results a simplified model for corroded bars was shown in d li et al 2018 the model for corroded flat specimens was also developed in garbatov et al 2014b in the study performed by wang et al 2017 the experimental results were compared with the fe estimations and the agreement was excellent additionally they showed that the results of different mathematical models might differ significantly thus the unified approach to model the mechanical properties changes concerning corrosion needs to be developed the corrode plate surface similar to a different natural phenomenon such as waves is stochastically originated in this way the modelling with the use of the random field jankowski and walukiewicz 1997 seems to be accurate for the purpose the examples of engineering applications with the use of random field modelling may be found in górski et al 2015 górski and winkelmann 2017 teixeira and guedes soares 2008 the possibility of random techniques usage in corrosion modelling was shown in garbatov and guedes soares 2017 nevertheless the stochastic modelling provides many samples which may need a large amount of computational time but may provide a good statistical base for the reliability analysis melchers 2017 woloszyk and garbatov 2019b of the ship and offshore structures the present study is a continuation of the work done in woloszyk and garbatov 2020 in the previous study the capabilities of random field modelling of corroded specimens were explored in the case of very thin specimens 1 mm of the initial thickness the results were compared with the experimental data as presented in nie et al 2019 and the evident agreement was observed for the lower level of the degree of degradation however for severely corroded plates more significant deviations were observed nevertheless the very thin plates can be found rarely in case of the ship and offshore structures thus the present work explores the possibility of the random field modelling of corroded specimens of thicker thicknesses in the range between 6 up to 9 mm the nonlinear fe analysis performed with the use of the explicit dynamic solver is employed here the sensitivity of the governing geometrical parameters of the specimen and random field is also analysed the results are validated with experimental data provided in wang et al 2017 2 corrosion modelling using random field approach the random field which is the set of spatially correlated random variables seems to be the most suitable technique to model corroded plate surfaces in the case of numerical modelling the discretised random field needs to be used where one of those discretisation methods may be found in ghanem and spanos 1991 li and der kiureghian 1993 in the current study the karhunen loeve expansion ghanem and spanos 1991 is employed the gaussian random field is defined by its mean μ x variance σ 2 x and autocovariance function c x x the detailed explanation of random field was already presented in woloszyk and garbatov 2020 the square exponential autocovariance used in this study 1 c x x exp x x 2 c 0 2 where x x is the absolute distance between any two points in the meshed surface and c 0 is the correlation length the spatial variation of the field is mostly dependent on the correlation length with the increase of correlation length the field becomes smoother whereas with the decrease of correlation length the field became more irregular two fields with the same mean value and variance but with different correlation lengths are presented in fig 1 the matlab software mathworks 2019 with a specially developed program code constantine 2012 is used to generate the gaussian random field h x for the specified mesh and various correlation lengths however based on the measurements of corroded surfaces wang et al 2017 it can be noticed that the maximum corrosion depth is often much higher than the mean value this leads to the log normal distribution which is obtained by the transformation of the normal field 2 l x exp μ σ h x where μ and σ are the location and scale parameters of the log normal field respectively there need to be calibrated to produce a proper mean value and standard deviation of the currently developed field the random field can be generated for the assumed values of the mean value and standard deviation of the corrosion depth however in the present study the statistical descriptors are calibrated based on the experimental results wang et al 2017 to show the feasibility of the proposed methodology the considered random field is assumed to be isotropic whereas in real corrosion conditions some anisotropy is possible however for small scale specimens it could be observed that the corrosion surfaces are somewhat regular 3 finite element modelling for the simulation of the tensile test of steel specimens ansys ls dyna ansys inc 2019 software is employed the multilinear stress strain relationship of the material and solid 164 elements are used with the explicit dynamics solver apart from the quasi static origin of the tensile testing the explicit solver is used to pass the convergence problem bäker 2018 which originates from both corrosion degradation and necking phenomenon in the standards of tensile testing iso 2009 the engineering stress strain curve is established however in the fe analysis one needs to define the true stress strain σ t r u e ε t r u e relationship as 3 ε t r u e ln 1 ε 4 σ t r u e σ 1 ε where σ and ε are engineering stress and strain respectively the above formulations are valid up to the ultimate tensile strength point where the necking phenomenon starts to occur and the power law based procedure is introduced kwesi nutor 2017 5 σ t r u e k ε t r u e n where n and k are the strain hardening parameter and strength coefficient respectively fig 2 shows the specimen scheme and the fe model the area of the corroded part of the specimen has a size of 50 25 mm and thus the mesh is very dense in this region in the case of mounting and transitional parts of the specimen their finite element size is not relevant since there are mainly distributing the longitudinal load to simulate the experimental conditions the mounting parts are fixed and one of them is subjected to a longitudinal displacement the displacement is realised via small increments in the time domain in the explicit solver for identifying the proper element size the mesh convergence studies are carried out the results of the analysis with an element size a from 0 5 mm up to 5 mm are presented in fig 3 the most refined mesh provides accurate results however with the element size of 1 mm the results are also accurate nevertheless further analysis showed that the 0 5 mm mesh size should be chosen to provide a good representation of the corrosion field especially for the weaker correlations it is essential to mention that significant differences in total elongation between coarse and refined mesh reaching 40 in case of 5 mm mesh are observed which may be as a result of the complexity of the necking behaviour during necking the strain is highly non uniform within the mid cross section and the highest strain is visible in the middle in fe modelling only the strain in the middle of any particular element can be captured when the element size is relatively big the strain distribution is reasonably accurate and the middle elements show smaller strain with comparison to the accurate one thus the failure criteria are defined with a higher mean elongation and the total elongation is higher when compared to an accurate one with the mesh refinement the total elongation tends to an accurate value the experimental results of wang et al 2017 are used as a validation case and the stress strain curve from this study is taken as a basic one in the present study the material properties of mild steel s235 are as follows yield stress r e 292 6 m p a young modulus e 207 g p a ultimate tensile stress r u 435 m p a and total elongation δ 35 2 the output engineering stress strain curve and input curve for the fe analysis with a comparison to experimental one are presented in fig 4 both numerical and experimental curves are almost identical with a minimal deviation the first part of the input curve was obtained using eqns 3 and 4 up to the ultimate tensile stress point strain equal to 0 182 the calibration of the second part is done using eqn 5 and the following parameters ε f a i l u r e 0 9 k 750 m p a n 0 214 the element breaks when the defined failure strain is obtained the proper modelling of the tensile behaviour in the fe analyses may be seen in fig 5 where the necking phenomenon is visible 4 corrosion modelling in the present study the two side corrosion degradation is analysed and the corrosion descriptors are presented in fig 7 one can distinguish the initial thickness of the specimen as t 0 and the maximum residual thickness after corrosion degradation as t m a x based on that the uniform degree of degradation is derived as 6 d o d u t i n i t m a x t i n i at any particular point of the corroded specimen one can distinguish the corrosion depth in the upper surface h u and in bottom surface h b similarly there is a mean and maximum corrosion depth in both surfaces h u and h b as well as δ h u and δ h b respectively the minimum residual thickness is calculated as 7 t m i n t m a x δ h u δ h b by calculating the total volume of the corroded specimen v c o r r o d e d the non uniform corrosion degradation level can be calculated as 8 d o d n t m a x a v c o r r o d e d t 0 a the total degradation level is equal to 9 d o d d o d u d o d n the cross sectional areas a i see fig 6 are calculated along with the specimen and the minimum cross sectional area a m i n is obtained to generate the random field of corroded plate surfaces the maximum and mean corrosion depth is needed together with correlation length for any particular mesh density the random field is generated and then transformed into an fe model see fig 6 the reference thickness for the mechanical properties calculations may be different e g the average thickness maximum thickness average thickness of the minimum cross sectional area cegla and gajdacsi 2016 shown that during the ultrasonic measurements of corroded plates most common method during ship inspections the values are usually higher than the average thickness and there are subjected to high uncertainties based on that in the present study the maximum residual thickness of corroded plates t m a x was chosen as a reference one 5 sensitivity analysis different parameters related to the geometry of the specimen and random field can influence the results of the current analysis thus the sensitivity analysis is conducted the analysed parameters of the specimen and random field are presented in table 1 the ratio between maximum corrosion depth and mean corrosion depth is assumed here equal to 3 the value was assumed based on the observations of wang et al 2017 and thus these two variables are changed at the same time considered as one factor the correlation length cannot be less than 0 5 mm due to the specified element size in the case of upper value with correlation length above 2 5 mm the number of pits is very low which is not observed in reality the number of corroded surfaces is one or two which is the one side or two side corroded respectively to keep the same minimum and maximum thickness the corrosion degradation depth of the one side corroded plate is two times the corrosion depth of one of the surfaces in a two side corroded plate additionally the number of realisations of the corrosion field is studied to show the difference in the results between one sample and the average value from several samples the one factor at the time ofat methodology daniel 1973 is used to perform the sensitivity analysis only one factor is changed whereas the rest of the variables are equal to the initial values as presented in table 1 this methodology with comparison to advanced techniques of design of experiments wu and hamada 2009 provides information about essential variables in a simple way which is the main objective of the current analysis nevertheless the multi factorial analysis may be performed in further studies fig 8 shows the influence of the maximum thickness into the mechanical properties it could be noticed that with the increase of the maximum thickness where the other corrosion descriptors remain unchanged the mechanical properties are growing this phenomenon is caused by the ratio between minimal and maximum thickness in the case of thin specimens this ratio is much lower for 3 mm plate it is 0 333 where for 8 mm plate it is 0 75 due to that any identical corrosion fields will have a more significant influence in the stress distribution in the thin specimens compared to the thick specimens the reduction in the yield stress ranges from 10 in case of an 8 mm specimen up to 40 in the case of a 3 mm thickness in the case of the young modulus and ultimate stress the reductions are between 9 and 33 the most sensitive parameter is the total elongation which is reduced between 9 up to 78 the fitting curves in all cases are of the 2nd order polynomial functions and there are shown together with the pearson correlation factor it can be noticed that the correlation factors are very high and thus these curves can model the reduction of the mechanical properties in the range of thicknesses and the assumed values of the mean and maximum corrosion depths fig 9 shows the influence of the maximum corrosion depth as well as the mean corrosion depth in the mechanical properties of corroded specimens it can be noticed that when the maximum corrosion depth is growing all mechanical properties are decreasing this is caused by the mean thickness reduction as well as the increase of the stress concentration factors in the pit regions the reduction of the yield stress varieties between 4 up to 29 and ultimate stress is reduced between 3 and 26 similarly to the initial thickness the most sensitive variable is the total elongation which is decreased compared to its initial value between 4 up to 45 the less sensitive is the modulus of elasticity which is reduced between 2 up to 22 all parameters may be modelled with the use of the linear approximation with the high correlation factor it could be observed that the values of these functions for h m a x 0 are the values that should be equal to the initial mechanical properties however small deviations are observed in the case of different corrosion types one side or two side the results are presented in table 2 one can observe that there are some changes in the mechanical properties in the case of surface 1 the results are very similar to those obtained for two side corrosion in the case of the young modulus and total elongation the values are even slightly higher however in the case of surface 2 the values of the yield stress and ultimate stresses are 3 and 2 lower from two side corrosion values respectively the young modulus and total elongation are smaller of 4 5 and 25 respectively additionally the mean value from the two one side corroded specimens was calculated and the mechanical properties are lower from that obtained in the case of two side corrosion degradation although the same corroded surfaces were applied probably the reduction is caused by higher stress concentration factors when compared with two side corrosion both factors the initial thickness and corrosion depth are investigated based on the corrosion degradation modelled with the same shape of random fields in both surfaces of corroded specimens different between the surfaces however in the case of the correlation length and corrosion type the results can deviate due to the different realisations of the specific random field thus the influence of the number of random field realisations is investigated the mechanical properties are calculated for the initial conditions with nine different realisations of the random field with the same characteristics correlation length and mesh density the deviations from the mean value for each realisation are presented in fig 10 the analysis shows that both yield and ultimate stresses are almost independent of the realisation number the differences between the maximum and minimum values of these two variables are about 1 concerning the mean value in the case of the young modulus the deviations are in the order of 4 which is more significant the biggest differences are in the case of the total elongation which is reaching 20 between the maximum and minimum value additionally the correlation matrix has been developed showing the correlation between variables the strong correlation has been found between the yield stress and ultimate tensile stress 0 84 the moderate correlation was found between the yield stress and total elongation and between the ultimate tensile stress and total elongation with values of 0 35 and 0 58 respectively in the case of the young modulus the correlation with other variables was not noted due to the high level of the variation in the case of the total elongation and young modulus additional convergence studies based on the previous results are performed the reason for convergence studies is to see how many samples are needed to produce a confident mean value that is close to the mean value from a significant amount of samples in other words how many samples are needed to produce the representative mean values the results of these studies are shown in fig 11 the differences from n samples are calculated as follows x is the selected variable and x is the mean value from 9 samples 10 d n i 1 n x i n x 1 100 the analysis shows that in the case of the yield stress and ultimate stress even one sample will be representative and two samples and more will produce minimal deviations in the case of the young modulus the mean from five samples will be quite representative and will result in a difference below 0 5 from the mean of multiple samples additionally in the case of these three variables the deviations are converging in the case of the total elongation no specific convergence could be distinguished even mean from 8 samples differ with about 1 3 with regards to the mean from 9 samples in this case more samples will be needed to achieve convergence however concerning the difference between the minimum and maximum value the 2 deviation level seems to be quite representative this level of deviation may be noticed above the mean from 5 samples additional discussion about the sensitivity of the total elongation is discussed below based on this study one can choose the mean from a couple of samples the most critical case or representative case to simulate the corrosion field in further studies the representative realisation for a specific correlation length will be chosen the representative field is the one that results in mechanical properties closest to mean from multiple samples this approach will lead to less computational effort it could be noticed that the total elongation is subjected to high uncertainties probably the total elongation is dependent on specific corrosion field which could be seen in different failure schemes fig 12 for specimens with the same field descriptors the failure modes for nine realisations are presented generally the reduction of the total elongation is related to premature breaking due to the stress concentration in the region of the pit which may be visible in the strain distribution of the corroded specimen it can also be noticed that the breaking line is not perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the specimen breaking may also not be located in the middle length of the specimen and it seems to be dependent on the location of the minimum cross sectional area the hypothesis that the breaking line is correlated with the minimum cross sectional area is verified the positions of the minimum cross sections together with actual breaking positions are presented in fig 15 if the first position of the minimum cross sectional area is not coherent with the breaking position the second smallest one is found it can be noticed that the positions of the minimum cross sectional area are the same as the position of the breaking region thus it can be concluded that the breaking will occur in the region of the minimum cross sectional area of one of two minimum cross sectional areas in the case of three realisations in the case of specimens where the second smallest cross sectional area broke the stress concentration about pit regions could be the reason for that fig 13 shows the impact of the correlation length of the random field into the mechanical properties for each correlation length the representative fields for upper and lower corroded surfaces were chosen as described previously the correlation length has almost no influence in both yield stress and ultimate stress the differences between maximum and minimum value are in the order of 2 the minimal impact can be visible in the case of the young modulus difference of 7 between maximum and minimum value however it is hard to find any correlation with correlation length which is represented by a small pearson factor it could be concluded that the deviations are stochastically originated the only significant effect that can be noticed is concerning the total elongation in this case with the increase of the correlation length the total elongation is reduced similarly to other factors the total elongation is the most sensitive variable based on the sensitivity analysis one can conclude that the maximum thickness and mean corrosion depth are the most sensitive parameters that govern the reduction of mechanical properties almost no influence is visible in the case of the correlation length and type of corrosion one side or two side the only variable that shows some sensitivity concerning the correlation length is the total elongation however the studies revealed that the total elongation is the most sensitive concerning all parameters and it is subjected to high uncertainties which was shown in the random field convergence studies the young modulus is also subjected to some uncertainty most certain parameters are the yield stress together with ultimate tensile stress in order to see the influence of different factors acting simultaneously the multi factorial analysis needs to be conducted 6 finite element analysis of corroded specimens for evaluation of newly developed methodology a numerical analysis of the corroded specimens is performed and validated with the experimental analysis as presented in wang et al 2017 the specimens were taken from the steel truss made from h beam elements which was exposed to natural environmental conditions the nine specimens were taken and analysed from horizontal h sloping s and vertical v members one specimen was cut from the top flange tf one from the bottom flange bf and one from the web w for each type of member the basic parameters of the random fields are equivalent to those measured experimentally i e maximum and mean corrosion depths of both surfaces the dimensions of the specimens and maximum thicknesses of the specimens are satisfied as well the material properties are calibrated to obtain the experimental stress strain curve in the intact conditions as presented in section 3 the main dimensions and descriptors of the corrosion fields are presented in table 3 all parameters are precisely identical in numerical simulations the only parameter that is related to correlation length is the number of corrosion pits per square centimetre since the correlation length has not such a significant influence in mechanical properties two different correlation lengths are chosen to simulate the corroded surfaces and made the analysis more simple the correlation length equals to 1 mm was chosen to model the surfaces with a denser pitting distribution above 10 whereas correlation length of 1 5 mm was chosen to model the surfaces with a lower number of pits per square centimetre below 10 the comparison of the experimentally measured and simulated surfaces is presented in fig 14 and one can see that there are quite similar between each other the comparison between surfaces in the experiment and numerical predictions is presented in table 4 based on the sensitivity analysis one can notice that at least a couple of samples will need to produce proper results however to avoid multiple calculations two representative fields for each correlation length were chosen to produce results close to the mean from a couple of samples one can notice small deviations in the minimum cross sectional area between numerical and experimental predictions there are originated from the differences between the real corrosion fields and randomly generated ones when maximum corrosion depth together with the mean corrosion depth is satisfied the minimum cross sectional area is the resulting value the results of the numerical analysis using the random field approach compared to experimental tests are presented in table 5 the lowest deviations between experimental and numerical results are in the case of the ultimate stress where the mean error is 1 in the case of the young modulus and yield stress the mean error is about 2 the most significant mean error is for the total elongation which is equal to 7 however only for severely corroded specimens hw and sw the error is 20 for the rest of the specimens the error of total elongation does not exceed 6 one can notice that except the total elongation which is a very sensitive parameter the deviations are not significant they are much smaller concerning the deviations between experimental tests and results from different mathematical models that were presented in wang et al 2017 which were in the order of 16 in case of the yield strength nevertheless the deviations are in the same order with deviations between experimental and numerical results obtained in wang et al 2017 where the fe analysis was performed and the corrosion fields were identical with those measured experimentally additionally the results of the proposed methodology are the results of a single random field realisation which is close to the mean value from a couple of samples however the sample that produces maximum or minimum mechanical properties can be possibly more representative and closer to the real specimen in the case of an experiment it is hard to produce two samples with the same corrosion field descriptors maximum corrosion depth and mean corrosion depth the deviations between the numerical and experimental results may originate not only from the corrosion modelling differences but also from the material properties deviations in the experimental domain as well as uncertainty measurement the results of tensile tests for intact specimens li and pasternak 2019 show that coefficient of variation in the case of the yield strength is 5 and in the case of the ultimate stress is 1 5 in this point of view the deviations between the numerical and experimental results are similar to these values due to that the results are additionally compared with the numerical simulations of wang et al 2017 where the same specimens with corrosion surfaces transmitted to the fe model were analysed in this case the input material properties are always the same the results of the comparison are presented in table 6 it can be noticed that the error is smaller concerning the comparison between the experimental predictions and random approach especially in the case of the total elongation the maximum deviation is significantly reduced the deviations shown in table 5 are in the same order as the deviations between the exact fe model and experiment additionally the deviations between the random field modelling and accurate fe modelling are in the order of the differences resulting from a couple of generations of the specific random field one can notice that single analysed specimen can be represented by the randomly modelled one with either the maximum mechanical properties or minimum between a couple of simulations from that point of view stochastic modelling provides accurate results concerning the mechanical properties of the corroded specimens additionally some specific fe modelling differences may impact the differences in the results the comparison between experimental and numerical results as presented in wang et al 2017 with comparison to the presented methodology is shown in figs 15 18 the yield stress presented as a function of dod is shown in fig 15 one can notice that both curves showing numerical predictions are very close to each other and there are modelled with the use of a linear approximation with highly correlated factors in the case of the experimental curve the best fitting curve is the polynomial one and it deviates from the numerical predictions in the low values of dod however the curves should tend to the initial value of the yield stress for dod equals to 0 which could be observed for numerical curves thus the possible deviations of the experimental curve may originate from the variability of the initial mechanical properties mainly it could be noticed that two points for dod close to 19 differ significantly in the experimental results in the case of numerical predictions the two points are close to each other fig 16 shows the ultimate stress as a function of dod in this case all regression curves are linear with high correlation factors it may be observed that all curves are very close to each other however the experimental curve shows slightly higher values compared to other ones all curves tend to the value which is very close to the initial ultimate stress when dod equals to 0 the young modulus presented as a function of dod is presented in fig 17 similarly to the ultimate stress the best regression curves are linear in the case of the numerical predictions the coefficients of determination are high whereas the coefficient of determination in the case of the experimental curve is quite low 0 52 the possible reason for that is the measuring uncertainty which is related to the extensometer usage in the testing procedure the deviations between the two numerical approaches may result from different parallel lengths which were taken to measure the elongation in the first part of the stress strain curve additionally the curves are crossing the vertical axis for dod equals to 0 with values close to the initial young modulus fig 18 shows the total elongation in the function of dod in this case the polynomial fitting curves are used to model the change of the total elongation concerning the dod in all cases the correlation factors are very high similarly to other mechanical properties all three curves are quite similar however the methodology which is used in this study slightly overestimates the total elongation in the higher values of dod it may be explained with the representative random field that was chosen to model the corrosion fields when the most critical random field is chosen the values could be much closer to those obtained experimentally for dod equals to 0 the numerical predictions using a random approach shows a value close to the initial total elongation in other cases these values are quite outstanding based on the presented results one can notice that the fe analysis of the corroded specimens with randomly generated corrosion fields is very close to the experiment additionally the fe analysis with randomly generated corrosion degradation is almost identical to the fe analysis with real corrosion fields the comparison between the experimental stress strain curves and numerically obtained ones with the use of the current methodology is presented in fig 19 as it can be noticed for all specimens the curves are very similar to each other this leads to the conclusion that not only mechanical properties are similar but the general stress strain response match as well 7 conclusions the methodology presented in this work revealed to be practical for the evaluation of the mechanical properties of corroded steel specimens the random field modelling may provide the morphology of the corroded surface very similar to the real one compared to very thin plates even for higher values of degree of degradation the results are comparable to the experimental ones this leads to the conclusion that the irregularities in the corroded surfaces are the factor that predominantly governs the mechanical properties reduction the random field modelling has another advantage using random field techniques one can generate many samples which is challenging in other cases due to the long duration of the corrosion process as well as a very functional analysis of the corrosion morphology and in this way it is economically justified nevertheless more experimental work should be done to validate furtherly of the proposed methodology possibly the changes in the mechanical properties may vary depending on corrosion type and other factors marine atmospheric etc the corrosion degradation with the same average and maximum depth value will cause a much higher reduction of the mechanical properties in the thinner plates compared to thicker plates additionally the reduction seems to be higher in the thinner plates for similar dod compared to the thicker plates the following conclusions may be derived when the presented results are compared with the investigations related to very thin specimens woloszyk and garbatov 2020 based on the sensitivity analysis it can be observed that the mechanical properties changes due to corrosion process are susceptible concerning the initial thickness of plates as well as the maximum and mean corrosion depth values some sensitivity concerning the type of corrosion one side or two side is visible as well in this case the one side corrosion will be the worst case the correlation length of the corrosion field revealed to be not a very sensitive parameter within the considered range however the total elongation was slightly reduced for the higher values of the correlation length the total elongation revealed to be subjected to a high level of uncertainties and it is the most sensitive parameter concerning the input parameters thus the higher deviations between the numerical predictions and experimental results in terms of this variable may be justified finally one needs to be aware that presented foundings are related to small scale specimens subjected to tensile loading and yielding failure the mechanical behaviour of corroded specimens with different scales and subjected to different types of loads need to be furtherly investigated the deviations between the numerical and experimental results may originate from the uncertainties in the initial mechanical properties this is additionally supported by the comparison of the numerical predictions with the use of the random approach and exact fe model of corroded specimens in this case where the input mechanical properties were identical the deviations between both models were minimal credit authorship contribution statement krzysztof

21672,the present work investigates the possibility of using random field techniques in modelling the mechanical behaviour of corroded thick steel plate specimens the nonlinear finite element method employing the explicit dynamic solver is used to analyse the mechanical properties of typical specimens a material model considering full nonlinearity is used to evaluate the stress strain response the influence of major governing parameters of both specimen dimensions and random field is investigated through the sensitivity analysis in order to validate the proposed methodology results are compared with available experimental data showing an excellent agreement in both mechanical properties and stress strain relationships additionally the conclusion is made that the irregularities in the corroded surface are the main factor resulting in the decrease of mechanical properties in this way random field modelling appeared to be a practical and fast technique for modelling the corroded surfaces of steel structures in analysing their structural behaviour keywords corrosion mechanical properties finite element method random field 1 introduction all metal structures operating in atmospheric or marine conditions are subjected to corrosion degradation garbatov et al 2006 which leads to a thickness reduction nowadays different models to evaluate the corrosion loss as a function of time exist garbatov et al 2006 melchers 2008 paik et al 2004 nevertheless it is noticed that the mechanical properties of structural elements could be reduced with the corrosion degradation progress garbatov et al 2014b the combination of these two factors can severely reduce the strength of structures garbatov et al 2014a saad eldeen et al 2012 wang et al 2014 woloszyk et al 2018 woloszyk and garbatov 2019a in recent years different studies focused on the investigation experimentally and numerically of the mechanical properties reduction of steel specimens caused by corrosion degradation the experimental analysis of corroded steel bars in natural and laboratory environment was conducted in fernandez and berrocal 2019 kashani et al 2013 zhang et al 2006 the maximum reduction in the case of yield strength was up to 30 and 80 in the case of total elongation for the most severely corroded elements the measurements of the corrosion morphology shown that the minimum cross sectional area may govern the mechanical properties reduction when analysing ship and offshore structures the plates are more often used in their construction and thus the flat specimens are used in defining the mechanical properties and with this respect many specimens of different levels of severity were analysed in garbatov et al 2014b for the specimens with corrosion severity above 20 the reduction of mechanical properties revealed to be very significant the reduction is observed in all mechanical properties i e yield stress ultimate stress young modulus and total elongation other studies related to flat specimens were done in nie et al 2019 qin et al 2016 wang et al 2017 xu et al 2019b 2019a leading to similar conclusions nevertheless even for the lower level of corrosion degradation the decrease of mechanical properties was also observed the reduction was even magnified when the specimens were pre stressed and corroded li et al 2018 li et al 2019 the majority of the studies agreed that ideally uniform corrosion degradation would not cause a significant reduction of mechanical properties in this way the decrease is mostly caused by the non uniformity of the corroded surface cairns et al 2005 du et al 2005a 2005b palsson and mirza 2002 this hypothesis is supported by garbatov et al 2018 where specimens subjected to different cleaning methods compared to only corroded ones revealed to have higher values of the mechanical properties in the case of the ship and offshore structures the most common type of corrosion is the non uniform one and the above foundlings cannot be neglected different mathematical models for predicting the mechanical properties of structural members were developed recently ahmmad and sumi 2010 appuhamy et al 2011 fernandez et al 2016 flaks 1978 moreno et al 2014 nakai et al 2004 mostly they are based on the experimental results a simplified model for corroded bars was shown in d li et al 2018 the model for corroded flat specimens was also developed in garbatov et al 2014b in the study performed by wang et al 2017 the experimental results were compared with the fe estimations and the agreement was excellent additionally they showed that the results of different mathematical models might differ significantly thus the unified approach to model the mechanical properties changes concerning corrosion needs to be developed the corrode plate surface similar to a different natural phenomenon such as waves is stochastically originated in this way the modelling with the use of the random field jankowski and walukiewicz 1997 seems to be accurate for the purpose the examples of engineering applications with the use of random field modelling may be found in górski et al 2015 górski and winkelmann 2017 teixeira and guedes soares 2008 the possibility of random techniques usage in corrosion modelling was shown in garbatov and guedes soares 2017 nevertheless the stochastic modelling provides many samples which may need a large amount of computational time but may provide a good statistical base for the reliability analysis melchers 2017 woloszyk and garbatov 2019b of the ship and offshore structures the present study is a continuation of the work done in woloszyk and garbatov 2020 in the previous study the capabilities of random field modelling of corroded specimens were explored in the case of very thin specimens 1 mm of the initial thickness the results were compared with the experimental data as presented in nie et al 2019 and the evident agreement was observed for the lower level of the degree of degradation however for severely corroded plates more significant deviations were observed nevertheless the very thin plates can be found rarely in case of the ship and offshore structures thus the present work explores the possibility of the random field modelling of corroded specimens of thicker thicknesses in the range between 6 up to 9 mm the nonlinear fe analysis performed with the use of the explicit dynamic solver is employed here the sensitivity of the governing geometrical parameters of the specimen and random field is also analysed the results are validated with experimental data provided in wang et al 2017 2 corrosion modelling using random field approach the random field which is the set of spatially correlated random variables seems to be the most suitable technique to model corroded plate surfaces in the case of numerical modelling the discretised random field needs to be used where one of those discretisation methods may be found in ghanem and spanos 1991 li and der kiureghian 1993 in the current study the karhunen loeve expansion ghanem and spanos 1991 is employed the gaussian random field is defined by its mean μ x variance σ 2 x and autocovariance function c x x the detailed explanation of random field was already presented in woloszyk and garbatov 2020 the square exponential autocovariance used in this study 1 c x x exp x x 2 c 0 2 where x x is the absolute distance between any two points in the meshed surface and c 0 is the correlation length the spatial variation of the field is mostly dependent on the correlation length with the increase of correlation length the field becomes smoother whereas with the decrease of correlation length the field became more irregular two fields with the same mean value and variance but with different correlation lengths are presented in fig 1 the matlab software mathworks 2019 with a specially developed program code constantine 2012 is used to generate the gaussian random field h x for the specified mesh and various correlation lengths however based on the measurements of corroded surfaces wang et al 2017 it can be noticed that the maximum corrosion depth is often much higher than the mean value this leads to the log normal distribution which is obtained by the transformation of the normal field 2 l x exp μ σ h x where μ and σ are the location and scale parameters of the log normal field respectively there need to be calibrated to produce a proper mean value and standard deviation of the currently developed field the random field can be generated for the assumed values of the mean value and standard deviation of the corrosion depth however in the present study the statistical descriptors are calibrated based on the experimental results wang et al 2017 to show the feasibility of the proposed methodology the considered random field is assumed to be isotropic whereas in real corrosion conditions some anisotropy is possible however for small scale specimens it could be observed that the corrosion surfaces are somewhat regular 3 finite element modelling for the simulation of the tensile test of steel specimens ansys ls dyna ansys inc 2019 software is employed the multilinear stress strain relationship of the material and solid 164 elements are used with the explicit dynamics solver apart from the quasi static origin of the tensile testing the explicit solver is used to pass the convergence problem bäker 2018 which originates from both corrosion degradation and necking phenomenon in the standards of tensile testing iso 2009 the engineering stress strain curve is established however in the fe analysis one needs to define the true stress strain σ t r u e ε t r u e relationship as 3 ε t r u e ln 1 ε 4 σ t r u e σ 1 ε where σ and ε are engineering stress and strain respectively the above formulations are valid up to the ultimate tensile strength point where the necking phenomenon starts to occur and the power law based procedure is introduced kwesi nutor 2017 5 σ t r u e k ε t r u e n where n and k are the strain hardening parameter and strength coefficient respectively fig 2 shows the specimen scheme and the fe model the area of the corroded part of the specimen has a size of 50 25 mm and thus the mesh is very dense in this region in the case of mounting and transitional parts of the specimen their finite element size is not relevant since there are mainly distributing the longitudinal load to simulate the experimental conditions the mounting parts are fixed and one of them is subjected to a longitudinal displacement the displacement is realised via small increments in the time domain in the explicit solver for identifying the proper element size the mesh convergence studies are carried out the results of the analysis with an element size a from 0 5 mm up to 5 mm are presented in fig 3 the most refined mesh provides accurate results however with the element size of 1 mm the results are also accurate nevertheless further analysis showed that the 0 5 mm mesh size should be chosen to provide a good representation of the corrosion field especially for the weaker correlations it is essential to mention that significant differences in total elongation between coarse and refined mesh reaching 40 in case of 5 mm mesh are observed which may be as a result of the complexity of the necking behaviour during necking the strain is highly non uniform within the mid cross section and the highest strain is visible in the middle in fe modelling only the strain in the middle of any particular element can be captured when the element size is relatively big the strain distribution is reasonably accurate and the middle elements show smaller strain with comparison to the accurate one thus the failure criteria are defined with a higher mean elongation and the total elongation is higher when compared to an accurate one with the mesh refinement the total elongation tends to an accurate value the experimental results of wang et al 2017 are used as a validation case and the stress strain curve from this study is taken as a basic one in the present study the material properties of mild steel s235 are as follows yield stress r e 292 6 m p a young modulus e 207 g p a ultimate tensile stress r u 435 m p a and total elongation δ 35 2 the output engineering stress strain curve and input curve for the fe analysis with a comparison to experimental one are presented in fig 4 both numerical and experimental curves are almost identical with a minimal deviation the first part of the input curve was obtained using eqns 3 and 4 up to the ultimate tensile stress point strain equal to 0 182 the calibration of the second part is done using eqn 5 and the following parameters ε f a i l u r e 0 9 k 750 m p a n 0 214 the element breaks when the defined failure strain is obtained the proper modelling of the tensile behaviour in the fe analyses may be seen in fig 5 where the necking phenomenon is visible 4 corrosion modelling in the present study the two side corrosion degradation is analysed and the corrosion descriptors are presented in fig 7 one can distinguish the initial thickness of the specimen as t 0 and the maximum residual thickness after corrosion degradation as t m a x based on that the uniform degree of degradation is derived as 6 d o d u t i n i t m a x t i n i at any particular point of the corroded specimen one can distinguish the corrosion depth in the upper surface h u and in bottom surface h b similarly there is a mean and maximum corrosion depth in both surfaces h u and h b as well as δ h u and δ h b respectively the minimum residual thickness is calculated as 7 t m i n t m a x δ h u δ h b by calculating the total volume of the corroded specimen v c o r r o d e d the non uniform corrosion degradation level can be calculated as 8 d o d n t m a x a v c o r r o d e d t 0 a the total degradation level is equal to 9 d o d d o d u d o d n the cross sectional areas a i see fig 6 are calculated along with the specimen and the minimum cross sectional area a m i n is obtained to generate the random field of corroded plate surfaces the maximum and mean corrosion depth is needed together with correlation length for any particular mesh density the random field is generated and then transformed into an fe model see fig 6 the reference thickness for the mechanical properties calculations may be different e g the average thickness maximum thickness average thickness of the minimum cross sectional area cegla and gajdacsi 2016 shown that during the ultrasonic measurements of corroded plates most common method during ship inspections the values are usually higher than the average thickness and there are subjected to high uncertainties based on that in the present study the maximum residual thickness of corroded plates t m a x was chosen as a reference one 5 sensitivity analysis different parameters related to the geometry of the specimen and random field can influence the results of the current analysis thus the sensitivity analysis is conducted the analysed parameters of the specimen and random field are presented in table 1 the ratio between maximum corrosion depth and mean corrosion depth is assumed here equal to 3 the value was assumed based on the observations of wang et al 2017 and thus these two variables are changed at the same time considered as one factor the correlation length cannot be less than 0 5 mm due to the specified element size in the case of upper value with correlation length above 2 5 mm the number of pits is very low which is not observed in reality the number of corroded surfaces is one or two which is the one side or two side corroded respectively to keep the same minimum and maximum thickness the corrosion degradation depth of the one side corroded plate is two times the corrosion depth of one of the surfaces in a two side corroded plate additionally the number of realisations of the corrosion field is studied to show the difference in the results between one sample and the average value from several samples the one factor at the time ofat methodology daniel 1973 is used to perform the sensitivity analysis only one factor is changed whereas the rest of the variables are equal to the initial values as presented in table 1 this methodology with comparison to advanced techniques of design of experiments wu and hamada 2009 provides information about essential variables in a simple way which is the main objective of the current analysis nevertheless the multi factorial analysis may be performed in further studies fig 8 shows the influence of the maximum thickness into the mechanical properties it could be noticed that with the increase of the maximum thickness where the other corrosion descriptors remain unchanged the mechanical properties are growing this phenomenon is caused by the ratio between minimal and maximum thickness in the case of thin specimens this ratio is much lower for 3 mm plate it is 0 333 where for 8 mm plate it is 0 75 due to that any identical corrosion fields will have a more significant influence in the stress distribution in the thin specimens compared to the thick specimens the reduction in the yield stress ranges from 10 in case of an 8 mm specimen up to 40 in the case of a 3 mm thickness in the case of the young modulus and ultimate stress the reductions are between 9 and 33 the most sensitive parameter is the total elongation which is reduced between 9 up to 78 the fitting curves in all cases are of the 2nd order polynomial functions and there are shown together with the pearson correlation factor it can be noticed that the correlation factors are very high and thus these curves can model the reduction of the mechanical properties in the range of thicknesses and the assumed values of the mean and maximum corrosion depths fig 9 shows the influence of the maximum corrosion depth as well as the mean corrosion depth in the mechanical properties of corroded specimens it can be noticed that when the maximum corrosion depth is growing all mechanical properties are decreasing this is caused by the mean thickness reduction as well as the increase of the stress concentration factors in the pit regions the reduction of the yield stress varieties between 4 up to 29 and ultimate stress is reduced between 3 and 26 similarly to the initial thickness the most sensitive variable is the total elongation which is decreased compared to its initial value between 4 up to 45 the less sensitive is the modulus of elasticity which is reduced between 2 up to 22 all parameters may be modelled with the use of the linear approximation with the high correlation factor it could be observed that the values of these functions for h m a x 0 are the values that should be equal to the initial mechanical properties however small deviations are observed in the case of different corrosion types one side or two side the results are presented in table 2 one can observe that there are some changes in the mechanical properties in the case of surface 1 the results are very similar to those obtained for two side corrosion in the case of the young modulus and total elongation the values are even slightly higher however in the case of surface 2 the values of the yield stress and ultimate stresses are 3 and 2 lower from two side corrosion values respectively the young modulus and total elongation are smaller of 4 5 and 25 respectively additionally the mean value from the two one side corroded specimens was calculated and the mechanical properties are lower from that obtained in the case of two side corrosion degradation although the same corroded surfaces were applied probably the reduction is caused by higher stress concentration factors when compared with two side corrosion both factors the initial thickness and corrosion depth are investigated based on the corrosion degradation modelled with the same shape of random fields in both surfaces of corroded specimens different between the surfaces however in the case of the correlation length and corrosion type the results can deviate due to the different realisations of the specific random field thus the influence of the number of random field realisations is investigated the mechanical properties are calculated for the initial conditions with nine different realisations of the random field with the same characteristics correlation length and mesh density the deviations from the mean value for each realisation are presented in fig 10 the analysis shows that both yield and ultimate stresses are almost independent of the realisation number the differences between the maximum and minimum values of these two variables are about 1 concerning the mean value in the case of the young modulus the deviations are in the order of 4 which is more significant the biggest differences are in the case of the total elongation which is reaching 20 between the maximum and minimum value additionally the correlation matrix has been developed showing the correlation between variables the strong correlation has been found between the yield stress and ultimate tensile stress 0 84 the moderate correlation was found between the yield stress and total elongation and between the ultimate tensile stress and total elongation with values of 0 35 and 0 58 respectively in the case of the young modulus the correlation with other variables was not noted due to the high level of the variation in the case of the total elongation and young modulus additional convergence studies based on the previous results are performed the reason for convergence studies is to see how many samples are needed to produce a confident mean value that is close to the mean value from a significant amount of samples in other words how many samples are needed to produce the representative mean values the results of these studies are shown in fig 11 the differences from n samples are calculated as follows x is the selected variable and x is the mean value from 9 samples 10 d n i 1 n x i n x 1 100 the analysis shows that in the case of the yield stress and ultimate stress even one sample will be representative and two samples and more will produce minimal deviations in the case of the young modulus the mean from five samples will be quite representative and will result in a difference below 0 5 from the mean of multiple samples additionally in the case of these three variables the deviations are converging in the case of the total elongation no specific convergence could be distinguished even mean from 8 samples differ with about 1 3 with regards to the mean from 9 samples in this case more samples will be needed to achieve convergence however concerning the difference between the minimum and maximum value the 2 deviation level seems to be quite representative this level of deviation may be noticed above the mean from 5 samples additional discussion about the sensitivity of the total elongation is discussed below based on this study one can choose the mean from a couple of samples the most critical case or representative case to simulate the corrosion field in further studies the representative realisation for a specific correlation length will be chosen the representative field is the one that results in mechanical properties closest to mean from multiple samples this approach will lead to less computational effort it could be noticed that the total elongation is subjected to high uncertainties probably the total elongation is dependent on specific corrosion field which could be seen in different failure schemes fig 12 for specimens with the same field descriptors the failure modes for nine realisations are presented generally the reduction of the total elongation is related to premature breaking due to the stress concentration in the region of the pit which may be visible in the strain distribution of the corroded specimen it can also be noticed that the breaking line is not perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the specimen breaking may also not be located in the middle length of the specimen and it seems to be dependent on the location of the minimum cross sectional area the hypothesis that the breaking line is correlated with the minimum cross sectional area is verified the positions of the minimum cross sections together with actual breaking positions are presented in fig 15 if the first position of the minimum cross sectional area is not coherent with the breaking position the second smallest one is found it can be noticed that the positions of the minimum cross sectional area are the same as the position of the breaking region thus it can be concluded that the breaking will occur in the region of the minimum cross sectional area of one of two minimum cross sectional areas in the case of three realisations in the case of specimens where the second smallest cross sectional area broke the stress concentration about pit regions could be the reason for that fig 13 shows the impact of the correlation length of the random field into the mechanical properties for each correlation length the representative fields for upper and lower corroded surfaces were chosen as described previously the correlation length has almost no influence in both yield stress and ultimate stress the differences between maximum and minimum value are in the order of 2 the minimal impact can be visible in the case of the young modulus difference of 7 between maximum and minimum value however it is hard to find any correlation with correlation length which is represented by a small pearson factor it could be concluded that the deviations are stochastically originated the only significant effect that can be noticed is concerning the total elongation in this case with the increase of the correlation length the total elongation is reduced similarly to other factors the total elongation is the most sensitive variable based on the sensitivity analysis one can conclude that the maximum thickness and mean corrosion depth are the most sensitive parameters that govern the reduction of mechanical properties almost no influence is visible in the case of the correlation length and type of corrosion one side or two side the only variable that shows some sensitivity concerning the correlation length is the total elongation however the studies revealed that the total elongation is the most sensitive concerning all parameters and it is subjected to high uncertainties which was shown in the random field convergence studies the young modulus is also subjected to some uncertainty most certain parameters are the yield stress together with ultimate tensile stress in order to see the influence of different factors acting simultaneously the multi factorial analysis needs to be conducted 6 finite element analysis of corroded specimens for evaluation of newly developed methodology a numerical analysis of the corroded specimens is performed and validated with the experimental analysis as presented in wang et al 2017 the specimens were taken from the steel truss made from h beam elements which was exposed to natural environmental conditions the nine specimens were taken and analysed from horizontal h sloping s and vertical v members one specimen was cut from the top flange tf one from the bottom flange bf and one from the web w for each type of member the basic parameters of the random fields are equivalent to those measured experimentally i e maximum and mean corrosion depths of both surfaces the dimensions of the specimens and maximum thicknesses of the specimens are satisfied as well the material properties are calibrated to obtain the experimental stress strain curve in the intact conditions as presented in section 3 the main dimensions and descriptors of the corrosion fields are presented in table 3 all parameters are precisely identical in numerical simulations the only parameter that is related to correlation length is the number of corrosion pits per square centimetre since the correlation length has not such a significant influence in mechanical properties two different correlation lengths are chosen to simulate the corroded surfaces and made the analysis more simple the correlation length equals to 1 mm was chosen to model the surfaces with a denser pitting distribution above 10 whereas correlation length of 1 5 mm was chosen to model the surfaces with a lower number of pits per square centimetre below 10 the comparison of the experimentally measured and simulated surfaces is presented in fig 14 and one can see that there are quite similar between each other the comparison between surfaces in the experiment and numerical predictions is presented in table 4 based on the sensitivity analysis one can notice that at least a couple of samples will need to produce proper results however to avoid multiple calculations two representative fields for each correlation length were chosen to produce results close to the mean from a couple of samples one can notice small deviations in the minimum cross sectional area between numerical and experimental predictions there are originated from the differences between the real corrosion fields and randomly generated ones when maximum corrosion depth together with the mean corrosion depth is satisfied the minimum cross sectional area is the resulting value the results of the numerical analysis using the random field approach compared to experimental tests are presented in table 5 the lowest deviations between experimental and numerical results are in the case of the ultimate stress where the mean error is 1 in the case of the young modulus and yield stress the mean error is about 2 the most significant mean error is for the total elongation which is equal to 7 however only for severely corroded specimens hw and sw the error is 20 for the rest of the specimens the error of total elongation does not exceed 6 one can notice that except the total elongation which is a very sensitive parameter the deviations are not significant they are much smaller concerning the deviations between experimental tests and results from different mathematical models that were presented in wang et al 2017 which were in the order of 16 in case of the yield strength nevertheless the deviations are in the same order with deviations between experimental and numerical results obtained in wang et al 2017 where the fe analysis was performed and the corrosion fields were identical with those measured experimentally additionally the results of the proposed methodology are the results of a single random field realisation which is close to the mean value from a couple of samples however the sample that produces maximum or minimum mechanical properties can be possibly more representative and closer to the real specimen in the case of an experiment it is hard to produce two samples with the same corrosion field descriptors maximum corrosion depth and mean corrosion depth the deviations between the numerical and experimental results may originate not only from the corrosion modelling differences but also from the material properties deviations in the experimental domain as well as uncertainty measurement the results of tensile tests for intact specimens li and pasternak 2019 show that coefficient of variation in the case of the yield strength is 5 and in the case of the ultimate stress is 1 5 in this point of view the deviations between the numerical and experimental results are similar to these values due to that the results are additionally compared with the numerical simulations of wang et al 2017 where the same specimens with corrosion surfaces transmitted to the fe model were analysed in this case the input material properties are always the same the results of the comparison are presented in table 6 it can be noticed that the error is smaller concerning the comparison between the experimental predictions and random approach especially in the case of the total elongation the maximum deviation is significantly reduced the deviations shown in table 5 are in the same order as the deviations between the exact fe model and experiment additionally the deviations between the random field modelling and accurate fe modelling are in the order of the differences resulting from a couple of generations of the specific random field one can notice that single analysed specimen can be represented by the randomly modelled one with either the maximum mechanical properties or minimum between a couple of simulations from that point of view stochastic modelling provides accurate results concerning the mechanical properties of the corroded specimens additionally some specific fe modelling differences may impact the differences in the results the comparison between experimental and numerical results as presented in wang et al 2017 with comparison to the presented methodology is shown in figs 15 18 the yield stress presented as a function of dod is shown in fig 15 one can notice that both curves showing numerical predictions are very close to each other and there are modelled with the use of a linear approximation with highly correlated factors in the case of the experimental curve the best fitting curve is the polynomial one and it deviates from the numerical predictions in the low values of dod however the curves should tend to the initial value of the yield stress for dod equals to 0 which could be observed for numerical curves thus the possible deviations of the experimental curve may originate from the variability of the initial mechanical properties mainly it could be noticed that two points for dod close to 19 differ significantly in the experimental results in the case of numerical predictions the two points are close to each other fig 16 shows the ultimate stress as a function of dod in this case all regression curves are linear with high correlation factors it may be observed that all curves are very close to each other however the experimental curve shows slightly higher values compared to other ones all curves tend to the value which is very close to the initial ultimate stress when dod equals to 0 the young modulus presented as a function of dod is presented in fig 17 similarly to the ultimate stress the best regression curves are linear in the case of the numerical predictions the coefficients of determination are high whereas the coefficient of determination in the case of the experimental curve is quite low 0 52 the possible reason for that is the measuring uncertainty which is related to the extensometer usage in the testing procedure the deviations between the two numerical approaches may result from different parallel lengths which were taken to measure the elongation in the first part of the stress strain curve additionally the curves are crossing the vertical axis for dod equals to 0 with values close to the initial young modulus fig 18 shows the total elongation in the function of dod in this case the polynomial fitting curves are used to model the change of the total elongation concerning the dod in all cases the correlation factors are very high similarly to other mechanical properties all three curves are quite similar however the methodology which is used in this study slightly overestimates the total elongation in the higher values of dod it may be explained with the representative random field that was chosen to model the corrosion fields when the most critical random field is chosen the values could be much closer to those obtained experimentally for dod equals to 0 the numerical predictions using a random approach shows a value close to the initial total elongation in other cases these values are quite outstanding based on the presented results one can notice that the fe analysis of the corroded specimens with randomly generated corrosion fields is very close to the experiment additionally the fe analysis with randomly generated corrosion degradation is almost identical to the fe analysis with real corrosion fields the comparison between the experimental stress strain curves and numerically obtained ones with the use of the current methodology is presented in fig 19 as it can be noticed for all specimens the curves are very similar to each other this leads to the conclusion that not only mechanical properties are similar but the general stress strain response match as well 7 conclusions the methodology presented in this work revealed to be practical for the evaluation of the mechanical properties of corroded steel specimens the random field modelling may provide the morphology of the corroded surface very similar to the real one compared to very thin plates even for higher values of degree of degradation the results are comparable to the experimental ones this leads to the conclusion that the irregularities in the corroded surfaces are the factor that predominantly governs the mechanical properties reduction the random field modelling has another advantage using random field techniques one can generate many samples which is challenging in other cases due to the long duration of the corrosion process as well as a very functional analysis of the corrosion morphology and in this way it is economically justified nevertheless more experimental work should be done to validate furtherly of the proposed methodology possibly the changes in the mechanical properties may vary depending on corrosion type and other factors marine atmospheric etc the corrosion degradation with the same average and maximum depth value will cause a much higher reduction of the mechanical properties in the thinner plates compared to thicker plates additionally the reduction seems to be higher in the thinner plates for similar dod compared to the thicker plates the following conclusions may be derived when the presented results are compared with the investigations related to very thin specimens woloszyk and garbatov 2020 based on the sensitivity analysis it can be observed that the mechanical properties changes due to corrosion process are susceptible concerning the initial thickness of plates as well as the maximum and mean corrosion depth values some sensitivity concerning the type of corrosion one side or two side is visible as well in this case the one side corrosion will be the worst case the correlation length of the corrosion field revealed to be not a very sensitive parameter within the considered range however the total elongation was slightly reduced for the higher values of the correlation length the total elongation revealed to be subjected to a high level of uncertainties and it is the most sensitive parameter concerning the input parameters thus the higher deviations between the numerical predictions and experimental results in terms of this variable may be justified finally one needs to be aware that presented foundings are related to small scale specimens subjected to tensile loading and yielding failure the mechanical behaviour of corroded specimens with different scales and subjected to different types of loads need to be furtherly investigated the deviations between the numerical and experimental results may originate from the uncertainties in the initial mechanical properties this is additionally supported by the comparison of the numerical predictions with the use of the random approach and exact fe model of corroded specimens in this case where the input mechanical properties were identical the deviations between both models were minimal credit authorship contribution statement krzysztof

21673,most studies of wave breaking on slopes to date have investigated regular waves or normal incident unidirectional waves in this study wave breakings of normal and oblique incident irregular waves and multidirectional irregular waves on a 1 15 slope were investigated the breaking criteria of irregular waves based on significant wave height and individual wave height were determined firstly breaker indexes calculated using significant wave heights at incipient breaking were analyzed they were substantially lower than the breaker indexes of regular waves the breaker index formulae of irregular waves are presented based on the referred formula of regular waves furthermore the breaker indexes of oblique incident waves were larger than the breaker indexes of normal incident waves however wave directionality had little effect on breaker indexes under the present experimental conditions secondly the breaker index the ratio of significant wave height to water depth in surf zone was analyzed it increased with a decrease in relative water depth thirdly information of individual waves in irregular wave trains was tracked by the wave by wave method the breaker indexes derived by individual wave heights were larger than the incipient breaker indexes derived from significant wave heights based on previous empirical formulae some relatively simple expressions are proposed to calculate individual breaking wave heights for unidirectional irregular waves keywords slope bathymetry oblique irregular wave multidirectional wave individual wave wave by wave method breaker index 1 introduction wave breaking is an important phenomenon in near shore wave propagation as discussed previously van rijn et al 2013 lim et al 2015 lentz et al 2016 van der a et al 2017 serio and mossa 2019 breaking waves usually exert a large force on maritime structures and induce near shore currents that cause sediment transport and beach deformation many breaking criteria have been proposed to calculate breaking wave height but there are often differences among them mccowan 1894 suggested that the limiting wave height of a solitary wave was 0 78 times the water depth in the empirical formula of goda 1970 the influence of wave period or wavelength was considered in addition to breaking water depth and effective beach slope additionally following the expression of goda 1970 researchers have proposed modified breaking criteria by analyzing experimental and field data seyama and kimura 1988 muttray and oumeraci 2000 rattanapitikon and shibyama 2000 goda 2010 among these some researchers considered that the breaking wave height was related to a given deep water wave condition munk 1949 described the relationship between breaking wave height and deep water wave steepness based on an evaluation of breaking wave energy using the theoretical solitary wave equation according to airy wave theory komar and gaughan 1972 modified the factor in munk s formula using the available laboratory and field data furthermore the steepness of breaking waves could constitute a geometric characteristic parameter for wave breaking miche 1944 proposed breaking criterion in terms of breaking wave steepness ostendorf and madsen 1979 modified the formula of miche 1944 by incorporating beach slope however all the aforementioned studies were based on wave breaking of regular waves furthermore kamphuis 1991 li et al 2000 and goda 2010 extended the empirical formula of goda 1970 to irregular waves and indicated that the corresponding coefficients for irregular waves should be reduced compared with regular waves in summary present research on the breaker indexes of regular waves is relatively comprehensive and the breaking criteria of regular waves is commonly used however waves in nature are typically irregular and research on the breaker indexes of irregular waves is insufficient especially regarding oblique incident irregular waves and multidirectional irregular waves in addition breaking positions wave heights and wave periods of individual waves in irregular wave trains differ the breaker index of irregular waves using individual wave heights should be different from that of irregular waves using significant wave heights therefore the breaker indexes of individual normal incident irregular waves require investigation the aim of the present study was to determine the breaking characteristics of normal and oblique incident unidirectional irregular waves and multidirectional waves on slopes firstly the breaker indexes of irregular waves using the significant wave height at incipient breaking were studied the applicability of the breaking criteria of regular waves to unidirectional and multidirectional irregular waves was analyzed and modified formulae were proposed secondly the breaker index the ratio of significant wave height to water depth in the surf zone was analyzed furthermore a comparison of the breaker index between unidirectional irregular waves with different incident directions and multidirectional waves was performed thirdly the wave parameters of individual waves on a slope were tracked by the wave by wave method the breaker indexes of individual waves in irregular wave trains were analyzed and compared with previous breaking criteria of regular waves the breaker indexes of individual waves were then also compared with the incipient breaker indexes represented by the significant wave height and the breaking formulae of individual normal incident irregular waves were determined 2 experimental setup 2 1 wave basin and experimental arrangement the experiment was conducted in the wave basin at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology china the wave basin is 40 0m long and 24 0m wide with a maximum water depth of 0 70m the wave basin is equipped with a self developed motor driven multidirectional wave maker which is effective at generating oblique and multidirectional waves the wave maker systems consist of 70 segments and each segment is 1 00m high and 0 34m wide wave absorbing systems are installed at the other three sides to avoid the influence of wave reflection fig 1 presents a schematic view of the experimental setup a photograph of which is shown in fig 2 to create a gradient in the experiment a smooth impermeable terrain was constructed the seaward slope of the terrain was 1 15 and the height of the topography was 0 40m the water depth before the slope was 0 40m equal to the top of the slope to ensure that all wave breaking occurred on the slope regarding the topography the parallel lines of topographic contours were marked with different colors to observe the wave breaking process and wave breaking position by video the wave surface elevations were recorded by 26 capacitance wave gauges which are shown as filled circles in fig 1 under steady state condition after the wave conditions in the wave basin had reached an equilibrium condition zl is a pentagonal array with five wave gauges which was used to measure the multidirectional waves the measured wave at gauge 1 was regarded as the initial incident wave the wave gauges on the slope were densely arranged to distinguish and determine the breaking wave height in the following discussion x 0 m is defined as the mean position of wave gauge 1 2 2 wave conditions the frequency spectrum s f used in this experiment was that of the jonswap spectrum as modified by goda 1999 1 s f β j h s 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ exp t p f 1 2 2 σ 2 where β j 0 06238 0 230 0 03368 γ 0 185 γ 1 9 1 1 094 0 01915 ln γ t p t s 1 0 0 132 γ 0 2 0 559 σ 0 07 f f p 0 09 f f p in which h s and t s are the significant wave height and significant wave period respectively t p and f p are the peak period and the corresponding peak frequency respectively γ is the peak enhancement factor and the value of 3 3 was used in this study for multidirectional waves the directional spectrum s f θ can be written as a product of a frequency spectrum s f and directional spreading function g f θ i e 2 s f θ s f g f θ the mitsuyasu type spreading function defined by longuet higgins et al 1963 was used in this experiment 3 g f θ g 0 cos 2 s θ θ 0 2 where θ 0 is the principal wave direction g 0 is a constant introduced to satisfy that the integration of the directional spreading function over the directional range should be 1 0 s is the directional spreading parameter or wave directional concentration parameter a greater s value means that the directional spreading is narrower for an intuitive understanding of the directional spreading properties fig 3 provides a comparison of the directional spreading with different parameters s this study mainly considered the breaking characteristics of irregular waves and the summarized wave conditions are listed in table 1 and table 2 due to the small effective test area two different incident wave directions α 0 15 for unidirectional irregular waves and three different directional spreading parameters s 25 40 and 75 for multidirectional waves were considered different initial wave heights and periods were used to investigate the effect of incident wave steepness on wave breaking it should be noted that a small oblique incident angle α 15 was used in this experiment this is because in the wave basin when oblique waves are generated waves in the area surrounded by the wave ray line as shown in fig 1 and the wave maker line are effective the slope terrain along the center line must be arranged in the effective area the larger the incident angle the smaller the effective area therefore a smaller incident wave angle was used to ensure all the waves could propagate along the center line of the terrain this is why larger directional spreading parameters were used as shown in fig 3 when s is larger the directional spreading is narrower and almost all directional waves can propagate along the center line of the terrain in the statistical analysis significant wave heights and periods were used for irregular waves and analyzed by applying the zero up crossing method using the filtered records after subtracting the long waves as explained in the following analysis the initial wave periods varied from 1 0 to 2 5s for unidirectional irregular waves with α 0 and 15 the corresponding initial wave heights of the irregular waves with different incident directions were similar for the comparison of incipient angle influence the initial wave periods of three different directional spreading parameters for multidirectional waves s 25 40 and 75 respectively varied from 1 5 to 2 0s the similar corresponding initial wave heights were used to investigate the differences caused by wave directionality the run up and run down of mean water level caused by the propagation of waves on the slope should be taken into account when the local water depth is considered the local water depth was determined by adding the mean water level to the still water depth due to the very shallow water depth near the top of the slope the data of three wave gauges no 22 no 23 and no 24 were excluded from the following analysis wave surface elevations were measured by the wave gauges at a sample interval of 0 02s for the initial wave periods t s 1 0s and t s 1 5s the data length of each record was 8 192 for the initial wave periods t s 2 0s and t s 2 5s the date length of each record was 16 384 each test was repeated two or three times to avoid random errors in order to determine breaking position breaking wave type and breaking wave height the entire process of wave propagation on the slope was videotaped as examples fig 4 provides the comparison of the measured incident wave spectra at no 1 wave gauge analyzed by the fast fourier transform method and the targets for unidirectional irregular waves furthermore fig 5 shows the comparison of the measured incident directional spectrum at wave gauge array zl analyzed by the bayesian method hashimoto et al 1987 and the corresponding target directional spectrum the case of s 40 is given as example the figures show that the desired incident waves were satisfactorily generated 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 low frequency waves in the wave basin low frequency motions in the wave basin can significantly affect the wave breaking process especially the wave breaking location and breaking wave height therefore they were initially analyzed before studying the wave breaker index fig 6 shows the wave run up and run down along the slope terrain for normal incident irregular waves in the present study the surf zone was defined as the beginning of the incipient wave breaking point to the no 21 wave gauge x 9 25m see section 3 2 1 in the surf zone all cases showed run down first and then run up however the water level tended to be zero near the top of the terrain because the still water level was at the top of the 1 15 slope this differed from that for a complete slope a typical example of wave frequency spectra for irregular waves is shown in fig 7 the low frequency energy gradually increased with a decrease in water depth while the first harmonic energy decreased in the surf zone since the wave energy transfer between the low frequency energy and the first harmonic energy was obvious in the surf zone the ratio of the low frequency energy to the first harmonic energy was analyzed as follows according to the initial significant wave period t s the corresponding peak frequency f p of incident waves could be calculated by the formula following eq 1 as the different harmonic energies could not be theoretically separated the low frequency energy and the first harmonic energy were approximately and roughly defined as the wave energy e 0 in the range of 0 0 5 f p and the wave energy e 1 in the range of 0 5 1 5 f p respectively five cases of irregular waves with different initial wave periods and heights are presented in fig 8 the other cases showed similar tendency and therefore are not shown the incipient breaking points of these five waves were both at x 7 5 m no 14 wave gauge the growth trends of e 0 e 1 for normal and oblique incident irregular waves and multidirectional irregular waves were similar on the slope the values of e 0 e 1 continuously increased and the growth trends became rapid in the surf zone therefore in the surf zone the energy will transfer from the dominant frequency to the low frequency with a decrease in water depth according to fig 8 the ratio of low frequency energy to first harmonic energy in the surf zone can reach approximately 0 5 therefore the effect of low frequency waves on the wave breaking process should be considered consequently before the wave breaker index calculation the measured wave records were filtered to exclude low frequency waves 3 2 breaker indexes based on significant waves 3 2 1 breaker index at incipient breaking for unidirectional irregular waves for regular waves the breaking point is usually fixed and can be easily located however when irregular waves approach the shore the breaking of individual waves occurs gradually with a decrease in water depth large waves break first far from the shoreline and small waves break last near the shoreline the breaking of irregular waves occurs in a zone instead of at a point like regular waves and the breaking criteria for regular waves cannot be directly applied to irregular waves goda 2010 for defining the breaking point of irregular waves kamphuis 1991 introduced the term incipient wave breaking kamphuis 1991 presented a curve of a wave shoaling trend beginning in deep water and a curve of wave decay trend beginning near the shoreline the incipient breaking wave height was then defined as the maximum wave height occurring at the intersection of these two curves and the water depth at the location of maximum wave height was defined as the breaking depth since the breaking of irregular waves occurs in a specific area the surf zone in the present study was defined as beginning from the location of incipient wave breaking to the position of the no 21 wave gauge incipient wave breaking was determined by the method proposed by kamphuis 1991 since most of the present empirical formulae for wave breaking criteria are based on regular waves the present study mainly reported the experimental results of irregular wave breaking to examine the applicability of the previous formulae additionally because most of the well known breaking criteria are only applicable to normal incident waves the applicability of previous empirical formulae to oblique and multidirectional irregular waves were also analyzed firstly the breaker index was analyzed at incipient wave breaking i e the incipient breaker index the significant wave height was used as the representative wave height for irregular waves summarizing the types of the breaker index formulae given by the corresponding references the forms of the breaker indexes could be classified into three types h b d b h b h 0 and h b l b or h b l 0 where h b is the breaking wave height d b is the breaking water depth l b is the breaking wave length and h 0 and l 0 are the corresponding wave height and wave length in deep water respectively some typical breaker index formulae of regular waves and irregular waves proposed by earlier researchers were compared with the present experimental data of normal and oblique incident irregular waves and multidirectional waves 1 breaker index of h b d b mccowan 1894 suggested that the limiting wave height of the solitary wave was controlled by water depth i e 4 h b d b k where h b is the breaking wave height d b is the breaking water depth and the value of k in mccowan s research was 0 78 considering the effect of beach slope many studies introduced beach slope as a parameter in their breaking criteria for instance singamsetti and wind 1980 considered both the effects of beach slope and deep water wave steepness 5 h b d b a 1 m 0 155 h 0 l 0 b 1 where m is the beach slope a 1 0 937 and b 1 0 13 for regular waves kamphuis 1991 proposed that a 1 should be 0 71 for irregular waves fig 9 shows a comparison of the analyzed incipient breaker indexes of h b d b with the calculated curves of eq 5 proposed by singamsetti and wind 1980 for regular waves and kamphuis 1991 for irregular waves this shows that the empirical formula of singamsetti and wind 1980 for regular waves produces much larger values compared with the present experimental data of unidirectional irregular waves however the present results are generally identical to the irregular wave results of kamphuis 1991 furthermore according to the fitting analysis the growth trend of h b d b of oblique irregular waves α 15 with a decrease in water depth was slightly faster than that of normal incident irregular waves α 0 in addition hansen 1990 proposed an expression considering local wave parameters at the wave breaking point as follows 6 h b d b a 2 m l b d b b 2 where a 2 1 05 and b 2 0 2 for regular waves kamphuis 1991 proposed that a 2 should be 0 77 for irregular waves similarly fig 10 shows the comparison of the analyzed incipient breaker indexes of h b d b with the calculated curves of eq 6 proposed by hansen 1990 for regular waves and kamphuis 1991 for irregular waves similarly the empirical formula of hansen 1990 for regular waves provides much larger values compared with the present experimental results of unidirectional irregular waves additionally the present incipient breaker indexes increased faster than those of irregular waves by kamphuis 1991 based on the fitting analysis the growth trend of h b d b of oblique incident irregular waves α 15 was also slightly faster than that of normal incident irregular waves α 0 moreover goda 2010 re examined the original laboratory data and a revision was made to modify the slope effect term the new criterion related to the relative breaking water depth d b l 0 was expressed as 7 h b d b a 3 1 exp b 3 π d b l 0 1 11 m 4 3 d b l 0 where a 3 0 17 and b 3 1 5 for regular waves and a 3 0 12 b 3 1 5 for irregular waves kamphuis 1991 proposed the same value of a 3 0 12 for irregular waves in parallel fig 11 shows the comparison of analyzed incipient breaker indexes of h b d b with the calculated curves of eq 7 the illustration also shows that the calculated breaker indexes of goda 2010 for regular waves are larger than the experimental data of unidirectional irregular waves in addition the experimental data were much larger than the irregular wave breaker indexes derived by goda 2010 the fitting results re iterates the finding that the growth trend of h b d b for oblique incident irregular waves α 15 was slightly faster than that for normal incident irregular waves α 0 it is necessary to mention that the definitions of incipient wave breaking used by goda 2010 and the present study both refer to kamphuis 1991 based on the results of four slopes 1 100 1 30 1 20 and 1 10 by goda 2000 the range of the corresponding coefficient a 3 for irregular waves was 0 11 0 13 and the breaker index and criterion coefficient tend to increase with increasing steepness of the slope later the proposed coefficient for irregular waves in goda 2010 was 0 12 which took the average value of the results for the four slopes the slope used in the present study was 1 15 larger than the three slopes of goda 2000 this may explain why the breaker indexes of irregular waves were higher in our study 2 breaker index of h b h 0 for the breaker index of h b h 0 the formula proposed by ogawa and shuto 1984 was related to the wave steepness in deep water and expressed as 8 h b h 0 a 4 m 0 09 h 0 l 0 b 4 where a 4 0 68 and b 4 0 25 for regular waves a comparison of the analyzed results with the calculated curves of eq 8 is depicted in fig 12 these results show that the breaker indexes of regular waves proposed by ogawa and shuto 1984 are larger than that of unidirectional irregular waves the fitting results revealed that the growth trend of h b h 0 of oblique incident irregular waves α 15 was much faster than that of normal incident irregular waves α 0 3 breaker index of h b l b regarding the breaker index of h b l b ostendorf and madsen 1979 proposed that it was dependent on the local relative water depth d b l b and the formula for regular waves can be described as 9 h b l b a 5 tanh b 5 0 8 5 m 2 π d b l b where a 5 0 14 and b 5 1 0 for regular waves kamphuis 1991 proposed that a 5 should be reduced to 0 12 for irregular waves fig 13 illustrates a comparison of the analyzed results with the calculated curves of eq 9 proposed by ostendorf and madsen 1979 for regular waves and kamphuis 1991 for irregular waves the expression of ostendorf and madsen 1979 for regular waves produced larger values compared with the present experimental data of unidirectional irregular waves the fitting analysis revealed that the growth trend of h b l b for oblique irregular waves α 15 was slightly slower than that for normal incident irregular waves α 0 it should be emphasized that the above breaker index formulae of h b d b and h b l b modified by kamphuis 1991 for irregular waves could not satisfactorily describe the growth trend of the present experimental data for unidirectional irregular waves that may be because only one parameter was modified by kamphuis 1991 in each empirical criterion therefore the fitted results of the constant parameters a i and b i were more reasonable to the experimental data for irregular waves in the present study the analyzed constant parameters a i and b i according to eq 5 to eq 9 are summarized in table 3 in which the original values based on regular waves and irregular waves by the referred authors are also provided for comparison from figs 9 13 and table 3 the breaker index expressions of regular waves proposed by other researchers with appropriate coefficients could be applied to irregular waves the incipient breaker indexes of irregular waves were lower than that of regular waves the incipient breaker indexes of oblique incident irregular waves α 15 were larger than that of normal incident irregular waves α 0 the growth trends of h b d b and h b h 0 of oblique incident irregular waves were faster than that of normal incident irregular waves but the growth trend of h b l b for oblique incident irregular waves was slightly slower than that of normal incident irregular waves the fact that oblique incident irregular waves have higher breaker indexes may be because wave refraction results in a tendency of the wave surface to be focused at the breaking point for oblique waves due to different water depths along the wave crest the outer waves in deeper water can support a larger breaking wave height 3 2 2 breaker index at incipient breaking for multidirectional irregular waves the incipient breaking of multidirectional waves can be also determined by the method proposed by kamphuis 1991 to assess the effectiveness of the method proposed by kamphuis 1991 for multidirectional waves it was initially utilized to determine the incipient breaking wave points of multidirectional waves with different wave conditions the determined points were then verified through video records they were found to conform with each other therefore the incipient breaking of multidirectional waves in the present study was still defined by the method proposed by kamphuis 1991 similar to figs 9 13 and figs 14 18 present the variations in different incipient breaker indexes for multidirectional waves with different directional spreading parameters s the experimental data and fitting curves of normal incident irregular waves α 0 which can be regarded as s were also plotted in the figures for comparison the incipient breaker indexes of h b d b h b h 0 and h b l b for multidirectional waves with three different directional spreading parameters s 25 40 and 75 respectively showed similar growth trends to those of normal incident irregular waves the breaker indexes were not strongly dependent on wave directionality furthermore the incipient breaker indexes of h b d b and h b l b of multidirectional waves were generally consistent with those of normal incident irregular waves however the breaker indexes of h b h 0 of multidirectional waves were much larger than those of normal incident irregular waves considering that the experimental data of multidirectional waves with different directional spreading parameters were identical to each other they were considered together in the fitting analysis as shown in fig 17 the modified formula of ogawa and shuto 1984 could be applied to multidirectional waves and the modified coefficients a 4 and b 4 in eq 8 were 0 77 and 0 20 r 2 0 84 the growth trend of h b h 0 of multidirectional waves was much faster than that of normal incident irregular waves based on fig 18 the empirical formula of ostendorf and madsen 1979 could be applied to multidirectional waves and the modified coefficients a 5 and b 5 in eq 9 were 0 11 and 1 19 r 2 0 89 the growth trend of h b l b of multidirectional waves was slightly faster than that of normal incident irregular waves in addition the experimental data of h b d b for multidirectional waves were too scattered to provide a good fit as shown in fig 14 fig 15 and fig 16 therefore the applicability of eq 5 eq 6 and eq 7 for multidirectional waves needs to be investigated further 3 2 3 breaker indexes in the surf zone when coastal structures are located in the surf zone it is more appropriate to consider the breaker index in the surf zone than the breaker index at incipient breaking few studies to date have investigated the breaker index of irregular waves within the surf zone the most well known research was conducted by goda 2010 therefore the present study further focused on the breaking of irregular waves in the surf zone and the ratio of significant wave height to water depth h 1 3 d is defined as the breaker index in this section when the wave breaking process is completed the wave develops into a bore hafsteinsson et al 2017 at this moment the wave height is usually controlled by water depth therefore wave height after wave breaking is approximately proportional to local water depth to investigate the breaker indexes in the surf zone for irregular waves fig 19 illustrates the analyzed relationship between significant wave height h 1 3 and local water depth d for all experimental data in the surf zone this shows that the significant wave height in the surf zone decreases with a decrease in water depth at shallower water depths the significant wave height changes almost linearly with water depth the ratio of significant wave height to water depth h 1 3 d for irregular waves in the surf zone is on average approximately 0 92 r 2 0 81 this value is much larger than that for regular waves this is because for regular waves the individual wave heights in the wave train are generally the same and the individual waves usually break at the same position therefore in the surf zone the waves have broken and the ratio of wave height to water depth is small however for irregular waves as the water depth on the slope decreases large waves break first and smaller waves break later therefore some subsequent smaller waves reach the breaking condition in the surf zone resulting in a higher ratio of wave height to water depth compared with regular waves although significant wave height in the surf zone is mainly controlled by water depth both parameters are not completely linear except in shallower water as shown in fig 19 therefore the relationship between the ratio of significant wave height to water depth h 1 3 d and the relative water depth d l 0 for irregular waves in the surf zone were further investigated the breaker index of normal incident irregular waves α 0 in the surf zone is shown in fig 20 in which the incipient breaker index of h b d b is also plotted for comparison this shows that as waves propagate along the slope the ratio of significant wave height to water depth h 1 3 d gradually increases with a decrease in d l 0 additionally the values of h 1 3 d increase starting from the incipient breaker index of h b d b which is consistent with the results of goda 2010 the maximum value of the breaker index of h 1 3 d is approximately 1 2 for the experimental data of normal incident irregular waves the following formula can be used to describe the growth trend in the breaker index of h 1 3 d in the surf zone 10 h 1 3 d a b log d l 0 where a 0 26 and b 0 40 r 2 0 92 obtained based on the experimental data for normal incident irregular waves a similar tendency of h 1 3 d was observed from the experimental data for oblique incident irregular waves α 15 as shown in fig 21 the fitting curve of oblique incident irregular waves based on eq 10 was also plotted and a 0 12 and b 0 49 were obtained r 2 0 89 compared with fig 20 the growth trend of h 1 3 d for oblique incident irregular waves in the surf zone was much faster than that for normal incident irregular waves the maximum value of h 1 3 d for oblique incident irregular waves was approximately 1 3 and larger than that for normal incident irregular waves fig 22 shows the breaker index of multidirectional irregular waves with s 25 40 and 75 in the surf zone the fitting curve of multidirectional irregular waves based on eq 10 was also plotted and a 0 42 and b 0 31 were obtained r 2 0 64 although the range of d l 0 was small it still indicates that the growth trend of h 1 3 d for multidirectional waves was similar with that for unidirectional irregular waves the values of h 1 3 d were identical to each other for multidirectional waves with different directional spreading parameters this may be because there were no major differences between these three directional spreading parameters as shown in fig 3 therefore further research should be performed for multidirectional waves with additional directional spreading parameters as shown in figs 20 22 the increasing tendency of h 1 3 d for unidirectional irregular waves α 0 15 and multidirectional waves with three different directional spreading parameters s 25 40 and 75 were similar the breaker index of h 1 3 d in the surf zone gradually increased from the incipient breaker index of h b d b with a decrease in d l 0 furthermore the growth trend of oblique incident irregular waves α 15 was faster than that of normal incident irregular waves α 0 and the multidirectional waves with three different directional spreading parameters the increase in the breaker index of h 1 3 d in the surf zone from the incipient breaker index of h b d b with a decrease in d l 0 can be attributed to the specific wave properties in the surf zone in fact because most of the smaller waves reach the breaking condition in the surf zone with a decrease in water depth the proportion of the breaking waves in the wave series in the surf zone should be larger than that in the defined incident breaking wave series therefore the ratio of the representative significant wave height to the water depth should be relatively larger in the surf zone concerning the increase in the breaker index of h 1 3 d with a decrease in d l 0 another reason may be because the breaker type of irregular waves changes from spilling to plunging with decreasing water depth in the surf zone which was identified with the video records 3 3 breaker indexes of individual waves for normal incident unidirectional irregular waves 3 3 1 individual waves tracked by the wave by wave method for irregular waves the wave heights and wave periods of individual waves in a wave train are different although the significant wave height is usually used to analyze irregular wave properties in fact the significant wave height cannot truly reflect the actual individual wave height similarly under the same wave height the properties of individual breaking waves in irregular wave trains are different from those of regular breaking waves therefore it is necessary to investigate the individual breaking wave height to determine irregular wave breaking characteristics since the wave gauges on the slope were densely arranged in the present experiment the wave parameters of individual waves could be tracked by the wave by wave method by observing and analyzing the original wave surface elevation records the evolution of individual waves on each wave gauge was tracked in turn the wave height and period of individual waves on each wave gauge were recorded where the maximum wave height on the slope was defined as the breaking wave height and the corresponding water depth was defined as the breaking water depth since the wave propagation direction should be consistent with the axial direction of wave gauge arrangement if the individual waves are tracked by the wave by wave method only the normal incident irregular waves α 0 are considered in this section fig 23 shows an example of the wave surface elevation for normal incident irregular waves α 0 it shows that there is a large wave group in the period of 42 60s the wave surface elevations of this wave group at different wave gauges are shown in fig 24 this reveals that individual waves with different wave heights break at different positions i e some individual waves break at no 13 wave gauge and some other individual waves break at no 16 wave gauge in addition fig 24 shows that when waves propagate into shallow water the steepness of wave profiles increase and the run up of mean water level increases markedly furthermore a total of 13 individual waves in the large wave group were tracked through the wave by wave method fig 25 presents the wave height variation in each individual wave from no 8 wave gauge to no 21 wave gauge on the slope it clearly indicates that the breaking points of individual waves are different large waves break far from the top of slope medium waves break at some distance from the top of slope and small waves break near the top of the slope due to the differences in breaking points between individual waves breaking wave height h b breaking water depth d b and breaking wavelength l b also differ the individual breaker indexes of h b d b and h b l b i e the ratios of breaking wave height to breaking water depth or breaking wavelength are defined and analyzed below the eight cases of normal incident irregular waves as shown in table 1 were considered and the large individual waves in the wave trains were tracked by the wave by wave method 40 65 individual waves in each wave train 3 3 2 individual breaker index of h b d b for large individual waves the relationship between breaking wave height and breaking water depth is shown in fig 26 here the local water depth was computed as the sum of still water depth and mean water depth over the entire wave record eq 4 proposed by mccowan 1894 for a solitary wave was also plotted for comparison this shows that most experimental points of individual waves are located above the line of eq 4 proposed by mccowan 1894 after fitting the experimental data of individual waves with eq 4 the value of k obtained was 0 85 r 2 0 40 significant wave height was used for irregular waves in kamphuis 1991 and k 0 78 r 2 0 70 was derived it should be pointed out that the coefficient k derived by kamphuis 1991 is exactly the same as that derived by mccowan 1894 however the best fit coefficient k of individual waves in the present study was larger than this the initial beach slope 1 10 in kamphuis s experiment is steeper than the slope 1 15 in the present experiment but the best fit coefficients k of eq 4 in kamphuis s experiment is smaller therefore when eq 4 was used to calculate the breaker index of h b d b the result derived by the individual wave height is larger than that derived by the significant wave height and solitary wave it should be mentioned that the wide range of h b values for a given d b value in fig 26 can be observed this indicates that the water depth is not the only factor that affects breaking wave height therefore the effect of incident wave period or wave length on the individual wave breaking process is discussed below since the relative water depths d b l 0 and d b l b can be easily converted to one another through the dispersion relationship fig 27 gives the variation of the breaker index of h b d b of individual waves with d b l 0 in fig 27 the analyzed incipient breaker index of h b d b for irregular waves and the breaking criterion proposed by goda 2010 for regular waves were also plotted for comparison this shows that the breaker index of h b d b increases with a decrease in d b l 0 and the breaker indexes of h b d b were lower than 1 5 the growth trend of h b d b for individual waves is similar to the empirical formula of goda 2010 however when d b l 0 is large goda s formula overestimates the experimental data and when d b l 0 is small goda s formula slightly underestimates the experimental data the experimental data of individual waves were fitted by eq 7 and the parameters a 3 0 092 and b 3 2 9 r 2 0 54 were obtained it can be seen from fig 27 that the fitting curve of eq 7 with appropriate coefficients could satisfactorily describe the growth trend of h b d b for individual waves and most experimental data were scattered in the area of the upper and lower bound lines corresponding to 130 and 75 of the values calculated by eq 7 with a 3 0 092 and b 3 2 9 3 3 3 individual breaker index of h b l b fig 28 shows the variation in the breaker index of h b l b for individual waves with d b l b where the analyzed incipient breaker index of h b l b for irregular waves and the breaking criterion proposed by ostendorf and madsen 1979 for regular waves were plotted for comparison it can be seen that the breaker index of d b l b increases with an increase in d b l b the growth trend of d b l b for individual waves is similar to the empirical formula of ostendorf and madsen 1979 however ostendorf and madsen s formula overestimates the experimental data when d b l b is large after fitting the experimental data of individual waves by eq 9 a 5 0 10 and b 5 1 43 r 2 0 82 were obtained the fitting curve of eq 9 with appropriate coefficients could provide a good indication of the growth trend of d b l b for individual waves most experimental data are scattered in the area of the upper and lower bound lines corresponding to 130 and 80 of the calculated values by eq 9 with a 5 0 10 and b 5 1 43 finally figs 27 and 28 show that the breaker indexes of h b d b and h b l b calculated by individual wave heights were markedly larger than the incipient breaker index calculated by significant wave height therefore it is reasonable to consider the breaker indexes derived by individual waves for coastal engineering design eq 7 proposed by goda 2010 with a 3 0 092 and b 3 2 9 and eq 9 proposed by ostendorf and madsen 1979 with a 5 0 10 and b 5 1 43 could be used to calculate the breaker indexes of individual normal incident irregular waves 4 conclusions unidirectional irregular waves with different incident angles and multidirectional irregular waves were experimentally studied since irregular waves usually break in a specific area wave breaker indexes at incipient breaking point and in the surf zone were analyzed furthermore individual breaking waves in wave trains were analyzed by the wave by wave method the following conclusions were obtained 1 incipient wave breaking was defined incipient breaker indexes represented by significant wave height of irregular waves are smaller than those of regular waves and the modified empirical formulae of regular waves with appropriate coefficients can be applied to irregular waves 2 incipient breaker indexes of oblique incident irregular waves α 15 and multidirectional waves with three different directional spreading parameters s 25 40 and 75 show a similar growth trend as that of normal incident irregular waves α 0 however incipient breaker indexes of oblique incident irregular waves are larger than those of normal incident irregular waves while wave directionality has little effect on incipient breaker indexes due to similar directional spreading 3 the breaker index ratio of significant wave height to water depth in the surf zone increases starting from the incipient breaker index with a decrease in relative water depth consistent with the findings of goda 2010 the growth trend in the breaker index of oblique incident irregular waves in the surf zone is faster than that of normal incident irregular waves and multidirectional waves 4 individual waves in the wave train with different wave heights usually break at different positions therefore breaker indexes calculated using significant wave heights cannot directly reflect the actual individual wave breaking information of individual waves was tracked by the wave by wave method breaker indexes derived by individual wave heights are larger than incipient breaker indexes derived by significant wave heights therefore it is reasonable to consider breaker indexes calculated using individual wave height for the design of coastal engineering eq 7 proposed by goda 2010 with a 3 0 092 and b 3 2 9 and eq 9 proposed by ostendorf and madsen 1979 with a 5 0 10 and b 5 1 43 can be effectively applied to calculate the breaker indexes of individual waves in normal incident

21673,most studies of wave breaking on slopes to date have investigated regular waves or normal incident unidirectional waves in this study wave breakings of normal and oblique incident irregular waves and multidirectional irregular waves on a 1 15 slope were investigated the breaking criteria of irregular waves based on significant wave height and individual wave height were determined firstly breaker indexes calculated using significant wave heights at incipient breaking were analyzed they were substantially lower than the breaker indexes of regular waves the breaker index formulae of irregular waves are presented based on the referred formula of regular waves furthermore the breaker indexes of oblique incident waves were larger than the breaker indexes of normal incident waves however wave directionality had little effect on breaker indexes under the present experimental conditions secondly the breaker index the ratio of significant wave height to water depth in surf zone was analyzed it increased with a decrease in relative water depth thirdly information of individual waves in irregular wave trains was tracked by the wave by wave method the breaker indexes derived by individual wave heights were larger than the incipient breaker indexes derived from significant wave heights based on previous empirical formulae some relatively simple expressions are proposed to calculate individual breaking wave heights for unidirectional irregular waves keywords slope bathymetry oblique irregular wave multidirectional wave individual wave wave by wave method breaker index 1 introduction wave breaking is an important phenomenon in near shore wave propagation as discussed previously van rijn et al 2013 lim et al 2015 lentz et al 2016 van der a et al 2017 serio and mossa 2019 breaking waves usually exert a large force on maritime structures and induce near shore currents that cause sediment transport and beach deformation many breaking criteria have been proposed to calculate breaking wave height but there are often differences among them mccowan 1894 suggested that the limiting wave height of a solitary wave was 0 78 times the water depth in the empirical formula of goda 1970 the influence of wave period or wavelength was considered in addition to breaking water depth and effective beach slope additionally following the expression of goda 1970 researchers have proposed modified breaking criteria by analyzing experimental and field data seyama and kimura 1988 muttray and oumeraci 2000 rattanapitikon and shibyama 2000 goda 2010 among these some researchers considered that the breaking wave height was related to a given deep water wave condition munk 1949 described the relationship between breaking wave height and deep water wave steepness based on an evaluation of breaking wave energy using the theoretical solitary wave equation according to airy wave theory komar and gaughan 1972 modified the factor in munk s formula using the available laboratory and field data furthermore the steepness of breaking waves could constitute a geometric characteristic parameter for wave breaking miche 1944 proposed breaking criterion in terms of breaking wave steepness ostendorf and madsen 1979 modified the formula of miche 1944 by incorporating beach slope however all the aforementioned studies were based on wave breaking of regular waves furthermore kamphuis 1991 li et al 2000 and goda 2010 extended the empirical formula of goda 1970 to irregular waves and indicated that the corresponding coefficients for irregular waves should be reduced compared with regular waves in summary present research on the breaker indexes of regular waves is relatively comprehensive and the breaking criteria of regular waves is commonly used however waves in nature are typically irregular and research on the breaker indexes of irregular waves is insufficient especially regarding oblique incident irregular waves and multidirectional irregular waves in addition breaking positions wave heights and wave periods of individual waves in irregular wave trains differ the breaker index of irregular waves using individual wave heights should be different from that of irregular waves using significant wave heights therefore the breaker indexes of individual normal incident irregular waves require investigation the aim of the present study was to determine the breaking characteristics of normal and oblique incident unidirectional irregular waves and multidirectional waves on slopes firstly the breaker indexes of irregular waves using the significant wave height at incipient breaking were studied the applicability of the breaking criteria of regular waves to unidirectional and multidirectional irregular waves was analyzed and modified formulae were proposed secondly the breaker index the ratio of significant wave height to water depth in the surf zone was analyzed furthermore a comparison of the breaker index between unidirectional irregular waves with different incident directions and multidirectional waves was performed thirdly the wave parameters of individual waves on a slope were tracked by the wave by wave method the breaker indexes of individual waves in irregular wave trains were analyzed and compared with previous breaking criteria of regular waves the breaker indexes of individual waves were then also compared with the incipient breaker indexes represented by the significant wave height and the breaking formulae of individual normal incident irregular waves were determined 2 experimental setup 2 1 wave basin and experimental arrangement the experiment was conducted in the wave basin at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology china the wave basin is 40 0m long and 24 0m wide with a maximum water depth of 0 70m the wave basin is equipped with a self developed motor driven multidirectional wave maker which is effective at generating oblique and multidirectional waves the wave maker systems consist of 70 segments and each segment is 1 00m high and 0 34m wide wave absorbing systems are installed at the other three sides to avoid the influence of wave reflection fig 1 presents a schematic view of the experimental setup a photograph of which is shown in fig 2 to create a gradient in the experiment a smooth impermeable terrain was constructed the seaward slope of the terrain was 1 15 and the height of the topography was 0 40m the water depth before the slope was 0 40m equal to the top of the slope to ensure that all wave breaking occurred on the slope regarding the topography the parallel lines of topographic contours were marked with different colors to observe the wave breaking process and wave breaking position by video the wave surface elevations were recorded by 26 capacitance wave gauges which are shown as filled circles in fig 1 under steady state condition after the wave conditions in the wave basin had reached an equilibrium condition zl is a pentagonal array with five wave gauges which was used to measure the multidirectional waves the measured wave at gauge 1 was regarded as the initial incident wave the wave gauges on the slope were densely arranged to distinguish and determine the breaking wave height in the following discussion x 0 m is defined as the mean position of wave gauge 1 2 2 wave conditions the frequency spectrum s f used in this experiment was that of the jonswap spectrum as modified by goda 1999 1 s f β j h s 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ exp t p f 1 2 2 σ 2 where β j 0 06238 0 230 0 03368 γ 0 185 γ 1 9 1 1 094 0 01915 ln γ t p t s 1 0 0 132 γ 0 2 0 559 σ 0 07 f f p 0 09 f f p in which h s and t s are the significant wave height and significant wave period respectively t p and f p are the peak period and the corresponding peak frequency respectively γ is the peak enhancement factor and the value of 3 3 was used in this study for multidirectional waves the directional spectrum s f θ can be written as a product of a frequency spectrum s f and directional spreading function g f θ i e 2 s f θ s f g f θ the mitsuyasu type spreading function defined by longuet higgins et al 1963 was used in this experiment 3 g f θ g 0 cos 2 s θ θ 0 2 where θ 0 is the principal wave direction g 0 is a constant introduced to satisfy that the integration of the directional spreading function over the directional range should be 1 0 s is the directional spreading parameter or wave directional concentration parameter a greater s value means that the directional spreading is narrower for an intuitive understanding of the directional spreading properties fig 3 provides a comparison of the directional spreading with different parameters s this study mainly considered the breaking characteristics of irregular waves and the summarized wave conditions are listed in table 1 and table 2 due to the small effective test area two different incident wave directions α 0 15 for unidirectional irregular waves and three different directional spreading parameters s 25 40 and 75 for multidirectional waves were considered different initial wave heights and periods were used to investigate the effect of incident wave steepness on wave breaking it should be noted that a small oblique incident angle α 15 was used in this experiment this is because in the wave basin when oblique waves are generated waves in the area surrounded by the wave ray line as shown in fig 1 and the wave maker line are effective the slope terrain along the center line must be arranged in the effective area the larger the incident angle the smaller the effective area therefore a smaller incident wave angle was used to ensure all the waves could propagate along the center line of the terrain this is why larger directional spreading parameters were used as shown in fig 3 when s is larger the directional spreading is narrower and almost all directional waves can propagate along the center line of the terrain in the statistical analysis significant wave heights and periods were used for irregular waves and analyzed by applying the zero up crossing method using the filtered records after subtracting the long waves as explained in the following analysis the initial wave periods varied from 1 0 to 2 5s for unidirectional irregular waves with α 0 and 15 the corresponding initial wave heights of the irregular waves with different incident directions were similar for the comparison of incipient angle influence the initial wave periods of three different directional spreading parameters for multidirectional waves s 25 40 and 75 respectively varied from 1 5 to 2 0s the similar corresponding initial wave heights were used to investigate the differences caused by wave directionality the run up and run down of mean water level caused by the propagation of waves on the slope should be taken into account when the local water depth is considered the local water depth was determined by adding the mean water level to the still water depth due to the very shallow water depth near the top of the slope the data of three wave gauges no 22 no 23 and no 24 were excluded from the following analysis wave surface elevations were measured by the wave gauges at a sample interval of 0 02s for the initial wave periods t s 1 0s and t s 1 5s the data length of each record was 8 192 for the initial wave periods t s 2 0s and t s 2 5s the date length of each record was 16 384 each test was repeated two or three times to avoid random errors in order to determine breaking position breaking wave type and breaking wave height the entire process of wave propagation on the slope was videotaped as examples fig 4 provides the comparison of the measured incident wave spectra at no 1 wave gauge analyzed by the fast fourier transform method and the targets for unidirectional irregular waves furthermore fig 5 shows the comparison of the measured incident directional spectrum at wave gauge array zl analyzed by the bayesian method hashimoto et al 1987 and the corresponding target directional spectrum the case of s 40 is given as example the figures show that the desired incident waves were satisfactorily generated 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 low frequency waves in the wave basin low frequency motions in the wave basin can significantly affect the wave breaking process especially the wave breaking location and breaking wave height therefore they were initially analyzed before studying the wave breaker index fig 6 shows the wave run up and run down along the slope terrain for normal incident irregular waves in the present study the surf zone was defined as the beginning of the incipient wave breaking point to the no 21 wave gauge x 9 25m see section 3 2 1 in the surf zone all cases showed run down first and then run up however the water level tended to be zero near the top of the terrain because the still water level was at the top of the 1 15 slope this differed from that for a complete slope a typical example of wave frequency spectra for irregular waves is shown in fig 7 the low frequency energy gradually increased with a decrease in water depth while the first harmonic energy decreased in the surf zone since the wave energy transfer between the low frequency energy and the first harmonic energy was obvious in the surf zone the ratio of the low frequency energy to the first harmonic energy was analyzed as follows according to the initial significant wave period t s the corresponding peak frequency f p of incident waves could be calculated by the formula following eq 1 as the different harmonic energies could not be theoretically separated the low frequency energy and the first harmonic energy were approximately and roughly defined as the wave energy e 0 in the range of 0 0 5 f p and the wave energy e 1 in the range of 0 5 1 5 f p respectively five cases of irregular waves with different initial wave periods and heights are presented in fig 8 the other cases showed similar tendency and therefore are not shown the incipient breaking points of these five waves were both at x 7 5 m no 14 wave gauge the growth trends of e 0 e 1 for normal and oblique incident irregular waves and multidirectional irregular waves were similar on the slope the values of e 0 e 1 continuously increased and the growth trends became rapid in the surf zone therefore in the surf zone the energy will transfer from the dominant frequency to the low frequency with a decrease in water depth according to fig 8 the ratio of low frequency energy to first harmonic energy in the surf zone can reach approximately 0 5 therefore the effect of low frequency waves on the wave breaking process should be considered consequently before the wave breaker index calculation the measured wave records were filtered to exclude low frequency waves 3 2 breaker indexes based on significant waves 3 2 1 breaker index at incipient breaking for unidirectional irregular waves for regular waves the breaking point is usually fixed and can be easily located however when irregular waves approach the shore the breaking of individual waves occurs gradually with a decrease in water depth large waves break first far from the shoreline and small waves break last near the shoreline the breaking of irregular waves occurs in a zone instead of at a point like regular waves and the breaking criteria for regular waves cannot be directly applied to irregular waves goda 2010 for defining the breaking point of irregular waves kamphuis 1991 introduced the term incipient wave breaking kamphuis 1991 presented a curve of a wave shoaling trend beginning in deep water and a curve of wave decay trend beginning near the shoreline the incipient breaking wave height was then defined as the maximum wave height occurring at the intersection of these two curves and the water depth at the location of maximum wave height was defined as the breaking depth since the breaking of irregular waves occurs in a specific area the surf zone in the present study was defined as beginning from the location of incipient wave breaking to the position of the no 21 wave gauge incipient wave breaking was determined by the method proposed by kamphuis 1991 since most of the present empirical formulae for wave breaking criteria are based on regular waves the present study mainly reported the experimental results of irregular wave breaking to examine the applicability of the previous formulae additionally because most of the well known breaking criteria are only applicable to normal incident waves the applicability of previous empirical formulae to oblique and multidirectional irregular waves were also analyzed firstly the breaker index was analyzed at incipient wave breaking i e the incipient breaker index the significant wave height was used as the representative wave height for irregular waves summarizing the types of the breaker index formulae given by the corresponding references the forms of the breaker indexes could be classified into three types h b d b h b h 0 and h b l b or h b l 0 where h b is the breaking wave height d b is the breaking water depth l b is the breaking wave length and h 0 and l 0 are the corresponding wave height and wave length in deep water respectively some typical breaker index formulae of regular waves and irregular waves proposed by earlier researchers were compared with the present experimental data of normal and oblique incident irregular waves and multidirectional waves 1 breaker index of h b d b mccowan 1894 suggested that the limiting wave height of the solitary wave was controlled by water depth i e 4 h b d b k where h b is the breaking wave height d b is the breaking water depth and the value of k in mccowan s research was 0 78 considering the effect of beach slope many studies introduced beach slope as a parameter in their breaking criteria for instance singamsetti and wind 1980 considered both the effects of beach slope and deep water wave steepness 5 h b d b a 1 m 0 155 h 0 l 0 b 1 where m is the beach slope a 1 0 937 and b 1 0 13 for regular waves kamphuis 1991 proposed that a 1 should be 0 71 for irregular waves fig 9 shows a comparison of the analyzed incipient breaker indexes of h b d b with the calculated curves of eq 5 proposed by singamsetti and wind 1980 for regular waves and kamphuis 1991 for irregular waves this shows that the empirical formula of singamsetti and wind 1980 for regular waves produces much larger values compared with the present experimental data of unidirectional irregular waves however the present results are generally identical to the irregular wave results of kamphuis 1991 furthermore according to the fitting analysis the growth trend of h b d b of oblique irregular waves α 15 with a decrease in water depth was slightly faster than that of normal incident irregular waves α 0 in addition hansen 1990 proposed an expression considering local wave parameters at the wave breaking point as follows 6 h b d b a 2 m l b d b b 2 where a 2 1 05 and b 2 0 2 for regular waves kamphuis 1991 proposed that a 2 should be 0 77 for irregular waves similarly fig 10 shows the comparison of the analyzed incipient breaker indexes of h b d b with the calculated curves of eq 6 proposed by hansen 1990 for regular waves and kamphuis 1991 for irregular waves similarly the empirical formula of hansen 1990 for regular waves provides much larger values compared with the present experimental results of unidirectional irregular waves additionally the present incipient breaker indexes increased faster than those of irregular waves by kamphuis 1991 based on the fitting analysis the growth trend of h b d b of oblique incident irregular waves α 15 was also slightly faster than that of normal incident irregular waves α 0 moreover goda 2010 re examined the original laboratory data and a revision was made to modify the slope effect term the new criterion related to the relative breaking water depth d b l 0 was expressed as 7 h b d b a 3 1 exp b 3 π d b l 0 1 11 m 4 3 d b l 0 where a 3 0 17 and b 3 1 5 for regular waves and a 3 0 12 b 3 1 5 for irregular waves kamphuis 1991 proposed the same value of a 3 0 12 for irregular waves in parallel fig 11 shows the comparison of analyzed incipient breaker indexes of h b d b with the calculated curves of eq 7 the illustration also shows that the calculated breaker indexes of goda 2010 for regular waves are larger than the experimental data of unidirectional irregular waves in addition the experimental data were much larger than the irregular wave breaker indexes derived by goda 2010 the fitting results re iterates the finding that the growth trend of h b d b for oblique incident irregular waves α 15 was slightly faster than that for normal incident irregular waves α 0 it is necessary to mention that the definitions of incipient wave breaking used by goda 2010 and the present study both refer to kamphuis 1991 based on the results of four slopes 1 100 1 30 1 20 and 1 10 by goda 2000 the range of the corresponding coefficient a 3 for irregular waves was 0 11 0 13 and the breaker index and criterion coefficient tend to increase with increasing steepness of the slope later the proposed coefficient for irregular waves in goda 2010 was 0 12 which took the average value of the results for the four slopes the slope used in the present study was 1 15 larger than the three slopes of goda 2000 this may explain why the breaker indexes of irregular waves were higher in our study 2 breaker index of h b h 0 for the breaker index of h b h 0 the formula proposed by ogawa and shuto 1984 was related to the wave steepness in deep water and expressed as 8 h b h 0 a 4 m 0 09 h 0 l 0 b 4 where a 4 0 68 and b 4 0 25 for regular waves a comparison of the analyzed results with the calculated curves of eq 8 is depicted in fig 12 these results show that the breaker indexes of regular waves proposed by ogawa and shuto 1984 are larger than that of unidirectional irregular waves the fitting results revealed that the growth trend of h b h 0 of oblique incident irregular waves α 15 was much faster than that of normal incident irregular waves α 0 3 breaker index of h b l b regarding the breaker index of h b l b ostendorf and madsen 1979 proposed that it was dependent on the local relative water depth d b l b and the formula for regular waves can be described as 9 h b l b a 5 tanh b 5 0 8 5 m 2 π d b l b where a 5 0 14 and b 5 1 0 for regular waves kamphuis 1991 proposed that a 5 should be reduced to 0 12 for irregular waves fig 13 illustrates a comparison of the analyzed results with the calculated curves of eq 9 proposed by ostendorf and madsen 1979 for regular waves and kamphuis 1991 for irregular waves the expression of ostendorf and madsen 1979 for regular waves produced larger values compared with the present experimental data of unidirectional irregular waves the fitting analysis revealed that the growth trend of h b l b for oblique irregular waves α 15 was slightly slower than that for normal incident irregular waves α 0 it should be emphasized that the above breaker index formulae of h b d b and h b l b modified by kamphuis 1991 for irregular waves could not satisfactorily describe the growth trend of the present experimental data for unidirectional irregular waves that may be because only one parameter was modified by kamphuis 1991 in each empirical criterion therefore the fitted results of the constant parameters a i and b i were more reasonable to the experimental data for irregular waves in the present study the analyzed constant parameters a i and b i according to eq 5 to eq 9 are summarized in table 3 in which the original values based on regular waves and irregular waves by the referred authors are also provided for comparison from figs 9 13 and table 3 the breaker index expressions of regular waves proposed by other researchers with appropriate coefficients could be applied to irregular waves the incipient breaker indexes of irregular waves were lower than that of regular waves the incipient breaker indexes of oblique incident irregular waves α 15 were larger than that of normal incident irregular waves α 0 the growth trends of h b d b and h b h 0 of oblique incident irregular waves were faster than that of normal incident irregular waves but the growth trend of h b l b for oblique incident irregular waves was slightly slower than that of normal incident irregular waves the fact that oblique incident irregular waves have higher breaker indexes may be because wave refraction results in a tendency of the wave surface to be focused at the breaking point for oblique waves due to different water depths along the wave crest the outer waves in deeper water can support a larger breaking wave height 3 2 2 breaker index at incipient breaking for multidirectional irregular waves the incipient breaking of multidirectional waves can be also determined by the method proposed by kamphuis 1991 to assess the effectiveness of the method proposed by kamphuis 1991 for multidirectional waves it was initially utilized to determine the incipient breaking wave points of multidirectional waves with different wave conditions the determined points were then verified through video records they were found to conform with each other therefore the incipient breaking of multidirectional waves in the present study was still defined by the method proposed by kamphuis 1991 similar to figs 9 13 and figs 14 18 present the variations in different incipient breaker indexes for multidirectional waves with different directional spreading parameters s the experimental data and fitting curves of normal incident irregular waves α 0 which can be regarded as s were also plotted in the figures for comparison the incipient breaker indexes of h b d b h b h 0 and h b l b for multidirectional waves with three different directional spreading parameters s 25 40 and 75 respectively showed similar growth trends to those of normal incident irregular waves the breaker indexes were not strongly dependent on wave directionality furthermore the incipient breaker indexes of h b d b and h b l b of multidirectional waves were generally consistent with those of normal incident irregular waves however the breaker indexes of h b h 0 of multidirectional waves were much larger than those of normal incident irregular waves considering that the experimental data of multidirectional waves with different directional spreading parameters were identical to each other they were considered together in the fitting analysis as shown in fig 17 the modified formula of ogawa and shuto 1984 could be applied to multidirectional waves and the modified coefficients a 4 and b 4 in eq 8 were 0 77 and 0 20 r 2 0 84 the growth trend of h b h 0 of multidirectional waves was much faster than that of normal incident irregular waves based on fig 18 the empirical formula of ostendorf and madsen 1979 could be applied to multidirectional waves and the modified coefficients a 5 and b 5 in eq 9 were 0 11 and 1 19 r 2 0 89 the growth trend of h b l b of multidirectional waves was slightly faster than that of normal incident irregular waves in addition the experimental data of h b d b for multidirectional waves were too scattered to provide a good fit as shown in fig 14 fig 15 and fig 16 therefore the applicability of eq 5 eq 6 and eq 7 for multidirectional waves needs to be investigated further 3 2 3 breaker indexes in the surf zone when coastal structures are located in the surf zone it is more appropriate to consider the breaker index in the surf zone than the breaker index at incipient breaking few studies to date have investigated the breaker index of irregular waves within the surf zone the most well known research was conducted by goda 2010 therefore the present study further focused on the breaking of irregular waves in the surf zone and the ratio of significant wave height to water depth h 1 3 d is defined as the breaker index in this section when the wave breaking process is completed the wave develops into a bore hafsteinsson et al 2017 at this moment the wave height is usually controlled by water depth therefore wave height after wave breaking is approximately proportional to local water depth to investigate the breaker indexes in the surf zone for irregular waves fig 19 illustrates the analyzed relationship between significant wave height h 1 3 and local water depth d for all experimental data in the surf zone this shows that the significant wave height in the surf zone decreases with a decrease in water depth at shallower water depths the significant wave height changes almost linearly with water depth the ratio of significant wave height to water depth h 1 3 d for irregular waves in the surf zone is on average approximately 0 92 r 2 0 81 this value is much larger than that for regular waves this is because for regular waves the individual wave heights in the wave train are generally the same and the individual waves usually break at the same position therefore in the surf zone the waves have broken and the ratio of wave height to water depth is small however for irregular waves as the water depth on the slope decreases large waves break first and smaller waves break later therefore some subsequent smaller waves reach the breaking condition in the surf zone resulting in a higher ratio of wave height to water depth compared with regular waves although significant wave height in the surf zone is mainly controlled by water depth both parameters are not completely linear except in shallower water as shown in fig 19 therefore the relationship between the ratio of significant wave height to water depth h 1 3 d and the relative water depth d l 0 for irregular waves in the surf zone were further investigated the breaker index of normal incident irregular waves α 0 in the surf zone is shown in fig 20 in which the incipient breaker index of h b d b is also plotted for comparison this shows that as waves propagate along the slope the ratio of significant wave height to water depth h 1 3 d gradually increases with a decrease in d l 0 additionally the values of h 1 3 d increase starting from the incipient breaker index of h b d b which is consistent with the results of goda 2010 the maximum value of the breaker index of h 1 3 d is approximately 1 2 for the experimental data of normal incident irregular waves the following formula can be used to describe the growth trend in the breaker index of h 1 3 d in the surf zone 10 h 1 3 d a b log d l 0 where a 0 26 and b 0 40 r 2 0 92 obtained based on the experimental data for normal incident irregular waves a similar tendency of h 1 3 d was observed from the experimental data for oblique incident irregular waves α 15 as shown in fig 21 the fitting curve of oblique incident irregular waves based on eq 10 was also plotted and a 0 12 and b 0 49 were obtained r 2 0 89 compared with fig 20 the growth trend of h 1 3 d for oblique incident irregular waves in the surf zone was much faster than that for normal incident irregular waves the maximum value of h 1 3 d for oblique incident irregular waves was approximately 1 3 and larger than that for normal incident irregular waves fig 22 shows the breaker index of multidirectional irregular waves with s 25 40 and 75 in the surf zone the fitting curve of multidirectional irregular waves based on eq 10 was also plotted and a 0 42 and b 0 31 were obtained r 2 0 64 although the range of d l 0 was small it still indicates that the growth trend of h 1 3 d for multidirectional waves was similar with that for unidirectional irregular waves the values of h 1 3 d were identical to each other for multidirectional waves with different directional spreading parameters this may be because there were no major differences between these three directional spreading parameters as shown in fig 3 therefore further research should be performed for multidirectional waves with additional directional spreading parameters as shown in figs 20 22 the increasing tendency of h 1 3 d for unidirectional irregular waves α 0 15 and multidirectional waves with three different directional spreading parameters s 25 40 and 75 were similar the breaker index of h 1 3 d in the surf zone gradually increased from the incipient breaker index of h b d b with a decrease in d l 0 furthermore the growth trend of oblique incident irregular waves α 15 was faster than that of normal incident irregular waves α 0 and the multidirectional waves with three different directional spreading parameters the increase in the breaker index of h 1 3 d in the surf zone from the incipient breaker index of h b d b with a decrease in d l 0 can be attributed to the specific wave properties in the surf zone in fact because most of the smaller waves reach the breaking condition in the surf zone with a decrease in water depth the proportion of the breaking waves in the wave series in the surf zone should be larger than that in the defined incident breaking wave series therefore the ratio of the representative significant wave height to the water depth should be relatively larger in the surf zone concerning the increase in the breaker index of h 1 3 d with a decrease in d l 0 another reason may be because the breaker type of irregular waves changes from spilling to plunging with decreasing water depth in the surf zone which was identified with the video records 3 3 breaker indexes of individual waves for normal incident unidirectional irregular waves 3 3 1 individual waves tracked by the wave by wave method for irregular waves the wave heights and wave periods of individual waves in a wave train are different although the significant wave height is usually used to analyze irregular wave properties in fact the significant wave height cannot truly reflect the actual individual wave height similarly under the same wave height the properties of individual breaking waves in irregular wave trains are different from those of regular breaking waves therefore it is necessary to investigate the individual breaking wave height to determine irregular wave breaking characteristics since the wave gauges on the slope were densely arranged in the present experiment the wave parameters of individual waves could be tracked by the wave by wave method by observing and analyzing the original wave surface elevation records the evolution of individual waves on each wave gauge was tracked in turn the wave height and period of individual waves on each wave gauge were recorded where the maximum wave height on the slope was defined as the breaking wave height and the corresponding water depth was defined as the breaking water depth since the wave propagation direction should be consistent with the axial direction of wave gauge arrangement if the individual waves are tracked by the wave by wave method only the normal incident irregular waves α 0 are considered in this section fig 23 shows an example of the wave surface elevation for normal incident irregular waves α 0 it shows that there is a large wave group in the period of 42 60s the wave surface elevations of this wave group at different wave gauges are shown in fig 24 this reveals that individual waves with different wave heights break at different positions i e some individual waves break at no 13 wave gauge and some other individual waves break at no 16 wave gauge in addition fig 24 shows that when waves propagate into shallow water the steepness of wave profiles increase and the run up of mean water level increases markedly furthermore a total of 13 individual waves in the large wave group were tracked through the wave by wave method fig 25 presents the wave height variation in each individual wave from no 8 wave gauge to no 21 wave gauge on the slope it clearly indicates that the breaking points of individual waves are different large waves break far from the top of slope medium waves break at some distance from the top of slope and small waves break near the top of the slope due to the differences in breaking points between individual waves breaking wave height h b breaking water depth d b and breaking wavelength l b also differ the individual breaker indexes of h b d b and h b l b i e the ratios of breaking wave height to breaking water depth or breaking wavelength are defined and analyzed below the eight cases of normal incident irregular waves as shown in table 1 were considered and the large individual waves in the wave trains were tracked by the wave by wave method 40 65 individual waves in each wave train 3 3 2 individual breaker index of h b d b for large individual waves the relationship between breaking wave height and breaking water depth is shown in fig 26 here the local water depth was computed as the sum of still water depth and mean water depth over the entire wave record eq 4 proposed by mccowan 1894 for a solitary wave was also plotted for comparison this shows that most experimental points of individual waves are located above the line of eq 4 proposed by mccowan 1894 after fitting the experimental data of individual waves with eq 4 the value of k obtained was 0 85 r 2 0 40 significant wave height was used for irregular waves in kamphuis 1991 and k 0 78 r 2 0 70 was derived it should be pointed out that the coefficient k derived by kamphuis 1991 is exactly the same as that derived by mccowan 1894 however the best fit coefficient k of individual waves in the present study was larger than this the initial beach slope 1 10 in kamphuis s experiment is steeper than the slope 1 15 in the present experiment but the best fit coefficients k of eq 4 in kamphuis s experiment is smaller therefore when eq 4 was used to calculate the breaker index of h b d b the result derived by the individual wave height is larger than that derived by the significant wave height and solitary wave it should be mentioned that the wide range of h b values for a given d b value in fig 26 can be observed this indicates that the water depth is not the only factor that affects breaking wave height therefore the effect of incident wave period or wave length on the individual wave breaking process is discussed below since the relative water depths d b l 0 and d b l b can be easily converted to one another through the dispersion relationship fig 27 gives the variation of the breaker index of h b d b of individual waves with d b l 0 in fig 27 the analyzed incipient breaker index of h b d b for irregular waves and the breaking criterion proposed by goda 2010 for regular waves were also plotted for comparison this shows that the breaker index of h b d b increases with a decrease in d b l 0 and the breaker indexes of h b d b were lower than 1 5 the growth trend of h b d b for individual waves is similar to the empirical formula of goda 2010 however when d b l 0 is large goda s formula overestimates the experimental data and when d b l 0 is small goda s formula slightly underestimates the experimental data the experimental data of individual waves were fitted by eq 7 and the parameters a 3 0 092 and b 3 2 9 r 2 0 54 were obtained it can be seen from fig 27 that the fitting curve of eq 7 with appropriate coefficients could satisfactorily describe the growth trend of h b d b for individual waves and most experimental data were scattered in the area of the upper and lower bound lines corresponding to 130 and 75 of the values calculated by eq 7 with a 3 0 092 and b 3 2 9 3 3 3 individual breaker index of h b l b fig 28 shows the variation in the breaker index of h b l b for individual waves with d b l b where the analyzed incipient breaker index of h b l b for irregular waves and the breaking criterion proposed by ostendorf and madsen 1979 for regular waves were plotted for comparison it can be seen that the breaker index of d b l b increases with an increase in d b l b the growth trend of d b l b for individual waves is similar to the empirical formula of ostendorf and madsen 1979 however ostendorf and madsen s formula overestimates the experimental data when d b l b is large after fitting the experimental data of individual waves by eq 9 a 5 0 10 and b 5 1 43 r 2 0 82 were obtained the fitting curve of eq 9 with appropriate coefficients could provide a good indication of the growth trend of d b l b for individual waves most experimental data are scattered in the area of the upper and lower bound lines corresponding to 130 and 80 of the calculated values by eq 9 with a 5 0 10 and b 5 1 43 finally figs 27 and 28 show that the breaker indexes of h b d b and h b l b calculated by individual wave heights were markedly larger than the incipient breaker index calculated by significant wave height therefore it is reasonable to consider the breaker indexes derived by individual waves for coastal engineering design eq 7 proposed by goda 2010 with a 3 0 092 and b 3 2 9 and eq 9 proposed by ostendorf and madsen 1979 with a 5 0 10 and b 5 1 43 could be used to calculate the breaker indexes of individual normal incident irregular waves 4 conclusions unidirectional irregular waves with different incident angles and multidirectional irregular waves were experimentally studied since irregular waves usually break in a specific area wave breaker indexes at incipient breaking point and in the surf zone were analyzed furthermore individual breaking waves in wave trains were analyzed by the wave by wave method the following conclusions were obtained 1 incipient wave breaking was defined incipient breaker indexes represented by significant wave height of irregular waves are smaller than those of regular waves and the modified empirical formulae of regular waves with appropriate coefficients can be applied to irregular waves 2 incipient breaker indexes of oblique incident irregular waves α 15 and multidirectional waves with three different directional spreading parameters s 25 40 and 75 show a similar growth trend as that of normal incident irregular waves α 0 however incipient breaker indexes of oblique incident irregular waves are larger than those of normal incident irregular waves while wave directionality has little effect on incipient breaker indexes due to similar directional spreading 3 the breaker index ratio of significant wave height to water depth in the surf zone increases starting from the incipient breaker index with a decrease in relative water depth consistent with the findings of goda 2010 the growth trend in the breaker index of oblique incident irregular waves in the surf zone is faster than that of normal incident irregular waves and multidirectional waves 4 individual waves in the wave train with different wave heights usually break at different positions therefore breaker indexes calculated using significant wave heights cannot directly reflect the actual individual wave breaking information of individual waves was tracked by the wave by wave method breaker indexes derived by individual wave heights are larger than incipient breaker indexes derived by significant wave heights therefore it is reasonable to consider breaker indexes calculated using individual wave height for the design of coastal engineering eq 7 proposed by goda 2010 with a 3 0 092 and b 3 2 9 and eq 9 proposed by ostendorf and madsen 1979 with a 5 0 10 and b 5 1 43 can be effectively applied to calculate the breaker indexes of individual waves in normal incident irregular wave trains credit authorship contribution statement jiayi xu conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis data curation writing original draft visualization shuxue liu

21674,due to the high superstructures and complex configurations of luxury cruise ships the impacts of wind loads on the ships must be analyzed during design in this study the aerodynamic performance of a vista class cruise ship was investigated through wind tunnel measurements empirical formulae and numerical calculations wind tunnel experiments were conducted in a simulated atmospheric boundary layer wind field and the measured data exhibited reliable wind load characteristics of the cruise ship three empirical formulae were employed to estimate the wind loads on the cruise ship the comparison between the estimated results and the experimental data indicated that the general characteristics of the wind loads on generic ship types summarized by empirical formulae were not consistent with those on the vista class cruise ship numerical simulations based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations were performed under the same conditions as those of the wind tunnel experiments mesh independence and reynolds number independence analyses were carried out the numerical results of the wind loads matched well with the experimental data valuable flow field details captured by the numerical calculations were also extracted to analyze the flow characteristics around the cruise ship the results demonstrated that the vista class cruise ship is a typical blunt body the wind loads on the cruise ship were sensitive to the reynolds number the reversed flow zones around the ship were primarily distributed over the front back sides of the ship the top deck and the ship s leeward side these reversed flow zones were mostly induced by the flow separation at the corners of the bow and aft decks and the sharp edges of the top deck the analysis of the flow characteristics around the ship can provide guidance for future optimization of the aerodynamic performance of the vista class cruise ship keywords vista class cruise ship aerodynamic performance wind

process of ship form design in practice forces and moments caused by strong winds also play an important role in ships fuel consumption bialystocki and konovessis 2016 vettor et al 2018 and navigation safety jebsen and papakonstantinou 1997 briggs et al 2003 especially for ships with large windward areas such as passenger liners and container ships compared with these ship types luxury cruise ships usually have more complex configurations and higher superstructures this means that when a luxury cruise ship is at sea it will encounter stronger wind loads which can result in a significant decrease in its speed and stability therefore it is critical to assess the effects of wind loads on cruise ships during design many methods have been proposed to estimate the wind loads on ships in general the prediction approaches are mainly divided into three categories wind tunnel tests empirical formulae and computational fluid dynamics cfd calculations wind tunnel tests can obtain the most accurate and reliable results for a specific study object kang and lee 2008 andersen 2013 however experimental costs are quite large and it is difficult for wind tunnel measurements to capture sufficient flow field details due to the limitations of the experiment devices hence in many cases only wind loads are measured in the wind tunnel tests and the experimental results are employed to provide accurate benchmark data for the validation of other prediction methods viola 2009 fujiwara et al 2009 kang et al 2016 the empirical formulae of wind loads are mostly derived from regression analysis isherwood 1972 and statistical analysis blendermann 1996 of systematic wind tunnel test data and they can easily capture the general characteristics of wind forces and moments based on a ship s feature parameters and type gould 1982 haddara and soares 1999 valčić and prpić oršić 2016 nevertheless empirical formulae are not applicable to predict the wind loads on ships without geometric similarity to the sample ships from the limited wind tunnel databases unlike some generic ship types the luxury cruise ships of different companies usually have their own distinct characteristics such as different shapes positions numbers and dimensions of the chimneys open air swimming pools radar radomes and even superstructures according to previous investigations conducted by platt 1998 the flow field around the ship is dramatically influenced by the ship s configuration such as the superstructure and chimneys this implies that it could be very difficult for empirical formulae to summarize the general rule for the accurate prediction of the wind loads on cruise ships from different companies this viewpoint is preliminarily verified in section 3 moreover there are no empirical formulae that can easily evaluate the influence of a ship s floating state such as trim heel on the wind loads this also greatly limits the application of the empirical formulae in practice compared with the above two methods cfd calculations reduce the time and costs and they also allow the test conditions to be varied and provide comprehensible visualization for the analysis of the flow field details however cfd cannot easily evaluate the aerodynamics of the ships accurately the precision level of the numerical simulation depends on the reasonable application of cfd techniques such as the solver turbulence model mesh generation and computational domain in recent years researchers have attempted various cfd techniques to conduct investigations on the aerodynamics of ships collie et al 2002 investigated the upwind sailing of an america s cup class yacht using two dimensional steady calculations based on three two equation turbulence models including the standard k ε renormalization group rng k ε and realizable k ε models the realizable k ε model provided better results than the standard and rng k ε models moreover the convergence time of the rng k ε model was the longest between the three turbulence models and the realizable k ε model required only slightly more time than the standard k ε model a similar study on the downwind sail aerodynamics of the america s cup class yacht was carried out by viola 2009 in this work four turbulence models spallart almaras shear stress transport sst k ω standard k ε and realizable k ε models were tested based on 1 million and 6 5 million tetrahedral meshes the numerical results of the drag and lift were compared with the experimental results it was observed that the lift computed by the realizable k ε model was in best agreement with the experimental values and the spallart almaras model obtained the most accurate drag furthermore the turbulence models were not particularly sensitive to the mesh size for the four turbulence models the differences between the computed results for the two mesh sizes were lower than 5 forrest and owen 2010 performed a study on the structures of the air flow around the sfs2 and t23 frigates a detached eddy simulation des model with unstructured meshes was utilized in their work the computed results of the mean velocity and turbulence intensity were compared with the experimental data using the vectors and contours it was shown that the large scale flow structures around the superstructure could be adequately captured by the des method but slight differences could still be observed when analyzing the locations and orientations of separating shear layers wnęk and guedes soares 2015 applied the commercial cfd software ansys to evaluate the wind loads on the liquefied natural gas lng carrier and a floating lng platform based on the sst k ω turbulence model and three different mesh generation techniques which were cfd hexa y 5 cfd tetra no prism and cfd tetra y y 0 1 the predicted results based on the cfd tetra y technique showed the best agreement with the experimental data obtained in the wind tunnel tests it was further concluded that when a study object contained too many geometric details it was reasonable to utilize tetrahedral meshes due to their high mesh quality for meshing complex geometric shapes in addition prismatic meshes on the surface of the study object were also helpful for improving the prediction accuracy of the numerical calculation janssen et al 2017 performed a numerical calculation of wind loads on a container ship employing the realizable k ε turbulence model and structured meshes to explore the effects of geometric simplifications on wind loads in their study the wind loads on four different simplified geometric models from a simple rectangular box to a highly detailed ship model were calculated the average absolute difference between the simulated results of the simplified models and measured results of the original model ranged from 37 9 for a simple box shaped ship to only 5 9 for the most detailed ship finally it was concluded that excessive geometric simplifications could lead to significantly different simulated wind loads even though the frontal and lateral projected areas of the simplified models were similar to that of the original ship as stated above wind tunnel tests empirical formulae and cfd calculations have their own advantages and have been widely applied to investigate the aerodynamic performances of various generic ship types for various academic purposes however to the best of our knowledge studies on the aerodynamic performances of luxury cruise ships have been rarely reported to conduct a thorough study on the aerodynamic performance of a vista class cruise ship three estimation approaches were used together in this study the wind tunnel test data showed reliable wind load characteristics of the cruise ship and the test data were also applied as benchmark data for the validation of the empirical formulae and numerical calculations the empirical formulae were used to analyze whether the wind load characteristics of the vista class cruise ship were similar to those of generic ship types by the comparison between the experimental data and estimated results numerical calculations were employed to capture the flow field details around the cruise ship and provide guidance for future optimization of the aerodynamic performance of the cruise ship the outline of this paper is as follows in section 2 the geometric features of the vista class cruise ship and the wind tunnel experiment setup including the experimental equipment schemes and results are presented in section 3 the basic theories of three empirical formulae of wind loads are briefly described a comparison between the estimated results of the empirical formulae and wind tunnel experimental data is presented and the applicability of the empirical formulae to the prediction of wind loads on vista class cruise ship is analyzed in section 4 the details of the numerical methods including the solver computational domain boundary conditions and mesh generation technique are presented mesh independence and reynolds number independence analyses were conducted moreover the prediction accuracy of the cfd calculations was also verified by comparing the numerical results with the wind tunnel experimental data the flow field details captured by cfd calculations are shown in section 5 and the flow characteristics around the cruise ship are discussed the key results of this study are summarized in section 6 2 wind tunnel experiment 2 1 target model a vista class cruise ship with a capacity of 4977 passengers was selected as the study object and almost all the geometric details including lifeboats waterslides antennas radar radomes handrails and masts were installed on the hull and superstructure only wind loads on the cruise ship were measured in this wind tunnel test and thus only the superstructure and the hull above the waterline were modeled the scale ratio of the experimental model was 1 270 the material was abs engineering plastic and the geometrical tolerance of the model was within 1 mm the experimental model is shown in fig 1 and its geometric characteristics are listed in table 1 2 2 experiment equipment the model test was performed in the versatile wind tunnel at shanghai jiao tong university sjtu as shown in fig 2 the test section of the wind tunnel had dimensions of 14 m length 6 0 m width 3 5 m height and the maximum attainable wind velocity was 20 m s wind angles ranging from 0 to 360 could be obtained by adjusting the rotation angle of the turntable moreover spires and ground roughness elements were equipped on the entrance region of the test section to simulate the atmospheric boundary layer over the ocean different velocity profiles could be successfully simulated by changing the heights of the ground roughness elements for this wind tunnel test the maximum blockage ratio was only 0 79 in beam wind see fig 3 which indicated that this model test could avoid the blocking effect barlow et al 1999 asce 2012 which suggested that the maximum blockage ratio was 5 for the wind tunnel experiments the wind load tests employed a six component balance with the measurement range of 70 n 7 n m whose limit bias was 0 05 the velocity profile was captured by the pitot tubes and an electronic pressure gauge whose limit bias was 0 01 the measurement equipment are shown in fig 4 2 3 coordinate system a right handed co rotational coordinate system was fixed at the center point o of the hull and the point o was located at the intersection of the longitudinal centerline transverse centerline and the waterline plane of the hull the positive directions of the x y z axes were defined base on the ittc s guidelines international towing tank conference 1993 as illustrated in fig 5 in this wind tunnel tests only the longitudinal wind force f x transverse wind force f y and yawing moment m z were measured 2 4 velocity profile in the atmospheric boundary layer the wind velocity v w varies with the elevation h above the ocean and the natural velocity gradient is usually expressed as follows 1 v w v 0 h h 0 α where v 0 is the wind velocity at the reference elevation h 0 which is usually 10 m above the ocean at full scale and α is the exponent of the wind velocity profile which is usually between 0 11 and 0 14 for the velocity profiles over the ocean norwegian maritime directory 1997 based on the 1 270 scale of the experimental model the reference elevation h 0 was converted from 10 m at full scale to 0 037 m at model scale in this model test the velocity profile α 0 125 was simulated and the wind velocities of points ranging from 2 to 70 cm above the center of the turntable see fig 5 were measured by the pitot tubes and the electronic pressure gauge the non dimensional velocity profile v w v 0 is shown in fig 6 where v 0 was 11 834 m s 2 5 reynolds number strictly speaking wind tunnel tests must satisfy the dynamic similarity principle the reynolds number re at the model scale should be equal or approximate to that at full scale however in practice the dynamic similarity principle is very hard to achieve due to the requirement of an extremely high wind velocity hence prior to the wind tunnel tests researchers usually must investigate a critical reynolds number range for a specific study object when re at the model scale exceeds this critical range the measured wind load coefficients will be insensitive to re andersen 2013 investigated the critical reynolds number for a post panamax container ship by wind tunnel tests the experimental data at different values of re showed that when re was more than 1 25 106 the wind load coefficients were constant in his study the reynolds number was defined as follows 2 r e u l p p ν where u is the wind velocity in the middle of the wind tunnel l pp is the length between perpendiculars and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the air nevertheless some researchers have a different view on the sensitivity of the reynolds number they regard the ship as a blunt body with many sharp edges healey 1992 where flow separation always occurs in its wake according to the many experiments conducted by prandtl and tietjens 1934 and farquarson 1950 the bluff bodies with sharp edges are usually insensitive to the re as long as the re is more than 104 therefore reynolds number independence analyses were omitted in the studies of these researchers forrest and owen 2010 janssen et al 2017 bardera et al 2019 as a rarely reported ship type there have been no investigations on the aerodynamic performances of luxury cruise ships to use as a reference to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the aerodynamics of the vista class cruise ship it is essential to conduct a reynolds number independence analysis unfortunately due to the limitations of the maximum wind velocity in the sjtu wind tunnel and the characteristic length of the geometric model the maximum attainable re in this study was only 1 41 106 which was inconvenient for the experimental investigation of the critical re of the cruise ship consequently a re value 1 28 106 close to the maximum re was firstly utilized in the wind tunnel tests and then a reynolds number independence analysis was conducted by cfd calculations as presented in section 4 2 6 test conditions and experimental results in these wind tunnel experiments the longitudinal wind force f x transverse wind force f y and yawing moment m z were measured at wind angles from 0 to 360 at 15 intervals the cruise ship was strictly symmetric with respect to its longitudinal centerline hence the data measured on the port and starboard were averaged this step was applied to eliminate the influences of slight asymmetry in the model making process and the minor non homogeneity of the velocity profiles in the wind tunnel the measured wind forces and moments are shown in fig 7 the longitudinal force f x had maximum values at wind angles of 15 and 165 and two local extreme values at wind angles of 60 and 120 were evident the transverse force f y had maximum values at wind angles of 60 and 120 and a distinctive local extreme value at a wind angle of 90 the yawing moment m z had maximum values at wind angles of 45 and 135 moreover f x was a small force component compared with f y and f x and m z were of the same order of magnitude the wind tunnel test data were used as the benchmark data for the validation of the empirical formulae and numerical calculations in the following study hence the measured wind loads are presented in non dimensional forms as shown in fig 8 the longitudinal force coefficient c x transverse force coefficient c y and yawing moment coefficient c n are defined as follows 3 c x f x 1 2 ρ u 2 a f 4 c y f y 1 2 ρ u 2 a l 5 c n m z 1 2 ρ u 2 a l l o a where ρ is the air density u is the average wind velocity experienced by the superstructure a f is the frontal projected area of the superstructure and hull above the waterline and a l is the lateral projected area of the superstructure and hull above the waterline a f and a l are fixed values which are not affected by the wind angle in this study the values of a f and a l were 0 026 and 0 165 m2 respectively 3 empirical formulae 3 1 basic theories of empirical formulae many researchers haddara and soares 1999 fujiwara et al 2009 wnęk and guedes soares 2015 have proven that the wind load characteristics summarized by empirical formulae isherwood 1972 blendermann 1994 fujiwara et al 2005 are applicable to most generic ship types however applicability studies on some special ships such as aircraft carriers luxury cruise ships and icebreakers have been rarely reported in this study three empirical formulae were used to predict the wind load coefficients on the vista class cruise ship isherwood 1972 developed expressions of the wind load coefficients by the multiple linear regression analysis of early published wind tunnel experiment results the wind force and moment coefficients were obtained depending on the main features of the superstructure and hull above the waterline the specific equations are as follows 6 c x θ a 0 a 1 2 a l l o a 2 a 2 2 a f b 2 a 3 2 l o a b a 4 s l o a a

where s is the perimeter of the lateral projected plane of the superstructure and hull above the waterline c is the longitudinal distance between the centroid of the lateral projected plane and the bow m is the number of the pillars and masts in the lateral projected plane and a ss is the lateral projected area of the superstructure a 0 a 6 b 0 b 6 c 0 c 5 are constant coefficients that must be determined through regression analysis of the wind tunnel experiment results these constant coefficients have unique values at different wind angles blendermann 1994 proposed expressions of the wind load coefficients using statistical analysis of the systematic wind tunnel experimental data collected by aage 1971 and blendermann 1993 these expressions specified in equations 9 11 are functions of the frontal projected area of the superstructure and the hull above the waterline a f the lateral projected area of the superstructure and the hull above the waterline a l the wind angle θ the longitudinal distance between the centroid of the lateral projected plane and the mid section of the hull s l and three constant coefficients cd af cd t and δ which were obtained by the statistical analysis of the experimental data this empirical formula is applicable to a wide variety of ship types and configurations but the values of cd af cd t and δ vary for different ship types in this study the expressions which are applicable to the prediction of the wind loads on the passenger liner were used 9 c x c d a f cos θ 1 δ 2 1 c d a f c d t a f a l sin 2 2 θ 10 c y c d t sin θ 1 δ 2 1 c d a f

wind loads consisted of longitudinal flow drag cross flow drag lift and induced drag as shown in fig 9 the explicit expressions are as follows 12 c x c l f cos θ c x l i sin θ 1 2 sin θ cos 2 θ sin θ

by the regression analysis of the experimental data which consisted of the wind tunnel test results from 71 sample ships and c is the longitudinal distance between the centroid of the lateral projected plane of the superstructure and hull above the waterline and the mid section of the hull in equation 12 the first term represents the component of the longitudinal flow drag the second term represents the component of the lift and induced drag and the third term is the correction term of the equation in equation 13 the first term represents the component of the cross flow drag and the second term represents the component of the lift and induced drag 3 2 validation of empirical formulae fig 10 shows the comparison between the wind tunnel experimental data and the computed values of three empirical formulae overall the values of c y predicted by three empirical formulae achieved a perfect match with the experimental data and the predicted values for c n exhibited consistent variation tendency with the experimental data however significant discrepancies were found between the predicted and experimental results for c x the c x values measured in the wind tunnel experiments had two additional local extreme values at wind angles of 60 and 120 but this data feature was not clearly reflected in the results predicted using the three empirical formulae to present the prediction accuracies of three empirical formulae more intuitively the prediction errors of the empirical formulae were calculated as follows 15 r e r r o r i 1 n e i p i e i n 100 where n is the number of the wind angles used in the wind tunnel tests e i is the experimental value at the i th wind angle p i is the value predicted using the empirical formula at the i th wind angle fig 11 shows that the estimation method proposed by fujiwara et al was more accurate than the other two empirical formulae and its prediction errors for c x c y and c n were 49 73 12 76 and 23 73 respectively fujiwara et al 2005 presented the precision level of his proposed empirical formula for various generic ship types in graphical form where the prediction errors for c x c y and c n were in the range of 10 15 less than 10 and less than 20 respectively these results demonstrate that the wind load characteristics summarized by this empirical formula were not completely consistent with that of the vista class cruise ship especially the characteristics for c x therefore these formulae are not suitable for the accurate prediction of wind loads on the vista class cruise ship 4 numerical simulation 4 1 geometric model to ensure high fidelity of the numerical calculations only a few small details including the masts handrails and waterslides which would not have a significant impact on the calculated results were omitted to improve the mesh quality in the following work the entire geometric model of the vista class cruise ship is shown in fig 12 4 2 numerical methods the commercial cfd software star ccm was employed to carry out the numerical simulations the three dimensional incompressible viscous flow field was solved based on the steady continuity equation and the rans equations the realizable k ε turbulence model shih et al 1995 was utilized for the closure of the rans equations the second order upwind scheme was applied for the convective discretization pressure velocity coupling equations were solved by the simplec algorithm the numerical computational domain and boundary conditions are depicted in fig 13 the total length of the computational domain was set to 9 m 7 5 l oa where the distances from the inlet to the bow and from the stern to the outlet were 3l oa and 3 5l oa respectively the width and height of the computational domain were the same as that of the sjtu wind tunnel which were 6 0 m width 3 5 m height the inlet of the computational domain was set as a velocity inlet and the inlet velocity was consistent with the wind velocity profile α 0 125 of the model test to make sure that the velocity profile remained unchanged as it flowed downstream the top and bottom of the domain were set as slip walls moreover since the maximum blockage ratio of this wind tunnel test was only 0 79 which means that boundary layers near the side walls of the wind tunnel had a very small influence on the distribution of the flow field around the ship model therefore the side walls were treated as symmetry planes to ignore the influence of the boundary layers near the side walls a pressure outlet boundary condition was used for the outlet of the computational domain the hull and superstructure were set as non slip walls the following numerical simulations were only performed at wind angles from 0 to 180 at 15 intervals due to the strict symmetry of the geometric model of the cruise ship in this study the convergence levels of all of the computed cases were satisfactory the residuals could decrease more than 3 4 orders of magnitude even for cases at wind angles with massive flow separation for most wind angles the computed wind loads could remain stationary after 5000 iterations small fluctuations of the computed results could be found for several cases at wind angles with massive flow separation under these conditions the results of the last 1000 iterations were averaged as the computed wind loads 4 3 mesh independence analysis the trimmer meshing model was applied for the mesh generation in this study several box control volumes were inserted around several geometrical details of the cruise ship such as lifeboats balconies chimney and spherical radomes for local mesh refinement three levels of cylinder control volumes were generated in the vicinity of the hull and superstructure to make sure that the captured flow field details had sufficient accuracy moreover eight layers of prism meshes with a growth rate of 1 05 were distributed on the surface of the hull and superstructure and the non dimensional wall distance y was set to less than 1 furthermore the mesh density usually has a considerable influence on the accuracy of numerical results fig 8 shows that the values of cx cy and c n at a wind angle of 120 had the highest order of magnitude compared with those at all other wind angles if the case θ 120 was employed to conduct the mesh independence analysis the convergence trends of the computed results with surface mesh density would be the clearest therefore the mesh independence analysis at a wind angle of 120 was conducted by adjusting the surface mesh size using the ship s overall length l oa as the basic size a total of five sets of meshes were generated based on the different surface mesh sizes the numerical results based on five sets of meshes are illustrated in table 2 and fig 14 as shown in fig 14 when the surface mesh size was adjusted from 0 035l oa to 0 025l oa the calculation accuracy was not significantly improved considering the numerical calculation s cost and accuracy the following cfd calculations used the third set of meshes the details of which are shown in figs 15 and 16 4 4 reynolds number independence analysis in this study the reynolds number independence analysis at a wind angle of 120 was performed using the third set of meshes the wind load coefficients for different re values ranging from 5 104 to 2 5 106 are illustrated in fig 17 fig 17 shows that the wind load coefficients on the vista class cruise ship were sensitive to the re when re exceeded 1 0 106 the wind load coefficients became constant this proved that the re utilized in the previous model test was reasonable therefore the following numerical calculations were also performed at the same reynolds number re 1 28 106 4 5 validation of numerical method fig 18 shows a comparison between the wind tunnel experimental data and computed results the results of the numerical calculations matched well with the experimental data the prediction errors for c x c y and c n were 10 81 3 43 and 8 59 respectively greater errors appeared in the predicted values for c x and c n than that for c y one important reason for this was that f x and m z were quite small at most wind angles see fig 7 and slight deviations caused by the geometric simplifications and complex flow fields could result in large relative errors similar conclusions were drawn by wnęk and guedes soares 2015 nonetheless it could be still concluded that the numerical calculation had high precision for the prediction of wind loads on the vista class cruise ship as a result the flow field details captured by the numerical simulations were also employed for the subsequent analysis 5 results and discussion 5 1 components of wind forces and moments the drag experienced by a body in a fluid are composed of viscous and pressure drag as a general rule the main contributor to drag on a blunt body is pressure drag based on the results predicted by the cfd calculations the components of the wind forces and moments on the vista class cruise ship are illustrated in fig 19 the magnitudes of the transverse wind force f y and yawing moment m z at wind angles of 0 and 180 were both zero thus the components of f y and m z are only listed at wind angles from 15 to 165 fig 19 shows that the wind loads on the vista class cruise ship were almost exclusively composed of the pressure drag moment the average proportions of the pressure drag moment for f x f y and m z at all wind angles were 87 51 99 58 and 99 01 this result reflects that the vista class cruise ship is a blunt body and the characteristics of the blunt body in the lateral view are more significant than those in the longitudinal view 5 2 flow patterns around ship the reason that the pressure drag was a principle contributor to the drag on a bluff body is the occurrence of flow separation in the boundary layer and the formation of reversed flow zones at the rear of the body larose and auteuil 2006 naturally it is interesting to explore the flow patterns around the vista class cruise ship to present the flow patterns around the cruise ship more intuitively the streamline diagrams around the ship are depicted as shown in fig 22 due to the strict symmetry of the cruise ship only the streamline distribution at wind angles from 0 to 180 were calculated the starboard side of the hull was defined as the windward side the port side of the hull was defined as the leeward side and the definition of the wind angles is illustrated in fig 20 moreover to make sure that the terminologies utilized to describe the cruise ship s structures are easy to be understood the general arrangement for the vista class cruise ship is also depicted in fig 21 fig 22 reveals that the shapes and dimensions of the wakes around the cruise ship were related to the wind angle when the wind angle was 0 streamlines extended smoothly along the cruise ship s longitudinal direction and then slight flow separation occurred at the corners of the aft deck as the air flowed downstream this led to the formation of two small scale symmetric reversed flow zones at the rear of the ship when the wind angle was between 15 and 60 flow separation was evident at the corners of the bow and aft decks and two asymmetric separated flows also appeared at the cruise ship s leeward side here the separated flow from the corners of the bow deck can be regarded as a longitudinal trailing vortex and its size was significantly larger than that from the corners of the aft deck when the wind angle was 75 the separated flow from the corners of the bow deck reattached on the surface of the cruise ship forming a d shape recirculation bubble in the beam wind two symmetric recirculation zones formed at the ship s leeward side and they rotated in opposite directions as the wind angle continued to change from 105 to 165 the variation trends of the wakes around the cruise ship were similar to those at wind angles from 75 to 15 when the wind angle was 180 a small scale reversed flow zone firstly formed at the rear of the ship and then two small scale symmetric separated flows appeared at the front side of the cruise ship as the air flowed downstream in addition the wind over deck wod forrest and owen 2010 bardera et al 2019 conditions were also quite significant when the wind moved over the top deck of the superstructure massive flow separation firstly occurred at the sharp edges of the top deck and then the flow structures exhibited drastic changes under the influence of some isolated elements on the top deck such as the chimney open air swimming pool 1 and 2 and radar domes at almost all wind angles vortices were found inside the chimney and open air swimming pool 1 and 2 based on the above analysis it was concluded that reversed flow zones around the cruise ship were primarily induced by the flow separation at the corners of the bow deck aft deck and the edges of the top deck if the corner radii of the bow and aft decks were adjusted appropriately and the edges of top deck were chamfered properly it could be beneficial for the pressure drag reduction of the vista class cruise ship 5 3 pressure distribution the pressure drag was a main contributor to wind loads on the vista class cruise ship therefore the pressure distribution on the cruise ship s surface was also a valuable flow field detail fig 23 shows the pressure coefficient distribution on the cruise ship s surface at wind angles from 0 to 180 the pressure coefficient is defined as follows 16 c p p p 0 1 2 ρ u 0 2 where p is the absolute pressure on the cruise ship s surface p 0 is the atmospheric pressure and u 0 is the wind velocity in the far field there are two columns in fig 23 the left column a shows the pressure distribution on the windward side of the cruise ship and the right column b shows the pressure distribution on the leeward side in the color bar the colors darker than light yellow including light yellow correspond to the negative pressure zone fig 23 a shows that the longitudinal position of the maximum positive pressure zone along the hull was highly consistent with the direction of the oncoming flow as the wind angle changed from 0 to 180 the position of maximum pressure zone also moved from the bow to the stern in contrast in fig 23 b the position of the minimum negative pressure zone was not related to the wind angle when the wind angle was less than 90 the minimum pressure zone was always at the corners of the bow deck when the wind angle was more than 90 the minimum pressure zone was always at the corners of the aft deck in the beam wind the minimum pressure zones were present at both corners of the bow and aft decks moreover fig 23 b shows that the positions and dimensions of the negative pressure zones on the ship s leeward side were associated closely with those of the separated flows around the ship see fig 22 meanwhile the open air zone on the top deck was mainly dominated by the negative pressure at most wind angles ranging from 30 to 150 these were attributed to the following the positive pressure on the ship s surface was directly caused by the air flow shock while the negative pressure was induced by the flow separation around the ship hence the above observations were predictable furthermore the extrema of the pressure coefficients on the surface of cruise ship at variant wind angles are also listed in fig 24 it can be seen that the maximum pressure coefficients did not present the distinctive characteristics and the maximum pressure coefficients at all wind angles were always about 1 while the variation trends of the minimum pressure coefficients at different wind angles were similar to those of transverse wind force coefficients see fig 8 this seemed to imply some incomprehensible relations between them 6 conclusions the investigations on the aerodynamic performances of various generic ship types have been widely performed via three estimation methods wind tunnel measurements empirical formulae and numerical calculations however to the best of our knowledge studies on the aerodynamic performance of luxury cruise ships have been rarely reported to date to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the aerodynamics of the vista class cruise ship wind tunnel measurements empirical formulae and numerical calculations were used together in this study the wind tunnel experiments were carried out in a simulated atmospheric boundary layer the measured data presented reliable wind load characteristics of the cruise ship three common empirical formulae were used to analyze whether the wind load characteristics of the vista class cruise ship were similar to those of generic ship types numerical calculations were employed to capture the flow field details around the cruise ship and analyze the flow characteristics around the ship and the prediction accuracy of the cfd calculations was also verified by comparing the wind tunnel experimental data with the numerical results based on the above work conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the prediction errors of the empirical formulae for the wind load coefficients on the vista class cruise ship were far greater than those on the generic ship types which proved that the wind load characteristics summarized by the empirical formulae were not completely consistent with those on the cruise ship hence these empirical formulae are not applicable for the accurate prediction of the wind loads on the vista class cruise ship 2 compared with empirical formulae cfd calculations showed the higher precision levels for the prediction of wind loads on the vista class cruise ship at various wind angles 3 the vista class cruise ship could be regarded as a blunt body with many sharp edges based on the components of the drags and its exterior shapes however the wind load coefficients on the cruise ship were still sensitive to the reynolds number and the critical reynolds number was up to 1 0 106 4 the flow separation zones around the ship were mainly distributed in three regions the front and back sides of the ship and the ship s leeward side the positions and dimensions of these flow separation zones were related to the wind angles 5 the wind over deck condition of the vista class cruise ship was quite significant when air flowed over the top deck of the superstructure the flow structures exhibited the dramatic changes under the influence of some isolated elements on the top deck such as the chimney open air swimming pool and radar radomes 6 massive flow separation always occurred in the corners of the bow and aft decks and the edges of the top deck if the corner radii of the bow and aft decks were adjusted appropriately and the edges of top deck were chamfered properly it could be beneficial for the drag reduction of the vista class cruise ship at present the design of this vista class cruise ship is still in the early stage the analysis of the flow characteristics around the ship can provide guidance for future optimization of the aerodynamic performance of the cruise ship credit authorship contribution statement penghui wang

21674,due to the high superstructures and complex configurations of luxury cruise ships the impacts of wind loads on the ships must be analyzed during design in this study the aerodynamic performance of a vista class cruise ship was investigated through wind tunnel measurements empirical formulae and numerical calculations wind tunnel experiments were conducted in a simulated atmospheric boundary layer wind field and the measured data exhibited reliable wind load characteristics of the cruise ship three empirical formulae were employed to estimate the wind loads on the cruise ship the comparison between the estimated results and the experimental data indicated that the general characteristics of the wind loads on generic ship types summarized by empirical formulae were not consistent with those on the vista class cruise ship numerical simulations based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations were performed under the same conditions as those of the wind tunnel experiments mesh independence and reynolds number independence analyses were carried out the numerical results of the wind loads matched well with the experimental data valuable flow field details captured by the numerical calculations were also extracted to analyze the flow characteristics around the cruise ship the results demonstrated that the vista class cruise ship is a typical blunt body the wind loads on the cruise ship were sensitive to the reynolds number the reversed flow zones around the ship were primarily distributed over the front back sides of the ship the top deck and the ship s leeward side these reversed flow zones were mostly induced by the flow separation at the corners of the bow and aft decks and the sharp edges of the top deck the analysis of the flow

process of ship form design in practice forces and moments caused by strong winds also play an important role in ships fuel consumption bialystocki and konovessis 2016 vettor et al 2018 and navigation safety jebsen and papakonstantinou 1997 briggs et al 2003 especially for ships with large windward areas such as passenger liners and container ships compared with these ship types luxury cruise ships usually have more complex configurations and higher superstructures this means that when a luxury cruise ship is at sea it will encounter stronger wind loads which can result in a significant decrease in its speed and stability therefore it is critical to assess the effects of wind loads on cruise ships during design many methods have been proposed to estimate the wind loads on ships in general the prediction approaches are mainly divided into three categories wind tunnel tests empirical formulae and computational fluid dynamics cfd calculations wind tunnel tests can obtain the most accurate and reliable results for a specific study object kang and lee 2008 andersen 2013 however experimental costs are quite large and it is difficult for wind tunnel measurements to capture sufficient flow field details due to the limitations of the experiment devices hence in many cases only wind loads are measured in the wind tunnel tests and the experimental results are employed to provide accurate benchmark data for the validation of other prediction methods viola 2009 fujiwara et al 2009 kang et al 2016 the empirical formulae of wind loads are mostly derived from regression analysis isherwood 1972 and statistical analysis blendermann 1996 of systematic wind tunnel test data and they can easily capture the general characteristics of wind forces and moments based on a ship s feature parameters and type gould 1982 haddara and soares 1999 valčić and prpić oršić 2016 nevertheless empirical formulae are not applicable to predict the wind loads on ships without geometric similarity to the sample ships from the limited wind tunnel databases unlike some generic ship types the luxury cruise ships of different companies usually have their own distinct characteristics such as different shapes positions numbers and dimensions of the chimneys open air swimming pools radar radomes and even superstructures according to previous investigations conducted by platt 1998 the flow field around the ship is dramatically influenced by the ship s configuration such as the superstructure and chimneys this implies that it could be very difficult for empirical formulae to summarize the general rule for the accurate prediction of the wind loads on cruise ships from different companies this viewpoint is preliminarily verified in section 3 moreover there are no empirical formulae that can easily evaluate the influence of a ship s floating state such as trim heel on the wind loads this also greatly limits the application of the empirical formulae in practice compared with the above two methods cfd calculations reduce the time and costs and they also allow the test conditions to be varied and provide comprehensible visualization for the analysis of the flow field details however cfd cannot easily evaluate the aerodynamics of the ships accurately the precision level of the numerical simulation depends on the reasonable application of cfd techniques such as the solver turbulence model mesh generation and computational domain in recent years researchers have attempted various cfd techniques to conduct investigations on the aerodynamics of ships collie et al 2002 investigated the upwind sailing of an america s cup class yacht using two dimensional steady calculations based on three two equation turbulence models including the standard k ε renormalization group rng k ε and realizable k ε models the realizable k ε model provided better results than the standard and rng k ε models moreover the convergence time of the rng k ε model was the longest between the three turbulence models and the realizable k ε model required only slightly more time than the standard k ε model a similar study on the downwind sail aerodynamics of the america s cup class yacht was carried out by viola 2009 in this work four turbulence models spallart almaras shear stress transport sst k ω standard k ε and realizable k ε models were tested based on 1 million and 6 5 million tetrahedral meshes the numerical results of the drag and lift were compared with the experimental results it was observed that the lift computed by the realizable k ε model was in best agreement with the experimental values and the spallart almaras model obtained the most accurate drag furthermore the turbulence models were not particularly sensitive to the mesh size for the four turbulence models the differences between the computed results for the two mesh sizes were lower than 5 forrest and owen 2010 performed a study on the structures of the air flow around the sfs2 and t23 frigates a detached eddy simulation des model with unstructured meshes was utilized in their work the computed results of the mean velocity and turbulence intensity were compared with the experimental data using the vectors and contours it was shown that the large scale flow structures around the superstructure could be adequately captured by the des method but slight differences could still be observed when analyzing the locations and orientations of separating shear layers wnęk and guedes soares 2015 applied the commercial cfd software ansys to evaluate the wind loads on the liquefied natural gas lng carrier and a floating lng platform based on the sst k ω turbulence model and three different mesh generation techniques which were cfd hexa y 5 cfd tetra no prism and cfd tetra y y 0 1 the predicted results based on the cfd tetra y technique showed the best agreement with the experimental data obtained in the wind tunnel tests it was further concluded that when a study object contained too many geometric details it was reasonable to utilize tetrahedral meshes due to their high mesh quality for meshing complex geometric shapes in addition prismatic meshes on the surface of the study object were also helpful for improving the prediction accuracy of the numerical calculation janssen et al 2017 performed a numerical calculation of wind loads on a container ship employing the realizable k ε turbulence model and structured meshes to explore the effects of geometric simplifications on wind loads in their study the wind loads on four different simplified geometric models from a simple rectangular box to a highly detailed ship model were calculated the average absolute difference between the simulated results of the simplified models and measured results of the original model ranged from 37 9 for a simple box shaped ship to only 5 9 for the most detailed ship finally it was concluded that excessive geometric simplifications could lead to significantly different simulated wind loads even though the frontal and lateral projected areas of the simplified models were similar to that of the original ship as stated above wind tunnel tests empirical formulae and cfd calculations have their own advantages and have been widely applied to investigate the aerodynamic performances of various generic ship types for various academic purposes however to the best of our knowledge studies on the aerodynamic performances of luxury cruise ships have been rarely reported to conduct a thorough study on the aerodynamic performance of a vista class cruise ship three estimation approaches were used together in this study the wind tunnel test data showed reliable wind load characteristics of the cruise ship and the test data were also applied as benchmark data for the validation of the empirical formulae and numerical calculations the empirical formulae were used to analyze whether the wind load characteristics of the vista class cruise ship were similar to those of generic ship types by the comparison between the experimental data and estimated results numerical calculations were employed to capture the flow field details around the cruise ship and provide guidance for future optimization of the aerodynamic performance of the cruise ship the outline of this paper is as follows in section 2 the geometric features of the vista class cruise ship and the wind tunnel experiment setup including the experimental equipment schemes and results are presented in section 3 the basic theories of three empirical formulae of wind loads are briefly described a comparison between the estimated results of the empirical formulae and wind tunnel experimental data is presented and the applicability of the empirical formulae to the prediction of wind loads on vista class cruise ship is analyzed in section 4 the details of the numerical methods including the solver computational domain boundary conditions and mesh generation technique are presented mesh independence and reynolds number independence analyses were conducted moreover the prediction accuracy of the cfd calculations was also verified by comparing the numerical results with the wind tunnel experimental data the flow field details captured by cfd calculations are shown in section 5 and the flow characteristics around the cruise ship are discussed the key results of this study are summarized in section 6 2 wind tunnel experiment 2 1 target model a vista class cruise ship with a capacity of 4977 passengers was selected as the study object and almost all the geometric details including lifeboats waterslides antennas radar radomes handrails and masts were installed on the hull and superstructure only wind loads on the cruise ship were measured in this wind tunnel test and thus only the superstructure and the hull above the waterline were modeled the scale ratio of the experimental model was 1 270 the material was abs engineering plastic and the geometrical tolerance of the model was within 1 mm the experimental model is shown in fig 1 and its geometric characteristics are listed in table 1 2 2 experiment equipment the model test was performed in the versatile wind tunnel at shanghai jiao tong university sjtu as shown in fig 2 the test section of the wind tunnel had dimensions of 14 m length 6 0 m width 3 5 m height and the maximum attainable wind velocity was 20 m s wind angles ranging from 0 to 360 could be obtained by adjusting the rotation angle of the turntable moreover spires and ground roughness elements were equipped on the entrance region of the test section to simulate the atmospheric boundary layer over the ocean different velocity profiles could be successfully simulated by changing the heights of the ground roughness elements for this wind tunnel test the maximum blockage ratio was only 0 79 in beam wind see fig 3 which indicated that this model test could avoid the blocking effect barlow et al 1999 asce 2012 which suggested that the maximum blockage ratio was 5 for the wind tunnel experiments the wind load tests employed a six component balance with the measurement range of 70 n 7 n m whose limit bias was 0 05 the velocity profile was captured by the pitot tubes and an electronic pressure gauge whose limit bias was 0 01 the measurement equipment are shown in fig 4 2 3 coordinate system a right handed co rotational coordinate system was fixed at the center point o of the hull and the point o was located at the intersection of the longitudinal centerline transverse centerline and the waterline plane of the hull the positive directions of the x y z axes were defined base on the ittc s guidelines international towing tank conference 1993 as illustrated in fig 5 in this wind tunnel tests only the longitudinal wind force f x transverse wind force f y and yawing moment m z were measured 2 4 velocity profile in the atmospheric boundary layer the wind velocity v w varies with the elevation h above the ocean and the natural velocity gradient is usually expressed as follows 1 v w v 0 h h 0 α where v 0 is the wind velocity at the reference elevation h 0 which is usually 10 m above the ocean at full scale and α is the exponent of the wind velocity profile which is usually between 0 11 and 0 14 for the velocity profiles over the ocean norwegian maritime directory 1997 based on the 1 270 scale of the experimental model the reference elevation h 0 was converted from 10 m at full scale to 0 037 m at model scale in this model test the velocity profile α 0 125 was simulated and the wind velocities of points ranging from 2 to 70 cm above the center of the turntable see fig 5 were measured by the pitot tubes and the electronic pressure gauge the non dimensional velocity profile v w v 0 is shown in fig 6 where v 0 was 11 834 m s 2 5 reynolds number strictly speaking wind tunnel tests must satisfy the dynamic similarity principle the reynolds number re at the model scale should be equal or approximate to that at full scale however in practice the dynamic similarity principle is very hard to achieve due to the requirement of an extremely high wind velocity hence prior to the wind tunnel tests researchers usually must investigate a critical reynolds number range for a specific study object when re at the model scale exceeds this critical range the measured wind load coefficients will be insensitive to re andersen 2013 investigated the critical reynolds number for a post panamax container ship by wind tunnel tests the experimental data at different values of re showed that when re was more than 1 25 106 the wind load coefficients were constant in his study the reynolds number was defined as follows 2 r e u l p p ν where u is the wind velocity in the middle of the wind tunnel l pp is the length between perpendiculars and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the air nevertheless some researchers have a different view on the sensitivity of the reynolds number they regard the ship as a blunt body with many sharp edges healey 1992 where flow separation always occurs in its wake according to the many experiments conducted by prandtl and tietjens 1934 and farquarson 1950 the bluff bodies with sharp edges are usually insensitive to the re as long as the re is more than 104 therefore reynolds number independence analyses were omitted in the studies of these researchers forrest and owen 2010 janssen et al 2017 bardera et al 2019 as a rarely reported ship type there have been no investigations on the aerodynamic performances of luxury cruise ships to use as a reference to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the aerodynamics of the vista class cruise ship it is essential to conduct a reynolds number independence analysis unfortunately due to the limitations of the maximum wind velocity in the sjtu wind tunnel and the characteristic length of the geometric model the maximum attainable re in this study was only 1 41 106 which was inconvenient for the experimental investigation of the critical re of the cruise ship consequently a re value 1 28 106 close to the maximum re was firstly utilized in the wind tunnel tests and then a reynolds number independence analysis was conducted by cfd calculations as presented in section 4 2 6 test conditions and experimental results in these wind tunnel experiments the longitudinal wind force f x transverse wind force f y and yawing moment m z were measured at wind angles from 0 to 360 at 15 intervals the cruise ship was strictly symmetric with respect to its longitudinal centerline hence the data measured on the port and starboard were averaged this step was applied to eliminate the influences of slight asymmetry in the model making process and the minor non homogeneity of the velocity profiles in the wind tunnel the measured wind forces and moments are shown in fig 7 the longitudinal force f x had maximum values at wind angles of 15 and 165 and two local extreme values at wind angles of 60 and 120 were evident the transverse force f y had maximum values at wind angles of 60 and 120 and a distinctive local extreme value at a wind angle of 90 the yawing moment m z had maximum values at wind angles of 45 and 135 moreover f x was a small force component compared with f y and f x and m z were of the same order of magnitude the wind tunnel test data were used as the benchmark data for the validation of the empirical formulae and numerical calculations in the following study hence the measured wind loads are presented in non dimensional forms as shown in fig 8 the longitudinal force coefficient c x transverse force coefficient c y and yawing moment coefficient c n are defined as follows 3 c x f x 1 2 ρ u 2 a f 4 c y f y 1 2 ρ u 2 a l 5 c n m z 1 2 ρ u 2 a l l o a where ρ is the air density u is the average wind velocity experienced by the superstructure a f is the frontal projected area of the superstructure and hull above the waterline and a l is the lateral projected area of the superstructure and hull above the waterline a f and a l are fixed values which are not affected by the wind angle in this study the values of a f and a l were 0 026 and 0 165 m2 respectively 3 empirical formulae 3 1 basic theories of empirical formulae many researchers haddara and soares 1999 fujiwara et al 2009 wnęk and guedes soares 2015 have proven that the wind load characteristics summarized by empirical formulae isherwood 1972 blendermann 1994 fujiwara et al 2005 are applicable to most generic ship types however applicability studies on some special ships such as aircraft carriers luxury cruise ships and icebreakers have been rarely reported in this study three empirical formulae were used to predict the wind load coefficients on the vista class cruise ship isherwood 1972 developed expressions of the wind load coefficients by the multiple linear regression analysis of early published wind tunnel experiment results the wind force and moment coefficients were obtained depending on the main features of the superstructure and hull above the waterline the specific equations are as follows 6 c x θ a 0 a 1 2 a l l o a 2 a 2 2 a f b 2 a 3 2 l o a b a 4 s l o a a 5 c l o a 2 a 6 m 7 c y θ b 0 b 1 2 a l l o a 2 b 2 2 a f b 2 b 3 2 l o a b b 4 s l o a b 5 c l o a b 6 a s s a l 8 c n θ c 0 c 1 2 a l l o a 2 c 2 2 a f b 2 c 3 2 l o a b c 4 s l o a c 5 c l o a where s is the perimeter of the lateral projected plane of the superstructure and hull above the waterline c is the longitudinal distance between the centroid of the lateral projected plane and the bow m is the number of the pillars and masts in the lateral projected plane and a ss is the lateral projected area of the superstructure a 0 a 6 b 0 b 6 c 0 c 5 are constant coefficients that must be determined through regression analysis of the wind tunnel experiment results these constant coefficients have unique values at different wind angles blendermann 1994 proposed expressions of the wind load coefficients using statistical analysis of the systematic wind tunnel experimental data collected by aage 1971 and blendermann 1993 these expressions specified in equations 9 11 are functions of the frontal projected area of the superstructure and the hull above the waterline a f the lateral projected area of the superstructure and the hull above the waterline a l the wind angle θ the longitudinal distance between the centroid of the lateral projected plane and the mid section of the hull s l and three constant coefficients cd af cd t and δ which were obtained by the statistical analysis of the experimental data this empirical formula is applicable to a wide variety of ship types and configurations but the values of cd af cd t and δ vary for different ship types in this study the expressions which are applicable to the prediction of the wind loads on the passenger liner were used 9 c x c d a f cos θ 1 δ 2 1 c d a f c d t a f a l sin 2 2 θ 10 c y c d t sin θ 1 δ 2 1 c d a f c d t a f a l sin 2 2 θ 11 c n s l l o a 0 18 θ π 2 c y fujiwara et al 2005 presented a set of expressions for the wind load coefficients based on physical considerations where it was assumed that the wind loads consisted of longitudinal flow drag cross flow drag lift and induced drag as shown in fig 9 the explicit expressions are as follows 12 c x c l f cos θ c x l i sin θ 1 2 sin θ cos 2 θ sin θ cos θ c a l f sin θ cos 3 θ 13 c y c c f sin 2 θ c y l i cos θ 1 2 sin 2 θ cos θ sin θ cos θ 14 c n c y 0 927 c l o a 0 149 θ π 2 where c lf c xli c alf and c yli are constant coefficients determined by the regression analysis of the experimental data which consisted of the wind tunnel test results from 71 sample ships and c is the longitudinal distance between the centroid of the lateral projected plane of the superstructure and hull above the waterline and the mid section of the hull in equation 12 the first term represents the component of the longitudinal flow drag the second term represents the component of the lift and induced drag and the third term is the correction term of the equation in equation 13 the first term represents the component of the cross flow drag and the second term represents the component of the lift and induced drag 3 2 validation of empirical formulae fig 10 shows the comparison between the wind tunnel experimental data and the computed values of three empirical formulae overall the values of c y predicted by three empirical formulae achieved a perfect match with the experimental data and the predicted values for c n exhibited consistent variation tendency with the experimental data however significant discrepancies were found between the predicted and experimental results for c x the c x values measured in the wind tunnel experiments had two additional local extreme values at wind angles of 60 and 120 but this data feature was not clearly reflected in the results predicted using the three empirical formulae to present the prediction accuracies of three empirical formulae more intuitively the prediction errors of the empirical formulae were calculated as follows 15 r e r r o r i 1 n e i p i e i n 100 where n is the number of the wind angles used in the wind tunnel tests e i is the experimental value at the i th wind angle p i is the value predicted using the empirical formula at the i th wind angle fig 11 shows that the estimation method proposed by fujiwara et al was more accurate than the other two empirical formulae and its prediction errors for c x c y and c n were 49 73 12 76 and 23 73 respectively fujiwara et al 2005 presented the precision level of his proposed empirical formula for various generic ship types in graphical form where the prediction errors for c x c y and c n were in the range of 10 15 less than 10 and less than 20 respectively these results demonstrate that the wind load characteristics summarized by this empirical formula were not completely consistent with that of the vista class cruise ship especially the characteristics for c x therefore these formulae are not suitable for the accurate prediction of wind loads on the vista class cruise ship 4 numerical simulation 4 1 geometric model to ensure high fidelity of the numerical calculations only a few small details including the masts handrails and waterslides which would not have a significant impact on the calculated results were omitted to improve the mesh quality in the following work the entire geometric model of the vista class cruise ship is shown in fig 12 4 2 numerical methods the commercial cfd software star ccm was employed to carry out the numerical simulations the three dimensional incompressible viscous flow field was solved based on the steady continuity equation and the rans equations the realizable k ε turbulence model shih et al 1995 was utilized for the closure of the rans equations the second order upwind scheme was applied for the convective discretization pressure velocity coupling equations were solved by the simplec algorithm the numerical computational domain and boundary conditions are depicted in fig 13 the total length of the computational domain was set to 9 m 7 5 l oa where the distances from the inlet to the bow and from the stern to the outlet were 3l oa and 3 5l oa respectively the width and height of the computational domain were the same as that of the sjtu wind tunnel which were 6 0 m width 3 5 m height the inlet of the computational domain was set as a velocity inlet and the inlet velocity was consistent with the wind velocity profile α 0 125 of the model test to make sure that the velocity profile remained unchanged as it flowed downstream the top and bottom of the domain were set as slip walls moreover since the maximum blockage ratio of this wind tunnel test was only 0 79 which means that boundary layers near the side walls of the wind tunnel had a very small influence on the distribution of the flow field around the ship model therefore the side walls were treated as symmetry planes to ignore the influence of the boundary layers near the side walls a pressure outlet boundary condition was used for the outlet of the computational domain the hull and superstructure were set as non slip walls the following numerical simulations were only performed at wind angles from 0 to 180 at 15 intervals due to the strict symmetry of the geometric model of the cruise ship in this study the convergence levels of all of the computed cases were satisfactory the residuals could decrease more than 3 4 orders of magnitude even for cases at wind angles with massive flow separation for most wind angles the computed wind loads could remain stationary after 5000 iterations small fluctuations of the computed results could be found for several cases at wind angles with massive flow separation under these conditions the results of the last 1000 iterations were averaged as the computed wind loads 4 3 mesh independence analysis the trimmer meshing model was applied for the mesh generation in this study several box control volumes were inserted around several geometrical details of the cruise ship such as lifeboats balconies chimney and spherical radomes for local mesh refinement three levels of cylinder control volumes were generated in the vicinity of the hull and superstructure to make sure that the captured flow field details had sufficient accuracy moreover eight layers of prism meshes with a growth rate of 1 05 were distributed on the surface of the hull and superstructure and the non dimensional wall distance y was set to less than 1 furthermore the mesh density usually has a considerable influence on the accuracy of numerical results fig 8 shows that the values of cx cy and c n at a wind angle of 120 had the highest order of magnitude compared with those at all other wind angles if the case θ 120 was employed to conduct the mesh independence analysis the convergence trends of the computed results with surface mesh density would be the clearest therefore the mesh independence analysis at a wind angle of 120 was conducted by adjusting the surface mesh size using the ship s overall length l oa as the basic size a total of five sets of meshes were generated based on the different surface mesh sizes the numerical results based on five sets of meshes are illustrated in table 2 and fig 14 as shown in fig 14 when the surface mesh size was adjusted from 0 035l oa to 0 025l oa the calculation accuracy was not significantly improved considering the numerical calculation s cost and accuracy the following cfd calculations used the third set of meshes the details of which are shown in figs 15 and 16 4 4 reynolds number independence analysis in this study the reynolds number independence analysis at a wind angle of 120 was performed using the third set of meshes the wind load coefficients for different re values ranging from 5 104 to 2 5 106 are illustrated in fig 17 fig 17 shows that the wind load coefficients on the vista class cruise ship were sensitive to the re when re exceeded 1 0 106 the wind load coefficients became constant this proved that the re utilized in the previous model test was reasonable therefore the following numerical calculations were also performed at the same reynolds number re 1 28 106 4 5 validation of numerical method fig 18 shows a comparison between the wind tunnel experimental data and computed results the results of the numerical calculations matched well with the experimental data the prediction errors for c x c y and c n were 10 81 3 43 and 8 59 respectively greater errors appeared in the predicted values for c x and c n than that for c y one important reason for this was that f x and m z were quite small at most wind angles see fig 7 and slight deviations caused by the geometric simplifications and complex flow fields could result in large relative errors similar conclusions were drawn by wnęk and guedes soares 2015 nonetheless it could be still concluded that the numerical calculation had high precision for the prediction of wind loads on the vista class cruise ship as a result the flow field details captured by the numerical simulations were also employed for the subsequent analysis 5 results and discussion 5 1 components of wind forces and moments the drag experienced by a body in a fluid are composed of viscous and pressure drag as a general rule the main contributor to drag on a blunt body is pressure drag based on the results predicted by the cfd calculations the components of the wind forces and moments on the vista class cruise ship are illustrated in fig 19 the magnitudes of the transverse wind force f y and yawing moment m z at wind angles of 0 and 180 were both zero thus the components of f y and m z are only listed at wind angles from 15 to 165 fig 19 shows that the wind loads on the vista class cruise ship were almost exclusively composed of the pressure drag moment the average proportions of the pressure drag moment for f x f y and m z at all wind angles were 87 51 99 58 and 99 01 this result reflects that the vista class cruise ship is a blunt body and the characteristics of the blunt body in the lateral view are more significant than those in the longitudinal view 5 2 flow patterns around ship the reason that the pressure drag was a principle contributor to the drag on a bluff body is the occurrence of flow separation in the boundary layer and the formation of reversed flow zones at the rear of the body larose and auteuil 2006 naturally it is interesting to explore the flow patterns around the vista class cruise ship to present the flow patterns around the cruise ship more intuitively the streamline diagrams around the ship are depicted as shown in fig 22 due to the strict symmetry of the cruise ship only the streamline distribution at wind angles from 0 to 180 were calculated the starboard side of the hull was defined as the windward side the port side of the hull was defined as the leeward side and the definition of the wind angles is illustrated in fig 20 moreover to make sure that the terminologies utilized to describe the cruise ship s structures are easy to be understood the general arrangement for the vista class cruise ship is also depicted in fig 21 fig 22 reveals that the shapes and dimensions of the wakes around the cruise ship were related to the wind angle when the wind angle was 0 streamlines extended smoothly along the cruise ship s longitudinal direction and then slight flow separation occurred at the corners of the aft deck as the air flowed downstream this led to the formation of two small scale symmetric reversed flow zones at the rear of the ship when the wind angle was between 15 and 60 flow separation was evident at the corners of the bow and aft decks and two asymmetric separated flows also appeared at the cruise ship s leeward side here the separated flow from the corners of the bow deck can be regarded as a longitudinal trailing vortex and its size was significantly larger than that from the corners of the aft deck when the wind angle was 75 the separated flow from the corners of the bow deck reattached on the surface of the cruise ship forming a d shape recirculation bubble in the beam wind two symmetric recirculation zones formed at the ship s leeward side and they rotated in opposite directions as the wind angle continued to change from 105 to 165 the variation trends of the wakes around the cruise ship were similar to those at wind angles from 75 to 15 when the wind angle was 180 a small scale reversed flow zone firstly formed at the rear of the ship and then two small scale symmetric separated flows appeared at the front side of the cruise ship as the air flowed downstream in addition the wind over deck wod forrest and owen 2010 bardera et al 2019 conditions were also quite significant when the wind moved over the top deck of the superstructure massive flow separation firstly occurred at the sharp edges of the top deck and then the flow structures exhibited drastic changes under the influence of some isolated elements on the top deck such as the chimney open air swimming pool 1 and 2 and radar domes at almost all wind angles vortices were found inside the chimney and open air swimming pool 1 and 2 based on the above analysis it was concluded that reversed flow zones around the cruise ship were primarily induced by the flow separation at the corners of the bow deck aft deck and the edges of the top deck if the corner radii of the bow and aft decks were adjusted appropriately and the edges of top deck were chamfered properly it could be beneficial for the pressure drag reduction of the vista class cruise ship 5 3 pressure distribution the pressure drag was a main contributor to wind loads on the vista class cruise ship therefore the pressure distribution on the cruise ship s surface was also a valuable flow field detail fig 23 shows the pressure coefficient distribution on the cruise ship s surface at wind angles from 0 to 180 the pressure coefficient is defined as follows 16 c p p p 0 1 2 ρ u 0 2 where p is the absolute pressure on the cruise ship s surface p 0 is the atmospheric pressure and u 0 is the wind velocity in the far field there are two columns in fig 23 the left column a shows the pressure distribution on the windward side of the cruise ship and the right column b shows the pressure distribution on the leeward side in the color bar the colors darker than light yellow including light yellow correspond to the negative pressure zone fig 23 a shows that the longitudinal position of the maximum positive pressure zone along the hull was highly consistent with the direction of the oncoming flow as the wind angle changed from 0 to 180 the position of maximum pressure zone also moved from the bow to the stern in contrast in fig 23 b the position of the minimum negative pressure zone was not related to the wind angle when the wind angle was less than 90 the minimum pressure zone was always at the corners of the bow deck when the wind angle was more than 90 the minimum pressure zone was always at the corners of the aft deck in the beam wind the minimum pressure zones were present at both corners of the bow and aft decks moreover fig 23 b shows that the positions and dimensions of the negative pressure zones on the ship s leeward side were associated closely with those of the separated flows around the ship see fig 22 meanwhile the open air zone on the top deck was mainly dominated by the negative pressure at most wind angles ranging from 30 to 150 these were attributed to the following the positive pressure on the ship s surface was directly caused by the air flow shock while the negative pressure was induced by the flow separation around the ship hence the above observations were predictable furthermore the extrema of the pressure coefficients on the surface of cruise ship at variant wind angles are also listed in fig 24 it can be seen that the maximum pressure coefficients did not present the distinctive characteristics and the maximum pressure coefficients at all wind angles were always about 1 while the variation trends of the minimum pressure coefficients at different wind angles were similar to those of transverse wind force coefficients see fig 8 this seemed to imply some incomprehensible relations between them 6 conclusions the investigations on the aerodynamic performances of various generic ship types have been widely performed via three estimation methods wind tunnel measurements empirical formulae and numerical calculations however to the best of our knowledge studies on the aerodynamic performance of luxury cruise ships have been rarely reported to date to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the aerodynamics of the vista class cruise ship wind tunnel measurements empirical formulae and numerical calculations were used together in this study the wind tunnel experiments were carried out in a simulated atmospheric boundary layer the measured data presented reliable wind load characteristics of the cruise ship three common empirical formulae were used to analyze whether the wind load characteristics of the vista class cruise ship were similar to those of generic ship types numerical calculations were employed to capture the flow field details around the cruise ship and analyze the flow characteristics around the ship and the prediction accuracy of the cfd calculations was also verified by comparing the wind tunnel experimental data with the numerical results based on the above work conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the prediction errors of the empirical formulae for the wind load coefficients on the vista class cruise ship were far greater than those on the generic ship types which proved that the wind load characteristics summarized by the empirical formulae were not completely consistent with those on the cruise ship hence these empirical formulae are not applicable for the accurate prediction of the wind loads on the vista class cruise ship 2 compared with empirical formulae cfd calculations showed the higher precision levels for the prediction of wind loads on the vista class cruise ship at various wind angles 3 the vista class cruise ship could be regarded as a blunt body with many sharp edges based on the components of the drags and its exterior shapes however the wind load coefficients on the cruise ship were still sensitive to the reynolds number and the critical reynolds number was up to 1 0 106 4 the flow separation zones around the ship were mainly distributed in three regions the front and back sides of the ship and the ship s leeward side the positions and dimensions of these flow separation zones were related to the wind angles 5 the wind over deck condition of the vista class cruise ship was quite significant when air flowed over the top deck of the superstructure the flow structures exhibited the dramatic changes under the influence of some isolated elements on the top deck such as the chimney open air swimming pool and radar radomes 6 massive flow separation always occurred in the corners of the bow and aft decks and the edges of the top deck if the corner radii of the bow and aft decks were adjusted appropriately and the edges of top deck were chamfered properly it could be beneficial for the drag reduction of the vista class cruise ship at present the design of this vista class cruise ship is still in the early stage the analysis of the flow characteristics around the ship can provide guidance for future optimization of the aerodynamic performance of the cruise ship credit authorship contribution statement penghui wang
