14745,due to livestock wastewater irrigation soil is becoming one of the major sinks of antibiotics in the environment recently it is getting recognized that a variety of minerals under low moisture conditions can induce strong catalytic hydrolysis to antibiotics however the relative importance and implication of soil water content wc for natural attenuation of soil residual antibiotics has not been well recognized in order to explore the optimal moisture levels and the key soil properties dominating for the high catalytic hydrolysis activities of soils this study collected 16 representative soil samples across china and assessed their performances to degrade chloramphenicol cap under different moisture levels the results showed that the soils with low organic matter contents 20 g kg and high amounts of crystalline fe al were particularly effective in catalyzing cap hydrolysis when exposed to low wc 6 wt wt leading to cap hydrolysis half lives of 40 d higher wc greatly suppressed the catalytic activity of the soil by utilizing this process it is possible to integrate abiotic and biotic degradation to enhance the mineralization of cap attributing to that the hydrolytic products are more available for soil microorganisms as expected the soils experienced periodic dry to wet moisture conditions i e the wc shifting from 1 to 5 to 20 35 wt wt exhibited higher degradation and mineralization of 14c cap in comparison with the constant wet treatment meanwhile the bacterial community composition and the specific genera showed that the dry to wet fluctuation of soil wc relieved the antimicrobial stress to bacterial community our study verifies the critical role of soil wc in mediating the natural attenuation of antibiotics and guides to remove antibiotics from both wastewater and soil graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotics moisture fluctuation abiotic hydrolysis microbial mineralization wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics have been extensively used to treat bacterial infections in addition to boost the growth of livestock and poultry martínez 2008 however the overuse of antibiotics has caused severe environment problems leading to serious ecological and public health concerns qiu et al 2022 xu et al 2022 chloramphenicol cap is a broad spectrum antibiotic owing to its low cost and impressive performance cap has been used as both clinical and veterinary drugs for more than 70 years balbi 2004 resulting its frequent detection in hospital municipal aquaculture livestock farming wastewater as well as surface waters in various countries and regions at concentration up to ppm levels lin et al 2022 ma et al 2020 soil is one of the major sinks of antibiotics originating from livestock farming and wastewater irrigation long term exposure of antibiotics would reinforce selective pressures on soil microorganisms resulting in occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistant genes args wang et al 2016 therefore it urgently needs to remove antibiotic residues from both wastewater and soils the natural soil water content usually plays a significant role for mediating the degradation of organic pollutants regarding both biotic and abiotic processes for example flooding and drying cycling of paddy soil could combine anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms to enhance the degradation mineralization of halogenated organic compounds jin et al 2019a meanwhile water fluctuations in coastal soils could induce redox oscillations leading to the high yield of reactive oxygen species i e oh o2 etc zhao et al 2022 which further promoted the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs chen et al 2021 recently it is getting recognized that soil minerals e g clay minerals iron aluminum oxides at low moisture level could induce significant hydrolytic reactions to some organic pollutants such as organophosphorus pesticides poly dimethysiloxanes and phenicol antibiotics jin et al 2019b mingelgrin et al 1977 xu et al 1998 in these reactions the level of surface water content dominates the surface catalytic activity in terms of affecting the surface brönsted acidity lewis acidity or hydrogen bonding interactions of the minerals with these organic compounds fang et al 2018 soma and soma 1989 wu et al 2021 limited surface water could facilitate surface hydrolysis while excess water would shield or compete for the surface reactive sites el amamy and mill 1984 jin et al 2019b 2022 mingelgrin et al 1977 saltzman et al 1974 xu 1998 therefore it is prospective that the low level of soil water content can effectively catalyze the hydrolysis of some residual antibiotics since the field soils are usually water unsaturated even drought rosenbaum et al 2012 abiotic hydrolysis might be an unneglectable natural attenuation pathway for soil residual antibiotics however up to date such abiotic hydrolysis processes were only tested in some representative soil minerals i e kaolinite montmorillonite aluminum oxide and iron oxide etc but have not been examined in actual soils due to the vast variations in soil compositions it is unclear which key soil properties dominate the abiotic hydrolytic activity further research is required to identify these key soil properties and the appropriate soil water content level for optimal degradation performance for one of its environmental implications we hypothesized that the antibiotics after hydrolytic degradation would be more prone for biodegradation correspondingly the antibiotic stress to soil microorganisms and the prevalence of soil args should be relieved zhang et al 2017 according to this hypothesis letting the antibiotic contaminated soil experience periodic dry to wet alternation could create sequential abiotic and biotic degradation of antibiotics in the soil actually field soils often undergo dry to wet moisture fluctuation through repeated raining and drying processes synergetic abiotic hydrolysis and biotic mineralization processes might be an important natural attenuation pathway for antibiotics in soil the other potential environmental implication relayed on the application of low cost wastewater treatment strategy using soil as the remediation media if abiotic hydrolysis of antibiotic residue was observed considerably in soil it might be possible to treat the antibiotic contained wastewater by field soil especially under the guidance of appropriate wastewater irrigation management or agricultural water management based on the above assumptions we systematically investigated the degradation process of antibiotics in actual field soils by the influence of soil water contents the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the optimal soil water content for abiotic hydrolysis of cap in 16 representative soils 2 to distinguish the main soil properties determining the catalytic activity of the soil 3 to examine how dry to wet fluctuation of soil water content would enhance the mineralization of 14c labeled cap in the soils 4 to evaluate the changes of soil microorganisms in soils in response of dry to wet water fluctuation the results of this study clearly revealed the key soil properties for determining their catalytic hydrolysis abilities in addition dry to wet fluctuation of soil water content could greatly enhance the mineralization of cap in soil and relieve antimicrobial pressure on bacterial communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and representative soils the information of chemicals and reagents used in this study is provided in the supporting information si text s1 sixteen agricultural soils were gathered across china table s1 they were carefully selected on the basis of geographical locations soil types the contents of soil organic matter som and the fe al contents the top layer soil 0 20 cm was sampled sieved 2 mm and air dried then stored

three yellow soils which cover a broad range of som contents were engaged to study the influence of soil water content 0 5 100 wt wt on their abiotic hydrolysis efficiencies for cap the soil aliquots were autoclaved 121 ºc 30 min to deactivate soil microbes then oven dried 105 ºc overnight for further use we suppose that autoclaving would not significantly affect the crystallinities of the soil minerals pan and chu 2016 afterward the acetone based cap stock solution 200 μl was spiked onto the sterilized soil sample to obtain the initial cap concentration of 0 25 μmol g after acetone was evaporated the soil sample was moved into a desiccator to proceed a 15 d reaction at 25 ºc in darkness in the desiccator the mgcl2 saturated solution nacl saturated solution or pure water was placed in the bottom to control the relative humidity rh in headspace at 33 76 or 100 respectively the corresponding soil water content was measured by weight the soils with higher water contents of 15 25 50 and 100 wt wt were established by adding certain amounts of pure water to the soil then capped for reaction under the same condition to enlarge the soil sample pool another 9 soils were further adopted to compare their catalytic hydrolysis abilities for cap at rh 76 the concentrations of residual cap and the degradation product 2 amino 1 4 nitrophenyl 1 3 propanediol anp were measured at three day intervals during the 15 day reaction period using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc text s3 the soil aliquots were extracted by 5 ml methanol water 1 1 v v ph 4 then filtered for hplc analysis to avoid microbial degradation all the soils reagents vessels and supplies were sterilized 121 ºc 30 min and carefully operated in a clean bench 2 3 mineralization of 14c cap in soils during dry to wet treatment three representative soils rsl 1 rsl 2 ysl with the highest abiotic hydrolysis performances were subjected for investigating the influence of dry to wet moisture treatment on the mineralization of cap in soils 14c cap radioactive labeled at the dichloroacetamide group the specific radioactivity of 93 8 mci mmol purity of 99 7 obtained from moravek inc california usa was utilized to trace the mineralization ratio and bound residues to initiate the dry incubation stage 5 g sterilized 121 ºc 30 min and oven dried 105 ºc overnight soil was spiked with 14c cap 1 25 μmol and 16 7 kbq in 5 g soil then incubated in a brown flask with the rh of 76 which was maintained by placing a cup of nacl saturated solution inside this dry incubation stage 25 ºc in darkness continued for one month during which stage cap was potentially hydrolyzed afterward 45 g dry weight fresh soil was added and well mixed the soil water content was re adjusted to the optimal moisture level for microbial degradation 22 33 and 35 wt wt for rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl respectively the optimal moisture levels were evaluated according to the soil texture and organic carbon content based on the report of schroll et al 2006 the soils were then compacted with a spatula to a volume equivalent to a soil density of 1 3 g cm3 the wet incubation stage 25 ºc in darkness lasted for another 2 months notably before starting the wet incubation stage the 3 fresh soils were pre wetted to re activate the indigenous microorganisms with the water content of 20 wt wt and 15 ºc in darkness for 2 weeks in addition a constant wet treatment group was set for comparison following the same procedure except that the 14c cap spiked soil did not experience the dry incubation stage but directly entered the wet incubation stage for 3 months the spiking concentration and radioactivity of 14c cap were the same as above 1 25 μmol and 16 7 kbq in 50 g soils during the incubation the flask was sealed with the rubber plug the produced 14co2 was absorbed by naoh solution 5 ml 1 m inside the flask which was sampled 3 times a week the radioactivity of the collected naoh was quantified on a tri carb 5110 tr liquid scintillation counter perkinelmer rodgau germany li et al 2015 finally the soil after incubation was sampled for analyzing the contents of extractable and non extractable residues li et al 2015 quadruplicate was set for the mineralization experiment the detailed information for analysis of 14co2 extractable and non extractable residues is presented in text s4 2 4 dna extraction sequencing and quantification after 3 month incubation the microbial community in the soil was analyzed to reflect the antibacterial effect by different water managements dry to wet and constant wet the fresh soil without spiking cap was also included for comparison the soil dna was extracted using a fastdna spin kit mpbio usa according to the manufacturer s protocol the v3 v4 hyper variable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified for each sample using two primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the raw sequence analysis was carried out with the illumina miseq paired end 300 bp protocol illumina inc san diego ca usa at the centre for genomic research shanghai majorbio biotechnology co ltd china the raw sequence data were processed in qiime 1 9 2 caporaso et al 2010 the quality filtered sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus according to the 97 sequence similarity by usearch11 uparse edgar 2013 2 5 data analysis the hydrolytic degradation of cap during the dry incubation stage was fitted by the pseudo first order kinetics to gain the obvious hydrolysis rate constants k obs the heatmap of pearson correlation among soil properties and k obs the heatmap for relative abundances of bacterial community composition at genus level alpha diversity indices least significant difference analysis were carried out using r version 4 1 1 https www r project org with pheatmap corrplot vegan and agricolae packages respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of soil water content on cap hydrolysis the degradation kinetics of cap in the 7 first round tested soils with various water contents are shown in fig 1a c including the 3 soils rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl and figure s1 including the 4 soils rsm rsh ysm and ysh as indicated in fig 1a c only the 3 soils i e rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl with low som contents 20 mg l showed convincing catalytic performance for cap hydrolysis under low moisture conditions the highest degradation rates were obtained at the water contents of 0 5 1 2 2 1 5 0 1 1 5 6 wt wt for rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl respectively figure s2 table s3 under this moisture range 26 66 cap was degraded after 15 d reaction fig 1a c figure s3 and significant amounts of anp and dichloroacetic acid dca were identified as the main hydrolytic products the mass recovery in terms of cap anp made up 61 101 of the original total amount figure s4 since the soils were sterilized and no significant adsorption of cap was observed cap should be mainly degraded via abiotic hydrolysis pathway in the 3 tested soils the hydrolytic degradation followed the pseudo first order kinetics the obtained k obs and half lives are provided in table s3 while the hydrolysis reaction was greatly suppressed when the soil water content exceeded 6 wt wt figure s5 this phenomenon was also in accordance with our previous observation in the presence of kaolinite alumina oxides and iron minerals jin et al 2021 2019b wu et al 2021 in these systems the hydrolysis of cap was induced by surface hydrogen bonding and or lewis acid interaction and exhibited similar moisture sensitivity therefore the influence of water content on the catalytic hydrolysis of cap in actual soils suggests that kaolinite and al fe minerals might be the dominant mineral forms for the reaction of cap 3 2 soil properties dominating cap hydrolysis typically the som contents showed great impact on cap hydrolysis in the 7 first round tested soils fig 1a c and figure s1 except rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl the other 4 tested soils rsm rsh and ysm ysh with relatively high som contents 20 g kg did not exhibit strong catalytic activities under low moisture conditions figure s1 since the co existing natural organic matter would inhibit the reaction by competing for the reactive sites or sequestrating the pollutants jin et al 2021 wu et al 2021 to further verify this hypothesis additional 9 soils were introduced for degrading cap at rh 76 as shown in fig 1d the soil rsl 3 was more reactive followed by ppsl and lsl combining the 16 soils together the k obs values clearly showed a negative correlation to the log values of som figure 2a 2 g r 2 0 69 pearson r 0 73 p 0 001 however although the soils of ybsl dsl and fsl contained relatively low som contents 11 14 g kg table s1 their catalytic activities were still low suggesting that other soil properties also control this process saltzman et al 1974 smolen and stone 1998 wu et al 2021 therefore multiple soil properties were characterized including hno3 fe al oxalate fe dcb fe cry fe tiron al xrf fe al si ph som cec and clay content the definitions of these characters were described in the caption of fig 2 g these properties were correlated to the k obs by pearson correlation analysis as shown in fig 2 g the k obs showed significant positive correlations p 0 001 to the amounts of dcb fe r 2 0 41 pearson r 0 48 figure s6a cry fe r 2 0 43 pearson r 0 51 fig 2c trion al r 2 0 61 pearson r 0 44 fig 2d and xrf al r 2 0 61 pearson r 0 81 figure s6c indicating that the crystalline fe al species are responsible for the hydrolysis reaction therefore the low crystalline fe al contents e g cry fe 10 g kg trion al 3 g kg table s2 of ybsl dsl and fsl could explain their low catalytic activities the positive correlation between k obs and clay content r 2 0 17 pearson r 0 48 p 0 001 fig 2b was expected as phyllosilicate minerals showed strong catalytic activities under low moisture conditions jin et al 2021 2019b besides the k obs also exhibited significant negative correlations to soil ph r 2 0 42 pearson r 0 51 p 0 001 fig 2e and cec r 2 0 58 pearson r 0 62 p 0 001 fig 2f this result is consistent with the well known fact that soils with high amount of crystalline fe al usually possess low ph pionke and corey 1967 ye et al 2022 the negative correlation was further supported by the observation that soil ph showed a negative correlation to the contents of dcb fe cry fe and trion al pearson r 0 44 0 48 p 0 001 on the other hand the main determinants of cec in soils are clay and organic matter as both have negative charges to attract cations aprile and lorandi 2012 in this study the cec showed a significantly positive correlation to log som pearson r 0 69 p 0 001 rather than the clay content pearson r 0 27 p 0 01 it appears that soil ph and cec could be considered as the initial screening factors to indicate the catalytic hydrolysis capability of the soils by the way ysl performed abnormally high degradation rate for cap which is out of the linear range of the correlations we propose that cap might be additionally degraded via potential pathways other than hydrolysis which are currently unknown 3 3 effect of dry to wet treatment on cap mineralization we focused on the influence of dry to wet treatment on the mineralization of cap for the 3 soils rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl which had displayed significant abiotic hydrolysis capacities fig 1a c 14c labelled cap was used to trace its mineralization and residue formation fig 3 indicates that during the one month dry incubation stage the production of 14co2 was negligible as entering the wet incubation stage remarkable mineralization was observed which was attributed to the increased bioavailability of contaminants and the high microbial activity compared to the constant wet control samples the mineralization rates increased significantly for all the 3 soils after the dry incubation fig 3 implying that the hydrolytic products were more easily metabolized by soil microorganisms than cap itself since the applied 14c cap is radioactive labeled at the dichloroacetamide group its hydrolytic product 14c dca is still radioactive labeled while the other half product anp is not in the later stage of the dry to wet group d w the mineralization rate of each soil came to an inflection point after which the mineralization rate reduced to the same level as the constant wet group w probably because the 14c dca had been consumed up finally the rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl treated with sequential dry to wet incubation had the total mineralization ratios of 34 8 62 5 and 52 4 respectively in comparison the rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl treated with constant wet incubation only obtained 24 4 43 0 and 29 3 mineralization respectively to evaluate the environmental risk of cap after the dry to wet treatment the extractable and non extractable 14c residues were quantified as a result the dry to wet group exhibited less extractable residues and more non extractable residues than the constant wet group fig 4a the formation of non extractable fraction in soil is commonly regarded as a detoxification process gevao et al 2000 li et al 2015 therefore the environmental risk of cap should be reduced after the dry to wet treatment furthermore the concentrations of residual cap and anp in the extractable fraction after 3 months incubation were also analyzed fig 4b notably one cap molecule precursor produces one anp if cap is degraded via the hydrolysis pathway while the co metabolism of cap by microbes does not yield anp as an intermediate zhang et al 2020 2022 herein the soils treated with sequential dry to wet incubation had much less cap residue and significantly higher yield of anp compared to the constant wet group indicating that the hydrolysis reaction accounts for an important degradation process for the dry to wet treatment since the produced anp was not radioactive labeled the extractable radioactivity involving 14c cap 14c dca and other 14c intermediates in the dry to wet group was lower than the sum concentrations of cap and anp expressed as percentages of the spiking radioactivity and cap concentration respectively fig 4b by contrast for the constant wet group less amount of anp was detected and the percentage of extractable radioactivity was higher than the total recovery of cap and anp except for rsl 1 fig 4b this result suggests that soil microorganisms co metabolized cap during the wet incubation stage to produce 14c residues other than anp microbial degradation instead of abiotic hydrolysis mainly contributes to cap degradation at high moisture conditions although anp might be still persistent in the soils like rsl 1 and ysl the sum concentrations of anp cap in the dry to wet group were significantly lower than those in the constant wet group fig 4b it further confirmed that periodical low soil moisture treatment can enhance the dissipation of cap in the soils especially in rsl 2 cap was completely degraded only 8 of the degraded cap was recovered as anp after the dry to wet treatment this enhanced degradation of cap in soil can be attributed to abiotic hydrolysis caused by soil minerals the hydrolysis products are more easily metabolized than cap itself 3 4 changes in the bacterial community composition it is well recognized that the alpha diversity is essential to reflect the microbial diversity in response of antibiotic stress nguyen et al 2020 in this study abundance based coverage estimator ace index and shannon indices were chosen to represent the richness and diversity of bacterial community components compared to the fresh soils either the dry to wet or constant wet treatment reduced the levels of ace and shannon indices in the soils fig 5a 5b which might be explained by the contamination with high amount of cap 0 025 μmol g while for rsl 2 the shannon index followed the opposite trend since rsl 2 performed the highest cap mineralization and the lowest residue fig 4 the anomalous rise of shannon index level in rsl 2 could be ascribed to the vigorous growth of the bacteria by utilizing cap and its hydrolytic products anp and dca it was reported that the dry to wet moisture alternation would decrease the shannon index of agricultural soils qi et al 2021 even though the hydrologic history and agricultural water management had trained the resistance and resilience of soil bacterial community peralta et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 while in this study the levels of ace and shannon indices in the dry to wet group were higher than those of the constant wet group except the ace index of ysl fig 5a 5b this should be attributed to the abiotic hydrolysis of cap during the dry incubation stage fig 1a c which decreased the antimicrobial stress to the bacterial community fang et al 2014 for the exception of ysl the original bacterial abundance in ysl soil was extremely low below the qpcr detection limit and there might be absent of anp degraders fig 4b as anp also has bacteriostatic activity chennakesava rao et al 2014 therefore the change of bacterial community suggests that the dry to wet treatment could relieve the antibiotic stress attributing to abiotic degradation of cap the bacterial community composition of the predominant genera showed significant difference among different soil types fig 5c obviously soil type is the decisive factor to shape the bacterial community structure either the dry to wet group or the constant wet group was separated from the fresh soil group for each soil type reflecting the impact of cap on the community composition notably the dry to wet group and the constant wet group were clearly separated in rsl 1 and rsl 2 except ysl probably due to the different responses of bacterial communities to the growth substrates cap and its hydrolytic products therefore the relative abundances of the top 10 genera of each soil were compared to reveal the potential degraders of cap and its hydrolytic products in response to the different moisture treatments based on the analysis including kruskal wallis rank sum test fdr correction and tukey kramer post hoc test the relative abundance of some genera e g rhodococcus and ramlibacter in rsl 1 fig 6a decreased in both moisture treatments compared to the fresh soil due to the stress by the introduction of cap the abundances of edaphobacter and methylobacterium methylorubrum were relatively higher after the constant wet treatment e g in rsl 1 and rsl 2 indicating their growth capacity in cap contaminated soils in rsl 2 the relative abundance of burkholderia caballeronia paraburkholderia norank f longimicrobiaceae and frateuria increased after the dry to wet treatment which might be held responsible for the degradation and bio assimilation of the cap hydrolytic products instead of cap while the abundance of the other 6 genera i e edaphobacter sphingomonas bradyrhizobium methylobacterium methylorubrum amycolatopsis and granulicella increased after the constant wet treatment which might degrade cap as the host of cap degrading genes fig 6b for instance sphingomonas has been reported to carry the cap degrading gene zhang et al 2020 2022 therefore the abiotic hydrolysis of cap in the dry incubation stage might inhibit the growth of dominant cap degrading genera for the following wet incubation stage of rsl 2 likewise the spread of cap degrading genes might be suppressed the soil of ysl performed the highest abiotic hydrolytic activity for cap fig 1c while it was badly active to metabolize the hydrolytic product anp the considerable mineralization ratio 52 36 for the dry to wet group should be ascribed to the microbial co metabolizing 14c dca fig 4c the dominant genera of amycolatopsis mucilaginibacter and nocardia might utilize dca for growth in general the cap metabolic pathways during the dry to wet treatment might be distinct from the constant wet treatment which can be reflected in bacterial community composition the decline of alpha diversity of bacterial community stressed by cap can be alleviated by the dry to wet treatment and the bacterial responsible for the degradation of cap or anp may play an important role in the shift of bacterial community composition conclusion in this study we applied 16 actual soils to investigate the key soil properties dominating the abiotic hydrolysis of cap and demonstrated that the actual soils with low som content 20 g kg high amounts of crystalline fe al mineral could promote strong abiotic hydrolysis reaction for cap under the conditions with low soil water content 0 5 6 wt wt the soil ph and cec could be chosen as the initial screening indicators notably red soils hold the highest potential for abiotic transformation of cap the occurrence of soil mineral induced abiotic hydrolysis in arid soil reveals an overlooked natural attenuation pathway for antibiotics which might give a new explanation for the relatively low residue concentrations of some antibiotics in the top soil than those in the subsurface soil beyond biodegradation and photolysis wang et al 2020 wei et al 2016 wolters and steffens 2005 soil moisture fluctuation has shown significant impact on transformation of soil organic pollutants however most of the previous studies focused on wet to flood fluctuation of soil water content chen et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 jin et al 2019a it has never been reported whether the degradation of soil contaminants can be promoted by alternating the soil moisture from extreme dry wc 5 wt wt to optimal wet state wc 20 wt wt hence this research is a pioneer study to provide evidence that dry to wet treatment can greatly enhance the mineralization of some hydrolysable organic pollutants in field soils given that the open field soils often undergo repeated drying and wetting cycles the natural attenuation of some antibiotics and other potential organic pollutants can be accelerated this finding also suggests that appropriate wastewater irrigation management or agricultural water management can facilitate the removal of antibiotics from both wastewater and soils declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

14745,due to livestock wastewater irrigation soil is becoming one of the major sinks of antibiotics in the environment recently it is getting recognized that a variety of minerals under low moisture conditions can induce strong catalytic hydrolysis to antibiotics however the relative importance and implication of soil water content wc for natural attenuation of soil residual antibiotics has not been well recognized in order to explore the optimal moisture levels and the key soil properties dominating for the high catalytic hydrolysis activities of soils this study collected 16 representative soil samples across china and assessed their performances to degrade chloramphenicol cap under different moisture levels the results showed that the soils with low organic matter contents 20 g kg and high amounts of crystalline fe al were particularly effective in catalyzing cap hydrolysis when exposed to low wc 6 wt wt leading to cap hydrolysis half lives of 40 d higher wc greatly suppressed the catalytic activity of the soil by utilizing this process it is possible to integrate abiotic and biotic degradation to enhance the mineralization of cap attributing to that the hydrolytic products are more available for soil microorganisms as expected the soils experienced periodic dry to wet moisture conditions i e the wc shifting from 1 to 5 to 20 35 wt wt exhibited higher degradation and mineralization of 14c cap in comparison with the constant wet treatment meanwhile the bacterial community composition and the specific genera showed that the dry to wet fluctuation of soil wc relieved

overuse of antibiotics has caused severe environment problems leading to serious ecological and public health concerns qiu et al 2022 xu et al 2022 chloramphenicol cap is a broad spectrum antibiotic owing to its low cost and impressive performance cap has been used as both clinical and veterinary drugs for more than 70 years balbi 2004 resulting its frequent detection in hospital municipal aquaculture livestock farming wastewater as well as surface waters in various countries and regions at concentration up to ppm levels lin et al 2022 ma et al 2020 soil is one of the major sinks of antibiotics originating from livestock farming and wastewater irrigation long term exposure of antibiotics would reinforce selective pressures on soil microorganisms resulting in occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistant genes args wang et al 2016 therefore it urgently needs to remove antibiotic residues from both wastewater and soils the natural soil water content usually plays a significant role for mediating the degradation of organic pollutants regarding both biotic and abiotic processes for example flooding and drying cycling of paddy soil could combine anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms to enhance the degradation mineralization of halogenated organic compounds jin et al 2019a meanwhile water fluctuations in coastal soils could induce redox oscillations leading to the high yield of reactive oxygen species i e oh o2 etc zhao et al 2022 which further promoted the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs chen et al 2021 recently it is getting recognized that soil minerals e g clay minerals iron aluminum oxides at low moisture level could induce significant hydrolytic reactions to some organic pollutants such as organophosphorus pesticides poly

1974 xu 1998 therefore it is prospective that the low level of soil water content can effectively catalyze the hydrolysis of some residual antibiotics since the field soils are usually water unsaturated even drought rosenbaum et al 2012 abiotic hydrolysis might be an unneglectable natural attenuation pathway for soil residual antibiotics however up to date such abiotic hydrolysis

content level for optimal degradation performance for one of its environmental implications we hypothesized that the antibiotics after hydrolytic degradation would be more prone for biodegradation correspondingly the antibiotic stress to soil microorganisms and the prevalence of soil args should be relieved zhang et al 2017 according to this hypothesis letting the antibiotic contaminated soil experience periodic dry to wet alternation could create sequential abiotic and biotic degradation of antibiotics in the soil actually field soils often undergo dry to wet moisture fluctuation through

environmental implication relayed on the application of low cost wastewater treatment strategy using soil as the remediation media if abiotic hydrolysis of antibiotic residue was observed considerably in soil it might be possible to treat the antibiotic contained wastewater by field soil especially under the guidance of appropriate wastewater irrigation management or agricultural water management based on the above assumptions we systematically investigated the degradation process of antibiotics in actual field soils by the influence of soil water contents the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the optimal soil water content for abiotic hydrolysis of cap in 16 representative soils 2 to distinguish the main soil properties determining the catalytic activity of the soil 3 to examine how dry to wet fluctuation of soil water content would enhance the mineralization of 14c labeled cap in the soils 4 to evaluate the changes of soil microorganisms in soils in response of dry to wet water fluctuation the results of this study clearly revealed the key soil properties for determining their catalytic hydrolysis abilities in addition dry to wet fluctuation of soil water content could greatly enhance the mineralization of cap in soil and relieve antimicrobial pressure on bacterial communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and representative soils the

three yellow soils which cover a broad range of som contents were engaged to study the influence of soil water content 0 5 100 wt wt on their abiotic hydrolysis efficiencies for cap the soil aliquots were autoclaved 121 ºc 30 min to deactivate soil microbes then oven dried 105 ºc overnight for further use we suppose that autoclaving would not significantly affect the crystallinities of the soil minerals pan and chu 2016 afterward the acetone based cap stock solution 200 μl was spiked onto the sterilized soil sample to obtain the initial cap concentration of 0 25 μmol g after acetone was evaporated the soil sample was moved into a desiccator to proceed a 15 d reaction at 25 ºc in darkness in the desiccator the mgcl2 saturated solution nacl saturated solution or pure water was placed in the bottom to control the relative humidity rh in headspace at 33 76 or 100 respectively the corresponding soil water content was measured by weight the soils with higher water contents of 15 25 50 and 100 wt wt were established by adding certain amounts of pure water to the soil then capped for reaction under the same condition to enlarge the soil sample pool another 9 soils were further adopted to compare their catalytic hydrolysis abilities for cap at rh 76 the concentrations of residual cap and the degradation product 2 amino 1 4 nitrophenyl 1 3 propanediol anp were measured at three day intervals during the 15 day reaction period using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc text s3 the soil aliquots were extracted by 5 ml methanol water 1 1 v v ph 4 then filtered for hplc analysis to avoid microbial degradation all the soils reagents vessels and supplies were sterilized 121 ºc 30 min and carefully operated in a clean bench 2 3 mineralization of 14c cap in soils during dry to wet treatment three representative soils rsl 1 rsl 2 ysl with the highest abiotic hydrolysis performances were subjected for investigating the influence of dry to wet moisture treatment on the mineralization of cap in soils 14c cap radioactive labeled at the dichloroacetamide group the specific radioactivity of 93 8 mci mmol purity of 99 7 obtained from moravek inc california usa was utilized to trace the mineralization ratio and bound residues to initiate the dry incubation stage 5 g sterilized 121 ºc 30 min and oven dried 105 ºc overnight soil was spiked with 14c cap 1 25 μmol and 16 7 kbq in 5 g soil then incubated in a brown flask with the rh of 76 which was maintained by placing a cup of nacl saturated solution inside this dry incubation stage 25 ºc in darkness continued for one month during which stage cap was potentially hydrolyzed afterward 45 g dry weight fresh soil was added and well mixed the soil water content was re adjusted to the optimal moisture level for microbial degradation 22 33 and 35 wt wt for rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl respectively the optimal moisture levels were evaluated according to the soil texture and organic carbon content based on the report of schroll et al 2006 the soils were then compacted with a spatula to a volume equivalent to a soil density of 1 3 g cm3 the wet incubation stage 25 ºc in darkness lasted for another 2 months notably before starting the wet incubation stage the 3 fresh soils were pre wetted to re activate the indigenous microorganisms with the water content of 20 wt wt and 15 ºc in darkness for 2 weeks in addition a constant wet treatment group was set for comparison following the same procedure except that the 14c cap spiked soil did not experience the dry incubation stage but directly entered the wet incubation stage for 3 months the spiking concentration and radioactivity of 14c cap were the same as above 1 25 μmol and 16 7 kbq in 50 g soils during the incubation the flask was sealed with the rubber plug the produced 14co2 was absorbed by naoh solution 5 ml 1 m inside the flask which was sampled 3 times a week the radioactivity of the collected naoh was quantified on a tri carb 5110 tr liquid scintillation counter perkinelmer rodgau germany li et al 2015 finally the soil after incubation was sampled for analyzing the contents of extractable and non extractable residues li et al 2015 quadruplicate was set for the mineralization experiment the detailed information for analysis of 14co2 extractable and non extractable residues is presented in text s4 2 4 dna extraction sequencing and quantification after 3 month incubation the microbial community in the soil was analyzed to reflect the antibacterial effect by different water managements dry to wet and constant wet the fresh soil without spiking cap was also included for comparison the soil dna was extracted using a fastdna spin kit mpbio usa according to the manufacturer s protocol the v3 v4 hyper variable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified for each sample using two primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 the raw sequence analysis was carried out with the illumina miseq paired end 300 bp protocol illumina inc san diego ca usa at the centre for genomic research shanghai majorbio biotechnology co ltd china the raw sequence data were processed in qiime 1 9 2 caporaso et al 2010 the quality filtered sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus according to the 97 sequence similarity by usearch11 uparse edgar 2013 2 5 data analysis the hydrolytic degradation of cap during the dry incubation stage was fitted by the pseudo first order kinetics to gain the obvious hydrolysis rate constants k obs the heatmap of pearson correlation among soil properties and k obs the heatmap for relative abundances of bacterial community composition at genus level alpha diversity indices least significant difference analysis were carried out using r version 4 1 1 https www r project org with pheatmap corrplot vegan and agricolae packages respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of soil water content on cap hydrolysis the degradation kinetics of cap in the 7 first round tested soils with various water contents are shown in fig 1a c including the 3 soils rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl and figure s1 including the 4 soils rsm rsh ysm and ysh as indicated in fig 1a c only the 3 soils i e rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl with low som contents 20 mg l showed convincing catalytic performance for cap hydrolysis under low moisture conditions the highest degradation rates were obtained at the water contents of 0 5 1 2 2 1 5 0 1 1 5 6 wt wt for rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl respectively figure s2 table s3 under this moisture range 26 66 cap was degraded after 15 d reaction fig 1a c figure s3 and significant amounts of anp and dichloroacetic acid dca were identified as the main hydrolytic products the mass recovery in terms of cap anp made up 61 101 of the original total amount figure s4 since the soils were sterilized and no significant adsorption of cap was observed cap should be mainly degraded via abiotic hydrolysis pathway in the 3 tested soils the hydrolytic degradation followed the pseudo first order kinetics the obtained k obs and half lives are provided in table s3 while the hydrolysis reaction was greatly suppressed when the soil water content exceeded 6 wt wt figure s5 this phenomenon was also in accordance with our previous observation in the presence of kaolinite alumina oxides and iron minerals jin et al 2021 2019b wu et al 2021 in these systems the hydrolysis of cap was induced by surface hydrogen bonding and or lewis acid interaction and exhibited similar moisture sensitivity therefore the influence of water content on the catalytic hydrolysis of cap in actual soils suggests that kaolinite and al fe minerals might be the dominant mineral forms for the reaction of cap 3 2 soil properties dominating cap hydrolysis typically the som contents showed great impact on cap hydrolysis in the 7 first round tested soils fig 1a c and figure s1 except rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl the other 4 tested soils rsm rsh and ysm ysh with relatively high som contents 20 g kg did not exhibit strong catalytic activities under low moisture conditions figure s1 since the co existing natural organic matter would inhibit the reaction by competing for the reactive sites or sequestrating the pollutants jin et al 2021 wu et al 2021 to further verify this hypothesis additional 9 soils were introduced for degrading cap at rh 76 as shown in fig 1d the soil rsl 3 was more reactive followed by ppsl and lsl combining the 16 soils together the k obs values clearly showed a negative correlation to the log values of som figure 2a 2 g r 2 0 69 pearson r 0 73 p 0 001 however although the soils of ybsl dsl and fsl contained relatively low som contents 11 14 g kg table s1 their catalytic activities were still low suggesting that other soil properties also control this process saltzman et al 1974 smolen and stone 1998 wu et al 2021 therefore multiple soil properties were characterized including hno3 fe al oxalate fe dcb fe cry fe tiron al xrf fe al si ph som cec and clay content the definitions of these characters were described in the caption of fig 2 g these properties were correlated to the k obs by pearson correlation analysis as shown in fig 2 g the k obs showed significant positive correlations p 0 001 to the amounts of dcb fe r 2 0 41 pearson r 0 48 figure s6a cry fe r 2 0 43 pearson r 0 51 fig 2c trion al r 2 0 61 pearson r 0 44 fig 2d and xrf al r 2 0 61 pearson r 0 81 figure s6c indicating that the crystalline fe al species are responsible for the hydrolysis reaction therefore the low crystalline fe al contents e g cry fe 10 g kg trion al 3 g kg table s2 of ybsl dsl and fsl could explain their low catalytic activities the positive correlation between k obs and clay content r 2 0 17 pearson r 0 48 p 0 001 fig 2b was expected as phyllosilicate minerals showed strong catalytic activities under low moisture conditions jin et al 2021 2019b besides the k obs also exhibited significant negative correlations to soil ph r 2 0 42 pearson r 0 51 p 0 001 fig 2e and cec r 2 0 58 pearson r 0 62 p 0 001 fig 2f this result is consistent with the well known fact that soils with high amount of crystalline fe al usually possess low ph pionke and corey 1967 ye et al 2022 the negative correlation was further supported by the observation that soil ph showed a negative correlation to the contents of dcb fe cry fe and trion al pearson r 0 44 0 48 p 0 001 on the other hand the main determinants of cec in soils are clay and organic matter as both have negative charges to attract cations aprile and lorandi 2012 in this study the cec showed a significantly positive correlation to log som pearson r 0 69 p 0 001 rather than the clay content pearson r 0 27 p 0 01 it appears that soil ph and cec could be considered as the initial screening factors to indicate the catalytic hydrolysis capability of the soils by the way ysl performed abnormally high degradation rate for cap which is out of the linear range of the correlations we propose that cap might be additionally degraded via potential pathways other than hydrolysis which are currently unknown 3 3 effect of dry to wet treatment on cap mineralization we focused on the influence of dry to wet treatment on the mineralization of cap for the 3 soils rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl which had displayed significant abiotic hydrolysis capacities fig 1a c 14c labelled cap was used to trace its mineralization and residue formation fig 3 indicates that during the one month dry incubation stage the production of 14co2 was negligible as entering the wet incubation stage remarkable mineralization was observed which was attributed to the increased bioavailability of contaminants and the high microbial activity compared to the constant wet control samples the mineralization rates increased significantly for all the 3 soils after the dry incubation fig 3 implying that the hydrolytic products were more easily metabolized by soil microorganisms than cap itself since the applied 14c cap is radioactive labeled at the dichloroacetamide group its hydrolytic product 14c dca is still radioactive labeled while the other half product anp is not in the later stage of the dry to wet group d w the mineralization rate of each soil came to an inflection point after which the mineralization rate reduced to the same level as the constant wet group w probably because the 14c dca had been consumed up finally the rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl treated with sequential dry to wet incubation had the total mineralization ratios of 34 8 62 5 and 52 4 respectively in comparison the rsl 1 rsl 2 and ysl treated with constant wet incubation only obtained 24 4 43 0 and 29 3 mineralization respectively to evaluate the environmental risk of cap after the dry to wet treatment the extractable and non extractable 14c residues were quantified as a result the dry to wet group exhibited less extractable residues and more non extractable residues than the constant wet group fig 4a the formation of non extractable fraction in soil is commonly regarded as a detoxification process gevao et al 2000 li et al 2015 therefore the environmental risk of cap should be reduced after the dry to wet treatment furthermore the concentrations of residual cap and anp in the extractable fraction after 3 months incubation were also analyzed fig 4b notably one cap molecule precursor produces one anp if cap is degraded via the hydrolysis pathway while the co metabolism of cap by microbes does not yield anp as an intermediate zhang et al 2020 2022 herein the soils treated with sequential dry to wet incubation had much less cap residue and significantly higher yield of anp compared to the constant wet group indicating that the hydrolysis reaction accounts for an important degradation process for the dry to wet treatment since the produced anp was not radioactive labeled the extractable radioactivity involving 14c cap 14c dca and other 14c intermediates in the dry to wet group was lower than the sum concentrations of cap and anp expressed as percentages of the spiking radioactivity and cap concentration respectively fig 4b by contrast for the constant wet group less amount of anp was detected and the percentage of extractable radioactivity was higher than the total recovery of cap and anp except for rsl 1 fig 4b this result suggests that soil microorganisms co metabolized cap during the wet incubation stage to produce 14c residues other than anp microbial degradation instead of abiotic hydrolysis mainly contributes to cap degradation at high moisture conditions although anp might be still persistent in the soils like rsl 1 and ysl the sum concentrations of anp cap in the dry to wet group were significantly lower than those in the constant wet group fig 4b it further confirmed that periodical low soil moisture treatment can enhance the dissipation of cap in the soils especially in rsl 2 cap was completely degraded only 8 of the degraded cap was recovered as anp after the dry to wet treatment this enhanced degradation of cap in soil can be attributed to abiotic hydrolysis caused by soil minerals the hydrolysis products are more easily metabolized than cap itself 3 4 changes in the bacterial community composition it is well recognized that the alpha diversity is essential to reflect the microbial diversity in response of antibiotic stress nguyen et al 2020 in this study abundance based coverage estimator ace index and shannon indices were chosen to represent the richness and diversity of bacterial community components compared to the fresh soils either the dry to wet or constant wet treatment reduced the levels of ace and shannon indices in the soils fig 5a 5b which might be explained by the contamination with high amount of cap 0 025 μmol g while for rsl 2 the shannon index followed the opposite trend since rsl 2 performed the highest cap mineralization and the lowest residue fig 4 the anomalous rise of shannon index level in rsl 2 could be ascribed to the vigorous growth of the bacteria by utilizing cap and its hydrolytic products anp and dca it was reported that the dry to wet moisture alternation would decrease the shannon index of agricultural soils qi et al 2021 even though the hydrologic history and agricultural water management had trained the resistance and resilience of soil bacterial community peralta et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 while in this study the levels of ace and shannon indices in the dry to wet group were higher than those of the constant wet group except the ace index of ysl fig 5a 5b this should be attributed to the abiotic hydrolysis of cap during the dry incubation stage fig 1a c which decreased the antimicrobial stress to the bacterial community fang et al 2014 for the exception of ysl the original bacterial abundance in ysl soil was extremely low below the qpcr detection limit and there might be absent of anp degraders fig 4b as anp also has bacteriostatic activity chennakesava rao et al 2014 therefore the change of bacterial community suggests that the dry to wet treatment could relieve the antibiotic stress attributing to abiotic degradation of cap the bacterial community composition of the predominant genera showed significant difference among different soil types fig 5c obviously soil type is the decisive factor to shape the bacterial community structure either the dry to wet group or the constant wet group was separated from the fresh soil group for each soil type reflecting the impact of cap on the community composition notably the dry to wet group and the constant wet group were clearly separated in rsl 1 and rsl 2 except ysl probably due to the different responses of bacterial communities to the growth substrates cap and its hydrolytic products therefore the relative abundances of the top 10 genera of each soil were compared to reveal the potential degraders of cap and its hydrolytic products in response to the different moisture treatments based on the analysis including kruskal wallis rank sum test fdr correction and tukey kramer post hoc test the relative abundance of some genera e g rhodococcus and ramlibacter in rsl 1 fig 6a decreased in both moisture treatments compared to the fresh soil due to the stress by the introduction of cap the abundances of edaphobacter and methylobacterium methylorubrum were relatively higher after the constant wet treatment e g in rsl 1 and rsl 2 indicating their growth capacity in cap contaminated soils in rsl 2 the relative abundance of burkholderia caballeronia paraburkholderia norank f longimicrobiaceae and frateuria increased after the dry to wet treatment which might be held responsible for the degradation and bio assimilation of the cap hydrolytic products instead of cap while the abundance of the other 6 genera i e edaphobacter sphingomonas bradyrhizobium methylobacterium methylorubrum amycolatopsis and granulicella increased after the constant wet treatment which might degrade cap as the host of cap degrading genes fig 6b for instance sphingomonas has been reported to carry the cap degrading gene zhang et al 2020 2022 therefore the abiotic hydrolysis of cap in the dry incubation stage might inhibit the growth of dominant cap degrading genera for the following wet incubation stage of rsl 2 likewise the spread of cap degrading genes might be suppressed the soil of ysl performed the highest abiotic hydrolytic activity for cap fig 1c while it was badly active to metabolize the hydrolytic product anp the considerable mineralization ratio 52 36 for the dry to wet group should be ascribed to the microbial co metabolizing 14c dca fig 4c the dominant genera of amycolatopsis mucilaginibacter and nocardia might utilize dca for growth in general the cap metabolic pathways during the dry to wet treatment might be distinct from the constant wet treatment which can be reflected in bacterial community composition the decline of alpha diversity of bacterial community stressed by cap can be alleviated by the dry to wet treatment and the bacterial responsible for the degradation of cap or anp may play an important role in the shift of bacterial community composition conclusion in this study we applied 16 actual soils to investigate the key soil properties dominating the abiotic hydrolysis of cap and demonstrated that the actual soils with low som content 20 g kg high amounts of crystalline fe al mineral could promote strong abiotic hydrolysis reaction for cap under the conditions with low soil water content 0 5 6 wt wt the soil ph and cec could be chosen as the initial screening indicators notably red soils hold the highest potential for abiotic transformation of cap the occurrence of soil mineral induced abiotic hydrolysis in arid soil reveals an overlooked natural attenuation pathway for antibiotics which might give a new explanation for the relatively low residue concentrations of some antibiotics in the top soil than those in the subsurface soil beyond biodegradation and photolysis wang et al 2020 wei et al 2016 wolters and steffens 2005 soil moisture fluctuation has shown significant impact on transformation of soil organic pollutants however most of the previous studies focused on wet to flood fluctuation of soil water content chen et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 jin et al 2019a it has never been reported whether the degradation of soil contaminants can be promoted by alternating the soil moisture from extreme dry wc 5 wt wt to optimal wet state wc 20 wt wt hence this research is a pioneer study to provide evidence that dry to wet treatment can greatly enhance the mineralization of some hydrolysable organic pollutants in field soils given that the open field soils often undergo repeated drying and wetting cycles the natural attenuation of some antibiotics and other potential organic pollutants can be accelerated this finding also suggests that appropriate wastewater irrigation management or agricultural water management can facilitate the removal of antibiotics from both wastewater and soils declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

14746,advanced oxidation technologies based on periodate pi io4 have garnered significant attention in water decontamination in this work we found that electrochemical activation using graphite electrodes e gp can significantly accelerate the degradation of micropollutants by pi the e gp pi system achieved almost complete removal of bisphenol a bpa within 15 min exhibited unprecedented ph tolerance ranging from ph 3 0 to 9 0 and showed more than 90 bpa depletion after 20 h of continuous operation additionally the e gp pi system can realize the stoichiometric transformation of pi into iodate dramatically decreasing the formation of iodinated disinfection by products mechanistic studies confirmed that singlet oxygen 1o2 is the primary reactive oxygen species in the e gp pi system a comprehensive evaluation of the oxidation kinetics of 1o2 with 15 phenolic compounds revealed a dual descriptor model based on quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis the model corroborates that pollutants exhibiting strong electron donating capabilities and high pk a values are more susceptible to attack by 1o2 through a proton transfer mechanism the unique selectivity induced by 1o2 in the e gp pi system allows it to exhibit strong resistance to aqueous matrices thus this study demonstrates a green system for the sustainable and effective elimination of pollutants while providing mechanistic insights into the selective oxidation behaviour of 1o2 graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemical activation periodate singlet oxygen qsar phenols data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction frequent detection of emerging organic contaminants eocs in water calls for the exploration of high efficiency and long lasting water treatment technologies as they will pose undesirable effects to human health and ecological environment advanced oxidation processes aops are considered as one of the most promising pathways to control eocs where highly reactive oxygen species ros are formed to transform and mineralize eocs widely studied aops like the fenton and fenton like reactions primarily utilize the generation of hydroxy radicals oh and sulfate radical so4 from hydrogen peroxide h2o2 persulfate and ozone which are capable of oxidizing almost all the organic pollutants without discrimination ren et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however the high oxidation ability of these radicals results in the disadvantage associated with their low resistance to naturally occurring substances such as humic acid ha halide ions and bicarbonate li et al 2016 zhu et al 2020 the critical obstacle impedes the actual application of radical based aops consequently there has been significant interest in the field regarding the strategic manipulation of the chemical reactivity of oxidizing species to achieve selective oxidation of pollutants particularly in the development of non radical oxidation systems periodate pi io4 with a high oxidation potential e 0 1 60 v has recently attracted significant interest in the field of water decontamination owing to its inherent advantages in terms of ease of storage and transportation chen et al 2022 guo et al 2022 he et al 2022 although the application of pi is largely hampered by its potential to release iodine species it can be solved by regulating the decomposition pathway of pi to minimize the production of harmful iodine species zong et al 2021 yet alone pi mediated oxidation process fails to oxidize eocs effectively lee and yoon 2004 many strategies have been proposed to intensify the oxidative ability of pi via stimulating the formation of various ros e g oh iodate radical io3 superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 eqs 1 5 or inducing direct electron transfer activation of pi bokare and choi 2015 choi et al 2018 lee et al 2014 liu et al 2022 long et al 2021 these strategies mainly include ultrasound lee et al 2016 transition metal oxides chatraei and zare 2013 carbonaceous materials long et al 2022 and photoactivation liu et al 2022 although the above methods succeed in improving the oxidation capacity of pi they also lead to the formation of secondary pollutant and increase energy consumption moreover these methods still face challenges in activating pi over a wide ph range for instance metal involved catalysts such as mno2 du et al 2020 co single atomic catalyst long et al 2021 ru co2o3 zhang et al 2023 and s zvi0 zong et al 2022 are viable candidates for accelerating the degradation of micropollutants by pi but their ph effectiveness range is limited to acidic conditions as such it is necessary to design pi based aops with strong resistance to reaction ph in order to extend their applicability 1 io4 energy io3 o 2 o h oh 3 3io4 2oh 2o2 3io3 h2o 4 2o2 2h2o h2o2 1o2 2oh 5 io4 2o2 h2o io3 2oh 21o2 over the past few decades electrochemical processes have been introduced in aops for efficient activation as they are environmentally friendly energy efficient use friendly and suitable for automation son et al 2021 song et al 2021 during electro activation the electric field can provide electrons as co catalysts to activate the oxidant thereby inducing the formation of ros and successfully avoiding the risks associated with exogenous catalysts long et al 2023 for instance yao et al proposed that the electrochemically activated peroxymonosulfate pms system exhibits strong reactivity in degrading contaminants and performs effectively over a wide ph range 3 0 11 0 yao et al 2021 thus it is expected that pi can also be activated by the electrochemical method over a broad ph range however knowledge in this field is still limited as far as we know only one recent research has demonstrated the feasibility of establishing an electro activated pi oxidation process in which nano confined fe2o3 was used as a working electrode to accelerate the removal of bisphenol a bpa by pi guo et al 2022 however the performance of the electro fe2o3 cnt pi system reduces under alkaline conditions considering that metal based catalysts generally suffer limitations in ph dependent catalytic activity chen et al 2021 son et al 2021 using a metal based working electrode to activate pi may be not the optimal choice graphite gp is a cheap and easily accessible non metallic electrode material that has attracted much attention in electrochemical aops due to its low oxygen evolution potential and high hydrogen evolution potential song et al reported that electrochemical activation of pms using gp electrodes can completely degrade sulfamethoxazole smx within 30 min song et al 2020 therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that using gp working electrodes for electrochemical activation of pi e gp pi can significantly enhance the removal of micropollutants however the performance of the e gp pi system has not been fully demonstrated and there is a lack of knowledge on its ph tolerance and application potentiality thus the objective of the study is to investigate the oxidation activity and reaction mechanism of the e gp pi system to our delight the e gp pi system characterized by the dominance of non radical ros not only can effectively and selectively degrade contaminants but also shows outstanding ph adaptation transcending other pi based aops currently reported the electro activation mechanism was fully discussed by demonstrating the main ros and the transformation pathway of pi by revealing the activity differences of the system in degrading 15 phenolic compounds with different substituent groups a new quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model was proposed to reveal the selective activity of the primary ros thus shedding light on the selective oxidation mechanism finally the application potential of the e gp pi system and the degradation pathways of bpa were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals unless otherwise

experiments the e gp pi oxidation process for degradation of organic pollutants was carried out in a 250 ml glass beaker and magnetic stirring 250 rpm was used to maintain mass transfer of the material covering the electrode surface the background electrolyte was 20 mm na2so4 in addition a gp anode and a gp cathode were used as the working electrodes which were fixed at a gap of 5 cm the gp electrodes before use were pretreated in deionized water and acetone 1 1 v v by an ultrasonic process to remove any potential impurities from the electrode surfaces degradation experiments were performed at 25 1 c maintained with a water bath and connected by a direct current supply the initial reaction ph was adjusted using 0 1 m h2so4 and or 0 2 m naoh unless stated otherwise the current was set to 30 ma organic pollutant degradation was initiated by simultaneously adding bpa and naio4 during the electrochemical process approximately 1 5 ml of water sample was collected at a

electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy the sosg fluorescence signal was captured by fluorescence spectrophotometry other analytic methods are described in texts s2 s6 2 4 details of theoretical calculations density functional theory dft calculations using the gaussian 16 package were employed to research the molecular structure characteristics of bpa specific procedures are described in text s7 3 results and discussion 3 1 bpa degradation performance of the e gp pi system bpa an endocrine disruptor is frequently detected in surface and underground water environments rahman et al 2021 and was selected as a model contaminant to evaluate the oxidative activity of the e gp pi system as shown in fig 1 a the control experiment with pi alone exhibited negligible reactivity for bpa removal within 15 min 14 2 bpa was degraded by the e gp system which should be attributed to the direct electron transfer from the gp electrode surface intriguingly bpa was completely degraded by the e gp pi oxidation process 100 suggesting that the electric field with gp electrodes can activate pi to produce ros thereby accelerating bpa depletion previous studies have reported that carbonaceous materials like biochar and fe n co doped carbonaceous catalyst possess activity for activating pi he et al 2022 xiao et al 2022 hence activation of pi by gp electrodes without current induction was studied fig 1a shows that bpa removal by the gp pi system is insignificant implying that the high reactivity of the e gp pi system does not derive from the catalytic contribution of gp additionally when gp electrode was replaced by the pt electrode the e pt pi system achieved 82 5 bpa removal within 15 min demonstrating the potential of electrolysis in activating pi the more prominent performance of the e gp pi system may be related to the strong electroconductibility and large specific surface area of gp electrode which would lead to faster mass transfer between the electrode surface and pi thus inducing effective activation to demonstrate the superiority of the e gp pi system the decay kinetics of bpa in other systems were evaluated including e gp h2o2 e gp pms e gp peroxydisulfate pds e gp peracetic acid paa and e gp permanganate pm systems as shown in fig 1a the lowest removal of bpa in the e gp h2o2 system may be related to the strong bond energy for cleaving the o o bond in h2o2 213 3 kj mol 1 peidong hu 2016 compared with the e gp pds system the e gp pi system had superior performance in the removal of bpa which may be associated with the longer i o bond in pi 1 79 å than the o o bond in pds 1 47 å hans and basil 1993 long et al 2021 nie et al 2020 the e gp paa e gp pms and e gp pm systems exhibited inferior bpa removal than the e gp pi system this difference could be attributed to the strong affinity between the gp electrode and pi resulting in faster pi decomposition and thus producing more ros figure s1 overall the above results collectively indicate that the e gp pi system may be a feasible and promising strategy for the abatement of organic compounds with relatively satisfactory efficacy the influence of current intensity on bpa removal was discussed figure s2a shows that increasing the current intensity from 0 01 a to 0 03 a in the e gp pi system led to a corresponding increase in bpa degradation from 24 9 to 100 however no further enhancement in removal was observed beyond a current density of 0 03 a possibly attributable to the occurrence of water electrolysis at high current densities figure s2b illustrates the impact of initial pi content on the elimination of bpa bpa removal was enhanced from 87 5 0 2 mm pi to 100 0 7 mm pi indicating that an elevated dose of pi promotes the generation of ros to expedite bpa depletion in addition the influence of reaction ph on bpa removal was evaluated by adjusting the initial ph from 3 0 to 9 0 higher ph values were not considered in consideration of the alkali mediated activation of pi bokare and choi 2015 interestingly the oxidation activity of the e gp pi system exhibited ph independent behavior achieving complete bpa degradation within 15 min over at ph 3 0 9 0 the ph independent behavior of the e gp pi does not arise from changes either in the reactivity of the pi alone and e gp systems or from changes in ph during bpa removal figure s3 the strong ph tolerance of the e gp pi systems may be attributed to two aspects on the one hand the electric field may be effective in activating h4io6 and h3io6 2 without differences in catalytic activity as they are the major species of pi at ph 3 0 9 0 pk a1 0 98 pk a2 7 42 pk a3 10 99 fig 1c valkai et al 2017 the speculation can be verified by the similar pi consumption at different ph figure s4 on the other hand the primary ros in the e gp pi system may exhibit a low ph dependent response in the oxidation of microcontaminants the exceptional ph tolerance of the e gp pi system highlights a considerable advancement over traditional pi activation methods such as metal based and carbonaceous material based pi oxidation processes fig 1d and table s2 in other words in comparison to other recently reported pi activation systems the e gp pi system exhibited outstanding potential for treating organic wastewater over a wide ph range 3 2 identifying ros generation routes according to previous studies various ros such as oh io3 o2 1o2 and direct electron transfer may be responsible for the removal of bpa in the e gp pi system here quenching experiments were carried out to confirm the involvement of the above ros tba a scavenger of oh k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 was employed to verify the role of oh hu et al 2017 the results shown in fig 2 a suggest that the presence of 100 mm tba poses a negligible effect on bpa removal indicating that bpa degradation in the e gp pi system is not dependent on oh given that oh can react with terephthalic acid tpa through a h abstraction pathway resulting in the formation of a distinctive product of p hydroxyterephthalic acid htpa tpa has been widely employed as a chemical probe to investigate the kinetics of oh generation and accumulation in various aops zhou et al 2020 no htpa formation was observed in the chromatograms of the e gp and e gp pi systems during tpa degradation figure s5 further confirming the negligible production of oh moreover epr spectrum using dmpo as a trapping agent did not detect the characteristic signals of dmpo oh 1 2 2 1 αn 14 8 g αh 12 8 g figure s6 all the results clearly demonstrate that oh is not the ros in the e gp pi system ffa which can scavenge 1o2 with a reaction rate constant of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 was introduced in the e gp pi system to assess the contribution of 1o2 he et al 2022 fig 2a illustrates that the addition of ffa 100 mm markedly suppresses the bpa degradation from 100 to 11 4 in the presence of excess ffa 11 4 bpa depletion could be attributed to the direct electron transfer reaction considering that pi may be directly consumed by ffa to inhibit bpa removal the consumption of pi by ffa was examined the low reactivity of ffa with pi shown in figure s7 suggests that the inhibitory effect of ffa on bpa removal should be associated with the competition of ffa and bpa for 1o2 as reported in previous studies 1o2 can oxidize ffa to form three representative products i e c5h6o4 m z 129 0183 in esi negative mode c4h4o3 m z 99 0075 in esi negative mode c5h6o3 m z 113 0242 in esi negative mode yang et al 2019 therefore we further examined the formation of 1o2 in the e gp pi system by examining the degradation products of ffa as depicted in figure s8 the characteristic mass spectra of the three ffa degradation products oxidized by 1o2 were measured and are presented the generation of 1o2 in the e gp pi system was further confirmed through epr spectroscopy using temp as a trapping agent for 1o2 a triplet peak signal with a strength ratio of 1 1 1 αn 7 2 g and αh 4 1 g of temp 1o2 was captured fig 2b suggesting the formation of 1o2 in the e gp pi system more convincing evidence was presented through the detection of transformation product of sosg oxidized by 1o2 namely sosg endoperoxide which can emit green fluorescence with a maximum at 528 nm a gradual increase fluorescence intensity at 528 nm was observed providing further evidence for the formation and accumulation of 1o2 in the e gp pi system fig 2c taken together these results fully illustrate the involvement of 1o2 in the e gp pi system previous studies have suggested that in pi based aops the formation of 1o2 may occur through the combination of o2 or the reaction between pi and molecular o2 eqs 4 and 6 bokare and choi 2015 therefore o2 and o2 may be the crucial intermediates in 1o2 formation nevertheless despite the sustainable input of n2 to remove o2 from the reaction solution the degradation kinetics of both bpa and ffa by the e gp pi system did not appear to be significantly affected figures s9 and 2d these observations imply that o2 is not a prerequisite for 1o2 formation to verify whether o2 was produced and subsequently involved in 1o2 formation we compared the depletion of bpa in the presence and absence of bq a scavenger of o2 k 0 9 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2022 a significant inhibitory effect was obtained with the addition of 5 mm of bq fig 2a moreover ffa degradation caused by 1o2 was significantly reduced in the presence of 5 mm bq fig 2d which corroborates that the production of o2 in the e gp pi system contributes to the generation of 1o2 given the formation and subsequent transformation of o2 to 1o2 h2o2 may be a secondary product in the e gp pi system according to eq 4 bokare and choi 2015 cheng et al have reported that h2o2 can activate pi to produce oh and 1o2 thus accelerating the degradation of micropollutants kim et al 2022 however figure s10 shows the negligible formation of h2o2 in the e gp pi system and that the addition of catalase a reagent for h2o2 decomposition exerts a low influence on bpa removal indicating the low contribution of h2o2 in the e gp pi system moreover the coexistence of o2 and h2o2 will initiate the haber weiss mechanism to form oh eq 7 however as we have discussed previously the contribution of oh in the e gp pi system has been fully ruled out the finding further excludes the involvement of h2o2 in the e gp pi system and denies the pathway described in eq 4 for producing 1o2 6 io4 o2 2oh io3 2o2 h2o 7 o2 h2o2 oh oh o2 8 2 i o 4 2 e electrochemical activation 2 i o 3 o 2 additionally although a direct method to confirm the contribution of io3 is still lacking the quenching experiments shown in fig 2a indirectly demonstrate the low importance of io3 since ffa completely suppressed bpa removal previous research demonstrated the inertness of io3 with 2 4 6 trichlorophenol lee et al 2014 but our work observed an accelerated removal of 2 4 6 tcp with the introduction of pi in the e gp system figure s11 further confirming the negligible role of io3 in the e gp pi system based on our experimental results and previous studies the working mechanisms of the e gp pi system are proposed firstly in the presence of an electric field io4 on gp electrode surface is rapidly converted to io3 while producing o2 eq 8 the conjecture can be substantiated by the stoichiometric conversion of io4 to io3 which is independent of the initial pi concentration figure s12 it should be noted that the electrochemical activation process cannot further activate io3 to degrade bpa suggesting that the contribution of io3 in the oxidation process is not significant figure s13 then the formed o2 can react with io4 to form 1o2 eq 5 which is the primary ros responsible for bpa removal in the e gp pi system 3 3 selective oxidation qsar model of 1o2 oxidation to gain further mechanistic insights into the oxidation kinetics of 1o2 the degradation of 15 phenolic compounds by the e gp pi system were assessed the corresponding reaction rate constants k obs are calculated and are listed in table s3 and figure s14 control experiments using alone pi failed to remove all the tested phenolic compounds but the e gp pi system could degrade all the organic compounds and showed different k obs values of the tested phenolic pollutants the e gp pi system exhibited the highest reactivity in removing hydroquinone and mequinol but was slightly sluggish to react with 2 nitrophenol indicating the selective activity of 1o2 for contaminants removal fig 3 a the oxidation behavior of contaminants in aops is intricately linked to their chemical structure and physical properties dalizza et al 2002 molecular descriptors such as the n octanol water partition constant kow dissociation constant pka and substituent constant can effectively illustrate the variations in the organic compounds chemical structure and physicochemical properties fei et al 2018 lee and von gunten 2012 kow which reflects the migration and transformation of substances in environmental media has been employed to quantitatively elucidate the correlation between the oxidation kinetic of oh and the hydrophobicity of targeted pollutants to be specific fei et al proposed that polychlorinated dibenzodioxins with high kow values exhibit strong resistant to oh oxidation fei et al 2018 hence we surmised that kow is a crucial parameter in predicting the oxidative activity of 1o2 with phenolic compounds nevertheless the e gp pi oxidation process revealed a weak correlation between logkow and the corresponding k obs figure s15 implying that the selective oxidation governed by 1o2 is not associated with the hydrophobicity of the organic pollutants the hammett substituent descriptors including σ σ and σ are critical experimental parameters for understanding the connection between reactivity and chemical structures containing aromatic rings lee and von gunten 2012 luo et al 2022 of these σ serves as a quantitative measure of the electron donating capability of substituents organic compounds with electron donating groups demonstrate lower σ values whereas those with electron withdrawing groups exhibit higher σ values as shown in fig 3b logk obs shows a linear decrease with σ indicating the occurrence of a typical electrophilic interaction between 1o2 and substituted phenols eq 9 similar to the hammett constant the ionization potential ip is also generally used as an indicator of the electron donating characteristics of pollutants previous studies have demonstrated that ip is associated with the reaction rates of specific systems hu et al 2017 luo et al 2023 to validate the electrophilic characteristic of 1o2 we conducted further investigations to examine the relation between the reaction rate and ip figure s16a illustrates a linear correlation between these two variables the results provide additional evidence regarding the electrophilic oxidation character of 1o2 however it is worth noting that the σ r2 0 74 constant displays a stronger linear association compared to the ip r2 0 70 implying that σ may be more suitable for elucidating the selective oxidation dynamics of 1o2 previous research has suggested that if the rate limiting step of the oxidation reaction involves a proton transfer process the k obs can be significantly affected by the pk a of organic contaminants tekle rottering et al 2016 similarly there is a positive linear relationship between logk obs and pk a in the e gp pi system r2 0 60 figure s16b the correlation observed between logk obs and pk a suggests that the proton transfer pathway is the rate limiting step for the oxidation of phenolic compounds by 1o2 the secondary kinetic isotope effect kie is generally utilized to elucidate the rate determining step of a reaction by replacing an h atom with its isotope in a bond that remains intact during the rate limiting process gomez gallego and sierra 2011 the substitution process alters the zero point energy due to the greater rigidity of the out of plane bending vibration in a c h bon compared to that of a c d bond potentially influencing the reaction rate thus we employed the secondary kie to gain further insights into the oxidation mechanism of 1o2 the degradation of phenol and phenol d 5 by the e gp pi system was compared typically an oxidation system with a high kie value ranging from 2 to 7 primarily oxidizes contaminants through a proton transfer mechanism while the opposite occurs via an electron transfer process gomez gallego and sierra 2011 the kie value of the e gp pi system was 2 37 fig 3c the phenomenon proves that the oxidation of aromatic compounds by 1o2 is dominated by a proton transfer mechanism 9 log k obs 1 45 0 09 1 17 0 17 σ r 2 0 74 10 log k obs 2 82 1 34 0 91 0 30 σ 0 15 0 14 p k a r 2 8 0 the above analysis suggests that the degradation rate of various phenolic compounds by 1o2 depends on their electron donating activity and degree of dissociation to better understand the intrinsic mechanism we attempt to investigate the relationship of k obs with σ and pk a using a dual descriptor model a more desirable correlation was presented based on the dual descriptor model r2 0 80 eq 10 and fig 3d further confirming that both the σ and pk a of organic pollutants affects their reaction behavior with 1o2 given that σ slope 0 91 0 30 has a steeper slope than pk a slope 0 15 0 14 it is probable that the oxidation activity of 1o2 to attack organic pollutants is more sensitive to σ than pk a therefore our findings imply that the kinetics of 1o2 to attack phenolic compounds in the e gp pi system depends on the ability of the targeted contaminants to donate electrons and the degree of dissociation with the former being the determinant 3 4 application advantages of the e gp pi system the influence of concomitant ions and humic acid ha on the reactivity of the e gp pi system for bpa removal was evaluated different from radical based aops no evident suppression on bpa abatement was observed when other inorganic constituents i e no3 so4 2 cl hco3 and hpo4 2 were introduced and the presence of 25 mg l ha suggested a low restriction on bpa removal fig 4 a these findings indicate the excellent resistance of the e gp pi system in complex water matrices it is worth noting that although hco3 is a quencher of o2 hco3 o2 co3 o2 2 bokare and choi 2015 the presence of 5 mm hco3 indicates a negligible influence on bpa removal this may be related to the fact that the reaction between pi and o2 is faster than the reaction between hco3 and o2 resulting in a low contribution to inhibit bpa depletion besides degradation experiments were conducted in real water samples to further evaluate the application prospect of the system 100 bpa removal was achieved in river water and lake water fig 4b indicating that the e gp pi oxidation process with 1o2 as the main ros was slightly affected by actual water matrixes our previous findings have shown the remarkable ph applicability of the e gp pi system similar results were also observed in the treatment of actual samples which further implies its superiority in practical applications fig s17 energy utilization efficiency is a pivotal parameter reflecting the energy consumption of electro based wastewater technologies the electric energy per order ee o of the e gp pi system under optimized conditions was calculated and the details are shown in text s4 the ee o value of the e gp pi system was 0 0488 kwh m 3 which is significantly lower than other electro based oxidation processes recorded in previous literatures guo et al 2022 long et al 2023 the low energy consumption further demonstrates the application potential of the e gp pi system in addition achieving long lasting catalytic performance is critical for actual treatment process to assess the long term reactivity of the system we constructed a continuous flow reactor where bpa and pi were mixed and continuously injected into the electrochemical reaction apparatus fig 4c reaction samples were freshly collected at 0 5 h intervals the removal of bpa by the e gp pi system remained a high efficiency after 10 h of treatment 98 6 however the performance gradually deteriorated with bpa removal rates of 84 4 and 33 3 achieved after 15 and 20 h of reaction respectively fig 4d the reduced handling capacity of the system may be associated with the accumulation of bpa degradation products and io3 on graphite electrode surface which impedes the catalytic process in order to address the above problem we attempted to use an ultrasonic cleaning approach to remove impurities from the two reaction electrodes after 5 h of each treatment satisfactorily the e gp pi system was still able to remove 90 7 bpa after 20 h of reaction generally carbon corrosion which results from the thermodynamic instability of carbon under oxidative conditions limits the long lasting use of carbon based electrodes qiao et al 2018 figure s18 shows the increase in surface oxide species content and slight corrosion of the gp surface after 20 h of reaction therefore the slight decrease in system effectiveness may be caused by the carbon corrosion of gp electrodes affecting its electrical conductivity and specific surface area in order to further improve the corrosion resistance of the gp working electrode further surface modification is preferred in future work 3 5 products analysis and toxicity assessment 3 5 1 bpa degradation mechanisms to investigate the degradation mechanism of bpa in the e gp pi system we detected the transformation products of bpa using uplc qtof ms ms a total of 13 transformation products tps were identified based on their accurate mass and fragment ions and no iodine degradation products of bpa was detected figure s19 furthermore the absence of 4 iodophenol and 2 iodophenol during phenol degradation indicates that no hoi was generated in the e gp pi system figure s20 these results highlight the low risk of the e gp pi system in producing iodinated disinfection byproducts to identify the active sites of bpa the condensed fukui index f of bpa was calculated and depicted in fig 5 the results showed that c6 f 0 0428 c27 f 0 0428 c1 f 0 0372 c23 f 0 0374 c3 f 0 0340 and c20 f 0 0340 with relatively high f values are the most active sites of bpa based on the fukui index and the detected products three degradation pathways of bpa oxidized by 1o2 in the e gp pi system were proposed in fig 5 1o2 as a selective oxidation species tends to attack electrophilic sites with high fukui index duan et al 2018 in pathway i tp1 m z 259 0976 and tp2 m z 243 1031 were produced when the benzene ring of the bpa molecule was oxidized via the nucleophilic addition of 1o2 to the c1 and c23 sites furthermore owing to the high electron rich nature of the hydroxyl group the hydroxylation process can further excite the benzene ring of bpa antoniou 2010 thus facilitating the formation of the tri hydroxylation product tp3 m z 275 0928 to further break down the polyhydroxylated bpa tp2 undergoes a dehydration pathway that converts it into tp4 m z 241 0875 which has a quinone structure the hydroxylated products mentioned above can then be further attacked by 1o2 through ring opening reactions resulting in the formation of tp5 m z 265 0761 tp6 m z 237 0771 and tp7 m z 191 0721 in addition to the hydroxylation reaction process the c3 site of bpa with a high f can also be oxidized by 1o2 specifically the reaction leads to the cleavage of the c c bond at the c3 site resulting in the formation of 4 isopropylphenol radical the radical is then converted to tp8 m z 132 0581 and tp9 m z 93 0351 through a series of electron rearrangements tp9 can further be oxidized to produce hydroquinone tp10 m z 107 0141 pathway iii involves the demethylation of bpa leading to the formation of tp11 m z 213 0926 which will be further oxidized to form tp12 m z 228 0792 and tp13 m z 175 0503 though a series of hydroxylation ring opening and demethylation reactions finally these transformation intermediates may be further mineralized into other small molecules such as co2 and h2o 3 5 2 toxicological assessment the mutagenicity acute toxicity bioaccumulation factor and developmental toxicity of bpa and its degradation intermediates were assessed by the t e s t based on qsar prediction the ld50 of bpa is 4108 99 mg kg 3 intermediates showed lower toxicity than bpa but 10 intermediates had higher toxicity than bpa indicating that the e gp pi system partially reduced the toxicity of bpa but some products remained highly toxic figure s21a the bioaccumulation factor of bpa is 117 27 and all products have lower bioaccumulation factors than bpa figure s21b besides the treatment of the e gp pi system resulted in the formation of 6 developmental non toxicants figure s21c all the intermediates belonged to mutagenicity negative compounds fig s21d to further analyze the impact of the e gp pi system on the toxicity of bpa we calculated the bioluminescence inhibition rates of bpa before and after treatment as shown in fig s22 the bioluminescence inhibition rate of bpa was 78 51 and decreased to 48 82 after the treatment of the e gp pi system indicating that the 1o2 based oxidation process employed by the e gp pi system could partially detoxify bpa 4 conclusion this study unveiled the great potential of the electro activation pi using gp electrodes as a robust and sustainable strategy for degrading organic pollutants unlike traditional pi based aops that exhibit ph dependent performance the e gp pi system suggested remarkable ph tolerance moreover the e gp pi system performed well in complex water matrices and demonstrated long lasting activity in removing bpa by cleaning the residue from electrode surfaces the quantitative transformation of pi to io3 significantly reduced the secondary risk of the e gp pi system in producing iodine disinfection byproducts the safe efficient and sustainable nature of the e gp pi system underscores its great potential for the treatment of organic wastewater mechanistic research fully demonstrated that 1o2 a typical selective oxidation species is responsible for the degradation of bpa in the e gp pi system and that o2 is a crucial intermediate for the formation of 1o2 by investigating the effects of organic contaminants characteristics on their reactivity to be oxidized by 1o2 we proposed a dual descriptor model that demonstrates a tendency for 1o2 to selectively oxidize organic phenolic compounds with high electron donating capacity and high dissociation degree the critical information is of great importance for improving our understanding of the oxidation kinetics of 1o2 and for optimizing the applied range of 1o2 dominated oxidation processes in treating real effluents however efforts should be made to further improve the pi utilization efficiency and oxidation activity of the e gp pi system for instance by applying flow configurations to maximize mass transport and by modifying electrodes through spatial confinement or nonmetal doping to optimize ros generation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

14746,advanced oxidation technologies based on periodate pi io4 have garnered significant attention in water decontamination in this work we found that electrochemical activation using graphite electrodes e gp can significantly accelerate the degradation of micropollutants by pi the e gp pi system achieved almost complete removal of bisphenol a bpa within 15 min exhibited unprecedented ph tolerance ranging from ph 3 0 to 9 0 and showed more than 90 bpa depletion after 20 h of continuous operation additionally the e gp pi system can realize the stoichiometric transformation of pi into iodate dramatically decreasing the formation of iodinated disinfection by products mechanistic studies confirmed that singlet oxygen 1o2 is the primary reactive oxygen species in the e gp pi system a comprehensive evaluation of the oxidation kinetics of 1o2 with 15 phenolic compounds revealed a dual descriptor model based on quantitative structure activity relationship qsar analysis the model corroborates that pollutants exhibiting strong electron donating capabilities and high pk a values are more susceptible to attack by 1o2 through a proton transfer mechanism the unique selectivity induced by 1o2 in the e gp pi system allows it to exhibit strong resistance to aqueous matrices thus this study demonstrates a green system for the sustainable and effective elimination of pollutants while providing mechanistic insights into the selective oxidation behaviour of 1o2 graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrochemical activation periodate singlet oxygen qsar phenols data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction frequent detection of emerging organic contaminants eocs in water calls for the exploration of high efficiency and long lasting water treatment technologies as they will pose undesirable effects to human health and ecological environment advanced oxidation processes aops are considered as one of the most promising pathways to control eocs where highly reactive oxygen species ros are formed to transform and mineralize eocs widely studied aops like the fenton and fenton like reactions primarily utilize the generation of hydroxy radicals oh and sulfate radical so4 from hydrogen peroxide h2o2 persulfate and ozone which are capable of oxidizing almost all the organic pollutants without discrimination ren et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however the high oxidation ability of these radicals results in the disadvantage associated with their low resistance to naturally occurring substances such as humic acid ha halide ions and bicarbonate li et al 2016 zhu et al 2020 the critical obstacle impedes the actual application of radical based aops consequently there has been significant interest in the field regarding the strategic manipulation of the chemical reactivity of oxidizing species to achieve selective oxidation of pollutants particularly in the development of non radical oxidation systems periodate pi io4 with a high oxidation potential e 0 1 60 v has recently attracted significant interest in the field of water decontamination owing to its inherent advantages in terms of ease of storage and transportation chen et al 2022 guo et al 2022 he et al 2022 although the application of pi is largely hampered by its potential to release iodine species it can be solved by regulating the decomposition pathway of pi to minimize the production of harmful iodine species zong et al 2021 yet alone pi mediated oxidation process fails to oxidize eocs effectively lee and yoon 2004 many strategies have been proposed to intensify the oxidative ability of pi via stimulating the formation of various ros e g oh iodate radical io3 superoxide radical o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 eqs 1 5 or inducing direct electron transfer activation of pi bokare and choi 2015 choi et al 2018 lee et al 2014 liu et al 2022 long et al 2021 these strategies mainly include ultrasound lee et al 2016 transition metal oxides chatraei and zare 2013 carbonaceous materials long et al 2022 and photoactivation liu et al 2022 although the above methods succeed in improving the oxidation capacity of pi they also lead to the formation of secondary pollutant and increase energy consumption moreover these methods still face challenges in activating pi over a wide ph range for instance metal involved catalysts such as mno2 du et al 2020 co single atomic catalyst long et al 2021 ru co2o3 zhang et al 2023 and s zvi0 zong et al 2022 are viable candidates for accelerating the degradation of micropollutants by pi but their ph effectiveness range is limited to acidic conditions as such it is necessary to design pi based aops with strong resistance to reaction ph in order to extend their applicability 1 io4 energy io3 o 2 o h oh 3 3io4 2oh 2o2 3io3 h2o 4 2o2 2h2o h2o2 1o2 2oh 5 io4 2o2 h2o io3 2oh 21o2 over the past few decades electrochemical processes have been introduced in aops for efficient activation as they are environmentally friendly energy efficient use friendly and suitable for automation son et al 2021 song et al 2021 during electro activation the electric field can provide electrons as co catalysts to activate the oxidant thereby inducing the formation of ros and successfully avoiding the risks associated with exogenous catalysts long et al 2023 for instance yao et al proposed that the electrochemically activated peroxymonosulfate pms system exhibits strong reactivity in degrading contaminants and performs effectively over a wide ph range 3 0 11 0 yao et al 2021 thus it is expected that pi can also be activated by the electrochemical method over a broad ph range however knowledge in this field is still limited as far as we know only one recent research has demonstrated the feasibility of establishing an electro activated pi oxidation process in which nano confined fe2o3 was used as a working electrode to accelerate the removal of bisphenol a bpa by pi guo et al 2022 however the performance of the electro fe2o3 cnt pi system reduces under alkaline conditions considering that metal based catalysts generally suffer limitations in ph dependent catalytic activity chen et al 2021 son et al 2021 using a metal based working electrode to activate pi may be not the optimal choice graphite gp is a cheap and easily accessible non metallic electrode material that has attracted much attention in electrochemical aops due to its low oxygen evolution potential and high hydrogen evolution potential song et al reported that electrochemical activation of pms using gp electrodes can completely degrade sulfamethoxazole smx within 30 min song et al 2020 therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that using gp working electrodes for electrochemical activation of pi e gp pi can significantly enhance the removal of micropollutants however the performance of the e gp pi system has not been fully demonstrated and there is a lack of knowledge on its ph tolerance and application potentiality thus the objective of the study is to investigate the oxidation activity and reaction mechanism of the e gp pi system to our delight the e gp pi system characterized by the dominance of non radical ros not only can effectively and selectively degrade contaminants but also shows outstanding ph adaptation transcending other pi based aops currently reported the electro activation mechanism was fully discussed by demonstrating the main ros and the transformation pathway of pi by revealing the activity differences of the system in degrading 15 phenolic compounds with different substituent groups a new quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model was proposed to reveal the selective activity of the primary ros thus shedding light on the selective oxidation mechanism finally the application potential of the e gp pi system and the degradation pathways of bpa were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals unless otherwise

sosg reagent is supplied by meilun biotechnology co ltd all stock solutions were prepared using deionized water with a resistivity greater than 18 0 mω cm 1 2 2 details of organic compound degradation experiments the e gp pi oxidation process for degradation of organic pollutants was carried out in a 250 ml glass beaker and magnetic stirring 250 rpm was used to maintain mass transfer of the material covering the electrode surface the background electrolyte was 20 mm na2so4 in addition a gp anode and a gp cathode were used as the working electrodes which were fixed at a gap of 5 cm the gp electrodes before use were pretreated in deionized water and acetone 1 1 v v by an ultrasonic process to remove any potential impurities from the electrode surfaces degradation experiments were performed at 25 1 c maintained with a water bath and connected by a direct current supply the initial reaction ph was adjusted using 0 1 m h2so4 and or 0 2 m naoh unless stated otherwise the current was set to 30 ma organic pollutant degradation was initiated by simultaneously adding bpa and naio4 during the electrochemical process approximately 1 5 ml of water sample was collected at a predetermined time interval and quenched with 20 μl of 0 5 m hydroxylamine after each experiment both working electrodes were washed with deionized water and treated under ultrasonic conditions 10 min to eliminate any potential degradation byproducts on the electrode surfaces each degradation experiment was performed three times 2 3 analytical methods high performance liquid chromatography hplc with a uv detector and an c18 separation column was employed to determine the concentrations of various compounds seen table s1 in supporting information quenching experiments were conducted to confirm the possible contribution of oh o2 and 1o2 to bpa removal details are described in text s1 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used as a trapping agent to detect the formation of ros by electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy the sosg fluorescence signal was captured by fluorescence spectrophotometry other analytic methods are described in texts s2 s6 2 4 details of theoretical calculations density functional theory dft calculations using the gaussian 16 package were employed to research the molecular structure characteristics of bpa specific procedures are described in text s7 3 results and discussion 3 1 bpa degradation performance of the e gp pi system bpa an endocrine disruptor is frequently detected in surface and underground water environments rahman et al 2021 and was selected as a model contaminant to evaluate the oxidative activity of the e gp pi system as shown in fig 1 a the control experiment with pi alone exhibited negligible reactivity for bpa removal within 15 min 14 2 bpa was degraded by the e gp system which should be attributed to the direct electron transfer from the gp electrode surface intriguingly bpa was completely degraded by the e gp pi oxidation process 100 suggesting that the electric field with gp electrodes can activate pi to produce ros thereby accelerating bpa depletion previous studies have reported that carbonaceous materials like biochar and fe n co doped carbonaceous catalyst possess activity for activating pi he et al 2022 xiao et al 2022 hence activation of pi by gp electrodes without current induction was studied fig 1a shows that bpa removal by the gp pi system is insignificant implying that the high reactivity of the e gp pi system does not derive from the catalytic contribution of gp additionally when gp electrode was replaced by the pt electrode the e pt pi system achieved 82 5 bpa removal within 15 min demonstrating the potential of electrolysis in activating pi the more prominent performance of the e gp pi system may be related to the strong electroconductibility and large specific surface area of gp electrode which would lead to faster mass transfer between the electrode surface and pi thus inducing effective activation to demonstrate the superiority of the e gp pi system the decay kinetics of bpa in other systems were evaluated including e gp h2o2 e gp pms e gp peroxydisulfate pds e gp peracetic acid paa and e gp permanganate pm systems as shown in fig 1a the lowest removal of bpa in the e gp h2o2 system may be related to the strong bond energy for cleaving the o o bond in h2o2 213 3 kj mol 1 peidong hu 2016 compared with the e gp pds system the e gp pi system had superior performance in the removal of bpa which may be associated with the longer i o bond in pi 1 79 å than the o o bond in pds 1 47 å hans and basil 1993 long et al 2021 nie et al 2020 the e gp paa e gp pms and e gp pm systems exhibited inferior bpa removal than the e gp pi system this difference could be attributed to the strong affinity between the gp electrode and pi resulting in faster pi decomposition and thus producing more ros figure s1 overall the above results collectively indicate that the e gp pi system may be a feasible and promising strategy for the abatement of organic compounds with relatively satisfactory efficacy the influence of current intensity on bpa removal was discussed figure s2a shows that increasing the current intensity from 0 01 a to 0 03 a in the e gp pi system led to a corresponding increase in bpa degradation from 24 9 to 100 however no further enhancement in removal was observed beyond a current density of 0 03 a possibly attributable to the occurrence of water electrolysis at high current densities figure s2b illustrates the impact of initial pi content on the elimination of bpa bpa removal was enhanced from 87 5 0 2 mm pi to 100 0 7 mm pi indicating that an elevated dose of pi promotes the generation of ros to expedite bpa depletion in addition the influence of reaction ph on bpa removal was evaluated by adjusting the initial ph from 3 0 to 9 0 higher ph values were not considered in consideration of the alkali mediated activation of pi bokare and choi 2015 interestingly the oxidation activity of the e gp pi system exhibited ph independent behavior achieving complete bpa degradation within 15 min over at ph 3 0 9 0 the ph independent behavior of the e gp pi does not arise from changes either in the reactivity of the pi alone and e gp systems or from changes in ph during bpa removal figure s3 the strong ph tolerance of the e gp pi systems may be attributed to two aspects on the one hand the electric field may be effective in activating h4io6 and h3io6 2 without differences in catalytic activity as they are the major species of pi at ph 3 0 9 0 pk a1 0 98 pk a2 7 42 pk a3 10 99 fig 1c valkai et al 2017 the speculation can be verified by the similar pi consumption at different ph figure s4 on the other hand the primary ros in the e gp pi system may exhibit a low ph dependent response in the oxidation of microcontaminants the exceptional ph tolerance of the e gp pi system highlights a considerable advancement over traditional pi activation methods such as metal based and carbonaceous material based pi oxidation processes fig 1d and table s2 in other words in comparison to other recently reported pi activation systems the e gp pi system exhibited outstanding potential for treating organic wastewater over a wide ph range 3 2 identifying ros generation routes according to previous studies various ros such as oh io3 o2 1o2 and direct electron transfer may be responsible for the removal of bpa in the e gp pi system here quenching experiments were carried out to confirm the involvement of the above ros tba a scavenger of oh k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 was employed to verify the role of oh hu et al 2017 the results shown in fig 2 a suggest that the presence of 100 mm tba poses a negligible effect on bpa removal indicating that bpa degradation in the e gp pi system is not dependent on oh given that oh can react with terephthalic acid tpa through a h abstraction pathway resulting in the formation of a distinctive product of p hydroxyterephthalic acid htpa tpa has been widely employed as a chemical probe to investigate the kinetics of oh generation and accumulation in various aops zhou et al 2020 no htpa formation was observed in the chromatograms of the e gp and e gp pi systems during tpa degradation figure s5 further confirming the negligible production of oh moreover epr spectrum using dmpo as a trapping agent did not detect the characteristic signals of dmpo oh 1 2 2 1 αn 14 8 g αh 12 8 g figure s6 all the results clearly demonstrate that oh is not the ros in the e gp pi system ffa which can scavenge 1o2 with a reaction rate constant of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 was introduced in the e gp pi system to assess the contribution of 1o2 he et al 2022 fig 2a illustrates that the addition of ffa 100 mm markedly suppresses the bpa degradation from 100 to 11 4 in the presence of excess ffa 11 4 bpa depletion could be attributed to the direct electron transfer reaction considering that pi may be directly consumed by ffa to inhibit bpa removal the consumption of pi by ffa was examined the low reactivity of ffa with pi shown in figure s7 suggests that the inhibitory effect of ffa on bpa removal should be associated with the competition of ffa and bpa for 1o2 as reported in previous studies 1o2 can oxidize ffa to form three representative products i e c5h6o4 m z 129 0183 in esi negative mode c4h4o3 m z 99 0075 in esi negative mode c5h6o3 m z 113 0242 in esi negative mode yang et al 2019 therefore we further examined the formation of 1o2 in the e gp pi system by examining the degradation products of ffa as depicted in figure s8 the characteristic mass spectra of the three ffa degradation products oxidized by 1o2 were measured and are presented the generation of 1o2 in the e gp pi system was further confirmed through epr spectroscopy using temp as a trapping agent for 1o2 a triplet peak signal with a strength ratio of 1 1 1 αn 7 2 g and αh 4 1 g of temp 1o2 was captured fig 2b suggesting the formation of 1o2 in the e gp pi system more convincing evidence was presented through the detection of transformation product of sosg oxidized by 1o2 namely sosg endoperoxide which can emit green fluorescence with a maximum at 528 nm a gradual increase fluorescence intensity at 528 nm was observed providing further evidence for the formation and accumulation of 1o2 in the e gp pi system fig 2c taken together these results fully illustrate the involvement of 1o2 in the e gp pi system previous studies have suggested that in pi based aops the formation of 1o2 may occur through the combination of o2 or the reaction between pi and molecular o2 eqs 4 and 6 bokare and choi 2015 therefore o2 and o2 may be the crucial intermediates in 1o2 formation nevertheless despite the sustainable input of n2 to remove o2 from the reaction solution the degradation kinetics of both bpa and ffa by the e gp pi system did not appear to be significantly affected figures s9 and 2d these observations imply that o2 is not a prerequisite for 1o2 formation to verify whether o2 was produced and subsequently involved in 1o2 formation we compared the depletion of bpa in the presence and absence of bq a scavenger of o2 k 0 9 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2022 a significant inhibitory effect was obtained with the addition of 5 mm of bq fig 2a moreover ffa degradation caused by 1o2 was significantly reduced in the presence of 5 mm bq fig 2d which corroborates that the production of o2 in the e gp pi system contributes to the generation of 1o2 given the formation and subsequent transformation of o2 to 1o2 h2o2 may be a secondary product in the e gp pi system according to eq 4 bokare and choi 2015 cheng et al have reported that h2o2 can activate pi to produce oh and 1o2 thus accelerating the degradation of micropollutants kim et al 2022 however figure s10 shows the negligible formation of h2o2 in the e gp pi system and that the addition of catalase a reagent for h2o2 decomposition exerts a low influence on bpa removal indicating the low contribution of h2o2 in the e gp pi system moreover the coexistence of o2 and h2o2 will initiate the haber weiss mechanism to form oh eq 7 however as we have discussed previously the contribution of oh in the e gp pi system has been fully ruled out the finding further excludes the involvement of h2o2 in the e gp pi system and denies the pathway described in eq 4 for producing 1o2 6 io4 o2 2oh io3 2o2 h2o 7 o2 h2o2 oh oh o2 8 2 i o 4 2 e electrochemical activation 2 i o 3 o 2 additionally although a direct method to confirm the contribution of io3 is still lacking the quenching experiments shown in fig 2a indirectly demonstrate the low importance of io3 since ffa completely suppressed bpa removal previous research demonstrated the inertness of io3 with 2 4 6 trichlorophenol lee et al 2014 but our work observed an accelerated removal of 2 4 6 tcp with the introduction of pi in the e gp system figure s11 further confirming the negligible role of io3 in the e gp pi system based on our experimental results and previous studies the working mechanisms of the e gp pi system are proposed firstly in the presence of an electric field io4 on gp electrode surface is rapidly converted to io3 while producing o2 eq 8 the conjecture can be substantiated by the stoichiometric conversion of io4 to io3 which is independent of the initial pi concentration figure s12 it should be noted that the electrochemical activation process cannot further activate io3 to degrade bpa suggesting that the contribution of io3 in the oxidation process is not significant figure s13 then the formed o2 can react with io4 to form 1o2 eq 5 which is the primary ros responsible for bpa removal in the e gp pi system 3 3 selective oxidation qsar model of 1o2 oxidation to gain further mechanistic insights into the oxidation kinetics of 1o2 the degradation of 15 phenolic compounds by the e gp pi system were assessed the corresponding reaction rate constants k obs are calculated and are listed in table s3 and figure s14 control experiments using alone pi failed to remove all the tested phenolic compounds but the e gp pi system could degrade all the organic compounds and showed different k obs values of the tested phenolic pollutants the e gp pi system exhibited the highest reactivity in removing hydroquinone and mequinol but was slightly sluggish to react with 2 nitrophenol indicating the selective activity of 1o2 for contaminants removal fig 3 a the oxidation behavior of contaminants in aops is intricately linked to their chemical structure and physical properties dalizza et al 2002 molecular descriptors such as the n octanol water partition constant kow dissociation constant pka and substituent constant can effectively illustrate the variations in the organic compounds chemical structure and physicochemical properties fei et al 2018 lee and von gunten 2012 kow which reflects the migration and transformation of substances in environmental media has been employed to quantitatively elucidate the correlation between the oxidation kinetic of oh and the hydrophobicity of targeted pollutants to be specific fei et al proposed that polychlorinated dibenzodioxins with high kow values exhibit strong resistant to oh oxidation fei et al 2018 hence we surmised that kow is a crucial parameter in predicting the oxidative activity of 1o2 with phenolic compounds nevertheless the e gp pi oxidation process revealed a weak correlation between logkow and the corresponding k obs figure s15 implying that the selective oxidation governed by 1o2 is not associated with the hydrophobicity of the organic pollutants the hammett substituent descriptors including σ σ and σ are critical experimental parameters for understanding the connection between reactivity and chemical structures containing aromatic rings lee and von gunten 2012 luo et al 2022 of these σ serves as a quantitative measure of the electron donating capability of substituents organic compounds with electron donating groups demonstrate lower σ values whereas those with electron withdrawing groups exhibit higher σ values as shown in fig 3b logk obs shows a linear decrease with σ indicating the occurrence of a typical electrophilic interaction between 1o2 and substituted phenols eq 9 similar to the hammett constant the ionization potential ip is also generally used as an indicator of the electron donating characteristics of pollutants previous studies have demonstrated that ip is associated with the reaction rates of specific systems hu et al 2017 luo et al 2023 to validate the electrophilic characteristic of 1o2 we conducted further investigations to examine the relation between the reaction rate and ip figure s16a illustrates a linear correlation between these two variables the results provide additional evidence regarding the electrophilic oxidation character of 1o2 however it is worth noting that the σ r2 0 74 constant displays a stronger linear association compared to the ip r2 0 70 implying that σ may be more suitable for elucidating the selective oxidation dynamics of 1o2 previous research has suggested that if the rate limiting step of the oxidation reaction involves a proton transfer process the k obs can be significantly affected by the pk a of organic contaminants tekle rottering et al 2016 similarly there is a positive linear relationship between logk obs and pk a in the e gp pi system r2 0 60 figure s16b the correlation observed between logk obs and pk a suggests that the proton transfer pathway is the rate limiting step for the oxidation of phenolic compounds by 1o2 the secondary kinetic isotope effect kie is generally utilized to elucidate the rate determining step of a reaction by replacing an h atom with its isotope in a bond that remains intact during the rate limiting process gomez gallego and sierra 2011 the substitution process alters the zero point energy due to the greater rigidity of the out of plane bending vibration in a c h bon compared to that of a c d bond potentially influencing the reaction rate thus we employed the secondary kie to gain further insights into the oxidation mechanism of 1o2 the degradation of phenol and phenol d 5 by the e gp pi system was compared typically an oxidation system with a high kie value ranging from 2 to 7 primarily oxidizes contaminants through a proton transfer mechanism while the opposite occurs via an electron transfer process gomez gallego and sierra 2011 the kie value of the e gp pi system was 2 37 fig 3c the phenomenon proves that the oxidation of aromatic compounds by 1o2 is dominated by a proton transfer mechanism 9 log k obs 1 45 0 09 1 17 0 17 σ r 2 0 74 10 log k obs 2 82 1 34 0 91 0 30 σ 0 15 0 14 p k a r 2 8 0 the above analysis suggests that the degradation rate of various phenolic compounds by 1o2 depends on their electron donating activity and degree of dissociation to better understand the intrinsic mechanism we attempt to investigate the relationship of k obs with σ and pk a using a dual descriptor model a more desirable correlation was presented based on the dual descriptor model r2 0 80 eq 10 and fig 3d further confirming that both the σ and pk a of organic pollutants affects their reaction behavior with 1o2 given that σ slope 0 91 0 30 has a steeper slope than pk a slope 0 15 0 14 it is probable that the oxidation activity of 1o2 to attack organic pollutants is more sensitive to σ than pk a therefore our findings imply that the kinetics of 1o2 to attack phenolic compounds in the e gp pi system depends on the ability of the targeted contaminants to donate electrons and the degree of dissociation with the former being the determinant 3 4 application advantages of the e gp pi system the influence of concomitant ions and humic acid ha on the reactivity of the e gp pi system for bpa removal was evaluated different from radical based aops no evident suppression on bpa abatement was observed when other inorganic constituents i e no3 so4 2 cl hco3 and hpo4 2 were introduced and the presence of 25 mg l ha suggested a low restriction on bpa removal fig 4 a these findings indicate the excellent resistance of the e gp pi system in complex water matrices it is worth noting that although hco3 is a quencher of o2 hco3 o2 co3 o2 2 bokare and choi 2015 the presence of 5 mm hco3 indicates a negligible influence on bpa removal this may be related to the fact that the reaction between pi and o2 is faster than the reaction between hco3 and o2 resulting in a low contribution to inhibit bpa depletion besides degradation experiments were conducted in real water samples to further evaluate the application prospect of the system 100 bpa removal was achieved in river water and lake water fig 4b indicating that the e gp pi oxidation process with 1o2 as the main ros was slightly affected by actual water matrixes our previous findings have shown the remarkable ph applicability of the e gp pi system similar results were also observed in the treatment of actual samples which further implies its superiority in practical applications fig s17 energy utilization efficiency is a pivotal parameter reflecting the energy consumption of electro based wastewater technologies the electric energy per order ee o of the e gp pi system under optimized conditions was calculated and the details are shown in text s4 the ee o value of the e gp pi system was 0 0488 kwh m 3 which is significantly lower than other electro based oxidation processes recorded in previous literatures guo et al 2022 long et al 2023 the low energy consumption further demonstrates the application potential of the e gp pi system in addition achieving long lasting catalytic performance is critical for actual treatment process to assess the long term reactivity of the system we constructed a continuous flow reactor where bpa and pi were mixed and continuously injected into the electrochemical reaction apparatus fig 4c reaction samples were freshly collected at 0 5 h intervals the removal of bpa by the e gp pi system remained a high efficiency after 10 h of treatment 98 6 however the performance gradually deteriorated with bpa removal rates of 84 4 and 33 3 achieved after 15 and 20 h of reaction respectively fig 4d the reduced handling capacity of the system may be associated with the accumulation of bpa degradation products and io3 on graphite electrode surface which impedes the catalytic process in order to address the above problem we attempted to use an ultrasonic cleaning approach to remove impurities from the two reaction electrodes after 5 h of each treatment satisfactorily the e gp pi system was still able to remove 90 7 bpa after 20 h of reaction generally carbon corrosion which results from the thermodynamic instability of carbon under oxidative conditions limits the long lasting use of carbon based electrodes qiao et al 2018 figure s18 shows the increase in surface oxide species content and slight corrosion of the gp surface after 20 h of reaction therefore the slight decrease in system effectiveness may be caused by the carbon corrosion of gp electrodes affecting its electrical conductivity and specific surface area in order to further improve the corrosion resistance of the gp working electrode further surface modification is preferred in future work 3 5 products analysis and toxicity assessment 3 5 1 bpa degradation mechanisms to investigate the degradation mechanism of bpa in the e gp pi system we detected the transformation products of bpa using uplc qtof ms ms a total of 13 transformation products tps were identified based on their accurate mass and fragment ions and no iodine degradation products of bpa was detected figure s19 furthermore the absence of 4 iodophenol and 2 iodophenol during phenol degradation indicates that no hoi was generated in the e gp pi system figure s20 these results highlight the low risk of the e gp pi system in producing iodinated disinfection byproducts to identify the active sites of bpa the condensed fukui index f of bpa was calculated and depicted in fig 5 the results showed that c6 f 0 0428 c27 f 0 0428 c1 f 0 0372 c23 f 0 0374 c3 f 0 0340 and c20 f 0 0340 with relatively high f values are the most active sites of bpa based on the fukui index and the detected products three degradation pathways of bpa oxidized by 1o2 in the e gp pi system were proposed in fig 5 1o2 as a selective oxidation species tends to attack electrophilic sites with high fukui index duan et al 2018 in pathway i tp1 m z 259 0976 and tp2 m z 243 1031 were produced when the benzene ring of the bpa molecule was oxidized via the nucleophilic addition of 1o2 to the c1 and c23 sites furthermore owing to the high electron rich nature of the hydroxyl group the hydroxylation process can further excite the benzene ring of bpa antoniou 2010 thus facilitating the formation of the tri hydroxylation product tp3 m z 275 0928 to further break down the polyhydroxylated bpa tp2 undergoes a dehydration pathway that converts it into tp4 m z 241 0875 which has a quinone structure the hydroxylated products mentioned above can then be further attacked by 1o2 through ring opening reactions resulting in the formation of tp5 m z 265 0761 tp6 m z 237 0771 and tp7 m z 191 0721 in addition to the hydroxylation reaction process the c3 site of bpa with a high f can also be oxidized by 1o2 specifically the reaction leads to the cleavage of the c c bond at the c3 site resulting in the formation of 4 isopropylphenol radical the radical is then converted to tp8 m z 132 0581 and tp9 m z 93 0351 through a series of electron rearrangements tp9 can further be oxidized to produce hydroquinone tp10 m z 107 0141 pathway iii involves the demethylation of bpa leading to the formation of tp11 m z 213 0926 which will be further oxidized to form tp12 m z 228 0792 and tp13 m z 175 0503 though a series of hydroxylation ring opening and demethylation reactions finally these transformation intermediates may be further mineralized into other small molecules such as co2 and h2o 3 5 2 toxicological assessment the mutagenicity acute toxicity bioaccumulation factor and developmental toxicity of bpa and its degradation intermediates were assessed by the t e s t based on qsar prediction the ld50 of bpa is 4108 99 mg kg 3 intermediates showed lower toxicity than bpa but 10 intermediates had higher toxicity than bpa indicating that the e gp pi system partially reduced the toxicity of bpa but some products remained highly toxic figure s21a the bioaccumulation factor of bpa is 117 27 and all products have lower bioaccumulation factors than bpa figure s21b besides the treatment of the e gp pi system resulted in the formation of 6 developmental non toxicants figure s21c all the intermediates belonged to mutagenicity negative compounds fig s21d to further analyze the impact of the e gp pi system on the toxicity of bpa we calculated the bioluminescence inhibition rates of bpa before and after treatment as shown in fig s22 the bioluminescence inhibition rate of bpa was 78 51 and decreased to 48 82 after the treatment of the e gp pi system indicating that the 1o2 based oxidation process employed by the e gp pi system could partially detoxify bpa 4 conclusion this study unveiled the great potential of the electro activation pi using gp electrodes as a robust and sustainable strategy for degrading organic pollutants unlike traditional pi based aops that exhibit ph dependent performance the e gp pi system suggested remarkable ph tolerance moreover the e gp pi system performed well in complex water matrices and demonstrated long lasting activity in removing bpa by cleaning the residue from electrode surfaces the quantitative transformation of pi to io3 significantly reduced the secondary risk of the e gp pi system in producing iodine disinfection byproducts the safe efficient and sustainable nature of the e gp pi system underscores its great potential for the treatment of organic wastewater mechanistic research fully demonstrated that 1o2 a typical selective oxidation species is responsible for the degradation of bpa in the e gp pi system and that o2 is a crucial intermediate for the formation of 1o2 by investigating the effects of organic contaminants characteristics on their reactivity to be oxidized by 1o2 we proposed a dual descriptor model that demonstrates a tendency for 1o2 to selectively oxidize organic phenolic compounds with high electron donating capacity and high dissociation degree the critical information is of great importance for improving our understanding of the oxidation kinetics of 1o2 and for optimizing the applied range of 1o2 dominated oxidation processes in treating real effluents however efforts should be made to further improve the pi utilization efficiency and oxidation activity of the e gp pi system for instance by applying flow configurations to maximize mass transport and by modifying electrodes through spatial confinement or nonmetal doping to optimize ros generation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

14747,while microplastic inputs into rivers are assumed to be correlated with anthropogenic activities and to accumulate towards the sea the impacts of water management on downstream microplastic transport are largely unexplored a comparative study of microplastic abundance in boulder creek bc and its less urbanized tributary south boulder creek sbc colorado usa characterized the downstream evolution of microplastics in surface water and sediments evaluating the effects of urbanization and flow diversions on the up to downstream profiles of microplastic concentrations and loads water and sediment samples were collected from 21 locations along both rivers and microplastic properties determined by fluorescence microscopy and raman spectroscopy the degree of catchment urbanization affected microplastic patterns as evidenced by greater water and sediment concentrations and loads in bc than the less densely populated sbc which is consistent with the differences in the degree of urbanization between both catchments microplastic removal through flow diversions was quantified showing that water diversions removed over 500 microplastic particles per second from the river and caused stepwise reductions of downstream loads at diversion points this redistribution of microplastics back into the catchment should be considered in large scale models quantifying plastic fate and transport to the oceans graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics in rivers water management diversions abstraction paired catchment approach global models data availability

wagner 2018 and are omnipresent in all environmental compartments on a global scale e g bian et al 2022 kukkola et al 2022 samandra et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 despite mps having been the focus of intense research efforts the sources their environmental entry points transport mechanisms and resulting distribution in the environment have yet to be fully understood it has been demonstrated that rivers represent major mp transport pathways to the oceans lebreton et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 but can also act as long term sinks drummond et al 2020 2022 margenat et al 2021 additionally mps in riverine environments may undergo major physio chemical transformation processes krause et al 2021 mcgivney et al 2020 and interact with the diverse community of freshwater organisms with potentially detrimental effects on species and ecosystem health e g causing entanglement suffocation and intestinal damage anbumani and kakkar 2018 kukkola et al 2021 to fully assess the risks that mps pose to river environments and their ecosystem services it is important to understand how mps are distributed within river corridors and how they get transported and potentially accumulated in river networks krause et al 2021 previous research has highlighted the existence of substantial spatial variability in mps in surface water and sediment in a wide range of river systems e g castañeda et al 2014 kurki fox et al 2023 wong et al 2020 however it is less well established which processes control this spatial variability a better understanding of these processes may result in more accurate predictions of the full extent to which rivers contribute to global plastic fluxes into the oceans and for site specific risk assessments additionally flux information may be coupled with estimates of mp residence times to assess local exposure and potential impacts on freshwater ecosystems this could lead to a better understanding of the potential sources and guide any regional management and mitigation strategies previous research has aimed to identify how population density and specifically the location of potential point and diffuse sources of discarded plastic waste influence the spatial distribution of mp consequently land use land cover has been linked to mp concentration and distribution in rivers grbić et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and global scale estimates of terrestrial plastic pollution and resulting riverine contributions to the oceans have predicted pollution hotspots to occur in densely populated urban areas with poor waste management systems ferraz et al 2020

tibbetts et al 2018 there is growing awareness that in addition to the spatial distribution of sources the environmental fate of mps is strongly determined by their transport dispersal and potential deposition and storage along river networks de carvalho et al 2021 margenat et al 2021 tibbetts et al 2018 flow conditions may strongly affect mp deposition behaviour and residence time in the hyporheic zone drummond et al 2020 2022 current model predictions of riverine contributions to mp in the world s oceans show discrepancies ranging over several orders of magnitude lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 current models use only relatively coarse spatial information of river discharge if included at all siegfried et al 2017 uzun et al 2022 van wijnen et al 2019 very few studies have investigated the change in mp concentrations in relation to the hydrological regime and the characteristic flow and transport behaviour of the respective river systems campanale et al 2020 wagner et al 2019 a general assumption of existing large scale plastic transport models is a downstream convergence of particle fluxes along the river network there is a severe lack of understanding of the impact of river water management schemes e g water diversion for irrigation and drinking water on mp distribution fate and transport in river corridors despite the majority of rivers globally now being regulated in their flow barbarossa et al 2020 baumgartner et al 2022 it may therefore be important to analyse and quantify the combined impacts of mp source distributions and their transport in river networks under the influence of anthropogenically altered flow and transport conditions in order to aid model predictions here we present a comparative field study that applies a paired catchment approach to quantify the spatial distribution of mp in two neighbouring catchments south boulder creek and boulder creek colorado usa with different degrees of urbanization this study aims to i characterize the downstream evolution of mp concentration and associated particle properties in surface water and streambed sediments ii identify mp source areas using spatial profiles of stream load the product of concentration and stream discharge iii evaluate the effects of a the mountain to plains transition and b urbanization and iv quantify the degree to which flow diversions affect mp concentrations loads and downstream transport 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region boulder creek bc and its tributary south boulder creek sbc colorado usa are part of the wider boulder creek watershed which extends over 1160 km2 and is located in the front range of the rocky mountains east of the continental divide both catchments cover diverse geographical and hydro geomorphological conditions along a rural urban gradient and differ significantly in catchment wide and near stream land cover patterns fig 1 both streams flow northeast from their mountainous headwaters that originate at the continental divide elevations 4100 m and through canyons upstream sampling locations b1 and s1 are 2400 m sampling locations are further described in runkel et al 2022 before they reach the plains sampling locations b12 and s6 elevation 1800 m and eventually confluence at the eastern edge of the city of boulder near sampling point b33 fig 1 ultimately these waters drain into the mississippi river and the gulf of mexico over 2300 km away the bc catchment is more urbanized 12 upstream of confluence with sbc than sbc 3 9 upstream of confluence with bc both are characterized by a high forest cover bc 73 and sbc 84 the catchment areas for bc and sbc upstream of their confluence are 405 km2 and 342 km2 respectively with a total catchment size of 790 km2 at point b34 fig 1 the sampled river sections cover 36 7 km flow length of bc and 27 7 km of sbc over these sections river slope varies between 0 003 m m b34 and 0 040 m m b9 for bc and 0 005 m m s9 and 0 085 s1 for sbc while average sinuosity is 1 31 bc and 1 39 sbc respectively indicating a comparable and generally low degree of meandering the procedures used to determine the foregoing watershed characteristics are detailed in section 2 4 like for many river systems in the western united states water management plays a large role in both streams murphy 2006 mountain reservoirs are used to store large volumes of water generated during spring snowmelt and this water is subsequently diverted out of the catchments for municipal and agricultural use through a system of canals as such stream discharge decreases in downstream direction for long periods of the year the bc study reach begins approximately 4 km downstream of barker reservoir which receives water from the surrounding catchment a relatively undeveloped area to the east of the continental divide water released from barker reservoir travels down boulder canyon entering the city of boulder near sampling location b12 fig 1 the primary diversion affecting stream discharge during this study is located downstream of sample location b19 where more than half of the discharge is diverted away from bc at certain times of year murphy 2006 the sbc study reach begins approximately 1 5 km downstream of gross reservoir which receives much of its water from the underground moffatt tunnel that transports water from west of the continental divide to the eastern side murphy 2006 most of the water leaving gross reservoir is diverted out of sbc downstream of sampling location s1 supplying water to the city of denver sbc flows through the small town of eldorado springs between s4 and s6 fig 1 before entering the plains downstream of sample location s6 a second major diversion active during the study period is located downstream of site s13 resulting in additional decreases in stream discharge 2 2 field data and sample collection surface water and sediment samples were collected from thirteen locations within bc and eight sites within sbc as a subset of a larger study that included additional sample locations runkel et al 2022 sampling took place october 14 18 2019 during steady low flow conditions which are typical in the research area for the period between october and march the relatively steady flow conditions during the sampling period were confirmed by stream discharge records from gauging stations bocoroco 18 5 km downstream from barker reservoir sampling location b9 and bocelsco 0 7 km downstream from the major diversion located between s1 and s4 https www dwr state co us fig 2 at each sampling site 50 l of surface water was collected from the centre of the stream and from the middle depth due to low flow conditions 10 cm of the water column with galvanized metal bucket during sampling the bucket was lowered into the stream horizontally opening facing upstream the bucket was returned to the upright position after being filled by the flowing water and the surface water was filtered through a 63 µm nylon mesh from which contents were then transferred into a precleaned 20 ml glass vial using deionized water the mp samples collected in this manner are assumed to include buoyant mps and mps with a density greater than water that have yet to settle to the streambed suspended sediment sampling techniques edwards and glysson 1999 were not employed in this study given the steady low flow conditions in which bedload is assumed to be negligible contributor to constituent load sediment was collected from both streambanks just above the water line using a metal spoon a composite sediment sample from three spots within a radius of about 1 m was collected and stored in a clean glass jar giving a final sample mass of 60 90 g per streambank all samples nwater 21 and nsediment 42 were stored at room temperature and transported to the university of birmingham uk for analysis at the end of the sampling period data collected at each sampling point comprised geographic coordinates stream depth cross sectional area velocity and discharge as measured by acoustic doppler velocimetry table s1 runkel et al 2022 2 3 sample analysis and qa qc sediment and water samples were extracted using sediment mp isolation smi units in accordance with nel et al 2020 as described in supplementary section s1 mp extraction after extraction organic matter om was digested using fenton reagent and stained with nile red as described in section s1 samples were analysed with fluorescence microscopy as described in kukkola et al 2023 and section s2 polymer identification by confocal raman spectroscopy lenz et al 2015 kelleher et al 2023 was employed for roughly 44 of all putative mps in total 206 particles the procedure and spectra acquisition parameters are described in section s3 field background samples laboratory blanks and positive blanks were collected and analysed as described in s4 for the purposes of this study mp measurements in counts per litre are hereinafter referred to as concentrations 2 4 land cover population density and statistical analyses to understand how mp concentrations vary in relation to catchment area and the percent of urban land cover each sub catchment defined as the drainage area discharging towards each sampling location was delineated with the usgs program streamstats v4 6 2 u s geological survey 2019 and exported into arcmap 10 7 1 esri 2011 population density per sub catchment for 2019 was obtained from the colorado state demography office https demography dola colorado gov and land cover classes for sub catchments were determined utilizing the national land cover database nlcd multi resolution land characteristics consortium https www mrlc gov viewer 2019 dataset which contains official land cover data for the usa 2019 with a resolution of 30 30 m the 20 landcover classes from the nlcd data set were reclassified into nine general categories see supplementary section s5 to analyse potential local land cover impacts on observed mp concentrations a 500 m circular buffer a 0 79 km2 was created around each sampling site in arcmap to aid identification of possible local source effects as compared to the sub catchment wide approach to study effects in sub catchments the area per land cover class was normalized to the respective sub catchment area data were assessed for normality using a shapiro wilk test spearman s rank coefficient was used to determine correlations between mp concentrations and urban land cover and population density because mps data followed a non normal distribution to evaluate any variation in mps concentrations in water and sediment between and within the two streams mann whitney u and kruskal wallis tests were applied spearman s rank coefficient was used to assess correlation direction and strength for mp concentration and size measured as longest length and hydrological parameters all statistical analyses were carried out in rstudio r core team 2022 with a significant threshold of α 0 05 2 5 mp loads and estimated concentrations in the absence of diversions contributions of mps from the sub catchments discharging to each segment of the study reaches i e the distance between sampling locations were quantified using spatial profiles of the stream mp loads table 1 developed by summing the observed load at each location the product of stream discharge and concentration and the load that had been diverted out of the system the product of the diverted stream discharge and the concentration at the nearest upstream site profiles of cumulative load were calculated by summing all positive changes in instream load while keeping the cumulative load constant when the instream load decreased kimball et al 2002 runkel et al 2013 stream segments with increases in cumulative load thus represent source areas with each source area contributing a percentage to the overall load 1 p e r c e n t c o n t r i b u t i o n 100 l d l u l b l t where l is the cumulative load d and u denote the cumulative load at the downstream and upstream ends of a stream segment while b and t denote the cumulative load at the bottom and top of the study reach loading rates change in load per km were also calculated for individual segments between sampling points and for the entire study reach as 2 l o a d i n g r a t e δ l o a d d i s t a n c e where load is the change in load for the segment or study reach ld lu or lb lt and distance equals the length of the segment or study reach table 1 three sampling points were excluded from the loading analysis due to unsteady flow conditions during sampling b15 b17 and b19 two additional bc sites b33 b34 were also excluded as they are located below the confluence of bc and sbc and are not used in the comparison of the two study reaches these downstream sites are omitted from our discussion of the results presented in sections 3 1 and 3 3 both study reaches have water diversions which decrease stream discharge sampling locations downstream of these diversions will have a smaller volume of water than they would in the absence of diversions and consequently the impact of a given source area and loading rate will be exacerbated with less dilution occurring due to reduced discharge these impacts can be formally quantified by estimating the mp concentrations that would be observed in the absence of diversions mp water concentrations in the absence of diversions are calculated by summing the observed and diverted loads and dividing by the sum of the observed and diverted stream discharge 3 results 3 1 stream discharge several flow diversions were active during the sampling event and 85 of the stream discharge present at b12 was diverted away from bc between b12 and b24 0 43 m3 s 1 fig 3 a and from 0 06 m3 s 1 s14 to 2 48 m3 s 1 s1 for sbc fig 3b several flow diversions were active during the sampling event with the major diversion on bc diverting 87 of the stream discharge at b19 away from bc 0 43 m3 s 1 for the sbc study reach 95 of the stream discharge at s1 2 35 m3 s 1 was diverted for use by the city of denver and 79 of the remaining stream discharge at s13 0 24 m3 s 1 was diverted out of the channel 3 2 mp concentrations in surface water and streambed sediments mp were detected in all surface water and sediment samples across the studied sites fig 4 mean surface water concentrations for bc were 0 22 mp l 1 0 14 standard deviation sd ranging between 0 08 b9 and 0 62 mp l 1 b24 for sbc mean mp concentrations were 0 09 mp l 1 0 05 sd with a range between 0 02 s4 and 0 16 mp l 1 s1 a mann whitney u test confirmed that the difference in mp concentration in the surface water between the two streams was significant p 0 016 streambed sediments for bc had a mean dry weight concentration of 186 mp kg 1 80 sd ranging between 114 b3 and 342 mp kg 1 b24 for sbc the mean sediment concentration was 142 mp kg 1 55 sd ranging from 98 s1 to 214 mp kg 1 s11 mann whitney test indicated that the difference in sediment concentration was non significant p 0 091 the sediment concentrations generally displayed a non significant increasing trend downstream with peaks between sites b12 and b24 fig 4 b12 being where bc emerges from boulder canyon at the city margins of boulder while b24 is located at the eastern edge of a high density urban area where the highest surface water concentration was also observed peak water mp concentrations at sbc were recorded at the most upstream site s1 and the most downstream site s15 0 16 mp l 1 the highest mp concentrations in sbc sediment were recorded at site s11 surface water concentrations in sbc exhibited a linear positive relationship with distance downstream of the first major diversion site s1 excluded rs 0 964 p 1 85 10 5 with increasing concentrations downstream a similar but non significant trend was also observed in sediments fig 4 no correlation was found between stream discharge and the size of mp either in surface water or sediments at bc however a moderate positive correlation was found between discharge and size of mps in surface water at sbc table s4 there was no correlation between discharge and mp concentration in water or sediments table s5 no correlation was found between river velocity or slope and mp concentration in surface water or sediments table s5 3 3 mp loads the average stream mp load for bc was 97 mp s 1 with a range between 16 mp s 1 b9 and 193 mp s 1 b24 fig 3e the stream mp load for bc declines from b1 35 mp s 1 to b9 16 mp s 1 after which it steadily increases to its maximum of 193 mp s 1 at b24 mp load then decreases in the last two stream segments b27 and b28 5 to 141 mp s 1 fig 3e the average stream load for sbc was 400 mp s 1 with a range between 381 mp s 1 s4 and 418 mp s 1 s15 fig 3f the mp stream load drops between sites s1 and s4 after which it generally increases to its maximum value at the end of the study reach s15 fig 3f as will be discussed in detail in section 4 4 most of the stream load is diverted out of the sbc catchment near the head of the study reach average study reach loading rates were 7 2 and 1 7 mp s 1 km 1 for bc and sbc respectively mp loading in bc is dominated by contributions to the three stream segments ending at b10 b12 and b24 percent contributions of 34 30 and 36 respectively fig 3e mp loading at sbc had major contributions at s6 25 s11 29 s13 32 and s15 11 fig 3f 3 4 physical and chemical properties of mp for bc surface water fragments amounted to 51 7 and fibres to 48 3 of the total mp detected fig 4 similarly for sbc surface water 51 3 of total mp were fragments and 48 7 fibres no spheres were detected in water samples from either stream a clear colour dominated fragments and a blue colour dominated fibres in both streams in the bc sediments mostly fragments were present 87 while fibres 12 and spheres 1 played a minor role fig 4 for sbc the percentage of fragments 93 was slightly larger while fibres only amounted to 7 in sediments from both streams most fragments were a clear colour while most fibres were black in total 206 putative mps 44 of total were subjected to raman spectroscopy analysis from which 86 were positively identified as plastics with the most common polymer type in surface water being polyester 50 and in sediment being polyethylene terephthalate 36 for details see supplementary section s6 the respective identification rate for fragments was 75 and 92 for fibres 3 5 land cover impacts on mp a mann whitney u test indicated a statistically significant difference in urban land cover between bc and sbc upstream of their confluence u 84 p 0 0001 when assessing the relationship of urban land cover within sub catchments to mp concentrations no correlation was found in water or sediments for bc however at sbc a very strong correlation was found in surface water site s1 excluded rs 0 964 p 1 85 10 5 with no trend evident in the sediments sbc rs 0 047 p 0 910 besides urbanization no significant correlations were found for other land cover types for sbc mp concentrations in surface water were positively correlated with forest cover rs 0 643 p 0 024 for bc but negatively for sbc rs 0 658 p 0 075 this is likely due to forest cover in bc increasing downstream towards the confluence but decreasing downstream at sbc towards more urbanized areas suggesting that mp concentrations in surface water and sediment were not correlated with the total catchment area bcwater rs 0 275 p 0 391 bcsed rs 0 322 p 0 222 sbcwater rs 0 395 p 0 332 sbcsed rs 0 476 p 0 232 the analysis of land cover impacts in the immediate 500 m buffer around each sampling location revealed a strong positive correlation between surface water mp concentration and urban cover at bc rs 793 p 0 025 and at sbc if the most upstream sampling point s1 was excluded from the analysis rswiths1 0299 p 0 4713 rswithouts1 0 828 p 0 023 for sediments no significant correlation was identified for bc rs 0 508 p 0 075 while for sbc the moderate correlation found was not statistically significant rs 0 547 p 0 160 none of the other land cover types had any correlation to mp concentrations for bc or sbc 4 discussion 4 1 mp concentration in surface water and sediments the more urbanized bc 0 22 mp l 1 63 µm had higher mp concentrations in surface water than sbc 0 09 mp l 1 but both streams could be considered to have relatively low mp contamination present and our findings are similar to other studies in rivers of comparable properties remote mountainous bian et al 2022 dalmau soler et al 2021 ferraz et al 2020 and orders of magnitude lower than those reported from lowland rivers such as canals in suzhou city china 8 40 mp l 1 20 µm or amsterdam netherlands 48 187 mp l 1 10 µm jin et al 2022 leslie et al 2017 similarly bc had higher sediment mp concentrations 186 mp kg 1 than sbc 142 mp kg 1 but these are in line with those previously reported from remote areas such as from the rivers of the tibetan plateau 50 195 mp kg 1 20 µm jiang et al 2019 and from dafeng river china 0 0 50 3 mp kg 1 20 µm 4 2 the effects of the mountain to plains transition and urbanization on mp concentrations and types surface water and sediment mp concentrations increase in the downstream direction for both bc and sbc with downstream trends being particularly clear in surface water fig 4 this is consistent with previous studies six rivers located at a mountain foothill transition area in the chin ling wei river plain china had concentrations of 2 57 0 14 mp l 1 75 µm in the mountainous areas with increasing concentrations of mp downstream up to 20 40 0 43 mp l 1 which coincided with an increase of polyethylene films downstream bian et al 2022 similarly in the llobregat river spain no mps 20 μm were reported from headwater locations but concentrations increased downstream to 3 60 mp l 1 dalmau soler et al 2021 polyester fibre and fragment concentrations also increased downstream which was attributed to washing synthetic clothes and non treated discharge dalmau soler et al 2021 this type of downstream change has previously been attributed to increasing population urbanization and anthropogenic activity typically present along the flow length s of rivers de carvalho et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 these trends therefore suggest a linkage between mp concentration and urbanization given the increase in urbanization with distance downstream that has been documented in both our catchments this linkage is further illuminated by the sub catchment analysis a positive relationship was detected for mp concentration and degree of urbanization in sub catchments of sbc downstream of s1 though this relationship was not found for the sub catchments of bc the effect of urbanization was evident in both surface water and sediments with a clear increase of mp concentrations at b10 where the stream emerges from boulder canyon and enters the urban area fig 4 this increase is maintained downstream of b10 with relatively consistent mp concentrations through the highly urbanized area b10 b27 the effect of urbanization was further supported by assessment of the immediate 0 79 km2 buffer around sampling points as this revealed a significant local impact of urbanization in surface water for both bc and sbc s1 was excluded as an outlier indicating that proximity to the source and human activities is likely to be a critical factor in driving mp concentration in this riverine environment although data from both streams suggests a linkage between mp concentration and urbanization the effect of urbanization can be further elucidated by directly comparing the two streams urban land cover in the bc catchment is approximately 3 1 times greater than that of sbc section 2 1 and the higher degree of urbanization in bc may be responsible for the higher surface water and sediment mp concentrations section 3 2 further the mp loading rate for the bc study reach is 4 2 times higher than for sbc section 3 3 in close agreement with the urban land cover ratio 3 1 and the ratio of loading rates for urban derived inorganic constituents considered in the larger study that coincided with this research runkel et al 2022 sub catchment contributions of mps to the receiving streams are formally quantified by the loading analysis for the case of bc three consecutive stream segments represent the dominant mp sources with each contributing approximately one third of the mp load b10 b24 fig 3e section 3 3 the sub reach encompassing these segments begins upstream of the city of boulder suggesting the presence of a margin around the urban area that is affected by the more populated area i e access to numerous mountain homes and recreational activities is provided by a heavily travelled highway in the lower part of boulder canyon the lower parts of this sub reach are within the city proper and water and sediment concentrations at its terminus are the highest concentrations observed in this study b24 section 3 2 at sbc higher sub catchment contributions include s1 at the head of the study reach and stream segments downstream of eldorado springs although the surface water concentration at s1 is high relative to other sbc sites s1 is not in an urban area and its concentration is lower than at the urban sites in bc fig 4 the high mp concentration observed at s1 is likely attributable to its proximity to gross reservoir where potential sources include recreational activities water diverted from west of the continental divide and a nearby road though atmospheric deposition has been reported previously for this study area and adjacent upper colorado area reynolds et al 2022 wetherbee et al 2019 the contribution to mp concentration is expected to remain equal at all sites and is not believed to be the driving cause of the relatively high mp concentrations at s1 all stream segments downstream of eldorado springs contribute to the mp load except for the segment ending at s9 fig 3f this loading may also be associated with urban activities with potential sources being areas such as eldorado springs low density housing upstream of s11 and highways and roads that cross sbc as it enters the plains 4 3 the effect of diversions on mp concentrations loads and downstream transport the magnitude of flow diversions from bc and sbc results in large quantities of mp being removed from each catchment despite the relatively low surface water concentrations observed in both streams the diversion downstream of b12 removes 85 of the water section 3 1 and an equivalent percentage of surface water mp from bc a removal of 119 mp s 1 fig 5 similarly the diversion below s1 removes 95 of the water and mp a removal of 376 mp s 1 from sbc while the second diversion removes 80 of the remaining water and mps removing 29 mp s 1 fig 5 while many studies thus far have considered rivers as dendritic conveyor belts where plastics particle fluxes are converging along the transport from land to ocean with certain mp retention times hurley et al 2018 ockelford et al 2020 this study s quantitative load analysis suggests that water management may have a significant impact on mp fate and the mp flux delivered to the ocean the eventual fate of diverted mp depends on the diverted water s use water used as a source of municipal drinking water may result in the sequestration of mp given the effectiveness of water treatment plants that remove 80 93 of mps 20 μm from potable water supplies dalmau soler et al 2021 shen et al 2020 in contrast water diverted for agricultural purposes re routs and disperses mps to the wider terrestrial environment and these particles may be flushed back into streams in the long term diversions may also have a large impact on mp concentration fate and transport in the downstream portions of these managed systems estimated mp water concentrations are calculated for sampling locations downstream of large diversions section 2 5 and are shown in fig 3c d and table 1 an example of this effect is b24 the site with the highest mp concentration recorded in this study b24 is the first sampling location downstream of the large diversion on bc and its concentration is roughly double that of all other bc locations despite having a percent contribution to the total load that is comparable to the stream segments above the diversion and a loading rate that is lower table 1 this disconnect is explained by the large magnitude of the diversion the estimated concentration at b24 in the absence of the diversion is similar to that of nearby sites and what appears to be an outlier is just an artefact of the flow regime a second example of this effect is the large diversion on sbc below s1 with the diversion in place most of the mp mass is diverted out of the system and what remains in the stream is more easily diluted by waters in the undeveloped portions of the sbc canyon in the absence of this diversion mp concentrations at the downstream locations would have the concentration signature of s1 as this large volume of water and large amount of mp mass would be relatively unaffected by the sources downstream fig 3d diversions also alter the hydrodynamic conditions of the downstream reach potentially changing the fate of the mp travelling in the water column in the case considered here the diversion on bc causes a dramatic decrease in stream velocity with a median velocity below the diversion 0 14 m s 1 b24 b28 5 that is roughly half the velocity above the diversion 0 26 m s 1 b1 b19 table s1 this decrease in velocity increases mp residence time in the stream segment potentially resulting in increased settling of mp mass to the streambed in addition median stream depth decreases below the diversion 0 2 m b24 b28 5 median 0 3 m b1 b19 increasing the probability that mp will settle and become entrained in the streambed the effects of these changes are evident in the loading analysis with instream loads decreasing in two of the three segments below the diversion b27 and b28 5 fig 3e this additional loss of mp mass may be attributable to increased settling and retention in the streambed in summary little focus has been given previously to how water management activities affect mp transport downstream and the effects have not been incorporated into global models to date the total diverted load within this system was as high as 524 mp s 1 which is a significant finding given that the present study was conducted in a relatively remote mountain watershed over a short spatial scale it has been estimated that in the year 2012 241 km3 of water was diverted for the purpose of agriculture in north america alone and 2670 km3 globally frenken 2012 using values from this study an estimated 41 39 1012 mp particles 63 µm are redistributed to the terrestrial environment in north america and as many as 45 93 1014 or 459 trillion mp globally however as the numbers for diverted mp used here are only representative of this relatively remote system this is likely a gross underestimation of the global total as higher mp concentrations have been reported in lower order streams up to 25 5 3 5 mp l 1 in the maozhou river kumar et al 2021 wu et al 2020 this implies that diversions located in more polluted systems will unavoidably carry and re distribute more mp than estimated here none of which has been integrated into global or regional mp models in 2020 693 million m3 per capita of surface water was diverted globally for purposes of irrigation industrial processes and potable water oecd 2022 and extended monitoring of mp in water diversions may help bridge the gap between research and regulations coffin 2023 further the water diversions and the mp they divert have not been accounted for in any of the current global models the models may therefore overestimate the total amount of mps flowing into oceans and simultaneously underestimate the quantity ending up in terrestrial ecosystems due to this re distribution 4 4 advantages of the load approach the application of a loading analysis developed for metal contamination kimball et al 2002 runkel et al 2013 to an assessment of mp results in several advances in understanding the concentration and fate of this contaminant in streams and rivers first stream discharge measurements made at each sampling location allow for the development of longitudinal loading profiles fig 3e f that are in turn used to identify mp sources in a quantitative manner table 1 this identification based on mp load cannot be done using concentration data alone in the case of metal contamination from mining the identified stream segments are further investigated to pinpoint specific inflows responsible for the mass loading e g tributary inflows small springs and or groundwater this follow up activity is more complicated for mp due to potential contributions from atmospheric transport wetherbee et al 2019 brahney et al 2020 sun et al 2022 a mechanism that is not a factor in the studies of metal loading upon which this work is based kimball et al 2002 runkel et al 2013 as such additional techniques may be needed to further elucidate mp sources second the loading analysis allows for the identification of potential removal mechanisms such as settling from the water column to the streambed third our detailed analysis of the effects of diversions would not be possible without the quantitative loading approach as shown here the reduction in water volume due to diversions can result in a higher relative concentration of mp at a site and locations with seemingly high concentrations can be erroneously considered hotspots if only concentration data are considered our analysis does in fact identify the site with the highest concentration as a hotspot site b24 section 4 3 but the associated percent contribution loading rate table 1 and concentration in the absence of diversions fig 3c indicate that this stream segment is no different from the stream segments immediately upstream this suggests that some recorded hotspots in the literature may not be the result of increased input but rather the result of water diversions upstream of the sampling site this finding could also have profound implications on studies of freshwater organisms as these sudden changes in water volume could lead to higher local exposure a factor that could be considered when assessing ecosystem health 5 conclusion our research revealed profound links between the degree of urbanization and mp concentrations even in the investigated mountainous streams it clearly demonstrates the worth of loading analysis for load identification per stream segments which can lead into better source identification in the future and inform regional management and mitigation efforts more importantly it highlighted the crucial role of water diversions on mp concentrations and loads with over 500 mp s 1 being re distributed from the stream network into the catchment and beyond due to diversions clearly these findings highlight the importance of understanding river catchments as complex systems rather than the dendritic model through which mp only converge downstream which underlies most existing models for the simulation of global plastic fluxes from terrestrial compartments to the ocean our findings demonstrate that we are only beginning to uncover the true complexity of how rivers contribute to global mp flows and that anthropogenic impacts on water management practice such as river diversions can have substantial impact on mp fate and transport declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

14747,while microplastic inputs into rivers are assumed to be correlated with anthropogenic activities and to accumulate towards the sea the impacts of water management on downstream microplastic transport are largely unexplored a comparative study of microplastic abundance in boulder creek bc and its less urbanized tributary south boulder creek sbc colorado usa characterized the downstream evolution of microplastics in surface water and sediments evaluating the effects of urbanization and flow diversions on the up to downstream profiles of microplastic concentrations and loads water and sediment samples were collected from 21 locations along both rivers and microplastic properties determined by fluorescence microscopy and raman spectroscopy the degree of catchment urbanization affected microplastic patterns as evidenced by greater water and sediment concentrations and loads in bc than the less densely populated sbc which is consistent with the differences in the degree of urbanization between both catchments microplastic removal through flow diversions was quantified showing that water diversions removed over 500 microplastic particles per second from the river and caused stepwise reductions of downstream loads at diversion points this redistribution of microplastics back into the catchment should be considered in large scale models quantifying plastic fate and transport to the oceans graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics in rivers water management diversions abstraction paired catchment approach global models data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics plastic particles 1 mm hartmann et al 2019 here within referred to as mp are considered to be contaminants of concern lambert and wagner 2018 and are omnipresent in all environmental compartments on a global scale e g bian et al 2022 kukkola et al 2022 samandra et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 despite mps having been the focus of intense research efforts the sources their environmental entry points transport mechanisms and resulting distribution in the environment have yet to be fully understood it has been demonstrated that rivers represent major mp transport pathways to the oceans lebreton et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 but can also act as long term sinks drummond et al 2020 2022 margenat et al 2021 additionally mps in riverine environments may undergo major physio chemical transformation processes krause et al 2021 mcgivney et al 2020 and interact with the diverse community of freshwater organisms with potentially detrimental effects on species and ecosystem health e g causing entanglement suffocation and intestinal damage anbumani and kakkar 2018 kukkola et al 2021 to fully assess the risks that mps pose to river environments and their ecosystem services it is important to understand how mps are distributed within river corridors and how they get transported and potentially accumulated in river networks krause et al 2021 previous research has highlighted the existence of substantial spatial variability in mps in surface water and sediment in a wide range of river systems e g castañeda et al 2014 kurki fox et al 2023 wong et al 2020 however it is less well established which processes control this spatial variability a better understanding of these processes may result in more accurate predictions of the full extent to which rivers contribute to global plastic fluxes into the oceans and for site specific risk assessments additionally flux information may be coupled with estimates of mp residence times to assess local exposure and potential impacts on freshwater ecosystems this could lead to a better understanding of the potential sources and guide any regional management and mitigation strategies previous research has aimed to identify how population density and specifically the location of potential point and diffuse sources of discarded plastic waste influence the spatial distribution of mp consequently land use land cover has been linked to mp concentration and distribution in rivers grbić et al 2020 wang et al 2021 and global scale estimates of terrestrial plastic pollution and resulting riverine contributions to the oceans have predicted pollution hotspots to occur in densely populated urban areas with poor waste management systems ferraz et al 2020 lebreton et al 2019 2017 meijer et al 2021 however a clear correlation between the degree of urbanization and mp concentration could often not be established see talbot and chang 2022 for a review tibbetts et al 2018 there is growing awareness that in addition to the spatial distribution of sources the environmental fate of mps is strongly determined by their transport dispersal and potential deposition and storage along river networks de carvalho et al 2021 margenat et al 2021 tibbetts et al 2018 flow conditions may strongly affect mp deposition behaviour and residence time in the hyporheic zone drummond et al 2020 2022 current model predictions of riverine contributions to mp in the world s oceans show discrepancies ranging over several orders of magnitude lebreton et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 current models use only relatively coarse spatial information of river discharge if included at all siegfried et al 2017 uzun et al 2022 van wijnen et al 2019 very few studies have investigated the change in mp concentrations in relation to the hydrological regime and the characteristic flow and transport behaviour of the respective river systems campanale et al 2020 wagner et al 2019 a general assumption of existing large scale plastic transport models is a downstream convergence of particle fluxes along the river network there is a severe lack of understanding of the impact of river water management schemes e g water diversion for irrigation and drinking water on mp distribution fate and transport in river corridors despite the majority of rivers globally now being regulated in their flow barbarossa et al 2020 baumgartner et al 2022 it may therefore be important to analyse and quantify the combined impacts of mp source distributions and their transport in river networks under the influence of anthropogenically altered flow and transport conditions in order to aid model predictions here we present a comparative field study that applies a paired catchment approach to quantify the spatial distribution of mp in two neighbouring catchments south boulder creek and boulder creek colorado usa with different degrees of urbanization this study aims to i characterize the downstream evolution of mp concentration and associated particle properties in surface water and streambed sediments ii identify mp source areas using spatial profiles of stream load the product of concentration and stream discharge iii evaluate the effects of a the mountain to plains transition and b urbanization and iv quantify the degree to which flow diversions affect mp concentrations loads and downstream transport 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region boulder creek bc and its tributary south boulder creek sbc colorado usa are part of the wider boulder creek watershed which extends over 1160 km2 and is located in the front range of the rocky mountains east of the continental divide both catchments cover diverse geographical and hydro geomorphological conditions along a rural urban gradient and differ significantly in catchment wide and near stream land cover patterns fig 1 both streams flow northeast from their mountainous headwaters that originate at the continental divide elevations 4100 m and through canyons upstream sampling locations b1 and s1 are 2400 m sampling locations are further described in runkel et al 2022 before they reach the plains sampling locations b12 and s6 elevation 1800 m and eventually confluence at the eastern edge of the city of boulder near sampling point b33 fig 1 ultimately these waters drain into the mississippi river and the gulf of mexico over 2300 km away the bc catchment is more urbanized 12 upstream of confluence with sbc than sbc 3 9 upstream of confluence with bc both are characterized by a high forest cover bc 73 and sbc 84 the catchment areas for bc and sbc upstream of their confluence are 405 km2 and 342 km2 respectively with a total catchment size of 790 km2 at point b34 fig 1 the sampled river sections cover 36 7 km flow length of bc and 27 7 km of sbc over these sections river slope varies between 0 003 m m b34 and 0 040 m m b9 for bc and 0 005 m m s9 and 0 085 s1 for sbc while average sinuosity is 1 31 bc and 1 39 sbc respectively indicating a comparable and generally low degree of meandering the procedures used to determine the foregoing watershed characteristics are detailed in section 2 4 like for many river systems in the western united states water management plays a large role in both streams murphy 2006 mountain reservoirs are used to store large volumes of water generated during spring snowmelt and this water is subsequently diverted out of the catchments for municipal and agricultural use through a system of canals as such stream discharge decreases in downstream direction for long periods of the year the bc study reach begins approximately 4 km downstream of barker reservoir which receives water from the surrounding catchment a relatively undeveloped area to the east of the continental divide water released from barker reservoir travels down boulder canyon entering the city of boulder near sampling location b12 fig 1 the primary diversion affecting stream discharge during this study is located downstream of sample location b19 where more than half of the discharge is diverted away from bc at certain times of year murphy 2006 the sbc study reach begins approximately 1 5 km downstream of gross reservoir which receives much of its water from the underground moffatt tunnel that transports water from west of the continental divide to the eastern side murphy 2006 most of the water leaving gross reservoir is diverted out of sbc downstream of sampling location s1 supplying water to the city of denver sbc flows through the small town of eldorado springs between s4 and s6 fig 1 before entering the plains downstream of sample location s6 a second major diversion active during the study period is located downstream of site s13 resulting in additional decreases in stream discharge 2 2 field data and sample collection surface water and sediment samples were collected from thirteen locations within bc and eight sites within sbc as a subset of a larger study that included additional sample locations runkel et al 2022 sampling took place october 14 18 2019 during steady low flow conditions which are typical in the research area for the period between october and march the relatively steady flow conditions during the sampling period were confirmed by stream discharge records from gauging stations bocoroco 18 5 km downstream from barker reservoir sampling location b9 and bocelsco 0 7 km downstream from the major diversion located between s1 and s4 https www dwr state co us fig 2 at each sampling site 50 l of surface water was collected from the centre of the stream and from the middle depth due to low flow conditions 10 cm of the water column with galvanized metal bucket during sampling the bucket was lowered into the stream horizontally opening facing upstream the bucket was returned to the upright position after being filled by the flowing water and the surface water was filtered through a 63 µm nylon mesh from which contents were then transferred into a precleaned 20 ml glass vial using deionized water the mp samples collected in this manner are assumed to include buoyant mps and mps with a density greater than water that have yet to settle to the streambed suspended sediment sampling techniques edwards and glysson 1999 were not employed in this study given the steady low flow conditions in which bedload is assumed to be negligible contributor to constituent load sediment was collected from both streambanks just above the water line using a metal spoon a composite sediment sample from three spots within a radius of about 1 m was collected and stored in a clean glass jar giving a final sample mass of 60 90 g per streambank all samples nwater 21 and nsediment 42 were stored at room temperature and transported to the university of birmingham uk for analysis at the end of the sampling period data collected at each sampling point comprised geographic coordinates stream depth cross sectional area velocity and discharge as measured by acoustic doppler velocimetry table s1 runkel et al 2022 2 3 sample analysis and qa qc sediment and water samples were extracted using sediment mp isolation smi units in accordance with nel et al 2020 as described in supplementary section s1 mp extraction after extraction organic matter om was digested using fenton reagent and stained with nile red as described in section s1 samples were analysed with fluorescence microscopy as described in kukkola et al 2023 and section s2 polymer identification by confocal raman spectroscopy lenz et al 2015 kelleher et al 2023 was employed for roughly 44 of all putative mps in total 206 particles the procedure and spectra acquisition parameters are described in section s3 field background samples laboratory blanks and positive blanks were collected and analysed as described in s4 for the purposes of this study mp measurements in counts per litre are hereinafter referred to as concentrations 2 4 land cover population density and statistical analyses to understand how mp concentrations vary in relation to catchment area and the percent of urban land cover each sub catchment defined as the drainage area discharging towards each sampling location was delineated with the usgs program streamstats v4 6 2 u s geological survey 2019 and exported into arcmap 10 7 1 esri 2011 population density per sub catchment for 2019 was obtained from the colorado state demography office https demography dola colorado gov and land cover classes for sub catchments were determined utilizing the national land cover database nlcd multi resolution land characteristics consortium https www mrlc gov viewer 2019 dataset which contains official land cover data for the usa 2019 with a resolution of 30 30 m the 20 landcover classes from the nlcd data set were reclassified into nine general categories see supplementary section s5 to analyse potential local land cover impacts on observed mp concentrations a 500 m circular buffer a 0 79 km2 was created around each sampling site in arcmap to aid identification of possible local source effects as compared to the sub catchment wide approach to study effects in sub catchments the area per land cover class was normalized to the respective sub catchment area data were assessed for normality using a shapiro wilk test spearman s rank coefficient was used to determine correlations between mp concentrations and urban land cover and population density because mps data followed a non normal distribution to evaluate any variation in mps concentrations in water and sediment between and within the two streams mann whitney u and kruskal wallis tests were applied spearman s rank coefficient was used to assess correlation direction and strength for mp concentration and size measured as longest length and hydrological parameters all statistical analyses were carried out in rstudio r core team 2022 with a significant threshold of α 0 05 2 5 mp loads and estimated concentrations in the absence of diversions contributions of mps from the sub catchments discharging to each segment of the study reaches i e the distance between sampling locations were quantified using spatial profiles of the stream mp loads table 1 developed by summing the observed load at each location the product of stream discharge and concentration and the load that had been diverted out of the system the product of the diverted stream discharge and the concentration at the nearest upstream site profiles of cumulative load were calculated by summing all positive changes in instream load while keeping the cumulative load constant when the instream load decreased kimball et al 2002 runkel et al 2013 stream segments with increases in cumulative load thus represent source areas with each source area contributing a percentage to the overall load 1 p e r c e n t c o n t r i b u t i o n 100 l d l u l b l t where l is the cumulative load d and u denote the cumulative load at the downstream and upstream ends of a stream segment while b and t denote the cumulative load at the bottom and top of the study reach loading rates change in load per km were also calculated for individual segments between sampling points and for the entire study reach as 2 l o a d i n g r a t e δ l o a d d i s t a n c e where load is the change in load for the segment or study reach ld lu or lb lt and distance equals the length of the segment or study reach table 1 three sampling points were excluded from the loading analysis due to unsteady flow conditions during sampling b15 b17 and b19 two additional bc sites b33 b34 were also excluded as they are located below the confluence of bc and sbc and are not used in the comparison of the two study reaches these downstream sites are omitted from our discussion of the results presented in sections 3 1 and 3 3 both study reaches have water diversions which decrease stream discharge sampling locations downstream of these diversions will have a smaller volume of water than they would in the absence of diversions and consequently the impact of a given source area and loading rate will be exacerbated with less dilution occurring due to reduced discharge these impacts can be formally quantified by estimating the mp concentrations that would be observed in the absence of diversions mp water concentrations in the absence of diversions are calculated by summing the observed and diverted loads and dividing by the sum of the observed and diverted stream discharge 3 results 3 1 stream discharge several flow diversions were active during the sampling event and 85 of the stream discharge present at b12 was diverted away from bc between b12 and b24 0 43 m3 s 1 fig 3 a and from 0 06 m3 s 1 s14 to 2 48 m3 s 1 s1 for sbc fig 3b several flow diversions were active during the sampling event with the major diversion on bc diverting 87 of the stream discharge at b19 away from bc 0 43 m3 s 1 for the sbc study reach 95 of the stream discharge at s1 2 35 m3 s 1 was diverted for use by the city of denver and 79 of the remaining stream discharge at s13 0 24 m3 s 1 was diverted out of the channel 3 2 mp concentrations in surface water and streambed sediments mp were detected in all surface water and sediment samples across the studied sites fig 4 mean surface water concentrations for bc were 0 22 mp l 1 0 14 standard deviation sd ranging between 0 08 b9 and 0 62 mp l 1 b24 for sbc mean mp concentrations were 0 09 mp l 1 0 05 sd with a range between 0 02 s4 and 0 16 mp l 1 s1 a mann whitney u test confirmed that the difference in mp concentration in the surface water between the two streams was significant p 0 016 streambed sediments for bc had a mean dry weight concentration of 186 mp kg 1 80 sd ranging between 114 b3 and 342 mp kg 1 b24 for sbc the mean sediment concentration was 142 mp kg 1 55 sd ranging from 98 s1 to 214 mp kg 1 s11 mann whitney test indicated that the difference in sediment concentration was non significant p 0 091 the sediment concentrations generally displayed a non significant increasing trend downstream with peaks between sites b12 and b24 fig 4 b12 being where bc emerges from boulder canyon at the city margins of boulder while b24 is located at the eastern edge of a high density urban area where the highest surface water concentration was also observed peak water mp concentrations at sbc were recorded at the most upstream site s1 and the most downstream site s15 0 16 mp l 1 the highest mp concentrations in sbc sediment were recorded at site s11 surface water concentrations in sbc exhibited a linear positive relationship with distance downstream of the first major diversion site s1 excluded rs 0 964 p 1 85 10 5 with increasing concentrations downstream a similar but non significant trend was also observed in sediments fig 4 no correlation was found between stream discharge and the size of mp either in surface water or sediments at bc however a moderate positive correlation was found between discharge and size of mps in surface water at sbc table s4 there was no correlation between discharge and mp concentration in water or sediments table s5 no correlation was found between river velocity or slope and mp concentration in surface water or sediments table s5 3 3 mp loads the average stream mp load for bc was 97 mp s 1 with a range between 16 mp s 1 b9 and 193 mp s 1 b24 fig 3e the stream mp load for bc declines from b1 35 mp s 1 to b9 16 mp s 1 after which it steadily increases to its maximum of 193 mp s 1 at b24 mp load then decreases in the last two stream segments b27 and b28 5 to 141 mp s 1 fig 3e the average stream load for sbc was 400 mp s 1 with a range between 381 mp s 1 s4 and 418 mp s 1 s15 fig 3f the mp stream load drops between sites s1 and s4 after which it generally increases to its maximum value at the end of the study reach s15 fig 3f as will be discussed in detail in section 4 4 most of the stream load is diverted out of the sbc catchment near the head of the study reach average study reach loading rates were 7 2 and 1 7 mp s 1 km 1 for bc and sbc respectively mp loading in bc is dominated by contributions to the three stream segments ending at b10 b12 and b24 percent contributions of 34 30 and 36 respectively fig 3e mp loading at sbc had major contributions at s6 25 s11 29 s13 32 and s15 11 fig 3f 3 4 physical and chemical properties of mp for bc surface water fragments amounted to 51 7 and fibres to 48 3 of the total mp detected fig 4 similarly for sbc surface water 51 3 of total mp were fragments and 48 7 fibres no spheres were detected in water samples from either stream a clear colour dominated fragments and a blue colour dominated fibres in both streams in the bc sediments mostly fragments were present 87 while fibres 12 and spheres 1 played a minor role fig 4 for sbc the percentage of fragments 93 was slightly larger while fibres only amounted to 7 in sediments from both streams most fragments were a clear colour while most fibres were black in total 206 putative mps 44 of total were subjected to raman spectroscopy analysis from which 86 were positively identified as plastics with the most common polymer type in surface water being polyester 50 and in sediment being polyethylene terephthalate 36 for details see supplementary section s6 the respective identification rate for fragments was 75 and 92 for fibres 3 5 land cover impacts on mp a mann whitney u test indicated a statistically significant difference in urban land cover between bc and sbc upstream of their confluence u 84 p 0 0001 when assessing the relationship of urban land cover within sub catchments to mp concentrations no correlation was found in water or sediments for bc however at sbc a very strong correlation was found in surface water site s1 excluded rs 0 964 p 1 85 10 5 with no trend evident in the sediments sbc rs 0 047 p 0 910 besides urbanization no significant correlations were found for other land cover types for sbc mp concentrations in surface water were positively correlated with forest cover rs 0 643 p 0 024 for bc but negatively for sbc rs 0 658 p 0 075 this is likely due to forest cover in bc increasing downstream towards the confluence but decreasing downstream at sbc towards more urbanized areas suggesting that mp concentrations in surface water and sediment were not correlated with the total catchment area bcwater rs 0 275 p 0 391 bcsed rs 0 322 p 0 222 sbcwater rs 0 395 p 0 332 sbcsed rs 0 476 p 0 232 the analysis of land cover impacts in the immediate 500 m buffer around each sampling location revealed a strong positive correlation between surface water mp concentration and urban cover at bc rs 793 p 0 025 and at sbc if the most upstream sampling point s1 was excluded from the analysis rswiths1 0299 p 0 4713 rswithouts1 0 828 p 0 023 for sediments no significant correlation was identified for bc rs 0 508 p 0 075 while for sbc the moderate correlation found was not statistically significant rs 0 547 p 0 160 none of the other land cover types had any correlation to mp concentrations for bc or sbc 4 discussion 4 1 mp concentration in surface water and sediments the more urbanized bc 0 22 mp l 1 63 µm had higher mp concentrations in surface water than sbc 0 09 mp l 1 but both streams could be considered to have relatively low mp contamination present and our findings are similar to other studies in rivers of comparable properties remote mountainous bian et al 2022 dalmau soler et al 2021 ferraz et al 2020 and orders of magnitude lower than those reported from lowland rivers such as canals in suzhou city china 8 40 mp l 1 20 µm or amsterdam netherlands 48 187 mp l 1 10 µm jin et al 2022 leslie et al 2017 similarly bc had higher sediment mp concentrations 186 mp kg 1 than sbc 142 mp kg 1 but these are in line with those previously reported from remote areas such as from the rivers of the tibetan plateau 50 195 mp kg 1 20 µm jiang et al 2019 and from dafeng river china 0 0 50 3 mp kg 1 20 µm 4 2 the effects of the mountain to plains transition and urbanization on mp concentrations and types surface water and sediment mp concentrations increase in the downstream direction for both bc and sbc with downstream trends being particularly clear in surface water fig 4 this is consistent with previous studies six rivers located at a mountain foothill transition area in the chin ling wei river plain china had concentrations of 2 57 0 14 mp l 1 75 µm in the mountainous areas with increasing concentrations of mp downstream up to 20 40 0 43 mp l 1 which coincided with an increase of polyethylene films downstream bian et al 2022 similarly in the llobregat river spain no mps 20 μm were reported from headwater locations but concentrations increased downstream to 3 60 mp l 1 dalmau soler et al 2021 polyester fibre and fragment concentrations also increased downstream which was attributed to washing synthetic clothes and non treated discharge dalmau soler et al 2021 this type of downstream change has previously been attributed to increasing population urbanization and anthropogenic activity typically present along the flow length s of rivers de carvalho et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 these trends therefore suggest a linkage between mp concentration and urbanization given the increase in urbanization with distance downstream that has been documented in both our catchments this linkage is further illuminated by the sub catchment analysis a positive relationship was detected for mp concentration and degree of urbanization in sub catchments of sbc downstream of s1 though this relationship was not found for the sub catchments of bc the effect of urbanization was evident in both surface water and sediments with a clear increase of mp concentrations at b10 where the stream emerges from boulder canyon and enters the urban area fig 4 this increase is maintained downstream of b10 with relatively consistent mp concentrations through the highly urbanized area b10 b27 the effect of urbanization was further supported by assessment of the immediate 0 79 km2 buffer around sampling points as this revealed a significant local impact of urbanization in surface water for both bc and sbc s1 was excluded as an outlier indicating that proximity to the source and human activities is likely to be a critical factor in driving mp concentration in this riverine environment although data from both streams suggests a linkage between mp concentration and urbanization the effect of urbanization can be further elucidated by directly comparing the two streams urban land cover in the bc catchment is approximately 3 1 times greater than that of sbc section 2 1 and the higher degree of urbanization in bc may be responsible for the higher surface water and sediment mp concentrations section 3 2 further the mp loading rate for the bc study reach is 4 2 times higher than for sbc section 3 3 in close agreement with the urban land cover ratio 3 1 and the ratio of loading rates for urban derived inorganic constituents considered in the larger study that coincided with this research runkel et al 2022 sub catchment contributions of mps to the receiving streams are formally quantified by the loading analysis for the case of bc three consecutive stream segments represent the dominant mp sources with each contributing approximately one third of the mp load b10 b24 fig 3e section 3 3 the sub reach encompassing these segments begins upstream of the city of boulder suggesting the presence of a margin around the urban area that is affected by the more populated area i e access to numerous mountain homes and recreational activities is provided by a heavily travelled highway in the lower part of boulder canyon the lower parts of this sub reach are within the city proper and water and sediment concentrations at its terminus are the highest concentrations observed in this study b24 section 3 2 at sbc higher sub catchment contributions include s1 at the head of the study reach and stream segments downstream of eldorado springs although the surface water concentration at s1 is high relative to other sbc sites s1 is not in an urban area and its concentration is lower than at the urban sites in bc fig 4 the high mp concentration observed at s1 is likely attributable to its proximity to gross reservoir where potential sources include recreational activities water diverted from west of the continental divide and a nearby road though atmospheric deposition has been reported previously for this study area and adjacent upper colorado area reynolds et al 2022 wetherbee et al 2019 the contribution to mp concentration is expected to remain equal at all sites and is not believed to be the driving cause of the relatively high mp concentrations at s1 all stream segments downstream of eldorado springs contribute to the mp load except for the segment ending at s9 fig 3f this loading may also be associated with urban activities with potential sources being areas such as eldorado springs low density housing upstream of s11 and highways and roads that cross sbc as it enters the plains 4 3 the effect of diversions on mp concentrations loads and downstream transport the magnitude of flow diversions from bc and sbc results in large quantities of mp being removed from each catchment despite the relatively low surface water concentrations observed in both streams the diversion downstream of b12 removes 85 of the water section 3 1 and an equivalent percentage of surface water mp from bc a removal of 119 mp s 1 fig 5 similarly the diversion below s1 removes 95 of the water and mp a removal of 376 mp s 1 from sbc while the second diversion removes 80 of the remaining water and mps removing 29 mp s 1 fig 5 while many studies thus far have considered rivers as dendritic conveyor belts where plastics particle fluxes are converging along the transport from land to ocean with certain mp retention times hurley et al 2018 ockelford et al 2020 this study s quantitative load analysis suggests that water management may have a significant impact on mp fate and the mp flux delivered to the ocean the eventual fate of diverted mp depends on the diverted water s use water used as a source of municipal drinking water may result in the sequestration of mp given the effectiveness of water treatment plants that remove 80 93 of mps 20 μm from potable water supplies dalmau soler et al 2021 shen et al 2020 in contrast water diverted for agricultural purposes re routs and disperses mps to the wider terrestrial environment and these particles may be flushed back into streams in the long term diversions may also have a large impact on mp concentration fate and transport in the downstream portions of these managed systems estimated mp water concentrations are calculated for sampling locations downstream of large diversions section 2 5 and are shown in fig 3c d and table 1 an example of this effect is b24 the site with the highest mp concentration recorded in this study b24 is the first sampling location downstream of the large diversion on bc and its concentration is roughly double that of all other bc locations despite having a percent contribution to the total load that is comparable to the stream segments above the diversion and a loading rate that is lower table 1 this disconnect is explained by the large magnitude of the diversion the estimated concentration at b24 in the absence of the diversion is similar to that of nearby sites and what appears to be an outlier is just an artefact of the flow regime a second example of this effect is the large diversion on sbc below s1 with the diversion in place most of the mp mass is diverted out of the system and what remains in the stream is more easily diluted by waters in the undeveloped portions of the sbc canyon in the absence of this diversion mp concentrations at the downstream locations would have the concentration signature of s1 as this large volume of water and large amount of mp mass would be relatively unaffected by the sources downstream fig 3d diversions also alter the hydrodynamic conditions of the downstream reach potentially changing the fate of the mp travelling in the water column in the case considered here the diversion on bc causes a dramatic decrease in stream velocity with a median velocity below the diversion 0 14 m s 1 b24 b28 5 that is roughly half the velocity above the diversion 0 26 m s 1 b1 b19 table s1 this decrease in velocity increases mp residence time in the stream segment potentially resulting in increased settling of mp mass to the streambed in addition median stream depth decreases below the diversion 0 2 m b24 b28 5 median 0 3 m b1 b19 increasing the probability that mp will settle and become entrained in the streambed the effects of these changes are evident in the loading analysis with instream loads decreasing in two of the three segments below the diversion b27 and b28 5 fig 3e this additional loss of mp mass may be attributable to increased settling and retention in the streambed in summary little focus has been given previously to how water management activities affect mp transport downstream and the effects have not been incorporated into global models to date the total diverted load within this system was as high as 524 mp s 1 which is a significant finding given that the present study was conducted in a relatively remote mountain watershed over a short spatial scale it has been estimated that in the year 2012 241 km3 of water was diverted for the purpose of agriculture in north america alone and 2670 km3 globally frenken 2012 using values from this study an estimated 41 39 1012 mp particles 63 µm are redistributed to the terrestrial environment in north america and as many as 45 93 1014 or 459 trillion mp globally however as the numbers for diverted mp used here are only representative of this relatively remote system this is likely a gross underestimation of the global total as higher mp concentrations have been reported in lower order streams up to 25 5 3 5 mp l 1 in the maozhou river kumar et al 2021 wu et al 2020 this implies that diversions located in more polluted systems will unavoidably carry and re distribute more mp than estimated here none of which has been integrated into global or regional mp models in 2020 693 million m3 per capita of surface water was diverted globally for purposes of irrigation industrial processes and potable water oecd 2022 and extended monitoring of mp in water diversions may help bridge the gap between research and regulations coffin 2023 further the water diversions and the mp they divert have not been accounted for in any of the current global models the models may therefore overestimate the total amount of mps flowing into oceans and simultaneously underestimate the quantity ending up in terrestrial ecosystems due to this re distribution 4 4 advantages of the load approach the application of a loading analysis developed for metal contamination kimball et al 2002 runkel et al 2013 to an assessment of mp results in several advances in understanding the concentration and fate of this contaminant in streams and rivers first stream discharge measurements made at each sampling location allow for the development of longitudinal loading profiles fig 3e f that are in turn used to identify mp sources in a quantitative manner table 1 this identification based on mp load cannot be done using concentration data alone in the case of metal contamination from mining the identified stream segments are further investigated to pinpoint specific inflows responsible for the mass loading e g tributary inflows small springs and or groundwater this follow up activity is more complicated for mp due to potential contributions from atmospheric transport wetherbee et al 2019 brahney et al 2020 sun et al 2022 a mechanism that is not a factor in the studies of metal loading upon which this work is based kimball et al 2002 runkel et al 2013 as such additional techniques may be needed to further elucidate mp sources second the loading analysis allows for the identification of potential removal mechanisms such as settling from the water column to the streambed third our detailed analysis of the effects of diversions would not be possible without the quantitative loading approach as shown here the reduction in water volume due to diversions can result in a higher relative concentration of mp at a site and locations with seemingly high concentrations can be erroneously considered hotspots if only concentration data are considered our analysis does in fact identify the site with the highest concentration as a hotspot site b24 section 4 3 but the associated percent contribution loading rate table 1 and concentration in the absence of diversions fig 3c indicate that this stream segment is no different from the stream segments immediately upstream this suggests that some recorded hotspots in the literature may not be the result of increased input but rather the result of water diversions upstream of the sampling site this finding could also have profound implications on studies of freshwater organisms as these sudden changes in water volume could lead to higher local exposure a factor that could be considered when assessing ecosystem health 5 conclusion our research revealed profound links between the degree of urbanization and mp concentrations even in the investigated mountainous streams it clearly demonstrates the worth of loading analysis for load identification per stream segments which can lead into better source identification in the future and inform regional management and mitigation efforts more importantly it highlighted the crucial role of water diversions on mp concentrations and loads with over 500 mp s 1 being re distributed from the stream network into the catchment and beyond due to diversions clearly these findings highlight the importance of understanding river catchments as complex systems rather than the dendritic model through which mp only converge downstream which underlies most existing models for the simulation of global plastic fluxes from terrestrial compartments to the ocean our findings demonstrate that we are only beginning to uncover the true complexity of how rivers contribute to global mp flows and that anthropogenic

14748,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox as a low carbon and energy saving technology has shown unique advantages in the treatment of high ammonia wastewater however wastewater usually contains complex heavy metals hms which pose a potential risk to the stable operation of the anammox system this review systematically re evaluates the hms toxicity level from the inhibition effects and the inhibition recovery process which can provide a new reference for engineering from the perspective of anammox cell structure extracellular anammoxosome membrane anammoxosome the mechanism of hms effects on cellular substances and metabolism is expounded furthermore the challenges and research gaps for hms inhibition in anammox research are also discussed the clarification of material flow energy flow and community succession under hms shock will help further reveal the inhibition mechanism the development of new recovery strategies such as bio accelerators and bio augmentation is conductive to breaking through the engineered limitations of hms on anammox this review provides a new perspective on the recognition of toxicity and mechanism of hms in the anammox process as well as the promotion of engineering applicability graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox heavy metals toxic effects mechanism recovery strategy abbreviations ahl n acyl homoserine

excess nitrogen produced by human production and life activities enters the water body which can easily cause eutrophication and destroy the ecological environment balance of the water body canfield et al 2010 as the current mainstream trend the biological nitrogen removal bnr process is widely used in wastewater treatment hu et al 2018 lin et al 2020 liu et al 2021 the diversity of nitrogen cycling pathways in nature makes bnr pathways complex fig 1 anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process uses nh4 as an electron donor and no2 as an electron acceptor to produce n2 which breaks the limitation of traditional nitrification and denitrification relying on lengthy reaction paths and greatly improves the nitrogen removal rate kartal et al 2011a as an autotrophic microorganism anammox bacteria can complete efficient nitrogen removal without organic carbon source and oxygen supply which makes the anammox process show great advantages and development potential in the concept of carbon neutrality qian et al 2022 xue et al 2021 however the slow proliferation rate and weak environmental adaptability of the anammox bacteria often face great challenges in actual wastewater treatment guo et al 2020 li et al 2018 heavy metals hms as the common water pollutants are widely distributed in various ammonia rich nitrogen wastewater such as aquaculture wastewater and landfill leachate wang et al 2022 zhao et al 2014 anammox bacteria will be exposed to hms for a long time during the treatment of ammonia rich wastewater which will affect its nitrogen removal efficiency with the popularization of anammox technology in mainstream wastewater treatment in recent years environmental emergency events also bring short term hms exposure risk to municipal wastewater treatment di cesare et al 2016 at present several reviews have summarized the reactor performance as a basic indicator to reflect the toxicity of hms for example wang et al focused on the short term and long term effects of hms on the anammox process wang et al 2021 and zhang et al further classified the hms toxicity level according to the semi inhibitory concentration ic50 on the anammox system zhang et al 2022a it is generally recognized that the ic50 is more suitable to evaluate the short term effects of hms on anammox however the sudden fluctuation of water quality in engineering requires the anammox systems to address hms shock and recovery processes so a novel toxicity evaluation method should be proposed to adapt to engineering practice moreover the different toxicity levels of hms are due to the response mechanism of the anammox system under hms shock previous reviews focused on the migration and binding process of hms on anammox cell surface changes in the structure and composition of eps and variations of intracellular enzyme activity in nitrogen metabolism madeira and de araujo 2021 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022b which can be attributed to the partial summary of cellular structural responses however as the most important cellular structure the anammoxosome is responsible for the metabolic function of anammox bacteria damste et al 2002 of which the response mechanism has not been systematically reviewed meanwhile studies on the response of anammoxosome related proteins and genes to hms are fragmented and lack scientific summary and analysis therefore according to the migration path of hms in anammox bacteria it is necessary to complete the response mechanism of hms at the cellular structure level of anammox bacteria with anammoxosome as the core which will broaden the response mechanism of anammox bacteria to hms shock to alleviate the inhibition of hms on anammox bacteria several strategies focused on wastewater pretreatment e g sorption and addition of exogenous chemical reagents e g feso4 and edta zhang et al 2022a 2016b which aim to reduce hms concentration in the system and relieve microbial stress however these strategies focused on changing the external adverse environment rather than directly restoring the microbial activity according to the potential response mechanism it would also be effective to regulate microbial activity in terms of microbial growth community balance and electron transport which requires more in depth analyses in addition to using these chemical reagents to increase microbial activity the resistance of anammox bacteria to hms shock is expected to be enhanced by emerging biological technologies this could be achieved through genetic engineering to hms resistant bacterial communities and 3d bio printing to optimize the spatial distribution of systematic communities ma et al 2022a yang et al 2021 although these potential applications have not been well associated with anammox systems this review systematically proposes these promising solutions which will be of great significance for engineering applications this review aims to summarize the inhibitory effects of hms shock on the anammox system from multiple perspectives including 1 generalizing the effects of hms on the anammox system according to different inhibition times types and forms and further re evaluating the toxicity level of hms 2 expanding the spatial response mechanism of hms shock on the anammox system at the cellular structure level and 3 proposing the direction of in depth research on the inhibition mechanism the recovery strategy of bio accelerators and bio augmentation 2 toxic influences of hms on anammox system the damage of hms to microorganisms is recognized but under the different types and forms of hms shock the degree of inhibition on anammox bacteria is different this section will review the inhibitory effects of hms on anammox systems and evaluate their toxicity levels by category summarize and analyze the difference in inhibitory effects of the same metal from the substance form of hms in addition relevant research priorities for multi metal inhibition are highlighted 2 1 toxicity of typical hms to anammox systems trace hms can promote the activity of microorganisms but as concentrations increase hms can enter cells through specific transport pathways interact with intracellular enzymes rna or dna destroy the integrity of the membrane structure and thus affect cell metabolism or cause cell death stohs and bagchi 1995 current researches on the hms toxicity to anammox systems are mainly divided into short term inhibition and long term inhibition short term inhibition focuses on evaluating the acute toxicity of hms ions while long term inhibition concerns the adaptability and recovery of microorganisms to the hms environment recent studies on the inhibition of the anammox process by hms are summarized in table 1 and table 2 for short term effects the changes in the anammox activity of microorganisms under low and high concentrations of hms were different cr vi at 2 mg l 1 and cd ii at 1 mg l 1 could increase the specific anammox activity saa by 8 9 and 17 4 respectively xu et al 2019b yu et al 2019 generally low concentration of hms could stimulate the physiological activity of anammox bacteria such as cu zn and ni table 1 on the one hand microorganisms can use hms to synthesize enzymes li et al 2015 required for physiological activities on the other hand anammox bacteria enhance their protective ability by increasing their own activities and secreting more extracellular polymeric substances eps under stress jiang et al 2018 high concentrations of hms often showed the acute toxicity on the anammox system for example when the cu ii concentration exceeded 20 mg l 1 the anammox activity was almost completely lost within 4 h xu et al 2019b cu ii can combine with thiolates to attack the iron sulfur center after entering cells thereby severely inhibiting electron transfer and the metabolic system dupont et al 2011 additionally cu ii can displace essential metals and active centers of enzymes cofactors or other biomolecular species resulting in enzyme inactivation and cytoplasmic membrane disruption eventually deteriorating the anammox system sani et al 2001 the long term effects of hms on anammox systems are often more than 20 days as shown in table 2 hms gradually showed obvious inhibition under long term exposure nevertheless due to the different magnitudes of hms toxicity some systems showed signs of recovery after adaptation reducing the competitive advantage of bacterial flora inhibiting the metal transport system and retaining hms by biofilms are the three reasons that lead to persistent hms toxicity in the anammox system for instance as the typical genus of anammox bacteria the dominance of candidatus kuenenia was weakened by 10 mg l 1 ni ii and its relative abundance decreased from 36 23 to 28 46 severely affecting the nitrogen removal rate wu et al 2019 the cusa resistance gene was responsible for pumping cu ii from the intracellular to the extracellular space of anammox bacteria under cu ii shock the expression of cusa was reduced leading to an increase in intracellular cu ii concentration thus showing an inhibitory effect on the anammox system for approximately 50 days yang et al 2013 in addition the hms adsorbed by the biofilm could still release ions to the environment which would persistently inhibit the activity of microorganisms zhang et al 2018b within a certain concentration range of hms microorganisms could improve their own adaptive capacity and the system activity also recovered however due to the irreversible damage of hms the effect of recovery is often different to achieve pre shock level zhang indicated that 2 mg l 1 cr vi caused the nitrogen removal rate nrr to plummet to 69 of the initial value but the nrr could only recover to 90 of the initial level after 10 days adaptation zhang et al 2021b anammox bacteria producing resistance genes can synthesize proteins related to detoxification under hms shock under the stress of some metals the expression of functional genes responsible for the migration and transformation of substances increases which not only converts the original highly toxic substances into low toxic forms but also discharges excess intracellular metal ions chen et al 2020b xu et al 2019a zhang et al 2018e this self regulating process of detoxification helps the anammox system regain its biological activity ic50 as an important indicator for the toxicity of hms is often used to evaluate the inhibition concentration of hms val del río et al 2017 zhang et al 2022a however the recovery time and biological adaptability of anammox system after hms inhibition are important aspects and some hms usually exist in the form of precipitation in the anammox system so its actual toxicity may differ from the results of ic50 in the anammox system inspired by these facts further consideration is needed in long term operation engineering this review proposed a combination of toxicity level recovery time and biological adaptation as well as considered the actual form of hms so as to provide another perspective for rational evaluation of the toxicity of hms on anammox process this method of re evaluating hms toxicity is also especially significant for practical applications fig 2 according to this toxicity evaluation method severely toxic metals include cd cu zn and cr vi these metals can usually generate free radicals directly or through valence transitions to attack proteins and dna in cells to prevent electron transfer making it difficult for anammox bacteria to develop resistance to these hms for these inhibitory mechanisms saa was inhibited by 50 at about only 10 mg l 1 hms and required more than 30 days for self recovery approximately moderately toxic metals include mn fe ni and ag compared with the highly toxic metals they were less inhibitory to anammox and could recover by themselves in about 15 days anammox bacteria had certain adaptability to moderately toxic metals and the relative abundance decreased by less than 50 after hms shock table 2 notably diverse autotrophic modes of anammox bacteria were revealed jetten et al 2009 microorganisms could utilize mn ii and fe iii as potential electron acceptors in the anammox process after long term acclimation strous et al 2006 zhu et al 2021 slightly toxic metals include pb and hg this is contrary to the theory that pb and hg have severe toxicity to microorganisms wu and wang 2011 yuan et al 2015 affected by the alkalinity of bicarbonate during the cultivation of anammox bacteria pb often existed in the form of precipitation in the system gutwiński et al 2020 it was demonstrated that 40 mg l 1 pb ii was exposed to the anammox system but the liquid ion concentration was only 2 3 mg l 1 which limited the toxic effect of pb in the anammox system yu et al 2016 similarly hg could not only combine with nh4 to form a stable complex hg nh3 2 2 chen et al 2020a but also be converted into low toxic hg0 by specific protein chen et al 2020b moreover anammox bacteria had strong adaptability to hg ii although 20 mg l 1 hg ii reduced nrr by 29 the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia decreased only from 14 2 to 13 9 table 2 without causing significant anammox bacterial death chen et al 2020b therefore pb and hg did not perform well in inhibiting anammox process 2 2 toxicity performance of different hms forms on anammox bacteria common forms of hms include metal ions metal oxides and nanoparticles nps since the toxicity of metal oxides is often attributed to the hms ions released in the system their inhibitory effects and mechanisms on anammox activity are similar zhang et al 2017 in contrast the toxic effects of nps could be further aggravated by nanoscale toxicity and released metal ions causing more complex mechanism zhang et al 2017 after entering the system the nps are first blocked by eps and then combined with the abundant proteins pn and polysaccharides ps in eps through the adsorption force generated by ligand exchange for example copper nps can bind to carboxyl hydroxyl groups in eps through surface hydroxyl groups wang et al 2016b the mutual adsorption between nps and eps leads to a more dispersed structure which facilitates further interaction of hms ions with anammox bacteria zhang et al 2021a in particular the complexes formed by the combination of nps with extracellular pn and ps are called nps eps coronas fig 3 a zhang et al 2021a it is worth noting that the nps eps corona can be toxic to microorganisms by affecting cell metabolism and biological activity kalčíková et al 2020 moreover the abundant carboxyl phenolic and hydroxyl groups in the nps eps corona expand the adsorption capacity of hms through electrostatic adsorption chen et al 2012 li and yu 2014 resulting in the formation of cross linked structures between nps metal ions and eps the cross linked structures can destroy the state of extracellular substances zhang et al 2021a and further weaken the ability of the system to resist hms shock through eps defense hms nps can directly contact the cell membrane which will destroy the integrity of the cell membrane to enter the anammox bacteria fig 3a these nps are capable of exerting toxic effects inside cells resulting in decreased microbial activity or even death furthermore the mechanism of interaction of nps with cell membranes is complex ma et al 2013 some nps such as au nps can utilize the physical adsorption ligands on the surface to exchange with lipid molecules of the cell membrane which affects the permeability and integrity of the cell membrane changes the endocytosis pathway and rate of nps wang et al 2019 or damages the cells through redox reactions fig 3a thill et al 2006 meanwhile it has been reported that the collision of cells with nps can cause physical damage to the cell membrane promote the permeability of the cell membrane thus increasing the possibility of hms entering the cell liu et al 2020a 2 3 toxicity relationship of the coexistence of multiple hms to anammox bacteria the complexity of the composition of urban sewage and industrial wastewater puts biological systems at risk of multiple hms shock compared to a single metal the interaction between different hms makes the toxicity mechanism to multiple hms shock more complicated in biological systems normally the combined inhibitory effects of multiple metals on the anammox system include synergistic antagonistic and independent effects zhang et al 2016c as a common hm in wastewater although zn ii can stimulate free radicals but also destroy intracellular dna and enzymatic activities sari et al 2020 zn ii did not show particularly strong acute toxicity in previous studies this may be because the absorption rate of zn ii by anammox bacteria is much lower than that of cu ii and cd ii li et al 2015 under zn ii shock the n2 yield of anammox bacteria significantly decreased in 6 3 h which was six times longer than that of cu ii shock li et al 2015 however in the zinc copper nickel system when the concentrations of the three hms were 0 80 0 075 and 0 04 mg l 1 the removal rate and efficiency of the reactor dropped rapidly by 47 8 and 28 3 within 30 days furthermore the phenomenon of nitrite accumulation was observed gutwinski et al 2021 which indicated the multi metal shock had more severe inhibitory effects on the anammox system than zn ii alone table 1 this is attributed to cu ii disrupting the integrity of the membrane of anammox bacteria to help zn ii and ni ii enter the interior of cells accelerating the occurrence of synergistic toxicity fig 3b hu et al 2003 zhang et al 2020 interestingly hms with similar inhibitory mechanisms tend to produce antagonistic effects due to the action of eps the sulfhydryl of pn in eps will act as active sites to bind metal ions leading to changes in the secondary structure of pn in eps and further affecting the tightness of the eps structure zhang et al 2015b under multi metal shock different types of hms will compete for the active sites to reduce the absorption and accumulation of other metals which can produce antagonistic toxicity ding et al 2015 in the lead cadmium chromium system pb ii has an order of preference for adsorption liu et al 2020b the c o and nh2 groups in leucine and the c or group in ps are preferentially occupied by pb ii which reduced the toxic effects of the other two metal ions fig 3b liu et al 2020b similarly zn ii can reduce the adsorption amount of cd ii in the anammox system and alleviate its toxicity expression chen et al 2020a in addition in the multi metal system hms can compete with nh4 for adsorption by virtue of their higher valence and smaller hydrated ion radius which may reduce the rate of nh4 absorption by microorganisms and weaken the nitrogen metabolism process li et al 2016 it is worth noting that the joint toxicity of multi metal is not a simply single manifestation of synergy or antagonism the degree of joint toxicity is determined by the shock time and hms concentration zhang et al zhang et al 2016c confirmed that the joint toxicity of cu ii and zn ii to anammox systems increased with increasing concentrations of metal ions and the joint toxicity of cu ii and zn ii showed a synergistic independent antagonistic trend for the independent stage although the statement was proposed there was still a lack of sufficient evidence to reveal the related independent mechanism in the hms coexisting system which was worth attention in future studies deciphering the mechanism of multi metal combined toxicity has obvious application significance for modern water pollution treatment in future work revealing the mechanism of multi metal action in anammox systems from the perspective of time and space will be a bright spot 3 response mechanisms of hms on anammox bacteria the different toxic effects of hms are due to the different reaction mechanisms of hms to anammox system these response mechanisms are reflected in the physiological activity of anammox bacteria and the succession of anammox bacterial community on the one hand the physiological activity of anammox bacteria depended on the interaction between hms and cells including the changes of eps in response to hms shock from the perspective of structure and components the regulation of membrane structure on hms migration and the response state of intracellular nitrogen metabolism process and material transformation based on metagenomics on the other hand the succession of anammox bacterial community under the hms shock affected the relative abundance and interspecific dominance of anammox bacteria 3 1 response mechanism of hms on eps 3 1 1 effects of hms on the eps components the components of eps are mainly protein pn polysaccharide ps and humic acid ha felz et al 2019 as the primary contact between anammox cells and the external environment eps plays a role in maintaining cell adhesion and metabolic stability under trace hms shock anammox bacteria tend to secrete more pn and ps as defense barriers and the system performance can be temporarily improved fig 4 a 2 mg l 1 cd ii could promote the secretion of tryptophan containing hydrophobic groups and pn substances containing aromatherapy groups which was conducive to the agglomeration of bacteria and stimulated the anammox process saa increased by approximately 15 xu et al 2019b however the addition of hms above the concentration threshold will lead to a decrease in the concentrations of pn and ps fig 4a the combination of excess hms and eps will gradually reduce the content of pn and ps thus affecting the reactor performance and the form of bio aggregation pn can maintain biological activity and play an important role in the electron transfer process the concentration of 5 mg l 1 cu ii could reduce the pn concentration by 76 8 and correspondingly reduce the saa by 17 zhang et al 2015a ps is one of the components that adheres between organisms and maintains the stability of eps the decrease in the content will cause the shedding of biofilms and the disintegration of granular sludge after ni ii shock the red granular sludge disintegrated into loose flocculent sludge and lost its granularity cheng et al 2021 although researchers have given less attention to the change in ha concentration we speculate that the concentration of ha increased under hms shock because it is a product of apoptosis and metabolism 3 1 2 effects of hms on the stratified structure of eps structurally eps consists of soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps from outside to inside sheng et al 2010 the stratified structure of eps maintains the stability of anammox bacteria wang et al 2020 toxic metal ions entering the system preferentially contact eps at the initial stage reducing the electrostatic repulsion between epss and the occurrence of bridging effect makes the eps structure more compact li et al 2020a the distribution of hms in eps is also positively correlated with this stratified structure the diffusion process of metal ions from s eps to b eps is accompanied by a change in the binding state mutual binding of high energy sites leads to tighter interactions between metal ions and eps fig 4b zhang et al 2015b with the progress in the combination process of hms and eps the content of pn and ps decreases resulting in the gradual loosening of the eps structure to make matters worse hms cations are more likely to enter the cell interior in this loose eps structure and then have a toxic effect on anammox bacteria which is consistent with the findings of li et al li et al 2020a 3 1 3 response of molecular structures of pn and ps to hms the structural responses of pn and ps originate from the binding of hms to their active sites leading to changes in intermolecular forces and functional groups hydrogen bonding is one of the important factors in maintaining the stability of the pn structure under the impact of low concentrations of cu ii the hydrogen bonds in eps undergo a deprotonation process which enhances the ability of eps to bind metal ions and allows cu ii to form inner sphere complexes with eps components li et al 2020a similarly disruption of structure is also reflected in protein secondary structure α helix β sheet β turn and random coil at the early stage of metal ion binding to eps the hydrophobic amino acids in eps are close to each other due to β sheet deformation thereby enhancing the hydrophobicity of cells hou et al 2015 jia et al 2017 the α helix β sheet random coil ratio indicates the tightness of the pn structure the lower the value is the looser the pn structure zhang et al 2015b the spatial structure of pn is conventionally relatively stable but the binding of metal cations to active sites on pn can cause bending of the peptide chain dudev and lim 2008 veitinger et al 2012 after binding to hms the shape of the pn molecule will change from an ordered and compact structure in the normal state to a disordered and loose structure li et al 2020a reducing the defenses of the system against hms in essence the binding process of eps and hms is accompanied by changes in functional groups fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir showed the changes between hms and the functional groups of eps the combination of hms and eps reacts directly in the fingerprint region of the spectrum ni ii and ag nps were confirmed to form ni o bonds and ag o bonds with eps wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018d the response of pn to hms is mainly reflected in the stretching vibrations of the c o bond and c n bond of amide i the deformation vibrations of c n and n h of amide ii and the stretching vibrations of the c o bond of coo related to amino acids liu et al 2020b wu et al 2019 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the negatively charged carboxyl hydroxyl and amide groups contained in ps are beneficial to the combination of metal cations mainly manifested in the stretching vibration of c o c bonds and c oh bonds and the deformation vibration of c o bonds liu et al 2020b wu et al 2019 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 ftir has demonstrated functional group changes before and after hms shock but has not been able to elucidate the dynamic process using 2d cos to analyze the functional group change reaction can further clarify the corresponding sequence of pn and ps to hms for example cu nps could induce functional groups to convert in the order of coc cu i o amide i c o zhang et al 2018f 3 2 response mechanism of hms on the membrane structure the membrane structure of anammox bacteria mainly includes anammoxosome membrane and cytoplasmic membrane which mainly play the role of region segmentation and substance exchange smeulders et al 2020 some key proteins with detoxification functions are also located on these membrane structures the anammoxosome is the main site of catabolism of anammox bacteria as the peculiar organelles of anammox bacteria anammoxosome usually occupy 50 70 of the cell volume van niftrik et al 2008 anammoxosome membrane has a dense stepped alkanes lipid membrane structure which can serve as an effective barrier against the spread of toxic substances so as to protect the anammox cells kartal et al 2011b moreover several important functional proteins exist on the anammoxosome membrane on the inner side of the anammoxosome membrane cytochrome c and heme are important carriers that regulate the electron transfer process and participate in the energy metabolism of anammox bacteria shimamura et al 2007 fe ii as the central ion of heme could improve heme activity at trace concentrations fig 4c bi et al 2014b mn ii and ni ii as essential elements of microorganisms could also promote the synthesis of heme to a certain extent fig 4c wu et al 2019 xu et al 2017 in contrast cu ii could chelate with the sulfur group of heme leading to metabolic disorder of cell proteins and enzymes ultimately leading to a decline in heme content fig 4c dupont et al 2011 based on the above results when the anammox system is affected by environmental pressure in engineering the strategy of adding trace amounts of fe ii mn ii and ni ii can be adopted to stimulate heme secretion to maintain the stability of the anammox system for bio toxic hms such as cu ii the method of complexation removal should be selected to reduce their damage to functional proteins additionally fad is also an important protein on the anammoxosome membrane and can catalyze the generation of nad and nadh production a study indicated that the redox characteristics of fad could reduce hg ii with high toxicity to hg0 with low toxicity but fad related proteins would bind to hg in this process which hindered the energy generation of fad regulated process muller et al 2001 when intracellular hms concentrations exceed physiological requirements metal efflux proteins located on the cytoplasmic membrane can remove some metal ions thus alleviating toxic effects nies 2003 van niftrik et al 2008 typical metal efflux proteins of anammox bacteria include czc protein zitb protein and atpase fig 4d the czc protein is driven by proton motive force the zitb protein is affected by concentration gradient and chemiosmotic gradient and the p type atpase utilizes the energy generated by atp hydrolysis nies 2003 these three proteins form a combinatorial network that helps microbes regulate metal concentrations in the cytoplasm and the environment nies 2003 what s more the energy released by the electron transfer chain is first converted into a transmembrane proton h step difference and then protons flow along the proton step difference which synthesize atp through the atp synthase located on anammoxosome membrane this process can balance the internal and external osmotic pressure of cells which is conducive to the discharge of hms ions and provides energy for cells to resist hms stress blencowe and morby 2003 studies have shown that atp synthase related genes were significantly upregulated under zn ii stress confirming that atp synthase could drive anammox bacteria to generate more energy to expel hms thus maintaining bacterial functions ma et al 2020 in brief the anammoxosome membrane is closely related to the electron and material transfer of anammox bacteria tan et al 2022 however the response of electron and material flow of anammox bacteria to hms stress is still unclear so the electron transfer pathway and the changes in amtb and foca responsible for nitrogen transfer under hms shock can be further analyzed in future work this can help expand our understanding of the metabolic process of anammox bacteria and more precisely regulate its metabolic process to improve the ability of anammox bacteria to resist hms shock 3 3 response mechanism of hms on key enzymes in anammoxosome the nitrogen catabolism of anammox takes place inside the anammoxosome along an electron transfer chain made up of a series of key enzymes fig 4e the electron transfer chain of anammox bacteria uses nitrite reductase nir hydrazine synthase hzs and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh as an important basis to ensure the conversion of substances tan et al 2022 meanwhile cytochrome c and heme as significant component of key enzymes play a role in electron carriers redox catalysis and other bio processes so their responses to hms cannot be ignored ferousi et al 2019 kartal and keltjens 2016 kleingardner and bren 2015 su and chen 2021 in recent years with the development of molecular biology and metagenome technology the changes in key enzymes and related functional genes of anammox bacteria under the hms shock have been successfully studied in fact some hms as important components of enzymes can promote enzyme activities and functional gene expression levels at low concentrations fig 4f for example fe ii can participate in the synthesis of heme and fe s clusters so it can promote heme c containing enzymes thereby increasing anammox activity bi et al 2014b ferousi et al 2017 zhang et al found that fe iii increased the content of heme c to approximately 120 zhang et al 2021c moreover hdh is composed of heme c network in addition metal oxides or metal nps can also improve the activity of related enzymes by affecting the properties of anammox granular sludge for instance mno2 was found that promoted the granulation of anammox sludge thus increasing the overall enzyme activity qiao et al 2012 furthermore ag nps could upregulate the functional genes nirs hzs and hdh which was due to the increased porosity of anammox granular sludge thereby increasing the diffusion rate of its substrates peng et al 2019 hms that exceed the threshold value will bind to the enzyme decrease the activity of the enzyme hu et al 2004 zhang et al 2016b and thus affect nitrogen metabolism balali mood et al 2021 as the power source of the anammox process the hdh that dehydrogenates hydrazine and generates electrons has attracted the attention of researchers a small amount of fe can promote hdh activity but an excess of 6 72 mg l 1 fe ii could lead to a decrease in hdh activity bi et al 2014b for non enzymatic active center ions 10 mg l 1 cd ii ag i and hg ii decreased the hdh content in the anammox system by 43 0 44 1 and 69 3 respectively fig 4g bi et al 2014a metals that can change their valence state have multiple inhibitory mechanisms on metabolic processes take cr as an example it could occupy the inactive site of the enzyme in anammox and form a cr vi enzyme substrate complex hindering substrate degradation and product generation fig 4g yu et al 2019 due to the presence of redox substances such as cytochrome cr vi can be reduced to cr iii in the cell this process generates reactive oxygen species ros attacking the dna of anammox cells to inhibit proteins synthesis and eventually affecting metabolic activity fig 4g yu et al 2019 researchers have observed the crystal structure of the key enzyme in anammox bacteria as well as determined the substances and electrons transport pathway in the key enzyme akram et al 2019 dietl et al 2015 however under the hms shock recent studies focused on the response degree of key enzyme activities at the macro level it is still unknown how hms bind to key active site of enzymes and how hms affect the substance and electron transport pathways in the molecular structure of key enzymes in anammox bacteria therefore in future work with the help of cutting edge technologies such as molecular biology and cryo electron microscopy the changes in active sites in the enzyme crystal structure in response to hms shock can be explored this can further broaden the understanding of the mechanism of action between hms and key enzymes at the molecular level 3 4 response regularity of hms on anammox bacterial community the response mechanism of anammox bacteria to hms toxicity is due to the inhibition of their own physiological activities which will further affect the relative abundance and competitive advantage of anammox bacteria in the community in the case of long term exposure to high concentrations of hms the decrease in the relative abundance of anammox bacteria accompanied by an increase in heterotrophic bacteria could be observed zhang et al 2018c under 20 mg l 1 cd ii shock the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia decreased from 26 21 to 8 21 but pseudomonas as heterotrophic denitrification bacteria its relative abundance increased correspondingly with the cd ii concentration zhang et al 2018b the growth of heterotrophic bacteria often depends on the release of eps and soluble microbial products smp as carbon sources wu et al 2019 since anammox bacteria dominate the anammox systems these smp usually evolved from apoptotic anammox cells both principal component analysis and redundancy analysis diagrams helped researchers explore the evolutionary trajectory of communities and the correlation between functional species and hms overall high concentration of hms will reduce the competitive advantage of anammox bacteria in the anammox system while enhance the competitiveness of heterotrophic bacteria this view is supported by various studies wu et al 2019 xu et al 2019b zhang et al 2018c moreover different genera of anammox bacteria also showed different tolerance to hms for example under the exposure of different forms of zn ion oxide nps candidatus brocadia usually showed stronger resistance than candidatus kuenenia and became the dominant genera in the anammox system zhang et al 2018a but cd ii shock showed the opposite result zhang et al 2018b this provides a new perspective for the domestication of hms resistant anammox systems targeted experiments can be designed to screen and purify the dominant anammox genera under different hms shock and these anammox genera will be potential bio augmentation means for practical engineering 4 future challenges and prospects although researchers have conducted a lot of studies on the toxicity mechanism of anammox under hms shock nevertheless under hms shock the succession mechanism of anammox bacterial community and changes in the distribution of material and energy flow are still worthy of further study besides the recovery and augmentation strategy under hms shock are also insufficient this section looks into the future prospects of hms inhibition on anammox and put forwards the feasible methods to alleviate hms inhibition on anammox system 4 1 in depth elaboration of inhibitory response microbial community analysis and regulation the diversity and gene expression of the anammox bacterial community under hms shock are mostly used to explain the changes in microbial activity however the transformation pathways of hms and the interactions between microbial community remain unclear subsequently combining fluorescent labeling omics and high throughput technology to construct a community level metabolic pathway the complex variations in microbial communities under hms shock could be revealed furthermore dna based stable isotope detection can link microbial functions to there identities which breaks down barriers between the community level and individual bacteria uhlík et al 2009 youngblut et al 2018 zhang et al 2022b this helps to reveal the potential relationship among the microbial community under hms inhibition and degradation by districting inter taxon and environment taxon correlations or conducting significant correlation analysis between key taxa and environmental factors the recovery methods of microbial communities under hms shock may be inferred xiao et al 2021 however these inferences are limited not only by a single model algorithm but also by the monitoring and processing of large amounts of biological information the dynamic equilibrium of the anammox bacterial community depends on the cross feedings between autotrophic bacteria and heterozygous bacteria feng et al 2019 the assimilation of soluble microbial products smp can be further considered as an indicator of the variations among microbial communities under hms shock xiao et al 2022 meanwhile quorum sensing qs mediated by n acyl homoserine lactones ahls plays a crucial role in microbial processes guo et al 2021 liu et al 2022b for example ahls produced by gram negative bacteria could regulate eps production nitrogen removal and microbial community stabilization in biological nitrogen removal bnr systems gao et al 2019 tan et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 based on these both endogenous and exogenous ahl mediated qs have been proved to relieve the inhibition pressure of hms on bnr systems and adjusted the recovery of various nitrogen conversion processes nitrification denitrification and ammoxidation etc gao et al 2022b gao et al 2022c however current studies were limited to the qs response of anammox based systems under hms shock liu et al 2022b so in depth researches on the relationship between the spatial variation of bacteria and ahls content and further strengthening anammox systems under hms shock by regulating qs system are of great significance for biological nitrogen removal technology at present due to the development of machine learning technology artificial intelligence systems are employed to monitor the intermediate metabolism process of the anammox community from the perspective of time and space concomitantly the spatial distribution of the anammox community could be further analyzed by microbial geography chen et al 2022 by changing the contents of metabolic intermediates and signal molecules in the environment the relative abundance and spatial distribution of microbial communities can be intelligently regulated which is helpful for advancing anammox processes on a larger scale 4 2 further clarification of the mechanism the transfer of matter energy and electrons the substance transport of anammox bacteria includes carbon and nitrogen transport in which carbon transport occurs in the outer periplasm while nitrogen transport occurs in the anammoxosome tan et al 2022 in fact there is an inseparable relationship between nitrogen and carbon transport in anammox bacteria and the nitrogen conversion process is an important for energy source in the carbon sequestration process of anammox bacteria for example the reducing power nadh required for co2 or carbonate assimilation of anammox bacteria comes from hydrazine dehydrogenation the energy required for atp synthesis comes from no2 oxidation and the energy released from no2 oxidation to no3 fixes co2 strous et al 2006 therefore once hms affect nitrogen transport the distribution of electrons and energy will be disrupted thus affecting carbon source metabolism in future work by means of metagenomics and other biomolecular techniques we can understand how hms affect nitrogen transport thereby placing an energy shortage pressure on carbon transport at greater depths however relevant research on the interaction mechanism between nitrogen and carbon transport in response to hms shock is still lacking in detail the essence of carbon transport is that anammox bacteria fix co2 or carbonate through the acetyl coa pathway and then enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca cycle to synthesize cytoplasmic cellular material liu et al 2022a this process involved a series of biochemical reactions related to bioenergy biosynthesis and maintenance of redox balance under the hms shock any one of the links may be affected and affect the subsequent metabolic process hence further study can focus on the response of the acetyl coa pathway and tca cycle by identifying the functional proteins in metabolic pathways fig 5 for nitrogen transport nh4 and no2 as important growth substrates of anammox bacteria will enter anammoxosome through amtb and foca nitrogen transporters strous et al 2006 respectively the binding process of hms to proteins will seriously affect the protein activity amtb and foca as the starting link of nitrogen flow and distribution processes deserve further investigation in the binding characteristics and binding sites hms which may be valuable for hms to inhibit the nitrogen removal performance of anammox from the perspective of material flow after transport nh4 and no2 can enter the cell and be reduced to n2 by key enzymes such as nar nir hzs and hdh wang et al 2016a until now the effects of different hms on the activities of these key enzymes have been studied extensively but there is still a research gap in the sequence about the influence of certain hms on key enzymes of anammox bacteria fig 5 if this could be revealed targeted measures can be taken to stimulate the activity of corresponding enzymes such as adding central ions of key enzyme activity and redox mediators which can help ensure the stability of the electron transfer chain and thus maintain the stability of the nitrogen removal process nitrous oxide n2o as a greenhouse gas has attracted increasing attention in biological water treatment anammox bacteria have not been shown to be able to produce n2o but n2o production is detected in anammox systems and coupled processes such as partial nitrification anammox systems pn a and partial denitrification anammox systems fig 5 take pn a system as an example nh4 could be converted to nh2oh by the catalysis of ammonia monooxygenase amo however under the condition of incomplete oxidation nh2oh would be converted to n2o therefore the oxidation process of reducing hms such as fe ii and cr iii consumes dissolved oxygen may lead the incomplete oxidation of nh2oh to the form n2o in addition due to the existence of apoptotic cells and microbial metabolites some heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria were enriched in the anammox community the incomplete denitrification process will also lead to the production of n2o in the denitrification process no could produce n2o under the catalysis of no reductase and n2o could produce n2 under the catalysis of n2o reductase nevertheless different enzymes might have different corresponding and sensitivity degrees under hms shock which could result in the different inhibitory effects once n2o reductase is more sensitive to some hms than no reductase it could cause the accumulation of n2o hence it is an important task to control low n2o emissions under hms and other pollutant shocks more recently the role of biochar in reducing n2o emissions in soil by enriching bacteria encoding the nos gene has been demonstrated gao et al 2022a therefore the strategy of adding biochar or n2o reducing microorganisms to the biological system may be adapted to reduce the excessive emission of n2o under the hms shock in anammox based bio process in addition the coupled process based on anammox involves the cooperation of multiple functional bacteria to complete the nitrogen removal process the toxic effects and response mechanisms of these bacteria under hms shock are different for example in the presence of cr vi the denitrification process would be subject to electronic competition from cr vi reduction jin et al 2017 and this response mechanism did not exist in the autotrophic anammox process this will affect the distribution of substance and energy in the system in practical engineering anammox and denitrifying bacteria are often coupled and symbiosis the synergistic effects of hms on the two types of bacteria in the coupled system might be different from that of the individual effect therefore the inhibition mechanism of hms on key nitrogen removal bacteria in the coupled system can be further studied in the future 4 3 efficient recovery strategies bio accelerators the inhibitory effect of hms on the anammox process promotes the exploration of efficient recovery strategies at present many researches have focused on biological promotion based on the addition of exogenous accelerators fig 6 the ionic state of hms has been shown to be the predominant toxic form as a conventional solution organic ligands have been used to chelate metal ions to protect cells it has been reported that ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta could relieve the inhibitory effects of cu and ni zhang et al 2016b however as an exogenous substance the metal concentration in the anammox system after washing with edta has decreased but it cannot be ignored that the cells will have metabolic disorders and decreased key enzyme activities li et al 2020b this requires researchers to further elucidate their role in cellular metabolism meanwhile aiming at these effective exogenous substances it is of engineering significance to focus on the appropriate substances e g signal molecules betaine and calcium ions to adjust the system balance and restore the nitrogen removal effect after chelation in contrast those chelators secreted by microorganisms e g cysteine etc have better biological adaptation as an important means of biological resistance to metal invasion the sulfhydryl group on cysteine captures free metals in cells thus preventing metal ions from inhibiting key enzyme activities the expression level of cysq kustc0852 a functional gene encoding cysteine biosynthesis has been detected to be upregulated in anammox bacteria with zn ii resistance ma et al 2020 hence tracer techniques such as isotope labeling can be employed to further reveal its detoxification site and determine whether exogenous administration can enter the cell to produce chelation in addition as common intermediate products in the anammox process nh2oh n2h4 and their related compounds nh2oh hcl and n2h4 h2so4 are all effective substances to relieve the inhibition on anammox zhang et al 2022c as a strong reducing substance nh2oh can reduce cr vi to cr iii outside the cell and decrease the intracellular cr vi concentration feng et al 2021 therefore for hms whose toxicity is affected by valence such as cr and hg nh2oh and n2h4 compounds can be selected as reducing agents to change the metal valence in the system however high concentrations of nh2oh can cause cytotoxicity so it is necessary to determine the concentration threshold for system recovery similarly the special structure of anammoxosome enables anammox bacteria to resist the toxicity of n2h4 at low concentrations more importantly the electrons generated by the oxidation of additional n2h4 by hdh will become an additional driving force under hms shock supplement the consumption of anammox bacteria anabolism and reduce the production of nitrate yao et al 2013 nh2oh and n2h4 have been shown to enhance the anammox process and inhibit nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob however their metabolic pathways and potential toxicity need to be further revealed to provide a basis for practical applications based on further studies on electron transfer blocking under hms shock the inhibition sites of hms on the electron transport chain can be better revealed which is helpful for the targeted dosing of electron transfer accelerators the current recovery strategies are relatively single and an efficient strategy needs to comprehensively consider multiple perspectives such as microbial growth electron transfer metal capture metal toxicity reduction and community balance 4 4 advanced system defense biological augmentation in the process of wastewater treatment long term hms shock has an impact on the performance of the system and it is also a process of directional domestication of anammox bacteria at present anammox bacteria have been found to have biological resistance to various hms such as zn ii and hg ii chen et al 2020b ma et al 2020 the addition of these native or exogenous bacteria is aimed at increasing the tolerance of the microbial community to hms and maintaining nitrogen removal activity in metal containing wastewater fig 7 a for the augmentation and domestication of native bacteria using hms wastewater the community diversity can be basically maintained or reduced controlling metal concentrations and acclimation conditions nutrients temperature ph etc will favor the growth of resistant flora ma et al 2022b for the augmentation of exogenous bacteria the primary problem is the screening purification and enrichment of resistant bacteria molecular means such as dna cloning are used to shorten the generation time of anammox bacteria and obtain the target bacteria quickly however the introduced bacteria are likely to compete with the original bacteria for nutrients and space which brings many uncertainties to biological augmentation zhao et al 2016 learning from the successful augmentation experience exogenous flora can be used to change the original microbial structure induce the formation of dominant bacteria and finally complete the augmentation of system resistance in recent years the development of fluorescent labeling technology has enabled fluorescent detection to visualize the characteristics and activities of bacterial cells which can ensure the acquisition of biological information during the augmentation process schneider and hackenberger 2017 the development of synthetic biology enables directionally editing the gene sequences of related microorganisms as needed to construct novel functional bacteria that meet expectations anammox bacteria have native metal resistance genes metal transport genes and hms reduction genes xu et al 2022 therefore these genes could be edited in anammox bacteria to strengthen their expression further enhancing the metal resistance hms efflux and reduction ability of anammox bacteria fig 7a metagenomic analysis of the currently known metal resistant bacteria interception of resistance gene fragments and transplantation into anammox cells may be realized in the future although there are no mature pure anammox bacteria at present an abundance of anammox bacteria of 97 99 5 can be obtained through reactor culture and percoll density gradient centrifugation jetten et al 2005 liu et al 2008 van der star et al 2008 zhang et al 2016a breakthroughs in separation and purification technology provide the basis for research on genetic engineering the maintenance of the original biological activity of the organism and the re expression of the resistance gene transcript during the gene editing process will be the focus of researchers in the future in addition anammox bacteria as chemoautotrophs are more susceptible to external factors but the application of new carrier technology can protect functional bacteria from the intrusion of toxic substances fig 7b the high porosity of sludge biochar not only helps to improve the adsorption of hms at active sites but also the porous structure provides attachment space for microorganisms and delays the impact of metal ions lü et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 the strengthening mechanism needs to be further investigated such as the potential of surface redox active functional groups quinone group and phenolic hydroxyl group etc to effectively regulate electron transfer in the nitrogen cycle extracellular electron transfer makes sludge biochar a potential new electron acceptor for nh4 oxidation shaw et al 2020 and this electron shuttle process may enable anammox reaction to complete from other pathways under hms inhibition in addition as an emerging interdisciplinary technology 3d bio printing technology subverts the traditional form of microbial load carrier surfaces in traditional biofilm systems and coats microorganisms with bio friendly gels to delay or reduce the contact between hms and anammox bacteria fig 7c how to complete the printing process of the anammox bacterial community in an anaerobic environment and maintain its activity is the primary problem to be solved the species and relative abundance of microbial communities in the community were purposefully designed and metal metabolizing bacteria were added to enhance community function while ensuring nitrogen removal efficiency moreover the three dimensional space advantage of 3d printed bodies enables researchers to configure appropriate spatial structures to increase the specific surface area of the material optimize steric hindrance to improve electron mass transfer efficiency and further improve nitrogen removal efficiency 5 conclusions the response mechanism and regulation strategy of anammox system to hms are important for the development of bnr process a large number of studies have focused on the short term and long term effects of typical hms on the performance of anammox systems on this basis we established a new toxicity evaluation method that is more suitable for engineering by combining acute toxicity of hms system recovery time and biological adaptability the inhibitory effects of hms nps and multi metal coexistence on anammox bacteria were also compared with single hms ions in particular the response mechanism of anammox system to hms was analyzed at the cellular structure level including the dynamic changes of the content and structure of pn and ps in eps the regulation of hms by proteins on anammoxosome and the effects of hms on intracellular nitrogen metabolism process meanwhile several research gaps on response mechanism under hms shock are also proposed containing in depth succession of anammox community and the distributive regulation of carbon and nitrogen flow under hms shock recently the acquisition and processing of microbial information have attracted the attention of researchers so the analysis and fitting based on machine learning will become a breakthrough in future research moreover the recovery and augmentation of the anammox system still need to be further improved to adapt to complex engineering environment bio accelerators and bio augmentation have great potential to alleviate hms inhibition from the perspective of exogenous addition and microbiota fortification new materials and biological technologies such as 3d bio printing gene editing and protein sequence design are showing their unique advantages declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

14748,anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox as a low carbon and energy saving technology has shown unique advantages in the treatment of high ammonia wastewater however wastewater usually contains complex heavy metals hms which pose a potential risk to the stable operation of the anammox system this review systematically re evaluates the hms toxicity level from the inhibition effects and the inhibition recovery process which can provide a new reference for engineering from the perspective of anammox cell structure extracellular anammoxosome membrane anammoxosome the mechanism of hms effects on cellular substances and metabolism is expounded furthermore the challenges and research gaps for hms inhibition in anammox research are also discussed the clarification of material flow energy flow and community succession under hms shock will help further reveal the inhibition mechanism the development of new recovery strategies such as bio accelerators and bio augmentation is conductive to breaking through the engineered limitations of hms on anammox this review provides a new perspective on the recognition of toxicity and mechanism of hms in the anammox process as well as

data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen as an important element in the composition of animals and plants is widely present in the environment soler jofra et al 2021 however the excess nitrogen produced by human production and life activities enters the water body which can easily cause eutrophication and destroy the ecological environment balance of the water body canfield et al 2010 as the current mainstream trend the biological nitrogen removal bnr process is widely used in wastewater treatment hu et al 2018 lin et al 2020 liu et al 2021 the diversity of nitrogen cycling pathways in nature makes bnr pathways complex fig 1 anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process uses nh4 as an electron donor and no2 as an electron acceptor to produce n2 which breaks the limitation of traditional nitrification and denitrification relying on lengthy reaction paths and greatly improves the nitrogen removal rate kartal et al 2011a as an autotrophic microorganism anammox bacteria can complete efficient nitrogen removal without organic carbon source and oxygen supply which makes the anammox process show great advantages and development potential in the concept of carbon neutrality qian et al 2022 xue et al 2021 however the slow proliferation rate and weak environmental adaptability of the anammox bacteria often face great challenges in actual wastewater treatment guo et al 2020 li et al 2018 heavy metals hms as the common water pollutants are widely distributed in various ammonia rich nitrogen wastewater such as aquaculture wastewater and landfill leachate wang et al 2022 zhao et al 2014 anammox bacteria will be exposed to hms for a long time during the treatment of ammonia rich wastewater which will affect its nitrogen removal efficiency with the popularization of anammox technology in mainstream wastewater treatment in recent years environmental emergency events also bring short term hms exposure risk to municipal wastewater treatment di cesare et al 2016 at present several reviews have summarized the reactor performance as a basic indicator to reflect the toxicity of hms for example wang et al focused on the short term and long term effects of hms on the anammox process wang et al 2021 and zhang et al further classified the hms toxicity level according to the semi inhibitory concentration ic50 on the anammox system zhang et al 2022a it is generally recognized that the ic50 is more suitable to evaluate the short term effects of hms on anammox however the sudden fluctuation of water quality in engineering requires the anammox systems to address hms shock and recovery processes so a novel toxicity evaluation method should be proposed to adapt to engineering practice moreover the different toxicity levels of hms are due to the response mechanism of the anammox system under hms shock previous reviews focused on the migration and binding process of hms on anammox cell surface changes in the structure and composition of eps and variations of intracellular enzyme activity in nitrogen metabolism madeira and de araujo 2021 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022b which can be attributed to the partial summary of cellular structural responses however as the most important cellular structure the anammoxosome is responsible for the metabolic function of anammox bacteria damste et al 2002 of which the response mechanism has not been systematically reviewed meanwhile studies on the response of anammoxosome related proteins and genes to hms are fragmented and lack scientific summary and analysis therefore according to the migration path of hms in anammox bacteria it is necessary to complete the response mechanism of hms at the cellular structure level of anammox bacteria with anammoxosome as the core which will broaden the response mechanism of anammox bacteria to hms shock to alleviate the inhibition of hms on anammox bacteria several strategies focused on wastewater pretreatment e g sorption and addition of exogenous chemical reagents e g feso4 and edta zhang et al 2022a 2016b which aim to reduce hms concentration in the system and relieve microbial stress however these strategies focused on changing the external adverse environment rather than directly restoring the microbial activity according to the potential response mechanism it would also be effective to regulate microbial activity in terms of microbial growth community balance and electron transport which requires more in depth analyses in addition to using these chemical reagents to increase microbial activity the resistance of anammox bacteria to hms shock is expected to be enhanced by emerging biological technologies this could be achieved through genetic engineering to hms resistant bacterial communities and 3d bio printing to optimize the spatial distribution of systematic communities ma et al 2022a yang et al 2021 although these potential applications have not been well associated with anammox systems this review systematically proposes these promising solutions which will be of great significance for engineering applications this review aims to summarize the inhibitory effects of hms shock on the anammox system from multiple perspectives including 1 generalizing the effects of hms on the anammox system according to different inhibition times types and forms and further re evaluating the toxicity level of hms 2 expanding the spatial response mechanism of hms shock on the anammox system at the cellular structure level and 3 proposing the direction of in depth research on the inhibition mechanism the recovery strategy of bio accelerators and bio augmentation 2 toxic influences of hms on anammox system the damage of hms to microorganisms is recognized but under the different types and forms of hms shock the degree of inhibition on anammox bacteria is different this section will review the inhibitory effects of hms on anammox systems and evaluate their toxicity levels by category summarize and analyze the difference in inhibitory effects of the same metal from the substance form of hms in addition relevant research priorities for multi metal inhibition are highlighted 2 1 toxicity of typical hms to anammox systems trace hms can promote the activity of microorganisms but as concentrations increase hms can enter cells through specific transport pathways interact with intracellular enzymes rna or dna destroy the integrity of the membrane structure and thus affect cell metabolism or cause cell death stohs and bagchi 1995 current researches on the hms toxicity to anammox systems are mainly divided into short term inhibition and long term inhibition short term inhibition focuses on evaluating the acute toxicity of hms ions while long term inhibition concerns the adaptability and recovery of microorganisms to the hms environment recent studies on the inhibition of the anammox process by hms are summarized in table 1 and table 2 for short term effects the changes in the anammox activity of microorganisms under low and high concentrations of hms were different cr vi at 2 mg l 1 and cd ii at 1 mg l 1 could increase the specific anammox activity saa by 8 9 and 17 4 respectively xu et al 2019b yu et al 2019 generally low concentration of hms could stimulate the physiological activity of anammox bacteria such as cu zn and ni table 1 on the one hand microorganisms can use hms to synthesize enzymes li et al 2015 required for physiological activities on the other hand anammox bacteria enhance their protective ability by increasing their own activities and secreting more extracellular polymeric substances eps under stress jiang et al 2018 high concentrations of hms often showed the acute toxicity on the anammox system for example when the cu ii concentration exceeded 20 mg l 1 the anammox activity was almost completely lost within 4 h xu et al 2019b cu ii can combine with thiolates to attack the iron sulfur center after entering cells thereby severely inhibiting electron transfer and the metabolic system dupont et al 2011 additionally cu ii can displace essential metals and active centers of enzymes cofactors or other biomolecular species resulting in enzyme inactivation and cytoplasmic membrane disruption eventually deteriorating the anammox system sani et al 2001 the long term effects of hms on anammox systems are often more than 20 days as shown in table 2 hms gradually showed obvious inhibition under long term exposure nevertheless due to the different magnitudes of hms toxicity some systems showed signs of recovery after adaptation reducing the competitive advantage of bacterial flora inhibiting the metal transport system and retaining hms by biofilms are the three reasons that lead to persistent hms toxicity in the anammox system for instance as the typical genus of anammox bacteria the dominance of candidatus kuenenia was weakened by 10 mg l 1 ni ii and its relative abundance decreased from 36 23 to 28 46 severely affecting the nitrogen removal rate wu et al 2019 the cusa resistance gene was responsible for pumping cu ii from the intracellular to the extracellular space of anammox bacteria under cu ii shock the expression of cusa was reduced leading to an increase in intracellular cu ii concentration thus showing an inhibitory effect on the anammox system for approximately 50 days yang et al 2013 in addition the hms adsorbed by the biofilm could still release ions to the environment which would persistently inhibit the activity of microorganisms zhang et al 2018b within a certain concentration range of hms microorganisms could improve their own adaptive capacity and the system activity also recovered however due to the irreversible damage of hms the effect of recovery is often different to achieve pre shock level zhang indicated that 2 mg l 1 cr vi caused the nitrogen removal rate nrr to plummet to 69 of the initial value but the nrr could only recover to 90 of the initial level after 10 days adaptation zhang et al 2021b anammox bacteria producing resistance genes can synthesize proteins related to detoxification under hms shock under the stress of some metals the expression of functional genes responsible for the migration and transformation of substances increases which not only converts the original highly toxic substances into low toxic forms but also discharges excess intracellular metal ions chen et al 2020b xu et al 2019a zhang et al 2018e this self regulating process of detoxification helps the anammox system regain its biological activity ic50 as an important indicator for the toxicity of hms is often used to evaluate the inhibition concentration of hms val del río et al 2017 zhang et al 2022a however the recovery time and biological adaptability of anammox system after hms inhibition are important aspects and some hms usually exist in the form of precipitation in the anammox system so its actual toxicity may differ from the results of ic50 in the anammox system inspired by these facts further consideration is needed in long term operation engineering this review proposed a combination of toxicity level recovery time and biological adaptation as well as considered the actual form of hms so as to provide another perspective for rational evaluation of the toxicity of hms on anammox process this method of re evaluating hms toxicity is also especially significant for practical applications fig 2 according to this toxicity evaluation method severely toxic metals include cd cu zn and cr vi these metals can usually generate free radicals directly or through valence transitions to attack proteins and dna in cells to prevent electron transfer making it difficult for anammox bacteria to develop resistance to these hms for these inhibitory mechanisms saa was inhibited by 50 at about only 10 mg l 1 hms and required more than 30 days for self recovery approximately moderately toxic metals include mn fe ni and ag compared with the highly toxic metals they were less inhibitory to anammox and could recover by themselves in about 15 days anammox bacteria had certain adaptability to moderately toxic metals and the relative abundance decreased by less than 50 after hms shock table 2 notably diverse autotrophic modes of anammox bacteria were revealed jetten et al 2009 microorganisms could utilize mn ii and fe iii as potential electron acceptors in the anammox process after long term acclimation strous et al 2006 zhu et al 2021 slightly toxic metals include pb and hg this is contrary to the theory that pb and hg have severe toxicity to microorganisms wu and wang 2011 yuan et al 2015 affected by the alkalinity of bicarbonate during the cultivation of anammox bacteria pb often existed in the form of precipitation in the system gutwiński et al 2020 it was demonstrated that 40 mg l 1 pb ii was exposed to the anammox system but the liquid ion concentration was only 2 3 mg l 1 which limited the toxic effect of pb in the anammox system yu et al 2016 similarly hg could not only combine with nh4 to form a stable complex hg nh3 2 2 chen et al 2020a but also be converted into low toxic hg0 by specific protein chen et al 2020b moreover anammox bacteria had strong adaptability to hg ii although 20 mg l 1 hg ii reduced nrr by 29 the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia decreased only from 14 2 to 13 9 table 2 without causing significant anammox bacterial death chen et al 2020b therefore pb and hg did not perform well in inhibiting anammox process 2 2 toxicity performance of different hms forms on anammox bacteria common forms of hms include metal ions metal oxides and nanoparticles nps since the toxicity of metal oxides is often attributed to the hms ions released in the system their inhibitory effects and mechanisms on anammox activity are similar zhang et al 2017 in contrast the toxic effects of nps could be further aggravated by nanoscale toxicity and released metal ions causing more complex mechanism zhang et al 2017 after entering the system the nps are first blocked by eps and then combined with the abundant proteins pn and polysaccharides ps in eps through the adsorption force generated by ligand exchange for example copper nps can bind to carboxyl hydroxyl groups in eps through surface hydroxyl groups wang et al 2016b the mutual adsorption between nps and eps leads to a more dispersed structure which facilitates further interaction of hms ions with anammox bacteria zhang et al 2021a in particular the complexes formed by the combination of nps with extracellular pn and ps are called nps eps coronas fig 3 a zhang et al 2021a it is worth noting that the nps eps corona can be toxic to microorganisms by affecting cell metabolism and biological activity kalčíková et al 2020 moreover the abundant carboxyl phenolic and hydroxyl groups in the nps eps corona expand the adsorption capacity of hms through electrostatic adsorption chen et al 2012 li and yu 2014 resulting in the formation of cross linked structures between nps metal ions and eps the cross linked structures can destroy the state of extracellular substances zhang et al 2021a and further weaken the ability of the system to resist hms shock through eps defense hms nps can directly contact the cell membrane which will destroy the integrity of the cell membrane to enter the anammox bacteria fig 3a these nps are capable of exerting toxic effects inside cells resulting in decreased microbial activity or even death furthermore the mechanism of interaction of nps with cell membranes is complex ma et al 2013 some nps such as au nps can utilize the physical adsorption ligands on the surface to exchange with lipid molecules of the cell membrane which affects the permeability and integrity of the cell membrane changes the endocytosis pathway and rate of nps wang et al 2019 or damages the cells through redox reactions fig 3a thill et al 2006 meanwhile it has been reported that the collision of cells with nps can cause physical damage to the cell membrane promote the permeability of the cell membrane thus increasing the possibility of hms entering the cell liu et al 2020a 2 3 toxicity relationship of the coexistence of multiple hms to anammox bacteria the complexity of the composition of urban sewage and industrial wastewater puts biological systems at risk of multiple hms shock compared to a single metal the interaction between different hms makes the toxicity mechanism to multiple hms shock more complicated in biological systems normally the combined inhibitory effects of multiple metals on the anammox system include synergistic antagonistic and independent effects zhang et al 2016c as a common hm in wastewater although zn ii can stimulate free radicals but also destroy intracellular dna and enzymatic activities sari et al 2020 zn ii did not show particularly strong acute toxicity in previous studies this may be because the absorption rate of zn ii by anammox bacteria is much lower than that of cu ii and cd ii li et al 2015 under zn ii shock the n2 yield of anammox bacteria significantly decreased in 6 3 h which was six times longer than that of cu ii shock li et al 2015 however in the zinc copper nickel system when the concentrations of the three hms were 0 80 0 075 and 0 04 mg l 1 the removal rate and efficiency of the reactor dropped rapidly by 47 8 and 28 3 within 30 days furthermore the phenomenon of nitrite accumulation was observed gutwinski et al 2021 which indicated the multi metal shock had more severe inhibitory effects on the anammox system than zn ii alone table 1 this is attributed to cu ii disrupting the integrity of the membrane of anammox bacteria to help zn ii and ni ii enter the interior of cells accelerating the occurrence of synergistic toxicity fig 3b hu et al 2003 zhang et al 2020 interestingly hms with similar inhibitory mechanisms tend to produce antagonistic effects due to the action of eps the sulfhydryl of pn in eps will act as active sites to bind metal ions leading to changes in the secondary structure of pn in eps and further affecting the tightness of the eps structure zhang et al 2015b under multi metal shock different types of hms will compete for the active sites to reduce the absorption and accumulation of other metals which can produce antagonistic toxicity ding et al 2015 in the lead cadmium chromium system pb ii has an order of preference for adsorption liu et al 2020b the c o and nh2 groups in leucine and the c or group in ps are preferentially occupied by pb ii which reduced the toxic effects of the other two metal ions fig 3b liu et al 2020b similarly zn ii can reduce the adsorption amount of cd ii in the anammox system and alleviate its toxicity expression chen et al 2020a in addition in the multi metal system hms can compete with nh4 for adsorption by virtue of their higher valence and smaller hydrated ion radius which may reduce the rate of nh4 absorption by microorganisms and weaken the nitrogen metabolism process li et al 2016 it is worth noting that the joint toxicity of multi metal is not a simply single manifestation of synergy or antagonism the degree of joint toxicity is determined by the shock time and hms concentration zhang et al zhang et al 2016c confirmed that the joint toxicity of cu ii and zn ii to anammox systems increased with increasing concentrations of metal ions and the joint toxicity of cu ii and zn ii showed a synergistic independent antagonistic trend for the independent stage although the statement was proposed there was still a lack of sufficient evidence to reveal the related independent mechanism in the hms coexisting system which was worth attention in future studies deciphering the mechanism of multi metal combined toxicity has obvious application significance for modern water pollution treatment in future work revealing the mechanism of multi metal action in anammox systems from the perspective of time and space will be a bright spot 3 response mechanisms of hms on anammox bacteria the different toxic effects of hms are due to the different reaction mechanisms of hms to anammox system these response mechanisms are reflected in the physiological activity of anammox bacteria and the succession of anammox bacterial community on the one hand the physiological activity of anammox bacteria depended on the interaction between hms and cells including the changes of eps in response to hms shock from the perspective of structure and components the regulation of membrane structure on hms migration and the response state of intracellular nitrogen metabolism process and material transformation based on metagenomics on the other hand the succession of anammox bacterial community under the hms shock affected the relative abundance and interspecific dominance of anammox bacteria 3 1 response mechanism of hms on eps 3 1 1 effects of hms on the eps components the components of eps are mainly protein pn polysaccharide ps and humic acid ha felz et al 2019 as the primary contact between anammox cells and the external environment eps plays a role in maintaining cell adhesion and metabolic stability under trace hms shock anammox bacteria tend to secrete more pn and ps as defense barriers and the system performance can be temporarily improved fig 4 a 2 mg l 1 cd ii could promote the secretion of tryptophan containing hydrophobic groups and pn substances containing aromatherapy groups which was conducive to the agglomeration of bacteria and stimulated the anammox process saa increased by approximately 15 xu et al 2019b however the addition of hms above the concentration threshold will lead to a decrease in the concentrations of pn and ps fig 4a the combination of excess hms and eps will gradually reduce the content of pn and ps thus affecting the reactor performance and the form of bio aggregation pn can maintain biological activity and play an important role in the electron transfer process the concentration of 5 mg l 1 cu ii could reduce the pn concentration by 76 8 and correspondingly reduce the saa by 17 zhang et al 2015a ps is one of the components that adheres between organisms and maintains the stability of eps the decrease in the content will cause the shedding of biofilms and the disintegration of granular sludge after ni ii shock the red granular sludge disintegrated into loose flocculent sludge and lost its granularity cheng et al 2021 although researchers have given less attention to the change in ha concentration we speculate that the concentration of ha increased under hms shock because it is a product of apoptosis and metabolism 3 1 2 effects of hms on the stratified structure of eps structurally eps consists of soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps from outside to inside sheng et al 2010 the stratified structure of eps maintains the stability of anammox bacteria wang et al 2020 toxic metal ions entering the system preferentially contact eps at the initial stage reducing the electrostatic repulsion between epss and the occurrence of bridging effect makes the eps structure more compact li et al 2020a the distribution of hms in eps is also positively correlated with this stratified structure the diffusion process of metal ions from s eps to b eps is accompanied by a change in the binding state mutual binding of high energy sites leads to tighter interactions between metal ions and eps fig 4b zhang et al 2015b with the progress in the combination process of hms and eps the content of pn and ps decreases resulting in the gradual loosening of the eps structure to make matters worse hms cations are more likely to enter the cell interior in this loose eps structure and then have a toxic effect on anammox bacteria which is consistent with the findings of li et al li et al 2020a 3 1 3 response of molecular structures of pn and ps to hms the structural responses of pn and ps originate from the binding of hms to their active sites leading to changes in intermolecular forces and functional groups hydrogen bonding is one of the important factors in maintaining the stability of the pn structure under the impact of low concentrations of cu ii the hydrogen bonds in eps undergo a deprotonation process which enhances the ability of eps to bind metal ions and allows cu ii to form inner sphere complexes with eps components li et al 2020a similarly disruption of structure is also reflected in protein secondary structure α helix β sheet β turn and random coil at the early stage of metal ion binding to eps the hydrophobic amino acids in eps are close to each other due to β sheet deformation thereby enhancing the hydrophobicity of cells hou et al 2015 jia et al 2017 the α helix β sheet random coil ratio indicates the tightness of the pn structure the lower the value is the looser the pn structure zhang et al 2015b the spatial structure of pn is conventionally relatively stable but the binding of metal cations to active sites on pn can cause bending of the peptide chain dudev and lim 2008 veitinger et al 2012 after binding to hms the shape of the pn molecule will change from an ordered and compact structure in the normal state to a disordered and loose structure li et al 2020a reducing the defenses of the system against hms in essence the binding process of eps and hms is accompanied by changes in functional groups fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir showed the changes between hms and the functional groups of eps the combination of hms and eps reacts directly in the fingerprint region of the spectrum ni ii and ag nps were confirmed to form ni o bonds and ag o bonds with eps wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018d the response of pn to hms is mainly reflected in the stretching vibrations of the c o bond and c n bond of amide i the deformation vibrations of c n and n h of amide ii and the stretching vibrations of the c o bond of coo related to amino acids liu et al 2020b wu et al 2019 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the negatively charged carboxyl hydroxyl and amide groups contained in ps are beneficial to the combination of metal cations mainly manifested in the stretching vibration of c o c bonds and c oh bonds and the deformation vibration of c o bonds liu et al 2020b wu et al 2019 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 ftir has demonstrated functional group changes before and after hms shock but has not been able to elucidate the dynamic process using 2d cos to analyze the functional group change reaction can further clarify the corresponding sequence of pn and ps to hms for example cu nps could induce functional groups to convert in the order of coc cu i o amide i c o zhang et al 2018f 3 2 response mechanism of hms on the membrane structure the membrane structure of anammox bacteria mainly includes anammoxosome membrane and cytoplasmic membrane which mainly play the role of region segmentation and substance exchange smeulders et al 2020 some key proteins with detoxification functions are also located on these membrane structures the anammoxosome is the main site of catabolism of anammox bacteria as the peculiar organelles of anammox bacteria anammoxosome usually occupy 50 70 of the cell volume van niftrik et al 2008 anammoxosome membrane has a dense stepped alkanes lipid membrane structure which can serve as an effective barrier against the spread of toxic substances so as to protect the anammox cells kartal et al 2011b moreover several important functional proteins exist on the anammoxosome membrane on the inner side of the anammoxosome membrane cytochrome c and heme are important carriers that regulate the electron transfer process and participate in the energy metabolism of anammox bacteria shimamura et al 2007 fe ii as the central ion of heme could improve heme activity at trace concentrations fig 4c bi et al 2014b mn ii and ni ii as essential elements of microorganisms could also promote the synthesis of heme to a certain extent fig 4c wu et al 2019 xu et al 2017 in contrast cu ii could chelate with the sulfur group of heme leading to metabolic disorder of cell proteins and enzymes ultimately leading to a decline in heme content fig 4c dupont et al 2011 based on the above results when the anammox system is affected by environmental pressure in engineering the strategy of adding trace amounts of fe ii mn ii and ni ii can be adopted to stimulate heme secretion to maintain the stability of the anammox system for bio toxic hms such as cu ii the method of complexation removal should be selected to reduce their damage to functional proteins additionally fad is also an important protein on the anammoxosome membrane and can catalyze the generation of nad and nadh production a study indicated that the redox characteristics of fad could reduce hg ii with high toxicity to hg0 with low toxicity but fad related proteins would bind to hg in this process which hindered the energy generation of fad regulated process muller et al 2001 when intracellular hms concentrations exceed physiological requirements metal efflux proteins located on the cytoplasmic membrane can remove some metal ions thus alleviating toxic effects nies 2003 van niftrik et al 2008 typical metal efflux proteins of anammox bacteria include czc protein zitb protein and atpase fig 4d the czc protein is driven by proton motive force the zitb protein is affected by concentration gradient and chemiosmotic gradient and the p type atpase utilizes the energy generated by atp hydrolysis nies 2003 these three proteins form a combinatorial network that helps microbes regulate metal concentrations in the cytoplasm and the environment nies 2003 what s more the energy released by the electron transfer chain is first converted into a transmembrane proton h step difference and then protons flow along the proton step difference which synthesize atp through the atp synthase located on anammoxosome membrane this process can balance the internal and external osmotic pressure of cells which is conducive to the discharge of hms ions and provides energy for cells to resist hms stress blencowe and morby 2003 studies have shown that atp synthase related genes were significantly upregulated under zn ii stress confirming that atp synthase could drive anammox bacteria to generate more energy to expel hms thus maintaining bacterial functions ma et al 2020 in brief the anammoxosome membrane is closely related to the electron and material transfer of anammox bacteria tan et al 2022 however the response of electron and material flow of anammox bacteria to hms stress is still unclear so the electron transfer pathway and the changes in amtb and foca responsible for nitrogen transfer under hms shock can be further analyzed in future work this can help expand our understanding of the metabolic process of anammox bacteria and more precisely regulate its metabolic process to improve the ability of anammox bacteria to resist hms shock 3 3 response mechanism of hms on key enzymes in anammoxosome the nitrogen catabolism of anammox takes place inside the anammoxosome along an electron transfer chain made up of a series of key enzymes fig 4e the electron transfer chain of anammox bacteria uses nitrite reductase nir hydrazine synthase hzs and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh as an important basis to ensure the conversion of substances tan et al 2022 meanwhile cytochrome c and heme as significant component of key enzymes play a role in electron carriers redox catalysis and other bio processes so their responses to hms cannot be ignored ferousi et al 2019 kartal and keltjens 2016 kleingardner and bren 2015 su and chen 2021 in recent years with the development of molecular biology and metagenome technology the changes in key enzymes and related functional genes of anammox bacteria under the hms shock have been successfully studied in fact some hms as important components of enzymes can promote enzyme activities and functional gene expression levels at low concentrations fig 4f for example fe ii can participate in the synthesis of heme and fe s clusters so it can promote heme c containing enzymes thereby increasing anammox activity bi et al 2014b ferousi et al 2017 zhang et al found that fe iii increased the content of heme c to approximately 120 zhang et al 2021c moreover hdh is composed of heme c network in addition metal oxides or metal nps can also improve the activity of related enzymes by affecting the properties of anammox granular sludge for instance mno2 was found that promoted the granulation of anammox sludge thus increasing the overall enzyme activity qiao et al 2012 furthermore ag nps could upregulate the functional genes nirs hzs and hdh which was due to the increased porosity of anammox granular sludge thereby increasing the diffusion rate of its substrates peng et al 2019 hms that exceed the threshold value will bind to the enzyme decrease the activity of the enzyme hu et al 2004 zhang et al 2016b and thus affect nitrogen metabolism balali mood et al 2021 as the power source of the anammox process the hdh that dehydrogenates hydrazine and generates electrons has attracted the attention of researchers a small amount of fe can promote hdh activity but an excess of 6 72 mg l 1 fe ii could lead to a decrease in hdh activity bi et al 2014b for non enzymatic active center ions 10 mg l 1 cd ii ag i and hg ii decreased the hdh content in the anammox system by 43 0 44 1 and 69 3 respectively fig 4g bi et al 2014a metals that can change their valence state have multiple inhibitory mechanisms on metabolic processes take cr as an example it could occupy the inactive site of the enzyme in anammox and form a cr vi enzyme substrate complex hindering substrate degradation and product generation fig 4g yu et al 2019 due to the presence of redox substances such as cytochrome cr vi can be reduced to cr iii in the cell this process generates reactive oxygen species ros attacking the dna of anammox cells to inhibit proteins synthesis and eventually affecting metabolic activity fig 4g yu et al 2019 researchers have observed the crystal structure of the key enzyme in anammox bacteria as well as determined the substances and electrons transport pathway in the key enzyme akram et al 2019 dietl et al 2015 however under the hms shock recent studies focused on the response degree of key enzyme activities at the macro level it is still unknown how hms bind to key active site of enzymes and how hms affect the substance and electron transport pathways in the molecular structure of key enzymes in anammox bacteria therefore in future work with the help of cutting edge technologies such as molecular biology and cryo electron microscopy the changes in active sites in the enzyme crystal structure in response to hms shock can be explored this can further broaden the understanding of the mechanism of action between hms and key enzymes at the molecular level 3 4 response regularity of hms on anammox bacterial community the response mechanism of anammox bacteria to hms toxicity is due to the inhibition of their own physiological activities which will further affect the relative abundance and competitive advantage of anammox bacteria in the community in the case of long term exposure to high concentrations of hms the decrease in the relative abundance of anammox bacteria accompanied by an increase in heterotrophic bacteria could be observed zhang et al 2018c under 20 mg l 1 cd ii shock the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia decreased from 26 21 to 8 21 but pseudomonas as heterotrophic denitrification bacteria its relative abundance increased correspondingly with the cd ii concentration zhang et al 2018b the growth of heterotrophic bacteria often depends on the release of eps and soluble microbial products smp as carbon sources wu et al 2019 since anammox bacteria dominate the anammox systems these smp usually evolved from apoptotic anammox cells both principal component analysis and redundancy analysis diagrams helped researchers explore the evolutionary trajectory of communities and the correlation between functional species and hms overall high concentration of hms will reduce the competitive advantage of anammox bacteria in the anammox system while enhance the competitiveness of heterotrophic bacteria this view is supported by various studies wu et al 2019 xu et al 2019b zhang et al 2018c moreover different genera of anammox bacteria also showed different tolerance to hms for example under the exposure of different forms of zn ion oxide nps candidatus brocadia usually showed stronger resistance than candidatus kuenenia and became the dominant genera in the anammox system zhang et al 2018a but cd ii shock showed the opposite result zhang et al 2018b this provides a new perspective for the domestication of hms resistant anammox systems targeted experiments can be designed to screen and purify the dominant anammox genera under different hms shock and these anammox genera will be potential bio augmentation means for practical engineering 4 future challenges and prospects although researchers have conducted a lot of studies on the toxicity mechanism of anammox under hms shock nevertheless under hms shock the succession mechanism of anammox bacterial community and changes in the distribution of material and energy flow are still worthy of further study besides the recovery and augmentation strategy under hms shock are also insufficient this section looks into the future prospects of hms inhibition on anammox and put forwards the feasible methods to alleviate hms inhibition on anammox system 4 1 in depth elaboration of inhibitory response microbial community analysis and regulation the diversity and gene expression of the anammox bacterial community under hms shock are mostly used to explain the changes in microbial activity however the transformation pathways of hms and the interactions between microbial community remain unclear subsequently combining fluorescent labeling omics and high throughput technology to construct a community level metabolic pathway the complex variations in microbial communities under hms shock could be revealed furthermore dna based stable isotope detection can link microbial functions to there identities which breaks down barriers between the community level and individual bacteria uhlík et al 2009 youngblut et al 2018 zhang et al 2022b this helps to reveal the potential relationship among the microbial community under hms inhibition and degradation by districting inter taxon and environment taxon correlations or conducting significant correlation analysis between key taxa and environmental factors the recovery methods of microbial communities under hms shock may be inferred xiao et al 2021 however these inferences are limited not only by a single model algorithm but also by the monitoring and processing of large amounts of biological information the dynamic equilibrium of the anammox bacterial community depends on the cross feedings between autotrophic bacteria and heterozygous bacteria feng et al 2019 the assimilation of soluble microbial products smp can be further considered as an indicator of the variations among microbial communities under hms shock xiao et al 2022 meanwhile quorum sensing qs mediated by n acyl homoserine lactones ahls plays a crucial role in microbial processes guo et al 2021 liu et al 2022b for example ahls produced by gram negative bacteria could regulate eps production nitrogen removal and microbial community stabilization in biological nitrogen removal bnr systems gao et al 2019 tan et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 based on these both endogenous and exogenous ahl mediated qs have been proved to relieve the inhibition pressure of hms on bnr systems and adjusted the recovery of various nitrogen conversion processes nitrification denitrification and ammoxidation etc gao et al 2022b gao et al 2022c however current studies were limited to the qs response of anammox based systems under hms shock liu et al 2022b so in depth researches on the relationship between the spatial variation of bacteria and ahls content and further strengthening anammox systems under hms shock by regulating qs system are of great significance for biological nitrogen removal technology at present due to the development of machine learning technology artificial intelligence systems are employed to monitor the intermediate metabolism process of the anammox community from the perspective of time and space concomitantly the spatial distribution of the anammox community could be further analyzed by microbial geography chen et al 2022 by changing the contents of metabolic intermediates and signal molecules in the environment the relative abundance and spatial distribution of microbial communities can be intelligently regulated which is helpful for advancing anammox processes on a larger scale 4 2 further clarification of the mechanism the transfer of matter energy and electrons the substance transport of anammox bacteria includes carbon and nitrogen transport in which carbon transport occurs in the outer periplasm while nitrogen transport occurs in the anammoxosome tan et al 2022 in fact there is an inseparable relationship between nitrogen and carbon transport in anammox bacteria and the nitrogen conversion process is an important for energy source in the carbon sequestration process of anammox bacteria for example the reducing power nadh required for co2 or carbonate assimilation of anammox bacteria comes from hydrazine dehydrogenation the energy required for atp synthesis comes from no2 oxidation and the energy released from no2 oxidation to no3 fixes co2 strous et al 2006 therefore once hms affect nitrogen transport the distribution of electrons and energy will be disrupted thus affecting carbon source metabolism in future work by means of metagenomics and other biomolecular techniques we can understand how hms affect nitrogen transport thereby placing an energy shortage pressure on carbon transport at greater depths however relevant research on the interaction mechanism between nitrogen and carbon transport in response to hms shock is still lacking in detail the essence of carbon transport is that anammox bacteria fix co2 or carbonate through the acetyl coa pathway and then enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca cycle to synthesize cytoplasmic cellular material liu et al 2022a this process involved a series of biochemical reactions related to bioenergy biosynthesis and maintenance of redox balance under the hms shock any one of the links may be affected and affect the subsequent metabolic process hence further study can focus on the response of the acetyl coa pathway and tca cycle by identifying the functional proteins in metabolic pathways fig 5 for nitrogen transport nh4 and no2 as important growth substrates of anammox bacteria will enter anammoxosome through amtb and foca nitrogen transporters strous et al 2006 respectively the binding process of hms to proteins will seriously affect the protein activity amtb and foca as the starting link of nitrogen flow and distribution processes deserve further investigation in the binding characteristics and binding sites hms which may be valuable for hms to inhibit the nitrogen removal performance of anammox from the perspective of material flow after transport nh4 and no2 can enter the cell and be reduced to n2 by key enzymes such as nar nir hzs and hdh wang et al 2016a until now the effects of different hms on the activities of these key enzymes have been studied extensively but there is still a research gap in the sequence about the influence of certain hms on key enzymes of anammox bacteria fig 5 if this could be revealed targeted measures can be taken to stimulate the activity of corresponding enzymes such as adding central ions of key enzyme activity and redox mediators which can help ensure the stability of the electron transfer chain and thus maintain the stability of the nitrogen removal process nitrous oxide n2o as a greenhouse gas has attracted increasing attention in biological water treatment anammox bacteria have not been shown to be able to produce n2o but n2o production is detected in anammox systems and coupled processes such as partial nitrification anammox systems pn a and partial denitrification anammox systems fig 5 take pn a system as an example nh4 could be converted to nh2oh by the catalysis of ammonia monooxygenase amo however under the condition of incomplete oxidation nh2oh would be converted to n2o therefore the oxidation process of reducing hms such as fe ii and cr iii consumes dissolved oxygen may lead the incomplete oxidation of nh2oh to the form n2o in addition due to the existence of apoptotic cells and microbial metabolites some heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria were enriched in the anammox community the incomplete denitrification process will also lead to the production of n2o in the denitrification process no could produce n2o under the catalysis of no reductase and n2o could produce n2 under the catalysis of n2o reductase nevertheless different enzymes might have different corresponding and sensitivity degrees under hms shock which could result in the different inhibitory effects once n2o reductase is more sensitive to some hms than no reductase it could cause the accumulation of n2o hence it is an important task to control low n2o emissions under hms and other pollutant shocks more recently the role of biochar in reducing n2o emissions in soil by enriching bacteria encoding the nos gene has been demonstrated gao et al 2022a therefore the strategy of adding biochar or n2o reducing microorganisms to the biological system may be adapted to reduce the excessive emission of n2o under the hms shock in anammox based bio process in addition the coupled process based on anammox involves the cooperation of multiple functional bacteria to complete the nitrogen removal process the toxic effects and response mechanisms of these bacteria under hms shock are different for example in the presence of cr vi the denitrification process would be subject to electronic competition from cr vi reduction jin et al 2017 and this response mechanism did not exist in the autotrophic anammox process this will affect the distribution of substance and energy in the system in practical engineering anammox and denitrifying bacteria are often coupled and symbiosis the synergistic effects of hms on the two types of bacteria in the coupled system might be different from that of the individual effect therefore the inhibition mechanism of hms on key nitrogen removal bacteria in the coupled system can be further studied in the future 4 3 efficient recovery strategies bio accelerators the inhibitory effect of hms on the anammox process promotes the exploration of efficient recovery strategies at present many researches have focused on biological promotion based on the addition of exogenous accelerators fig 6 the ionic state of hms has been shown to be the predominant toxic form as a conventional solution organic ligands have been used to chelate metal ions to protect cells it has been reported that ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta could relieve the inhibitory effects of cu and ni zhang et al 2016b however as an exogenous substance the metal concentration in the anammox system after washing with edta has decreased but it cannot be ignored that the cells will have metabolic disorders and decreased key enzyme activities li et al 2020b this requires researchers to further elucidate their role in cellular metabolism meanwhile aiming at these effective exogenous substances it is of engineering significance to focus on the appropriate substances e g signal molecules betaine and calcium ions to adjust the system balance and restore the nitrogen removal effect after chelation in contrast those chelators secreted by microorganisms e g cysteine etc have better biological adaptation as an important means of biological resistance to metal invasion the sulfhydryl group on cysteine captures free metals in cells thus preventing metal ions from inhibiting key enzyme activities the expression level of cysq kustc0852 a functional gene encoding cysteine biosynthesis has been detected to be upregulated in anammox bacteria with zn ii resistance ma et al 2020 hence tracer techniques such as isotope labeling can be employed to further reveal its detoxification site and determine whether exogenous administration can enter the cell to produce chelation in addition as common intermediate products in the anammox process nh2oh n2h4 and their related compounds nh2oh hcl and n2h4 h2so4 are all effective substances to relieve the inhibition on anammox zhang et al 2022c as a strong reducing substance nh2oh can reduce cr vi to cr iii outside the cell and decrease the intracellular cr vi concentration feng et al 2021 therefore for hms whose toxicity is affected by valence such as cr and hg nh2oh and n2h4 compounds can be selected as reducing agents to change the metal valence in the system however high concentrations of nh2oh can cause cytotoxicity so it is necessary to determine the concentration threshold for system recovery similarly the special structure of anammoxosome enables anammox bacteria to resist the toxicity of n2h4 at low concentrations more importantly the electrons generated by the oxidation of additional n2h4 by hdh will become an additional driving force under hms shock supplement the consumption of anammox bacteria anabolism and reduce the production of nitrate yao et al 2013 nh2oh and n2h4 have been shown to enhance the anammox process and inhibit nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob however their metabolic pathways and potential toxicity need to be further revealed to provide a basis for practical applications based on further studies on electron transfer blocking under hms shock the inhibition sites of hms on the electron transport chain can be better revealed which is helpful for the targeted dosing of electron transfer accelerators the current recovery strategies are relatively single and an efficient strategy needs to comprehensively consider multiple perspectives such as microbial growth electron transfer metal capture metal toxicity reduction and community balance 4 4 advanced system defense biological augmentation in the process of wastewater treatment long term hms shock has an impact on the performance of the system and it is also a process of directional domestication of anammox bacteria at present anammox bacteria have been found to have biological resistance to various hms such as zn ii and hg ii chen et al 2020b ma et al 2020 the addition of these native or exogenous bacteria is aimed at increasing the tolerance of the microbial community to hms and maintaining nitrogen removal activity in metal containing wastewater fig 7 a for the augmentation and domestication of native bacteria using hms wastewater the community diversity can be basically maintained or reduced controlling metal concentrations and acclimation conditions nutrients temperature ph etc will favor the growth of resistant flora ma et al 2022b for the augmentation of exogenous bacteria the primary problem is the screening purification and enrichment of resistant bacteria molecular means such as dna cloning are used to shorten the generation time of anammox bacteria and obtain the target bacteria quickly however the introduced bacteria are likely to compete with the original bacteria for nutrients and space which brings many uncertainties to biological augmentation zhao et al 2016 learning from the successful augmentation experience exogenous flora can be used to change the original microbial structure induce the formation of dominant bacteria and finally complete the augmentation of system resistance in recent years the development of fluorescent labeling technology has enabled fluorescent detection to visualize the characteristics and activities of bacterial cells which can ensure the acquisition of biological information during the augmentation process schneider and hackenberger 2017 the development of synthetic biology enables directionally editing the gene sequences of related microorganisms as needed to construct novel functional bacteria that meet expectations anammox bacteria have native metal resistance genes metal transport genes and hms reduction genes xu et al 2022 therefore these genes could be edited in anammox bacteria to strengthen their expression further enhancing the metal resistance hms efflux and reduction ability of anammox bacteria fig 7a metagenomic analysis of the currently known metal resistant bacteria interception of resistance gene fragments and transplantation into anammox cells may be realized in the future although there are no mature pure anammox bacteria at present an abundance of anammox bacteria of 97 99 5 can be obtained through reactor culture and percoll density gradient centrifugation jetten et al 2005 liu et al 2008 van der star et al 2008 zhang et al 2016a breakthroughs in separation and purification technology provide the basis for research on genetic engineering the maintenance of the original biological activity of the organism and the re expression of the resistance gene transcript during the gene editing process will be the focus of researchers in the future in addition anammox bacteria as chemoautotrophs are more susceptible to external factors but the application of new carrier technology can protect functional bacteria from the intrusion of toxic substances fig 7b the high porosity of sludge biochar not only helps to improve the adsorption of hms at active sites but also the porous structure provides attachment space for microorganisms and delays the impact of metal ions lü et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 the strengthening mechanism needs to be further investigated such as the potential of surface redox active functional groups quinone group and phenolic hydroxyl group etc to effectively regulate electron transfer in the nitrogen cycle extracellular electron transfer makes sludge biochar a potential new electron acceptor for nh4 oxidation shaw et al 2020 and this electron shuttle process may enable anammox reaction to complete from other pathways under hms inhibition in addition as an emerging interdisciplinary technology 3d bio printing technology subverts the traditional form of microbial load carrier surfaces in traditional biofilm systems and coats microorganisms with bio friendly gels to delay or reduce the contact between hms and anammox bacteria fig 7c how to complete the printing process of the anammox bacterial community in an anaerobic environment and maintain its activity is the primary problem to be solved the species and relative abundance of microbial communities in the community were purposefully designed and metal metabolizing bacteria were added to enhance community function while ensuring nitrogen removal efficiency moreover the three dimensional space advantage of 3d printed bodies enables researchers to configure appropriate spatial structures to increase the specific surface area of the material optimize steric hindrance to improve electron mass transfer efficiency and further improve nitrogen removal efficiency 5 conclusions the response mechanism and regulation strategy of anammox system to hms are important for the development of bnr process a large number of studies have focused on the short term and long term effects of typical hms on the performance of anammox systems on this basis we established a new toxicity evaluation method that is more suitable for engineering by combining acute toxicity of hms system recovery time and biological adaptability the inhibitory effects of hms nps and multi metal coexistence on anammox bacteria were also compared with single hms ions in particular the response mechanism of anammox system to hms was analyzed at the cellular structure level including the dynamic changes of the content and structure of pn and ps in eps the regulation of hms by proteins on anammoxosome and the effects of hms on intracellular nitrogen metabolism process meanwhile several research gaps on response mechanism under hms shock are also proposed containing in depth succession of anammox community and the distributive regulation of carbon and nitrogen flow under hms shock recently the acquisition and processing of microbial information have attracted the attention of researchers so the analysis and fitting based on machine learning will become a breakthrough in future research moreover the recovery and augmentation of the anammox system still need to be further improved to adapt to complex engineering environment bio accelerators and bio augmentation have great potential to alleviate hms inhibition from the perspective of exogenous addition and microbiota fortification new materials and biological technologies

14749,new technologies using advanced oxidation processes aops with low energy input to address the presence of micro contaminants and the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps are required for drinking water safety in this work the activation of chlorine dioxide with solar solar clo2 process a type of renewable and inexhaustible energy was developed to degrade atrazine atz and control the formation of dbps results revealed that solar clo2 process was effective in degrading atz hydroxyl radicals oh and chlorine radicals cl produced in solar clo2 process were found to be the predominant agents for atz degradation with contribution rates of 55 9 and 44 1 respectively based on radical quenching tests and competition kinetics reaction ph did not affect the total amount of cl and oh i e oh exp and cl exp while the conversion of cl to oh was responsible for the depressed atz degradation efficiency with the increasing ph in solar clo2 process the presence of bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl and humic acid ha retarded the atz degradation mainly due to they decreased oh exp and cl exp using the uplc ms ms analysis six degradation intermediates of atz were tentatively identified and the three stage degradation pathway as well as the stepwise detoxification of atz were confirmed by the condensed fukui function cff calculation and ecosar prediction applying solar clo2 as a pretreatment of ha containing water the formation of dbps during post chlorination was significantly reduced however the presence of atz during solar clo2 pretreatment of ha significantly lowered the control efficiency of dbps the major degradation intermediate i e deethyldeisopropylhydroxyatrazine deiha of atz could incorporate into ha and therefore providing more precursors for dbps the acute toxicity recorded by the behavior of zebrafish larvae revealed that using chloramine instead of chlorine downstream the solar clo2 pretreatment of atz and ha could significantly reduce the acute toxicity by decreasing the formation of total dbps this study demonstrated the great potential of applying solar clo2 process followed by chloramination to simultaneously degrade micro contaminants and reduce dbps formation as well as toxic risk in practical applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar chlorine dioxide process atrazine radicals disinfection byproducts toxicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction advanced oxidation process aops combining chlorine based disinfectants are promising treatment strategies to be integrated into conventional water treatment plants to degrade micro contaminants chlorine based aops degrade micro contaminants mainly by producing powerful reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals oh and reactive chlorine species rcs fan et al 2022 qin et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 the common strategy in practical applications to produce these powerful reactive species is by the ultraviolet light uv with chlorine chloramine and more recently with chlorine dioxide clo2 kong et al 2021 wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b compared with chlorine based aops and chloramine based aops clo2 based aops has some advantages such as considerable biocidal efficiency of clo2 and less dbps formation potential pang et al 2023 therefore clo2 based aops have been rising great attention attempts have been made to investigate the degradation of micro contaminants by uv clo2 aop at a uv wavelength of 254 nm i e uvc254 clo2 process the uvc254 clo2 process was demonstrated to produce reactive species e g chlorine oxide radicals clo chlorine radicals cl hydroxyl radicals oh and ozone to facilitate the degradation of micro contaminants including sulfamethoxazole triclosan and ciprofloxacin sichel et al 2011 however the degradation efficiency of micro contaminants by uvc254 clo2 process was lower than the well documented uvc254 chlorine and uvc254 chloramine process kong et al 2021 tian et al 2020 besides the low absorption coefficients 60 7 m 1cm 1 of clo2 at uvc254 resulting in less production of reactive species and high input of energy limited the application of uvc254 clo2 process in micro contaminants elimination xu et al 2022 ye et al 2022 to conquer these limitations activation of clo2 in uva range 320 nm to 400 nm at wavelength of 360 nm i e uva clo2 process was performed in literatures chuang et al 2022 kong et al 2021 the high absorption coefficients 619 1 to 1284 2 m 1cm 1 of clo2 in the uva range which are over 1 magnitude higher than that at uvc254 enable the production of more reactive species in uva clo2 process than in uvc254 clo2 process firak et al 2022 although uva clo2 process showed good degradation efficiency towards micro contaminants the energy conversion efficiency of uva lower than 70 from electrical power into optical power was still deemed not energy efficient peng et al 2022 overall the uv based clo2 aop require additional energy input which is detrimental to economic savings clo2 has high absorption coefficients of 50 100 m 1cm 1 and 619 1 1284 2 m 1cm 1 in the wavelength range of 220 to 240 nm and 300 to 420 nm respectively kong et al 2021 peng et al 2022 this suggests the potential activation ability of solar irradiation at wavelength of 300 420 nm towards clo2 solar is a cost effective and bebign energy consisting of 3 uv light 44 visible light and 53 infeared and features enormous advantages such as clean obtainable renewable and inexhaustible yang et al 2021 recently the common applied chlorine persulfate and sulfite have been proved well cooperated with solar in degrading micro contaminants chen et al 2023 sanchez montes et al 2022 tan et al 2022 for example chlorine can absorb energy at the solar emission of 300 400 nm to produce clo cl and oh et al to effectively degrade micro contaminants sanchez montes et al 2022 while for the clo2 with a wider adaption to the solar irradiation spectrum whether solar irradiation can activate clo2 to produce the powerful reactive species and thus promote to the degradation of micro contaminants have never been reported generally aops applying in water treatment would have significant effect on the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps during the following disinfection process chen et al 2022 ding et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a zhou et al 2020 it was found that uv sulfite treatment of amino acids could generate precursors more prone to form haloacetonitrile during post chlorination chen et al 2022 while uv persulfate degradation of chloramphenicol could convert the amino groups into nitro groups and therefore greatly alleviate the formation of haloacetonitrile chu et al 2016a this demonstrated that the degradation intermediates during the degradation of micro contaminants in aops played predominant role in the dbps formation effect of uv clo2 pretreatment on the dbps formation showed that uv clo2 process could enhance the formation of dbps while the authors did not offer corresponding explanations and effective coping strategies kong et al 2021 peng et al 2022 for the potential solar clo2 process its effect on and underlying mechanism of the dbps formation during following disinfection step as well as the control strategies need to be comprehensively addressed herein the solar clo2 process was constructed for the first time to degrade micro contaminants atrazine atz was selected as a target micro contaminant as a common herbicide atz has caused significant environmental contamination and it is frequently detected in surface water and ground water with concentrations ranging from 0 07 to 3 00 ug l joseph et al 2022 urseler et al 2022 firstly the removal efficiency and reactive species mediated mechanisms of atz degradation in solar clo2 process was investigated secondly the effects of different operation conditions e g ph and clo2 dose and water matrices e g bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl humic acid ha and real waters on atz degradation were evaluated thirdly the atz degradation pathway in solar clo2 process and the formation of dbps during following chlorination were addressed finally the toxic risk of dbps was determined and the risk control strategy was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents the information of the materials and reagents used in this study is provided in text s1 all of the chemicals with reagent grade were used without further purification chlorine dioxide clo2 stock solutions were freshly prepared by the reaction of sulfuric acid and sodium chlorite and

clo2 at the designed initial concentration and gently mixed for 10 s the initial ph was adjusted by diluted h2so4 and naoh and maintained by 2 mm phosphate buffer degradation solutions were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals and divided into three aliquots 1 one aliquot of the degradation solution was quenched by excessive sodium thiosulfate and extracted by methyl tert butyl ether mtbe for the further analysis of organic compounds 2 one aliquot was quenched with ethylenediamine and purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min for the analysis of the inorganic byproducts i e cl clo2 and clo3 3 another one aliquot was directly analyzed for residual clo2 and the formed free chlorine to evaluate the effect of ph the experiments were conducted in the 2 mm phosphate buffer solutions at ph 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 and 11 0 respectively additional cl hco3 and ha at 0 2 0 mm 0 2 0 mm and 0 3 0 mg l respectively was added into the testing solutions to evaluate the effect of cl hco3 and ha on the degradation of atz real waters collected from taihu lake and yangtze river were used as water matrices to evaluate the effect of real water matrices on the atz degradation all experiments were conducted in duplicate 2 3 disinfection byproducts formation tests chlorine simulated distribution systems sds tests and chloramine uniform formation conditions ufc tests were conducted to investigate the formation of dbps from atz 1 0 um and or ha 1 0 mg l during different treatment processes chuang and mitch 2017 for chlorine sds tests sodium hypochlorite was dosed into the 30 min degradation solution with a pre determined dosage in the dark for 24 h at 25 1 c leaving 1 0 mg l as cl2 free chlorine residual after 24 h while for chloramine ufc tests the preformed monochloramine was dosed into the 30 min degradation solution with a pre determined dosage in the dark for 72 h at 25 1 c leaving 1 0 mg l as cl2 free chlorine residual after 72 h the residual disinfectant was quenched using a stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid then the as formed dbps was extracted with mtbe and measured as soon as possible 2 4 toxicity evaluation experiments zebrafish larvae provided by nanjing ezerinka biotechnology co ltd were used as toxicity indicator to compare the acute toxicity of solutions treated by different treatment processes randomly selected zebrafish larvae were exposed to nine solutions i deionized water as a blank control ii atz and ha solution iii chlorinated atz solution iv chlorinated ha solution v chlorinated atz and ha solution vi solar clo2 pretreatment followed

followed by chloraminated atz and ha solution for each group three parallels were included the exposure solutions were kept in an illumination incubator and renewed daily with ph maintained at 7 0 0 2 and temperature adjusted to 28 0 1 0 c after incubation for 96 h the zebrafish larvae were transformed to the 24 well plates and the behaviors including trajectories swimming distance and swimming speed of zebrafish larvae were recorded by a daniovision observation chamber noldus 2 5 analytical methods concentrations of atz nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba and deethyldeisopropylhydroxyatrazine ammeline deiha were determined with a high performance liquid chromatography uplc waters e2695 coupled with a waters symmetry c18 column 5 μm 150 mm 4 6 mm the details of the detection conditions were shown in table s2 the degradation intermediates of atz were analyzed using a hplc ms ms system agilent 1290 6460 with positive mode electrospray ionization esi the chromatographic separation was carried out on a c18 hplc capillary column 5 μm 100 mm 2 1 mm the eluents consisted of deionized water eluent a containing 0 1 formic acid and acetonitrile eluent b with a flow rate of 0 24 ml min 1 the gradient program was 10 to 70 b from 5 to 30 min hold for 10 min and then went back to 10 b from 40 to 50 min the column temperature and injection volume were set at 30 c and 20 μl the concentrations of clo2 and chlorine were measured on a hachdr2800 residual chlorine analyzer based on the diethyl p phenylene diamine dpd colorimetric method apha 1998 the productions of chlorite clo2 chlorate clo3 and chloride cl were measured using an ion chromatography ics 2100 equipped with an anionic column metrosep a supp 5100 fan et al 2022 electron spin resonance esr spectrum was recorded on a emx 10 12 esr spectrometer bruker germany using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the spin trapping agent the concentrations of thms i e tcm hans i e dcan and tcan hacams i e dcacam and tcacam and hnms i e dcnm and tcnm were detected with a gas chromatography electron capture detection gc ecd 7890b agilent usa and that of haas i e dcaa and tcaa and hals i e dcal and tcal were measured using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms dsq2 thermo fisher usa the detailed parameters are provided in table s3 chen et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation efficiency of atz by solar chlorine dioxide process the degradation kinetics of atz by solar alone clo2 alone and solar clo2 process in neutral aquatic solution were shown in fig 1 a atz hardly underwent directly photolysis by solar irradiation the degradation percentage of atz was less than 5 after treatment by clo2 alone for 30 min indicating that clo2 oxidation can t remove atz by contrast atz could be degraded during solar clo2 process with a reduction rate of 86 3 within 30 min the degradation of atz by solar clo2 process could be well fitted by pseudo first order kinetic with a rate constant kobs of 0 067 min 1 which was lower than uva365 clo2 process kobs 0 095 min 1 but comparable to the commonly used uvc254 clo2 process kobs 0 073 min 1 fig s3a additionally solar activation of some common oxidants including persulfate hydrogen peroxide and chlorine was also comparatively studied with solar activation of clo2 as shown in fig s3b the atz degradation efficiency by solar hydrogen peroxide process was below 5 0 indicating that solar can not effectively activate hydrogen peroxide which is in agreement with the results in previous study diez et al 2020 solar clo2 process showed a much better performance in degrading atz than either solar persulfate process or solar chlorine process possibly because clo2 featured with a higher utilization ratio of solar irradiation than that of persulfate and chlorine can form more reactive species that contribute to atz degradation as reported the molar absorption coefficient of clo2 covering the solar irradiation spectrum 300 800 nm was significantly higher than both persulfate and chlorine fig s3c peng et al 2022 tan et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 the consumption of clo2 as well as the productions of its inorganic byproducts i e cl clo2 clo3 and free chlorine were investigated to evaluate the application potential of solar clo2 process as shown in fig 1b 61 4 of clo2 was continuously consumed in solar clo2 process after reaction for 30 min the kobs of clo2 consumption 0 029 min 1 was lower than that for atz degradation 0 067 min 1 suggesting the high utilization efficiency of clo2 activation to produce reactive species for atz degradation with the consumption of clo2 clo3 and cl were the major inorganic byproducts with productions of 5 89 and 5 03 μm respectively clo2 and free chlorine were also formed with concentrations of 3 05 and 1 29 μm respectively note that the productions of clo3 0 49 mg l and clo2 0 21 mg l in treated water were both lower than the who guidelines 0 70 mg l who 2011 in summary the results suggested that solar clo2 process has great potential in degrading atz 3 2 reactive species accounting for atz degradation previous literatures reported that hydroxyl radicals oh reactive chlorine species rcs including chlorine oxide radicals clo chlorine radicals cl and dichlorine radicals cl2 ozone and in situ formed free chlorine may be produced during clo2 activation via uv transition metals et al eqs 1 7 with transformation pathways shown in fig s4 chuang et al 2022 kong et al 2021 liu et al 2022 to insight into the mechanism of atz degradation in solar clo2 process the reactive species accounting for atz degradation was comprehensively studied firstly chlorination of atz at free chlorine dosages of 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 μm could not remove atz at a reaction time of 30 min fig s5a excluding the role of in situ formed free chlorine in atz degradation during solar clo2 process then the role of ozone to the degradation of atz was examined by n2 purging experiments ozone was formed from the reaction of o 3p and oxygen eq 3 during photolysis of clo2 as demonstrated by previous studies thomsen et al 2000 chuang et al 2022 through n2 purging for 30 min oxygen free reaction solutions could be achieved to inhibit the formation of ozone in solar clo2 process further experiment was conducted to confirm that n2 purging at a flow rate of 1 5 l min for 30 min has little effect on the variation of clo2 in its aqueous solution fig s5b as shown in fig s5c the degradation of atz was barely changed in the n2 purging experiment compared with that without n2 purging suggesting the negligible role of ozone in degrading atz in solar clo2 process finally scavenging tests were conducted to further investigate the role of ozone as well as oh and rcs in atz degradation tba can be used as a quencher for oh clo and cl since it reacts with oh clo and cl with second order reaction rate constants of 6 0 108 m 1s 1 1 3 107 m 1s 1 and 3 0 108 m 1s 1 respectively while its reactivities with ozone and cl2 are both negligible 3 0 10 3 m 1s 1 and 7 0 102 m 1s 1 respectively wu et al 2017 yang et al 2021b neta et al 1988 hco3 can be used to identify the role of clo in degrading atz because hco3 can rapidly react with oh cl and cl2 i e with second order reaction rate constants of 8 5 106 m 1s 1 2 2 108 m 1s 1 and 8 0 107 m 1s 1 respectively while its reaction rate with clo is much lower 6 0 102 m 1s 1 kong et al 2016 the addition of 10 mm tba or hco3 did not affect the consumption of clo2 under solar irradiation fig s5d evidencing that both tba and hco3 can not react with clo2 directly fig s5e showed that the degradation of atz was almost completely inhibited in the addition of 10 mm tba or hco3 confirming the negligible roles of ozone clo and cl2 in degrading atz excluding the roles of solar irradiation clo2 ozone in situ formed free chlorine clo and cl2 in degrading atz oh and or cl may be the dominant reactive species that contribute to the degradation of atz in solar clo2 process this was tentatively determined by the esr spectrum showing the formation of oh and cl in solar clo2 process fig s6 to further investigate the contribution of oh and or cl to atz degradation in solar clo2 process competition kinetics using ba and nb as the probe compounds were performed ba reacts rapidly with oh and cl with second order reaction rate constants of 5 9 109 and 1 8 1010 m 1s 1 respectively which were much higher than that with clo and cl2 with second order reaction rate constants both 107 m 1s 1 while nb only reacts with oh with a second order reaction rate constant of 3 9 109 m 1s 1 chen et al 2021 lei et al 2019 supplementary experiments also verified that ba and nb were resistant to solar irradiation and clo2 oxidation under the same experimental conditions fig s7 as shown in fig 2 a the kobs of nb ba and atz in solar clo2 process were determined to be 6 54 10 3 min 1 2 03 10 2 min 1 and 9 71 10 3 min 1 respectively based on the kinetics eqs 8 9 the steady state concentrations of oh oh exp and cl cl exp could be calculated to be 2 79 10 14 m and 9 64 10 15 m the second order reaction rate constants of atz with oh and cl were 3 0 109 m 1s 1 and 6 87 109 m 1s 1 respectively acero et al 2000 kong et al 2020 using the calculated steady state concentrations to model the pseudo first order reaction rate constant kobs atz of atz degradation the kobs atz can be determined to be 9 00 10 3 min 1 eq 10 this was in good agreement with the kobs atz 9 71 10 3 min 1 obtained from atz degradation kinetics k obs atz k obs atz k obs atz 7 3 further evidencing the dominant role of oh and cl in degrading atz in solar clo2 process as a result oh and cl produced in solar clo2 process contribute to 55 9 and 44 1 of the atz degradation respectively fig 2b 1 c l o 2 c l o o 3 p 2 c l o 2 c l o 2 3 o 3 p o 2 o 3 4 c l o h 2 o h o c l h c l o 2 5 c l c l c l 2 6 c l o h c l o h 7 c l o h o h c l 8 k o b s n b k o h n b o h

degradation of atz in solar clo2 process was studied as shown in fig 3 a the degradation efficiency of atz rapidly increased from 16 3 to 100 after reaction for 30 min as clo2 dose increased from 5 0 to 100 0 μm similar increasing was also observed for the clo2 consumption with the increasing clo2 dose during the 30 min reaction time fig s8a using the competition kinetics eqs 8 10 as shown in fig s8b the oh exp and cl exp increased from 8 14 10 15 m and 3 24 10 15 m to 7 43 10 14 m and 2 36 10 14 m respectively when clo2 dose increased from 5 0 to 100 0 μm reaction ph generally plays a significant role in the degradation of contaminants during aops phosphate buffer was used in solar clo2 process to maintain the reaction ph to the designed values i e 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 11 0 phosphate has three ionization constants pka1 2 1 pka2 7 2 and pka3 12 3 in aqueous solution with phosphate species distribution versus ph shown in fig s9a meaning that h2po4 dominated at acidic conditions while hpo4 2 increased with increasing ph it was reported that hpo4 2 reacted with oh and cl with second order reaction rate constants of 1 5 105 and 104 m 1s 1 while h2po4 reacted with oh and cl with second order reaction rate constants of 2 0 104 and 8 68 102 m 1s 1 respectively maruthamuthu and neta 1978 peng et al 2022 assuming the main phosphate species were hpo4 2 and h2po4 at concentration of 2 mm respectively the percentage of phosphate competing for oh and cl with atz can be calculated according to eq 11 11 p k r s s k r a t z a t z k r s s where k r s represents the reaction rate constants between oh or cl and phosphate species s represents the concentration of phosphate species as a result the presence of hpo4 2 only scavenged 9 1 of oh and 0 3 of cl respectively similarly 2 mm of h2po4 also just has a maximum scavenging rate of 1 3 and 0 1 towards oh and cl respectively this suggested that 2 mm phosphate as the buffer in solar clo2 process has negligible effect on the scavenging of oh and cl as well as the degradation of atz hence the degradation of atz in solar clo2 process was investigated at the ph range of 3 0 11 0 using 2 mm phosphate as a buffer as shown in fig 3b the degradation efficiency of atz slightly decreased from 95 6 to 86 3 with ph increased from 3 0 to 7 0 and then it obviously decreased to 61 5 when ph was further increased to 11 0 the clo2 consumption showed negligible change during the ph range from 3 0 to 11 0 fig s9b suggesting the little ph dependence of clo2 photodissociation this result was also supported by the negligible change on the total amount of oh exp and cl exp produced via clo2 activation by solar irradiation under the same experimental conditions fig s9c interestingly the oh exp increased from 1 42 10 14 m to 3 59 10 14 m while the cl exp significantly decreased from 2 49 10 14 m to 4 56 10 16 m when ph was increased from 3 0 to 11 0 with the increasing ph oh level was increased so as to enhance the conversion of cl to oh eqs 6 7 because cl reacts rapidly with oh to form cloh precursor of oh with a second order reaction rate constant of 1 8 1010 m 1s 1 which is much higher than that with h2o with a second order reaction rate constant of 4 5 103 m 1s 1 chuang et al 2022 as a result the modeled kobs atz decreased from 1 28 10 2 min 1 to 6 65 10 3 min 1 with the increasing ph from 3 0 to 11 0 the species distribution of atz as a function of ph was shown in fig s9d it revealed that atz featuring with an ionization constant pka of 1 7 was in its negative ions 100 in the range of ph from 3 0 11 0 zheng et al 2019 meaning that the electrostatic repulsion between atz ions and cl oh was negligible accordingly with the increasing ph the conversion of cl to oh was responsible for the depletion of the atz degradation efficiency in solar clo2 process 3 4 impact of hco3 cl ha and real water matrix fig 4 a showed the effect of hco3 co3 2 on the degradation of atz in solar clo2 process the degradation efficiency of atz significantly decreased with the increasing concentration of hco3 co3 2 from 0 to 2 0 mm due to the pka of 6 37 hco3 would be the major species of bicarbonate at the condition of ph 7 0 0 2 fig s10a showed that 0 2 0 mm of hco3 has little effect on the clo2 consumption in solar clo2 process indicating that hco3 can not consume clo2 as reported oh and cl can be scavenged by hco3 to form co3 with second order reaction rate constants of 8 5 106 and 2 2 108 m 1s 1 respectively eqs 12 13 peng et al 2022 meaning that 22 1 to 85 0 of oh and 76 2 to 98 5 of cl should be consumed when the concentration of hco3 was increased from 0 1 to 2 0 mm furthermore competition kinetics were also conducted to evaluate the effect of hco3 on the variation of oh exp and cl exp as detailed in text s2 the oh exp and cl exp decreased from 2 79 10 14 m and 9 64 10 15 m to 9 25 10 15 m and 1 72 10 16 m respectively with hco3 addition increasing from 0 to 2 0 mm fig s10b the formed co3 only degrade atz with a second order reaction rate constant of 4 0 106 m 1s 1 kong et al 2020 which is much slower than that of oh and cl therefore the inhibition of atz degradation in solar clo2 process in the presence of hco3 was mainly due to the scavenging of oh and cl by hco3 12 c l h c o 3 c o 3 c l h 13 o h h c o 3 c o 3 h 2 o fig 4b showed the effect of cl in the concentration range of 0 2 0 mm on the degradation of atz in solar clo2 process the degradation of atz significantly retarded in the presence of 0 5 2 0 mm cl the addition of cl in the concentration range of 0 5 to 2 0 mm had little effect on the consumption of clo2 fig s11a cl could scavenge oh and cl with second order reaction rate constants of 4 3 109 and 6 5 109 m 1s 1 respectively eqs 5 14 15 lee et al 2020 meaning that oh exp and cl exp should be greatly reduced given a much higher i e 500 2000 times concentration of cl than the target atz in solar clo2 process this was also supported by the competition kinetics showing that oh exp and cl exp decreased from 2 79 10 14 m and 9 64 10 15 m to 6 84 10 16 m and 1 94 10 16 m respectively with the addition of cl increased from 0 to 2 0 mm detailed in text s2 and fig s11b the retarded atz degradation in the presence of cl might be attributed to the conversion of oh and cl to cl2 14 o h c l c l o h 15 c l o h h c l h 2 o ha is ubiquitous in natural water and drinking water the effect of ha 0 3 mg l on the degradation of atz in solar clo2 process was investigated as shown in fig 4c the degradation efficiency of atz rapidly decreased from 86 3 to 29 4 in solar clo2 process as the concentration of ha increased from 0 to 3 mg l the presence of ha accelerated clo2 consumption fig s12a however the oh exp and cl exp decreased from 2 79 10 14 m and 9 64 10 15 m to 5 56 10 16 m and 1 43 10 16 m respectively with the initial concentration of ha increased from 0 to 2 0 mm detailed in text s2 and fig s12b this may be due to that ha consumes clo2 remarkably fig s12c resulting in less clo2 available for activation by solar irradiation and therefore decreasing the oh exp and cl exp besides ha as a common scavenger of reactive species can scavenge oh and cl with second order reaction rate constants of 1 4 104 and 1 3 104 l mg c 1s 1 chen et al 2023 kong et al 2016 respectively hence depress the atz degradation in solar clo2 process accordingly the consumption of clo2 oh and cl by ha was the dominant reason for the retarded atz degradation in solar clo2 process the effect of real water matrices including yangtze river water and taihu lake water i e two typical source waters in china on the degradation of atz in solar clo2 process was evaluated fig 4d revealed that the degradation efficiency of atz decreased in the two real water matrices with taihu lake water exhibit a higher inhibition rate than yangtze river water comparatively taihu lake water featured a higher content of natural organic matter nom and alkalinity while yangtze river water had a higher concentration of cl table s1 therefore it could be inferred that hco3 cl and nom in real waters may integrally contribute to the decreased atz degradation efficiency in solar clo2 process because 1 the clo2 was competitively consumed by nom in both taihu lake water and yangtze river water fig s13a 2 the oh exp and cl exp was 2 79 10 14 m and 9 64 10 15 m in deionized water while they reduced to a maximum of 1 21 10 14 m and 3 14 10 15 m in taihu lake water and a maximum of 1 56 10 14 m and 3 86 10 15 m in yangtze river water respectively detailed in text s2 and fig s13b 3 5 degradation pathways and toxic changes of atz in solar clo2 process degradation intermediates of atz in solar clo2 process were identified using uplc ms ms six degradation intermediates namely hydroxyatrazine hatz p197 deisopropylatrazine dia p173 deethylatrazine dea p187 deisopropylhydroxyatrazine diha p155 deethyldeisopropylatrazine dedia p145 and deethyldeisopropylhydroxyatrazine deiha p127 were tentatively identified according to the total ion chromatogram and chromatogram fragments shown in fig s14 s21 the structure information of the tentatively confirmed degradation intermediates was provided in table s4 the condensed fukui function cff calculation based on dmol3 ab initio code has been successfully applied to predict the reactive site of a compound that attacked by radicals detailed in text s3 chen et al 2023 according to the cff atoms in a certain molecule with larger cff values f 0 are supposed to be more reactive to radical attack li et al 2021 by integrating the identified structures of atz and its degradation intermediates and the cff calculation the possible three stage degradation pathways of atz in solar clo2 process were proposed in fig 5 a as shown in fig s22 the cff values of 7cl 0 0255 8 n 0 0040 9c 0 0015 12 n 0 0090 and 13c 0 0020 were larger than that of other atoms on atz suggesting that atz 7cl atz 8 n atz 9c atz 12 n and atz 13c were the primary reactive sites therefore in stage i the hydroxy substitution reaction occurred at atz 7cl was responsible for the formation of hatz radical attack at cn bond between atz 8 n and atz 9c as well as atz 12 n and atz 13c induced dealkylation that generated dia and dea respectively in stage ii diha might be formed from two ways 1 cn bond cleavage between hatz 8 n and hatz 9c with high cff values of 0 1280 and 0 1215 respectively fig s23 2 hydroxylation of dia 7cl because of the high reactive activity of dia 7cl with a high cff value of 0 2750 fig s24 the detected dedia would be explained by the dealkylation of dea since cff values of dea 8 n and dea 9c were higher than that of other atoms on dea fig s25 in stage iii deiha was formed from either diha via dealkylation and or dedia via hydroxy substitution which was also supported by the cff calculation results displayed in fig s26 and s27 the three stage degradation pathways of atz in solar clo2 process were further confirmed by the time evolution of the degradation intermediates as shown in fig s28 the peak area of hatz dia and dea first increased to a maximum at 5 min then they gradually decreased with the production of diha and dedia finally deiha was gradually accumulated to a concentration of 0 274 um at the reaction time of 30 min with a transformation rate of 27 4 indicating that deiha was the most major product after atz degradation for 30 min in solar clo2 process quantitative structure activity relationship qsar coupling with ecosar software was employed to assess the acute and chronic toxic of atz and its six degradation intermediates towards fish daphnid and green algae chen et al 2020 li et al 2022 as shown in fig 5b and table s5 atz was harmful towards fish daphnid and green algae in term of acute toxicity and was toxic regards to chronic toxicity after solar clo2 degradation the six degradation intermediates exhibited lower toxic toward fish daphnid and green algae than the parent atz moreover the acute and chronic toxicity showed progressively decreasing trend with the stepwise degradation of atz especially the final major degradation intermediate deiha was even not harmful towards fish daphnid and green algae suggesting that solar clo2 process could effectively degrade and simultaneously detoxify atz 3 6 effect of solar clo2 pretreatment on the formation of dbps aops pretreatment of micro contaminants and nom generally has a significant effect on the formation of dbps during following disinfection step chen et al 2022 chen et al 2023 herein clo2 clo3 and 11 common cx3r type dbps including 5 carbonaceous dbps c dbps i e one thms tcm two haas dcaa and tcaa two hals dcal and tcal and 6 nitrogenous dbps n dbps i e two hans dcan and tcan two hacams dcacam and tcacam and two hnms dcnm and tcnm were selected to comprehensively evaluate the effect of solar clo2 treatment on the formation of dbps during the post chlorination as shown in fig 6 a no clo2 clo3 and cx3r type dbps was formed from chlorination of atz at a concentration of 1 um when solar clo2 was introduced as a pretreatment process clo3 0 51 mg l and clo2 0 34 mg l were detected while still no cx3r type dbps was formed after chlorination of the treated atz solution indicating that clo3 and clo2 were mainly formed from the activation of clo2 chlorination of atz in the presence of 1 mg l ha to simulate the coexisting micro contaminant and nom in real water could generate cx3r type dbps with concentrations of 0 9 to 16 7 ug l fig 6b it was worth noting that the formation of cx3r type dbps from chlorination of ha without the addition of atz fig 6c was comparable to that in the presence of atz indicating the dominant role of ha as a precursor in the formation of cx3r type dbps during chlorination of atz in ha containing water compared with solely chlorination of ha solar clo2 pretreatment formed clo3 and clo2 with concentrations of 0 64 and 0 57 mg l respectively while it significantly reduced the formation of cx3r type dbps by 57 2 fig 6c total organic chlorine tocl tests also showed that applying solar clo2 as a pretreatment of ha containing water reduced the formation of tocl by 52 4 during chlorination fig s29 further suggesting that solar clo2 process has good control efficiency towards the formation of dbps from ha however the control efficiency towards the formation of cx3r type dbps in solar clo2 pretreatment of ha in the presence of atz fig 6b significantly decreased from 57 2 to 32 8 compared to the case without atz the above results demonstrated that the presence of atz in solar clo2 treatment of ha possibly increased the precursors of cx3r type dbps to further investigate the effect of atz degradation in ha containing water during solar clo2 pretreatment on the formation of cx3r type dbps some control experiments were conducted firstly dosing atz to the solar clo2 treated ha solution had little effect on the formation of cx3r type dbps suggesting that atz played negligible role in the increase of cx3r type dbp precursors fig 6d then selecting the major degradation products e g deiha of atz as a reference compound we found that the addition of deiha into the solar clo2 treated ha solution greatly enhanced the formation of cx3r type dbps by 36 5 and especially the six n dbps by 69 4 note that solely chlorination of deiha did not form any cx3r type dbps appreciably demonstrating that the degradation products of atz e g deiha might be incorporated into ha and therefore provided more precursors for cx3r type dbps especially for n dbps as a potential explanation deiha on which all the c and n atoms featured larger cff values fig 6e compared with atz was considered very reactive to be incorporated into ha for instance the high cff values of 2n 0 0755 4n 0 0740 6n 0 0745 8n 0 0810 and 9n 0 0790 on deiha may facilitate the direct incorporation of deiha and ha to provide the nitrogen for the formation of n dbps 3 7 comparison of acute toxicity and risk control strategy the acute toxicity of nine solutions i e i deionized water as blank control ii atz and ha solution iii chlorinated atz solution iv chlorinated ha solution v chlorinated atz and ha solution vi solar clo2 pretreatment followed by chlorinated atz solution vii solar clo2 pretreatment followed by chlorinated ha solution viii solar clo2 pretreatment followed by chlorinated atz and ha solution and ix solar clo2 pretreatment followed by chloraminated atz and ha solution was compared by recording the behavior of zebrafish larvae after 96 h exposure tests as shown in fig 7 a compared to the deionized water the trajectories of zebrafish larvae had little change in solutions ii iii and vi this is because 1 atz at low concentration and short exposure time has negligible acute toxicity to zebrafish larvae 2 chlorination of atz at a concentration of 1 0 um with or without solar clo2 pretreatment can not form toxic dbps as described in text 3 7 the trajectories of zebrafish larvae in solutions iv v vii viii and ix became sparse suggesting the inhibited activity of zebrafish larvae induced by the formed dbps besides the swimming distance and speed of zebrafish larvae were also recorded in fig 7b and c which shown similar results with the behavioral trajectory the swimming distance and speed of zebrafish larvae increased in solution vii compared with solution iv while that became lower in solution viii than solution vii this may be due to solar clo2 pretreatment efficiently reduced the formation of dbps from chlorination of ha while the formation of dbps from solar clo2 pretreatment followed by chlorination of ha was enhanced in the presence of atz compared with that without atz it was worth noting that the behavioral trajectory swimming distance and speed of zebrafish larvae in solution ix were more active than that in solution viii motivated by this observation the formation of dbps from chlorination and chloramination of atz and ha solution downstream the solar clo2 pretreatment was further measured and compared as shown in fig s30 for solar clo2 pretreated atz and ha solution the concentrations of clo2 and clo3 were comparable during the following chlorination and chloramination however chloramination slightly promoted the formation of n dbps by 14 4 while obviously reduced the formation of c dbps by 39 2 compared with chlorination this could be explained by that chlorine has a much higher oxidation ability than chloramine to oxidize organic matters and therefore forming more dbps zhang et al 2019a ding et al 2019 although chlorine has a stronger oxidative ability chloramine may be a source of nitrogen to form n dbps chu et al 2016b which could be the reason for the higher amount of n dbps observed during chloramination than chlorination the shift of species and amounts in the formation of cx3r type dbps during chloramination compared with chlorination downstream the solar clo2 pretreatment was the reason for the lowered toxicity the results were also consistent with the dbp associated toxicity determined using cytotoxicity index cti method detailed in text s4 and results shown in fig 7d chen et al 2022 ding et al 2019 which showed that the cti of dbps formed from chloramination was lower than that of dbps formed from chlorination by a percent of 29 4 this finding illustrated that using chloramine instead of chlorine as the disinfectant may be an effective strategy to reduce the formation of dbps and simultaneously alleviate the toxicity when solar clo2 process was applied to degrade atz in real nom containing waters 4 conclusions this study elucidated the degradation of atz in solar clo2 process and the strategies for controlling dbps during the subsequent disinfection step results revealed that oh and cl were the dominant radicals that responsible for the efficient degradation of atz in solar clo2 process increasing ph could induce the conversion of cl to oh hence retard the atz degradation in solar clo2 process hco3 cl and ha mainly induced depletion of oh and cl and therefore decreased the degradation efficiency of atz six degradation intermediates were tentatively identified and the three stage degradation pathway as well as the stepwise detoxification of atz were confirmed selecting atz and ha as a component to simulate real waters the presence of atz during solar clo2 pretreatment of ha dramatically decreased the control efficiency of dbps during the following chlorination this is because the major degradation intermediate e g deiha of atz could incorporate into ha and enhance the formation of dbps however using chloramine as an alternative disinfectant of chlorine downstream the solar clo2 pretreatment of atz and ha could reduce the formation of total dbps as well as the acute toxicity declaration of competing interest we declare that

14749,new technologies using advanced oxidation processes aops with low energy input to address the presence of micro contaminants and the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps are required for drinking water safety in this work the activation of chlorine dioxide with solar solar clo2 process a type of renewable and inexhaustible energy was developed to degrade atrazine atz and control the formation of dbps results revealed that solar clo2 process was effective in degrading atz hydroxyl radicals oh and chlorine radicals cl produced in solar clo2 process were found to be the predominant agents for atz degradation with contribution rates of 55 9 and 44 1 respectively based on radical quenching tests and competition kinetics reaction ph did not affect the total amount of cl and oh i e oh exp and cl exp while the conversion of cl to oh was responsible for the depressed atz degradation efficiency with the increasing ph in solar clo2 process the presence of bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl and humic acid ha retarded the atz degradation mainly due to they decreased oh exp and cl exp using the uplc ms ms analysis six degradation intermediates of atz were tentatively identified and the three stage degradation pathway as well as the stepwise detoxification of atz were confirmed by the condensed fukui function cff calculation and ecosar prediction applying solar clo2 as a pretreatment of ha containing water the formation of dbps during post chlorination was significantly reduced however the presence of atz during solar clo2 pretreatment of ha significantly lowered the control efficiency of dbps the major degradation intermediate i e deethyldeisopropylhydroxyatrazine deiha of atz could incorporate into ha and therefore providing more precursors for dbps the acute toxicity recorded by the behavior of zebrafish larvae revealed that using chloramine instead of chlorine downstream the solar clo2 pretreatment of atz and ha could significantly reduce the acute toxicity by decreasing the formation of total dbps this study demonstrated the great potential of applying solar clo2 process followed by chloramination to simultaneously degrade micro contaminants and reduce dbps formation as well as toxic risk in practical applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solar chlorine dioxide process atrazine radicals disinfection byproducts toxicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction advanced oxidation process aops combining chlorine based disinfectants are promising treatment strategies to be integrated into conventional water treatment plants to degrade micro contaminants chlorine based aops degrade micro contaminants mainly by producing powerful reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals oh and reactive chlorine species rcs fan et al 2022 qin et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 the common strategy in practical applications to produce these powerful reactive species is by the ultraviolet light uv with chlorine chloramine and more recently with chlorine dioxide clo2 kong et al 2021 wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2019b compared with chlorine based aops and chloramine based aops clo2 based aops has some advantages such as considerable biocidal efficiency of clo2 and less dbps formation potential pang et al 2023 therefore clo2 based aops have been rising great attention attempts have been made to investigate the degradation of micro contaminants by uv clo2 aop at a uv wavelength of 254 nm i e uvc254 clo2 process the uvc254 clo2 process was demonstrated to produce reactive species e g chlorine oxide radicals clo chlorine radicals cl hydroxyl radicals oh and ozone to facilitate the degradation of micro contaminants including sulfamethoxazole triclosan and ciprofloxacin sichel et al 2011 however the degradation efficiency of micro contaminants by uvc254 clo2 process was lower than the well documented uvc254 chlorine and uvc254 chloramine process kong et al 2021 tian et al 2020 besides the low absorption coefficients 60 7 m 1cm 1 of clo2 at uvc254 resulting in less production of reactive species and high input of energy limited the application of uvc254 clo2 process in micro contaminants elimination xu et al 2022 ye et al 2022 to conquer these limitations activation of clo2 in uva range 320 nm to 400 nm at wavelength of 360 nm i e uva clo2 process was performed in literatures chuang et al 2022 kong et al 2021 the high absorption coefficients 619 1 to 1284 2 m 1cm 1 of clo2 in the uva range which are over 1 magnitude higher than that at uvc254 enable the production of more reactive species in uva clo2 process than in uvc254 clo2 process firak et al 2022 although uva clo2 process showed good degradation efficiency towards micro contaminants the energy conversion efficiency of uva lower than 70 from electrical power into optical power was still deemed not energy efficient peng et al 2022 overall the uv based clo2 aop require additional energy input which is detrimental to economic savings clo2 has high absorption coefficients of 50 100 m 1cm 1 and 619 1 1284 2 m 1cm 1 in the wavelength range of 220 to 240 nm and 300 to 420 nm respectively kong et al 2021 peng et al 2022 this suggests the potential activation ability of solar irradiation at wavelength of 300 420 nm towards clo2 solar is a cost effective and bebign energy consisting of 3 uv light 44 visible light and 53 infeared and features enormous advantages such as clean obtainable renewable and inexhaustible yang et al 2021 recently the common applied chlorine persulfate and sulfite have been proved well cooperated with solar in degrading micro contaminants chen et al 2023 sanchez montes et al 2022 tan et al 2022 for example chlorine can absorb energy at the solar emission of 300 400 nm to produce clo cl and oh et al to effectively degrade micro contaminants sanchez montes et al 2022 while for the clo2 with a wider adaption to the solar irradiation spectrum whether solar irradiation can activate clo2 to produce the powerful reactive species and thus promote to the degradation of micro contaminants have never been reported generally aops applying in water treatment would have significant effect on the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps during the following disinfection process chen et al 2022 ding et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a zhou et al 2020 it was found that uv sulfite treatment of amino acids could generate precursors more prone to form haloacetonitrile during post chlorination chen et al 2022 while uv persulfate degradation of chloramphenicol could convert the amino groups into nitro groups and therefore greatly alleviate the formation of haloacetonitrile chu et al 2016a this demonstrated that the degradation intermediates during the degradation of micro contaminants in aops played predominant role in the dbps formation effect of uv clo2 pretreatment on the dbps formation showed that uv clo2 process could enhance the formation of dbps while the authors did not offer corresponding explanations and effective coping strategies kong et al 2021 peng et al 2022 for the potential solar clo2 process its effect on and underlying mechanism of the dbps formation during following disinfection step as well as the control strategies need to be comprehensively addressed herein the solar clo2 process was constructed for the first time to degrade micro contaminants atrazine atz was selected as a target micro contaminant as a common herbicide atz has caused significant environmental contamination and it is frequently detected in surface water and ground water with concentrations ranging from 0 07 to 3 00 ug l joseph et al 2022 urseler et al 2022 firstly the removal efficiency and reactive species mediated mechanisms of atz degradation in solar clo2 process was investigated secondly the effects of different operation conditions e g ph and clo2 dose and water matrices e g bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl humic acid ha and real waters on atz degradation were evaluated thirdly the atz degradation pathway in solar clo2 process and the formation of dbps during following chlorination were addressed finally the toxic risk of dbps was determined and the risk control strategy was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents the information of the materials and reagents used in this study is provided in text s1 all of the chemicals with reagent grade were used without further purification chlorine dioxide clo2 stock solutions were freshly prepared by the reaction of sulfuric acid and sodium chlorite and

at predetermined time intervals and divided into three aliquots 1 one aliquot of the degradation solution was quenched by excessive sodium thiosulfate and extracted by methyl tert butyl ether mtbe for the further analysis of organic compounds 2 one aliquot was quenched with ethylenediamine and purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min for the analysis of the inorganic byproducts i e cl clo2 and clo3 3

degradation of atz real waters collected from taihu lake and yangtze river were used as water matrices to evaluate the effect of real water matrices on the atz degradation all experiments were conducted in duplicate 2 3 disinfection byproducts formation tests chlorine simulated distribution systems sds tests and chloramine uniform formation conditions ufc tests were conducted to investigate the formation of dbps from atz 1 0 um and or ha 1 0 mg l during different treatment processes chuang and mitch 2017 for chlorine sds tests sodium hypochlorite was dosed into the 30 min degradation

into the 30 min degradation solution with a pre determined dosage in the dark for 72 h at 25 1 c leaving 1 0 mg l as cl2 free chlorine residual after 72 h the residual disinfectant was quenched using a stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid then the as formed dbps was extracted with mtbe and measured as soon as possible 2 4 toxicity evaluation experiments zebrafish larvae provided by nanjing

measured using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms dsq2 thermo fisher usa the detailed parameters are provided in table s3 chen et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation efficiency of atz by solar chlorine dioxide process the degradation kinetics of atz by solar alone clo2 alone and solar clo2 process in neutral aquatic solution were shown in fig 1 a atz hardly underwent directly photolysis by solar irradiation the degradation percentage of atz was less than 5 after treatment by clo2 alone for 30 min indicating that clo2 oxidation can t remove atz by contrast atz could be degraded during solar clo2 process with a reduction rate of 86 3 within 30 min the degradation of atz by solar clo2 process could be well fitted by pseudo first order kinetic with a rate constant kobs of 0 067 min 1 which was lower than uva365 clo2 process kobs 0 095 min 1 but comparable to the commonly used uvc254 clo2 process kobs 0 073 min 1 fig s3a additionally solar activation of some common oxidants including persulfate hydrogen peroxide and chlorine was also comparatively studied with solar activation of clo2 as shown in fig s3b the atz degradation efficiency by solar hydrogen peroxide process was below 5 0 indicating that solar can not effectively activate hydrogen peroxide which is in agreement with the results in previous study diez et al 2020 solar clo2 process showed a much better performance in degrading atz than either solar persulfate process or solar chlorine process possibly because clo2 featured with a higher utilization ratio of solar irradiation than that of persulfate and chlorine can form more reactive species that contribute to atz degradation as reported the molar absorption coefficient of clo2 covering the solar irradiation spectrum 300 800 nm was significantly higher than both persulfate and chlorine fig s3c peng et al 2022 tan et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 the consumption of clo2 as well as the productions of its inorganic byproducts i e cl clo2 clo3 and free chlorine were investigated to evaluate the application potential of solar clo2 process as shown in fig 1b 61 4 of clo2 was continuously consumed in solar clo2 process after reaction for 30 min the kobs of clo2 consumption 0 029 min 1 was lower than that for atz degradation 0 067 min 1 suggesting the high utilization efficiency of clo2 activation to produce reactive species for atz degradation with the consumption of clo2 clo3 and cl were the major inorganic byproducts with productions of 5 89 and 5 03 μm respectively clo2 and free chlorine were also formed with concentrations of 3 05 and 1 29 μm respectively note that the productions of clo3 0 49 mg l and clo2 0 21 mg l in treated water were both lower than the who guidelines 0 70 mg l who 2011 in summary the results suggested that solar clo2 process has great potential in degrading atz 3 2 reactive species accounting for atz degradation previous literatures reported that hydroxyl radicals oh reactive chlorine species rcs including chlorine oxide radicals clo chlorine radicals cl and dichlorine radicals cl2 ozone and in situ formed free chlorine may be produced during clo2 activation via uv transition metals et al eqs 1 7 with transformation pathways shown in fig s4 chuang et al 2022 kong et al 2021 liu et al 2022 to insight into the mechanism of atz degradation in solar clo2 process the reactive species accounting for atz degradation was comprehensively studied firstly chlorination of atz at free chlorine dosages of 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 μm could not remove atz at a reaction time of 30 min fig s5a excluding the role of in situ formed free chlorine in atz degradation during solar clo2 process then the role of ozone to the degradation of atz was examined by n2 purging experiments ozone was formed from the reaction of o 3p and oxygen eq 3 during photolysis of clo2 as demonstrated by previous studies thomsen et al 2000 chuang et al 2022 through n2 purging for 30 min oxygen free reaction solutions could be achieved to inhibit the formation of ozone in solar clo2 process further experiment was conducted to confirm that n2 purging at a flow rate of 1 5 l min for 30 min has little effect on the variation of clo2 in its aqueous solution fig s5b as shown in fig s5c the degradation of atz was barely changed in the n2 purging experiment compared with that without n2 purging suggesting the negligible role of ozone in degrading atz in solar clo2 process finally scavenging tests were conducted to further investigate the role of ozone as well as oh and rcs in atz degradation tba can be used as a quencher for oh clo and cl since it reacts with oh clo and cl with second order reaction rate constants of 6 0 108 m 1s 1 1 3 107 m 1s 1 and 3 0 108 m 1s 1 respectively while its reactivities with ozone and cl2 are both negligible 3 0 10 3 m 1s 1 and 7 0 102 m 1s 1 respectively wu et al 2017 yang et al 2021b neta et al 1988 hco3 can be used to identify the role of clo in degrading atz because hco3 can rapidly react with oh cl and cl2 i e with second order reaction rate constants of 8 5 106 m 1s 1 2 2 108 m 1s 1 and 8 0 107 m 1s 1 respectively while its reaction rate with clo is much lower 6 0 102 m 1s 1 kong et al 2016 the addition of 10 mm tba or hco3 did not affect the consumption of clo2 under solar irradiation fig s5d evidencing that both tba and hco3 can not react with clo2 directly fig s5e showed that the degradation of atz was almost completely inhibited in the addition of 10 mm tba or hco3 confirming the negligible roles of ozone clo and cl2 in degrading atz excluding the roles of solar irradiation clo2 ozone in situ formed free chlorine clo and cl2 in degrading atz oh and or cl may be the dominant reactive species that contribute to the degradation of atz in solar clo2 process this was tentatively determined by the esr spectrum showing the formation of oh and cl in solar clo2 process fig s6 to further investigate the contribution of oh and or cl to atz degradation in solar clo2 process competition kinetics using ba and nb as the probe compounds were performed ba reacts rapidly with oh and cl with second order reaction rate constants of 5 9 109 and 1 8 1010 m 1s 1 respectively which were much higher than that with clo and cl2 with second order reaction rate constants both 107 m 1s 1 while nb only reacts with oh with a second order reaction rate constant of 3 9 109 m 1s 1 chen et al 2021 lei et al 2019 supplementary experiments also verified that ba and nb were resistant to solar irradiation and clo2 oxidation under the same experimental conditions fig s7 as shown in fig 2 a the kobs of nb ba and atz in solar clo2 process were determined to be 6 54 10 3 min 1 2 03 10 2 min 1 and 9 71 10 3 min 1 respectively based on the kinetics eqs 8 9 the steady state concentrations of oh oh exp and cl cl exp could be calculated to be 2 79 10 14 m and 9 64 10 15 m the second order reaction rate constants of atz with oh and cl were 3 0 109 m 1s 1 and 6 87 109 m 1s 1 respectively acero et al 2000 kong et al 2020 using the calculated steady state concentrations to model the pseudo first order reaction rate constant kobs atz of atz degradation the kobs atz can be determined to be 9 00 10 3 min 1 eq 10 this was in good agreement with the kobs atz 9 71 10 3 min 1 obtained from atz degradation kinetics k obs atz k obs atz k obs atz 7 3 further evidencing the dominant role of oh and cl in degrading atz in solar clo2 process as a result oh and cl produced in solar clo2 process contribute to 55 9 and 44 1 of the atz degradation respectively fig 2b 1 c l o 2 c l o o 3 p 2 c l o 2 c l o 2 3 o 3 p o 2 o 3 4 c l o h 2 o h o c l h c l o 2 5 c l c l c l 2 6 c l o h c l o h 7 c l o h o h c l 8 k o b s n b k o h n b o h

degradation of atz in solar clo2 process was studied as shown in fig 3 a the degradation efficiency of atz rapidly increased from 16 3 to 100 after reaction for 30 min as clo2 dose increased from 5 0 to 100 0 μm similar increasing was also observed for the clo2 consumption with the increasing clo2 dose during the 30 min reaction time fig s8a using the competition kinetics eqs 8 10 as shown in fig s8b the oh exp and cl exp increased from 8 14 10 15 m and 3 24 10 15 m to 7 43 10 14 m and 2 36 10 14 m respectively when clo2 dose increased from 5 0 to 100 0 μm reaction ph generally plays a significant role in the degradation of contaminants during aops phosphate buffer was used in solar clo2 process to maintain the reaction ph to the designed values i e 3 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 11 0 phosphate has three ionization constants pka1 2 1 pka2 7 2 and pka3 12 3 in aqueous solution with phosphate species distribution versus ph shown in fig s9a meaning that h2po4 dominated at acidic conditions while hpo4 2 increased with increasing ph it was reported that hpo4 2 reacted with oh and cl with second order reaction rate constants of 1 5 105 and 104 m 1s 1 while h2po4 reacted with oh and cl with second order reaction rate constants of 2 0 104 and 8 68 102 m 1s 1 respectively maruthamuthu and neta 1978 peng et al 2022 assuming the main phosphate species were hpo4 2 and h2po4 at concentration of 2 mm respectively the percentage of phosphate competing for oh and cl with atz can be calculated according to eq 11 11 p k r s s k r a t z a t z k r s s where k r s represents the reaction rate constants between oh or cl and phosphate species s represents the concentration of phosphate species as a result the presence of hpo4 2 only scavenged 9 1 of oh and 0 3 of cl respectively similarly 2 mm of h2po4 also just has a maximum scavenging rate of 1 3 and 0 1 towards oh and cl respectively this suggested that 2 mm phosphate as the buffer in solar clo2 process has negligible effect on the scavenging of oh and cl as well as the degradation of atz hence the degradation of atz in solar clo2 process was investigated at the ph range of 3 0 11 0 using 2 mm phosphate as a buffer as shown in fig 3b the degradation efficiency of atz slightly decreased from 95 6 to 86 3 with ph increased from 3 0 to 7 0 and then it obviously decreased to 61 5 when ph was further increased to 11 0 the clo2 consumption showed negligible change during the ph range from 3 0 to 11 0 fig s9b suggesting the little ph dependence of clo2 photodissociation this result was also supported by the negligible change on the total amount of oh exp and cl exp produced via clo2 activation by solar irradiation under the same experimental conditions fig s9c interestingly the oh exp increased from 1 42 10 14 m to 3 59 10 14 m while the cl exp significantly decreased from 2 49 10 14 m to 4 56 10 16 m when ph was increased from 3 0 to 11 0 with the increasing ph oh level was increased so as to enhance the conversion of cl to oh eqs 6 7 because cl reacts rapidly with oh to form cloh precursor of oh with a second order reaction rate constant of 1 8 1010 m 1s 1 which is much higher than that with h2o with a second order reaction rate constant of 4 5 103 m 1s 1 chuang et al 2022 as a result the modeled kobs atz decreased from 1 28 10 2 min 1 to 6 65 10 3 min 1 with the increasing ph from 3 0 to 11 0 the species distribution of atz as a function of ph was shown in fig s9d it revealed that atz featuring with an ionization constant pka of 1 7 was in its negative ions 100 in the range of ph from 3 0 11 0 zheng et al 2019 meaning that the electrostatic repulsion between atz ions and cl oh was negligible accordingly with the increasing ph the conversion of cl to oh was responsible for the depletion of the atz degradation efficiency in solar clo2 process 3 4 impact of hco3 cl ha and real water matrix fig 4 a showed the effect of hco3 co3 2 on the degradation of atz in solar clo2 process the degradation efficiency of atz significantly decreased with the increasing concentration of hco3 co3 2 from 0 to 2 0 mm due to the pka of 6 37 hco3 would be the major species of bicarbonate at the condition of ph 7 0 0 2 fig s10a showed that 0 2 0 mm of hco3 has little effect on the clo2 consumption in solar clo2 process indicating that hco3 can not consume clo2 as reported oh and cl can be scavenged by hco3 to form co3 with second order reaction rate constants of 8 5 106 and 2 2 108 m 1s 1 respectively eqs 12 13 peng et al 2022 meaning that 22 1 to 85 0 of oh and 76 2 to 98 5 of cl should be consumed when the concentration of hco3 was increased from 0 1 to 2 0 mm furthermore competition kinetics were also conducted to evaluate the effect of hco3 on the variation of oh exp and cl exp as detailed in text s2 the oh exp and cl exp decreased from 2 79 10 14 m and 9 64 10 15 m to 9 25 10 15 m and 1 72 10 16 m respectively with hco3 addition increasing from 0 to 2 0 mm fig s10b the formed co3 only degrade atz with a second order reaction rate constant of 4 0 106 m 1s 1 kong et al 2020 which is much slower than that of oh and cl therefore the inhibition of atz degradation in solar clo2 process in the presence of hco3 was mainly due to the scavenging of oh and cl by hco3 12 c l h c o 3 c o 3 c l h 13 o h h c o 3 c o 3 h 2 o fig 4b showed the effect of cl in the concentration range of 0 2 0 mm on the degradation of atz in solar clo2 process the degradation of atz significantly retarded in the presence of 0 5 2 0 mm cl the addition of cl in the concentration range of 0 5 to 2 0 mm had little effect on the consumption of clo2 fig s11a cl could scavenge oh and cl with second order reaction rate constants of 4 3 109 and 6 5 109 m 1s 1 respectively eqs 5 14 15 lee et al 2020 meaning that oh exp and cl exp should be greatly reduced given a much higher i e 500 2000 times concentration of cl than the target atz in solar clo2 process this was also supported by the competition kinetics showing that oh exp and cl exp decreased from 2 79 10 14 m and 9 64 10 15 m to 6 84 10 16 m and 1 94 10 16 m respectively with the addition of cl increased from 0 to 2 0 mm detailed in text s2 and fig s11b the retarded atz degradation in the presence of cl might be attributed to the conversion of oh and cl to cl2 14 o h c l c l o h 15 c l o h h c l h 2 o ha is ubiquitous in natural water and drinking water the effect of ha 0 3 mg l on the degradation of atz in solar clo2 process was investigated as shown in fig 4c the degradation efficiency of atz rapidly decreased from 86 3 to 29 4 in solar clo2 process as the concentration of ha increased from 0 to 3 mg l the presence of ha accelerated clo2 consumption fig s12a however the oh exp and cl exp decreased from 2 79 10 14 m and 9 64 10 15 m to 5 56 10 16 m and 1 43 10 16 m respectively with the initial concentration of ha increased from 0 to 2 0 mm detailed in text s2 and fig s12b this may be due to that ha consumes clo2 remarkably fig s12c resulting in less clo2 available for activation by solar irradiation and therefore decreasing the oh exp and cl exp besides ha as a common scavenger of reactive species can scavenge oh and cl with second order reaction rate constants of 1 4 104 and 1 3 104 l mg c 1s 1 chen et al 2023 kong et al 2016 respectively hence depress the atz degradation in solar clo2 process accordingly the consumption of clo2 oh and cl by ha was the dominant reason for the retarded atz degradation in solar clo2 process the effect of real water matrices including yangtze river water and taihu lake water i e two typical source waters in china on the degradation of atz in solar clo2 process was evaluated fig 4d revealed that the degradation efficiency of atz decreased in the two real water matrices with taihu lake water exhibit a higher inhibition rate than yangtze river water comparatively taihu lake water featured a higher content of natural organic matter nom and alkalinity while yangtze river water had a higher concentration of cl table s1 therefore it could be inferred that hco3 cl and nom in real waters may integrally contribute to the decreased atz degradation efficiency in solar clo2 process because 1 the clo2 was competitively consumed by nom in both taihu lake water and yangtze river water fig s13a 2 the oh exp and cl exp was 2 79 10 14 m and 9 64 10 15 m in deionized water while they reduced to a maximum of 1 21 10 14 m and 3 14 10 15 m in taihu lake water and a maximum of 1 56 10 14 m and 3 86 10 15 m in yangtze river water respectively detailed in text s2 and fig s13b 3 5 degradation pathways and toxic changes of atz in solar clo2 process degradation intermediates of atz in solar clo2 process were identified using uplc ms ms six degradation intermediates namely hydroxyatrazine hatz p197 deisopropylatrazine dia p173 deethylatrazine dea p187 deisopropylhydroxyatrazine diha p155 deethyldeisopropylatrazine dedia p145 and deethyldeisopropylhydroxyatrazine deiha p127 were tentatively identified according to the total ion chromatogram and chromatogram fragments shown in fig s14 s21 the structure information of the tentatively confirmed degradation intermediates was provided in table s4 the condensed fukui function cff calculation based on dmol3 ab initio code has been successfully applied to predict the reactive site of a compound that attacked by radicals detailed in text s3 chen et al 2023 according to the cff atoms in a certain molecule with larger cff values f 0 are supposed to be more reactive to radical attack li et al 2021 by integrating the identified structures of atz and its degradation intermediates and the cff calculation the possible three stage degradation pathways of atz in solar clo2 process were proposed in fig 5 a as shown in fig s22 the cff values of 7cl 0 0255 8 n 0 0040 9c 0 0015 12 n 0 0090 and 13c 0 0020 were larger than that of other atoms on atz suggesting that atz 7cl atz 8 n atz 9c atz 12 n and atz 13c were the primary reactive sites therefore in stage i the hydroxy substitution reaction occurred at atz 7cl was responsible for the formation of hatz radical attack at cn bond between atz 8 n and atz 9c as well as atz 12 n and atz 13c induced dealkylation that generated dia and dea respectively in stage ii diha might be formed from two ways 1 cn bond cleavage between hatz 8 n and hatz 9c with high cff values of 0 1280 and 0 1215 respectively fig s23 2 hydroxylation of dia 7cl because of the high reactive activity of dia 7cl with a high cff value of 0 2750 fig s24 the detected dedia would be explained by the dealkylation of dea since cff values of dea 8 n and dea 9c were higher than that of other atoms on dea fig s25 in stage iii deiha was formed from either diha via dealkylation and or dedia via hydroxy substitution which was also supported by the cff calculation results displayed in fig s26 and s27 the three stage degradation pathways of atz in solar clo2 process were further confirmed by the time evolution of the degradation intermediates as shown in fig s28 the peak area of hatz dia and dea first increased to a maximum at 5 min then they gradually decreased with the production of diha and dedia finally deiha was gradually accumulated to a concentration of 0 274 um at the reaction time of 30 min with a transformation rate of 27 4 indicating that deiha was the most major product after atz degradation for 30 min in solar clo2 process quantitative structure activity relationship qsar coupling with ecosar software was employed to assess the acute and chronic toxic of atz and its six degradation intermediates towards fish daphnid and green algae chen et al 2020 li et al 2022 as shown in fig 5b and table s5 atz was harmful towards fish daphnid and green algae in term of acute toxicity and was toxic regards to chronic toxicity after solar clo2 degradation the six degradation intermediates exhibited lower toxic toward fish daphnid and green algae than the parent atz moreover the acute and chronic toxicity showed progressively decreasing trend with the stepwise degradation of atz especially the final major degradation intermediate deiha was even not harmful towards fish daphnid and green algae suggesting that solar clo2 process could effectively degrade and simultaneously detoxify atz 3 6 effect of solar clo2 pretreatment on the formation of dbps aops pretreatment of micro contaminants and nom generally has a significant effect on the formation of dbps during following disinfection step chen et al 2022 chen et al 2023 herein clo2 clo3 and 11 common cx3r type dbps including 5 carbonaceous dbps c dbps i e one thms tcm two haas dcaa and tcaa two hals dcal and tcal and 6 nitrogenous dbps n dbps i e two hans dcan and tcan two hacams dcacam and tcacam and two hnms dcnm and tcnm were selected to comprehensively evaluate the effect of solar clo2 treatment on the formation of dbps during the post chlorination as shown in fig 6 a no clo2 clo3 and cx3r type dbps was formed from chlorination of atz at a concentration of 1 um when solar clo2 was introduced as a pretreatment process clo3 0 51 mg l and clo2 0 34 mg l were detected while still no cx3r type dbps was formed after chlorination of the treated atz solution indicating that clo3 and clo2 were mainly formed from the activation of clo2 chlorination of atz in the presence of 1 mg l ha to simulate the coexisting micro contaminant and nom in real water could generate cx3r type dbps with concentrations of 0 9 to 16 7 ug l fig 6b it was worth noting that the formation of cx3r type dbps from chlorination of ha without the addition of atz fig 6c was comparable to that in the presence of atz indicating the dominant role of ha as a precursor in the formation of cx3r type dbps during chlorination of atz in ha containing water compared with solely chlorination of ha solar clo2 pretreatment formed clo3 and clo2 with concentrations of 0 64 and 0 57 mg l respectively while it significantly reduced the formation of cx3r type dbps by 57 2 fig 6c total organic chlorine tocl tests also showed that applying solar clo2 as a pretreatment of ha containing water reduced the formation of tocl by 52 4 during chlorination fig s29 further suggesting that solar clo2 process has good control efficiency towards the formation of dbps from ha however the control efficiency towards the formation of cx3r type dbps in solar clo2 pretreatment of ha in the presence of atz fig 6b significantly decreased from 57 2 to 32 8 compared to the case without atz the above results demonstrated that the presence of atz in solar clo2 treatment of ha possibly increased the precursors of cx3r type dbps to further investigate the effect of atz degradation in ha containing water during solar clo2 pretreatment on the formation of cx3r type dbps some control experiments were conducted firstly dosing atz to the solar clo2 treated ha solution had little effect on the formation of cx3r type dbps suggesting that atz played negligible role in the increase of cx3r type dbp precursors fig 6d then selecting the major degradation products e g deiha of atz as a reference compound we found that the addition of deiha into the solar clo2 treated ha solution greatly enhanced the formation of cx3r type dbps by 36 5 and especially the six n dbps by 69 4 note that solely chlorination of deiha did not form any cx3r type dbps appreciably demonstrating that the degradation products of atz e g deiha might be incorporated into ha and therefore provided more precursors for cx3r type dbps especially for n dbps as a potential explanation deiha on which all the c and n atoms featured larger cff values fig 6e compared with atz was considered very reactive to be incorporated into ha for instance the high cff values of 2n 0 0755 4n 0 0740 6n 0 0745 8n 0 0810 and 9n 0 0790 on deiha may facilitate the direct incorporation of deiha and ha to provide the nitrogen for the formation of n dbps 3 7 comparison of acute toxicity and risk control strategy the acute toxicity of nine solutions i e i deionized water as blank control ii atz and ha solution iii chlorinated atz solution iv chlorinated ha solution v chlorinated atz and ha solution vi solar clo2 pretreatment followed by chlorinated atz solution vii solar clo2 pretreatment followed by chlorinated ha solution viii solar clo2 pretreatment followed by chlorinated atz and ha solution and ix solar clo2 pretreatment followed by chloraminated atz and ha solution was compared by recording the behavior of zebrafish larvae after 96 h exposure tests as shown in fig 7 a compared to the deionized water the trajectories of zebrafish larvae had little change in solutions ii iii and vi this is because 1 atz at low concentration and short exposure time has negligible acute toxicity to zebrafish larvae 2 chlorination of atz at a concentration of 1 0 um with or without solar clo2 pretreatment can not form toxic dbps as described in text 3 7 the trajectories of zebrafish larvae in solutions iv v vii viii and ix became sparse suggesting the inhibited activity of zebrafish larvae induced by the formed dbps besides the swimming distance and speed of zebrafish larvae were also recorded in fig 7b and c which shown similar results with the behavioral trajectory the swimming distance and speed of zebrafish larvae increased in solution vii compared with solution iv while that became lower in solution viii than solution vii this may be due to solar clo2 pretreatment efficiently reduced the formation of dbps from chlorination of ha while the formation of dbps from solar clo2 pretreatment followed by chlorination of ha was enhanced in the presence of atz compared with that without atz it was worth noting that the behavioral trajectory swimming distance and speed of zebrafish larvae in solution ix were more active than that in solution viii motivated by this observation the formation of dbps from chlorination and chloramination of atz and ha solution downstream the solar clo2 pretreatment was further measured and compared as shown in fig s30 for solar clo2 pretreated atz and ha solution the concentrations of clo2 and clo3 were comparable during the following chlorination and chloramination however chloramination slightly promoted the formation of n dbps by 14 4 while obviously reduced the formation of c dbps by 39 2 compared with chlorination this could be explained by that chlorine has a much higher oxidation ability than chloramine to oxidize organic matters and therefore forming more dbps zhang et al 2019a ding et al 2019 although chlorine has a stronger oxidative ability chloramine may be a source of nitrogen to form n dbps chu et al 2016b which could be the reason for the higher amount of n dbps observed during chloramination than chlorination the shift of species and amounts in the formation of cx3r type dbps during chloramination compared with chlorination downstream the solar clo2 pretreatment was the reason for the lowered toxicity the results were also consistent with the dbp associated toxicity determined using cytotoxicity index cti method detailed in text s4 and results shown in fig 7d chen et al 2022 ding et al 2019 which showed that the cti of dbps formed from chloramination was lower than that of dbps formed from chlorination by a percent of 29 4 this finding illustrated that using chloramine instead of chlorine as the disinfectant may be an effective strategy to reduce the formation of dbps and simultaneously alleviate the toxicity when solar clo2 process was applied to degrade atz in real nom containing waters 4 conclusions this study elucidated the degradation of atz in solar clo2 process and the strategies for controlling dbps during the subsequent disinfection step results revealed that oh and cl were the dominant radicals that responsible for the efficient degradation of atz in solar clo2 process increasing ph could induce the conversion of cl to oh hence retard the atz degradation in solar clo2 process hco3 cl and ha mainly induced depletion of oh and cl and therefore decreased the degradation efficiency of atz six degradation intermediates were tentatively identified and the three stage degradation pathway as well as the stepwise detoxification of atz were confirmed selecting atz and ha as a component to simulate real waters the presence of atz during solar clo2 pretreatment of ha dramatically decreased the control efficiency of dbps during the following chlorination this is because the major degradation intermediate e g deiha of atz could incorporate into ha and enhance the formation of dbps however using chloramine as an alternative disinfectant of chlorine downstream the solar clo2 pretreatment of atz and ha could reduce the formation of total dbps as well as the acute toxicity declaration of competing interest we declare that
