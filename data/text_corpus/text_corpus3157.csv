15785,despite increasing regulatory efforts to reduce production of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas continued human and ecological exposure to pfas has led to concerns about historical releases municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps provide important conduits between waste sources and the environment we present a meta analysis of results reported in 44 peer reviewed publications that include 460 influent and 528 effluent samples collected from 21 countries for which some or all of five perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas and three perfluorinated sulfonic acids pfsas were measured our meta analysis revealed global patterns and trends that to our knowledge have not been reported elsewhere regression analyses of samples collected from 2004 to 2020 quantified the temporal trends of global wastewater effluent concentrations of each of the pfas and the corresponding mean concentration for each country although legacy compounds perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos have been reported with the highest measured concentrations their global temporal trends are lowest of all pfas considered concentrations of most pfas analyzed in wastewater in the united states have not changed significantly with time whereas reported pfas concentrations in wastewater effluent from china have increased from 11 to 37 per year in addition our results show significant positive correlations between previous wastewater effluent concentrations of individual pfas and the gross domestic product per capita of each country our analysis of this global data set also confirmed conclusions from previous studies on smaller data sets i none of the pfas studied are effectively removed by conventional treatment processes ii effluents from treatment plants that include a significant industrial component to their influent tend to have higher pfas concentrations and iii the few studies that measured both aqueous concentrations and concentrations adsorbed to suspended particulate matter spm indicate that pfas adsorbed to spm can contribute significantly to the total pfas load keywords pfas wastewater historical pacs 0000 1111 msc 0000 1111 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a widespread family of over 4000 man made chemicals composed of a carbon fluorine tail and polar functional group buck et al 2021 nakayama et al 2019 perfluoroalkyl acids can have different c f chain lengths and depending on their functional groups can be categorized as either perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids c n f 2 n 1 cooh pfcas or perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids c n f 2 n 1 so 3 h pfsas due to their hydrophobic and amphiphilic chemical structure pfas are highly effective surfactants they have been manufactured since the 1950s and are used in applications ranging from industrial processes e g metal plating and firefighting to common domestic and commercial products e g waterproof clothing and food packaging widespread use of pfas has led to release into the environment at all stages of their life cycle including manufacture application and disposal dasu et al 2022 significant sources of pfas in the environment include application of aqueous film forming foam afff used for firefighting moody et al 2003 atmospheric emissions from industrial processes schroeder et al 2021 leaching from landfills lang et al 2017 perkola and sainio 2013 and discharge of treated wastewater coggan et al 2019 hu et al 2016 sinclair and kannan 2006 due to their solubility in water pfas are mobile in the environment and have been detected in surface water kunacheva et al 2012 podder et al 2021 groundwater shin et al 2011 sediments higgins and luthy 2006 mussabek et al 2019 and even snow in polar regions zhao et al 2012 as a result pfas have been increasingly detected in drinking water supplies globally domingo and nadal 2019 hu et al 2016 leading to increased concerns over human exposure consumption of water containing long chained pfas leads to bio accumulation bartell et al 2010 and as a result serum measurements of most people in industrialized countries indicate the presence of pfas steenland et al 2010 historical exposure of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos the two most well studied pfas has been linked to decreased kidney function c8 science panel 2012 kataria et al 2015 watkins et al 2013 non hodgkin lymphoma testicular kidney prostate and ovarian cancers vieira et al 2013 and increased risk of infertility for women fei et al 2009 the growing list of health risks of pfoa and pfos has led to voluntary phase out of their production in 2000 and 2002 in the united states respectively usepa 2002 more recently these concerns led to international recognition through listing in the stockholm convention of persistent organic pollutants annex a pfos in 2019 and annex b pfoa in 2009 respectively brennan et al 2021 stockholm convention 2019 however shorter chained alternatives c 6 which are suspected to have negative health effects similar to pfoa and pfos wang et al 2017 remain under review by regulating bodies although widespread concern for human health has increased research interest the effect of restrictions and regulations on the global circulation of pfas is still not well understood combining sample results from the scientific literature provides a means for testing the viability of previously observed patterns at larger scales and for identifying new patterns prevedouros et al 2006 reviewed pfca sources fate and transport and estimated the total global emissions and mass inventories of pfcas whereas podder et al 2021 reviewed the occurrence of pfas in surface water and through analysis of the combined data showed spatio temporal variability of three pfcas and two pfsas in surface waters across different continents they suggest that the inclusion of pfos in the stockholm list of persistent organic pollutants has impacted global surface water concentrations however acknowledge a need for further validation and studies considering the more recent inclusion of pfoa understanding and managing the release of pfas in the global environment requires more detailed analyses of direct and indirect sources and release to the environment we focus here on wastewater treatment plants wwtps which are ubiquitous throughout industrialized countries and provide a critical link between producers and users of pfas containing products and the environment becker et al 2008 bossi et al 2008 campo et al 2014 concentrations of pfas in waste streams are influenced by the regional population size gallen et al 2018 consumption patterns industrial applications clara et al 2008 wastewater source type coggan et al 2019 shivakoti et al 2010 yu et al 2009 and country shigei et al 2020 due to the chemical thermal and biological stability imparted by their c f bonds pfas are not effectively removed by conventional wwtp processes and are commonly detected in both wwtp influent and effluent ahrens et al 2009 lenka et al 2021 sinclair and kannan 2006 yu et al 2009 furthermore polyfluoroalkyl precursors such as fluorotelomer alcohols and perfluorooctane sulfonamides can degrade to pfcas and pfsas during secondary wastewater treatment resulting in measured concentrations of pfcas and pfsas increasing from influent to effluent arvaniti et al 2012 coggan et al 2019 guerra et al 2014 sinclair and kannan 2006 xiao et al 2012 yu et al 2009 the main mechanism of removal of pfas in conventional wwtps is adsorption to sludge which increases with chain length and is stronger for pfsas than pfcas arvaniti et al 2012 zareitalabad et al 2013 pfas have also been shown to adsorb to suspended particulate matter spm although current measurement of this partitioning in wastewater is limited elmoznino et al 2018 shivakoti et al 2010 vierke et al 2013 yu et al 2009 pfas concentrations in wastewater vary widely reflecting the diversity of sources waste streams with higher industrial contributions tend to have higher concentrations of pfas castiglioni et al 2015 clara et al 2008 coggan et al 2019 dauchy et al 2017 sinclair and kannan 2006 xiao et al 2012 however pfas sources vary in industrial wastewater sources metal plating textile paper etc and in municipal wastewater sources food packaging impregnation agents cleansers etc clara et al 2008 kunacheva et al 2011 vo et al 2020 furthermore the pfas load of similar products and industries can vary by country vo et al 2020 or region positive correlations between pfas concentrations and the gross domestic product gdp of cities across china suggest a connection between economic activity and pfas in wastewater wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 similarly shigei et al 2020 attributed low concentrations of pfas measured in wastewater from jordan to lower access to pfas containing products however to our knowledge there have been no efforts to explore this connection between socioeconomic conditions and pfas concentrations in waste streams at the global scale restrictions of pfoa and pfos production have led to shifts in the application of pfas over time wang et al 2013 despite phase out by major producers pfoa pfos and their precursors are still commonly detected in industrial and municipal wastewater coggan et al 2019 dauchy et al 2017 houtz et al 2016 a monitoring campaign of two australian wwtps was conducted by nguyen et al 2019 between 2014 and 2017 to investigate temporal trends of pfas in wwtp influent they found that over time per capita mass loads increased for most pfcas and decreased for most pfsas in addition coggan et al 2019 and houtz et al 2016 compared measurements of pfas from their sampling campaign of national australian wwtps in 2017 and regional california wwtps in 2014 respectively to similar campaigns conducted four to five years prior gallen et al 2018 klosterhaus et al 2013 in contrast to nguyen et al 2019 they found increases in short chained pfcas concentrations but no significant changes for pfoa or pfos more recently gallen et al 2022 completed a 10 year study of wastewater influent to a single municipal wwtp to provide an improved longer term analysis of temporal trends they found decreasing concentrations of most pfas studied including pfoa and pfos but observed shifts in the distribution of pfas toward shorter chained compounds a recent meta analysis from the united states of wastewater with no stated industrial sources indicated that only pfoa from the 8 pfas analyzed showed a decreasing trend thompson et al 2022 we compiled data reported in the scientific literature from 2004 to 2020 and performed a meta analysis to quantify global patterns and trends of pfas measured in wastewater our analysis includes measured concentrations of 5 pfcas perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa c 6 perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa c 7 pfoa c 8 perfluorononanoic acid pfna c 9 and perfluorodecanoic acid pfda c 10 and 3 pfsas perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs c 4 perfluorohexanesulfonic acid pfhxs c 6 and pfos c 8 from hundreds of wwtps we evaluated differences in pfas particulate phase concentrations pfas removal efficiencies and wastewater sources to quantify these properties at the global scale from this analysis of published data we developed models to quantify international temporal trends of pfas concentrations in waste streams and associated variability by country lastly we used our model results to evaluate the connection between the economic output of each country and pfas concentrations in its wastewater 2 methods 2 1 overview of data used in this study compiling data for analysis of pfas in wastewater involved reviewing related literature and defining criteria for inclusion of reported results in our analyses we describe this process in more detail in the remainder of this section 2 1 1 data collection we searched for data published in peer reviewed literature by searching keywords such as pfas perfluoroalkyl perfluorinated wastewater and wwtp using web of science and google scholar in our review of related literature we screened studies based on wastewater source and treatment type we collected publications that reported data from wwtps with municipal or mixed municipal and industrial wastewater sources and chose not to include publications with measurements from only industrial wastewater as the pfas loads of different industrial wastewater sources can vary significantly depending on the specific industry clara et al 2008 dauchy et al 2017 vo et al 2020 and analyzing such variability is beyond the scope of this paper the portion of the influent wastewater generated by industrial sources is included when reported in table s1 wwtps can use a wide array of treatment methods we included papers that studied conventional wastewater treatment plants with secondary biological treatment such as conventional activated sludge anaerobic anoxic oxic and sequencing batch reactor systems though advanced treatment systems such as reverse osmosis and anion exchange resin can remove pfas these methods are not widely used for wastewater treatment so we did not include them in our study table 1 summarizes the papers included in our analyses 2 1 2 data processing we collected influent and effluent concentrations of five pfcas pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfna pfda and three pfsas pfbs pfhxs pfos the entire data set is included in table s1 we selected these 8 pfas because they represent a diverse mix of chain lengths and their concentrations were measured in a wide range of studies table 1 summarizes which pfas were measured in each of the selected studies the most commonly reported pfas were pfoa and pfos in addition effluent was measured for pfas more frequently than influent which may be due to complications of analyzing untreated wastewater lenka et al 2021 different indicators may be used to assess the environmental impact of pfas in wwtp effluent the daily pfas mass load from a treatment plant provides a measure of the contribution of a given wwtp to the local environment however it is difficult to compare different wwtps which may differ significantly in the numbers of people served or volumes of wastewater treated thus normalizing mass load by the number of people served or volume of water treated provides metrics that may be more meaningfully compared across wwtps however we note that for samples where the size of the population served was available concentration is strongly correlated with mass load per capita per day fig s1 there are many reasons for studying and measuring pfas in conventional wwtps and this leads to disparate reporting of information in the published literature when provided we obtained the operating flow rate served population wastewater source type and measurement date of each wwtp although other details of wwtp conditions such as temperature guerra et al 2014 ph tavasoli 2020 solid retention time srt gallen et al 2018 guerra et al 2014 kibambe et al 2020 yu et al 2009 hydraulic retention time hrt guerra et al 2014 and total suspended solids shivakoti et al 2010 were reported in detail by some authors they were not reported in the majority of the included papers although we could not determine details of each individual wwtp we determined estimates of overall variability in pfas removal efficiencies from the collection of reported concentrations most studies only measured aqueous phase pfas concentrations and relatively few measured pfas adsorbed to suspended particulate matter spm we collected available measurements of pfas adsorbed to spm in wastewater from the few studies that reported them elmoznino et al 2018 shivakoti et al 2010 vierke et al 2013 yu et al 2009 concentrations of pfas adsorbed to spm were reported as mass per sampled water volume ng l shivakoti et al 2010 vierke et al 2013 mass loads mg day elmoznino et al 2018 yu et al 2009 and mass ratios ng g becker et al 2008 elmoznino et al 2018 vierke et al 2013 we used information provided on the total suspended solids or flow rate to convert all concentrations to mass adsorbed to spm per volume of wastewater ng l table s3 we neglected studies that did not include sufficient details to quantify mass adsorbed to spm per volume of wastewater arvaniti et al 2012 becker et al 2008 methods for analyses sample preparation extraction and measurement of pfas are still evolving and all studies considered here precede any standardized protocol for measurement of pfas in wastewater usepa 2019 2021 the lack of standardized methods leads to variability in measurement techniques choices of solvents and reagents container materials and preservation methods lenka et al 2021 these differences influence measurement sensitivity and can lead to losses from sorption to laboratory materials lath et al 2019 method detection limits vary between pfas and sample and ranged from 0 01 ng l shivakoti et al 2010 to 10 ng l sinclair and kannan 2006 to avoid systematically excluding low concentrations from our analyses we assigned measurements below the limit of detection l o d a concentration of half the lod c 0 5 l o d we similarly assigned concentrations below the limit of quantitation l o q or blank b l a n k as half the loq or blank concentration 95 of the non quantified measurements had a reported limit below 5 ng l 2 1 3 additional data considerations in addition to differences in measurement techniques sampling approaches vary between studies wastewater can be collected as grab samples or as flow or time proportionate composite samples grab samples represent snapshots in time and may not reflect short term fluctuations that occur in wwtps influent and effluent grab samples could be collected from different parcels of water if the hrt of a wwtp is not appropriately incorporated to the timing of sampling however most authors do not report details of how and when grab samples were collected furthermore diurnal variability of pfas concentrations may vary by wwtp but this has not been measured in most papers presenting pfas concentrations in wastewater one exception was a study from south korea that measured hourly samples from municipal wwtps and showed variations of less than 12 during a 24 h period joo et al 2021 although grab samples were the more common method some studies took flow or time proportionate composite samples which average out hour to hour changes in wastewater castiglioni et al 2015 clara et al 2008 coggan et al 2019 elmoznino et al 2018 nguyen et al 2019 pan et al 2011 perkola and sainio 2013 schultz et al 2006 sinclair and kannan 2006 and thus better represent daily average concentrations the sampling method for each study is shown in table 1 2 2 probabilistic principal component analysis we analyzed correlations between the pfas compounds to determine if there was any linear dependence or opportunity for dimensional reduction principal component analysis pca linearly combines observed interrelated variables to a set of orthogonal variables the subset of the orthogonal variables that preserve the most important features of the data are considered the principal components pcs ideally only a few pcs are required to describe the majority of the variance within the data thus pca simplifies pattern recognition across our collection of pfas measurements because not all eight pfas were analyzed in each study table 1 we used probabilistic pca an extended form of pca that solves for principal components pcs of sparse data sets instead of performing a linear transformation of observed variables probabilistic pca uses an iterative expectation maximization algorithm to solve for pcs and any missing data which are both treated as latent variables we performed the probabilistic pca on the z scores of log effluent pfas concentrations using the ppca function in matlab 2021 we calculated the z scores i e transformed to zero mean unit standard deviation for each pfas compound in the data set to ensure uniform relative weight of each compound in the analysis 2 3 regression analysis we performed standard linear regressions and linear mixed effect lme regressions on log c eff with respect to sample collection date for each pfas each regression was performed individually for each pfas therefore only studies that analyzed the relevant pfas were included in each regression the standard linear model weighs all observations equally and does not distinguish between geographical variability and temporal variability many of the observations took place within a single year for a given country table 1 due to the limited data we were unable to perform an individual linear regression for each country countries with more observations such as the united states could contribute disproportionately to the regression results and bias the global expected concentrations lme models are an extension of the standard linear model that determine shared behavior of different groups while also allowing for variance across groups as a result lme models are less susceptible to bias introduced by disproportionate reporting from different groups here we group the available data by country because countries generally represent regions in which regulations governing production and use of pfas are uniform in some cases there may be local variability in these regulations but the availability of data does not support a more detailed regional analysis we note that all countries in our data set include samples from at least 4 wwtps with the exception of 5 countries kenya 3 taiwan 3 singapore 2 mexico 1 and uganda 1 we used the fitlme function from matlab 2021 to fit a lme model lme1 with fixed slope m and intercept that varied by country to determine the relationship between sample date t and measured pfas concentrations in wastewater effluent c eff 1 log c eff m t b z b e where b n 0 σ b 2 e n 0 σ e 2 where b is the mean intercept and b is a one dimensional vector length n c number of countries with variance σ b 2 that quantifies the offset of the intercept for each country z is a n o b s n c design matrix of ones and zeros that indicates the country of each observation e is a zero mean one dimensional vector length n o b s of model residuals with variance σ e 2 b b then quantifies the mean estimated log concentration of wastewater effluent measured in 2012 mean measurement year of global data set for each country because different countries are at different stages of their use and regulation of pfas it is possible they do not all follow the global average trend we performed a second lme regression lme2 on a subset of the data that included only observations from countries us italy australia south korea and china that had at least 30 observations n 30 across a minimum of three years to test the variability in international trends this secondary model estimates deviations from both the mean intercept b and slope m for each of the five countries and can be expressed as follows 2 log c eff m z m t b z b e where b n 0 σ b 2 m n 0 σ m 2 e n 0 σ e 2 where the variance of m is σ m 2 lastly we tested correlations between the average gdp per capita of different countries and their relative concentrations of pfas in their wwtp effluent we chose to normalize the total gdp of each country by its population to provide a global and standard comparison between average income of individuals and relative application or consumption of pfas although gdp per capita varies regionally within a country the variability across different countries considered in this analysis is significantly larger than regional differences within countries kummu et al 2018 3 results 3 1 liquid particulate partitioning fig 1 compares concentrations of pfas dissolved in the aqueous phase c liq to concentrations of pfas adsorbed to spm c spm at different stages of treatment from 30 wwtps in five different countries elmoznino et al 2018 shivakoti et al 2010 vierke et al 2013 yu et al 2009 the filled circles represent effluent samples and the open symbols are samples taken from influent and intermediate treatment stages in general higher c spm corresponds with higher c liq measured c spm of each pfas are mostly between 0 01 c liq and 1 c liq short chained pfsas pfbs and pfhxs were detected on spm in fewer samples likely due to their lower hydrophobic interaction and adsorption capacity gagliano et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 only shivakoti et al 2010 measured all eight pfas adsorbed to spm in effluent samples from 10 wwtps and marked by cyan circles in fig 1 whereas elmoznino et al 2018 detected all pfas excluding pfhxa pfhpa and pfbs adsorbed to spm from 9 different wwtps and marked by violet circles in fig 1 these effluent observations were closely grouped with the observations from samples collected before and during treatment all pfas had at least one effluent measurement where the c spm was greater than 0 8 c liq these observations demonstrate that pfas adsorbed to spm can contribute significantly to total pfas discharged from wwtps as a result monitoring studies that do not measure pfas in the particulate phase may significantly underestimate the total pfas discharge to the environment 3 2 influent versus effluent concentrations to evaluate the effect of conventional wwtp processes on pfas concentrations we plotted log effluent concentrations log c eff versus log influent concentrations log c inf for all observations for which pfas were detected in both influent and effluent fig 2 for each pfas the observations generally cluster around the black line representing log c eff log c inf in addition observations of pfcas top row are more frequently located in the yellow region indicating log c eff log c inf and observations of pfsas bottom row are more frequently located in the blue region indicating log c eff log c inf to quantify the mean change in concentration from influent to effluent we fit the line log c eff a log c inf plotted as a red line for each of the pfas the results indicate that log c eff is relatively well correlated with log c inf for all pfas evaluated r 0 7 except pfda r 0 57 the intercept a quantifies the mean relative change in concentration between influent and effluent c eff c inf 10 a for pfcas the average relative change in concentrations from influent to effluent ranged from 11 to 48 conversely the average relative change of pfsa concentrations from influent to effluent ranged from 1 to 26 in addition to these mean changes in concentrations between influent and effluent fig 2 indicates significant variability in the influent effluent relationship across the entire data set used for our study this is not surprising because the results include samples from a wide variety of treatment processes and waste streams 3 3 wastewater sources effluent concentrations of each of the eight pfas are significantly and positively correlated with each other p 0 01 with pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0 27 to 0 65 fig s1 fig 3 shows a biplot from the probabilistic pca on all collected effluent concentrations the vectors in fig 3 indicate the contribution of each pfas to the first and second pcs the first principal component pc1 and second principal component pc2 explain 51 1 and 8 8 of the variance of the original data all eight pfas contribute positively to pc1 reflecting their significant positive correlation separation of pfas coefficients vary more widely across pc2 with more positive coefficients for pfcas than pfsas markers in fig 3 indicate how each wastewater source was described or the relative industrial contribution when reported when the industrial contribution was quantified we categorized wastewater samples with 0 5 industrial contribution as domestic with 5 25 as mixed with 35 industrial contribution as high ind when the specific industrial contribution was not reported we referenced descriptions given by the original studies for example when wwtps were described as domestic campo et al 2014 municipal bossi et al 2008 wang et al 2020 or domestic and commercial guo et al 2010 sinclair and kannan 2006 we categorized them as domestic when a mixture of both domestic and industrial sources were indicated for a wwtp rodríguez varela et al 2021 shivakoti et al 2010 we generalized them as mixed in fig 3 marker color indicates the wastewater source category and marker type indicates qualitative open circle or quantitative filled circle categorization of the wastewater source the box chart in the bottom panel of fig 3 shows the pc1 score distributions by source category in general samples with higher industrial wastewater contributions have higher values of pc1 than samples with lower industrial contributions high pc1 scores indicate high concentrations of overall pfas because all pfas contribute positively to pc1 these results suggest that wastewater with high industrial contribution have high overall concentrations of pfas whereas domestic waste streams have low overall concentrations of pfas this grouping by source type along pc1 is consistent with observations from previous smaller scale studies where industrial sources were often correlated with elevated pfas concentrations in wastewater clara et al 2008 coggan et al 2019 vo et al 2020 the median pc1 scores are similar between similar source categories that were qualitatively and quantitatively identified however source groups with qualitative descriptions had higher variance in pc1 scores than groups with quantified industrial source percentages in particular the median of high ind pc1 scores is within the third quartile of the mixed n a pc1 scores wide overlap of mixed n a wwtp pc1 scores with high ind wwtp scores suggest that unspecified industrial contributions may contribute significantly to the variance in reported pfas concentrations we removed samples from the mixed n a high ind n a and high ind 35 categories from the regression analyses presented in sections 3 4 and 3 5 3 4 temporal trends in effluent concentrations we first analyzed long term trends of pfas concentrations in municipal wastewater through a simple linear regression the observations marked by country and fitted results black line of log c eff with respect to time are shown in fig 4 the regression included data from 17 different countries not all pfas were measured in each country pfas concentrations from different countries tended to fall either above or below the regression line notably the united states had the largest sample size and measured concentrations consistently higher than predicted concentrations for all pfas observed whereas observations from greece were mostly below the regression line although fewer in number there were even fewer data from countries such as uganda singapore and denmark table 1 to better represent international variability in concentrations we performed a lme regression with a fixed slope and random effect intercepts for each country lme1 on effluent concentrations of pfas with respect to time similar to the standard linear regression lme1 incorporated all available observations from wwtps that met our source criteria which included observations from 17 different countries the mean estimated results of lme1 with b 0 is shown by the blue line in fig 4 the actual prediction of log concentrations of pfas for each country is shifted by b either above b 0 or below b 0 the depicted black trend line the model predictions for pfas concentrations in wastewater by country have the lowest uncertainty at the center of their sampled dates the lme1 intercepts b b indicate log concentrations of wwtp effluent in 2012 see markers in fig 5 the fixed effect intercept b estimated by lme1 of pfoa and pfos c eff 10 b indicate global mean concentrations that were 11 2 ng l 6 8 18 6 95 ci and 6 1 ng l 3 3 11 3 95 ci respectively which were the highest of all pfas the country effects b suggest that united states canada japan and austria had relatively high concentrations of most pfas considered whereas countries such as uganda greece italy and spain had relatively low concentrations of pfas in particular uganda had estimated concentrations that deviated from the mean of all countries by over one log unit b 1 for pfhxa and pfhpa it is worth noting that the model estimates had greater uncertainty for shorter chained pfas c 8 which have not been measured as frequently as long chained pfas and countries with fewer observations uganda south africa and germany the fixed effect or global mean slopes m predicted by lme1 for each pfas indicate mean changes in log pfas concentrations log c eff per year in global wastewater see markers with confidence intervals in fig 6 these slopes indicate that all short chained pfas analyzed pfhxa pfhpa pfbs and pfhxs are increasing in concentration with time in global wastewater effluent conversely pfoa pfda and pfos which are all long chained pfas are not increasing significantly or are decreasing with time p 0 05 to explore whether the global average trends predicted by lme1 reflect trends in individual countries we performed a separate lme regression in which the slope was also a random effect lme2 for this analysis we excluded countries with limited measurements from different years this resulted in a reduced data set that included samples from only the united states italy australia south korea and china although lme2 incorporated fewer data and more model complexity the estimated country specific intercepts and global mean temporal trends estimated are consistent with the results of lme1 lme2 also yields estimates of adjustments to the global mean trend for each country and pfas the most significant perturbations from the mean trends occur in the united states and china which are also the countries with the largest numbers of samples fig 7 illustrates the estimated trends of pfas reported in wastewater effluent from the united states and china for short and long chain pfcas and pfsas although the intercepts from both lme1 and lme2 suggest that concentrations of overall pfas reported in wastewater effluent from the united states were higher than the global mean in 2012 fig 5 the lme2 model suggest that the slopes are all lower for the united states than the global average fig 6 furthermore the lme2 slopes suggest that pfas concentrations in wastewater from the united states are not significantly changing with time in contrast the lme2 model intercepts suggest that wastewater concentrations from china were not historically different from the global mean but they have increased in concentration quickly relative to the global mean trends for all pfas analyzed here in addition temporal trends of short chain pfca and pfsa compounds c 8 are overall greater than long chained pfas compounds c 8 across all five countries analyzed in lme2 similar to the lme1 estimates 3 5 pfas and gdp per capita we evaluated the relationship between measured pfas concentrations in wastewater effluent and national gdp per capita as a metric of the net economic output of each country measured concentrations of pfas increase with the national gdp per capita see fig 8 although there is high variability in the measured pfas concentrations which are not explained by gdp per capita alone our results indicate a significant p 0 05 positive correlation between gdp per capita and wastewater effluent concentrations for all pfas considered here these results suggest that countries with populations with higher income use manufacture or apply more of these pfas leading to elevated pfas concentrations 4 discussion results in section 3 2 show that reported effluent concentrations are typically higher than influent concentrations for the pfcas studied here this has been attributed to transformation of precursors such as fluorotelomer alcohols dauchy et al 2017 our results are consistent with others in suggesting that these pfca precursor loads can influence effluent concentrations more significantly than removal processes houtz et al 2016 removal of pfas in liquid streams in conventional wwtps mostly occurs through adsorption to solids including activated sludge and suspended particulate matter which are ultimately likely to be released into the environment hamid and li 2016 vierke et al 2013 our results indicate that across most of the 17 countries included in our study concentrations of short chained pfas e g pfhxa pfhpa pfbs and pfhxs in wwtp effluent have increased with time which is generally consistent with the few other studies that quantified temporal changes in effluent pfas concentrations gallen et al 2022 nguyen et al 2019 thompson et al 2022 however each of these previous studies focused on temporal changes within a single country or even a single treatment plant gallen et al 2022 our results include estimates of global mean trends and for a subset of countries variability of those trends between countries globally our results suggest that effluent concentrations of pfoa and pfos have not changed significantly with time but there are noticeable deviations from this global trend in the us decreasing pfoa china increasing pfoa and pfos and south korea decreasing pfos our estimate of pfoa concentrations in wwtp effluent decreasing at about 12 per year is consistent with a recent study that considered wwtp effluent in the us thompson et al 2022 they found annual changes of pfoa of 13 yr all data included to 12 yr known industrial sources excluded alternatively in our study australia exhibited negligible trends for pfoa and pfos which contrasts with a recent comprehensive study of temporal trends of effluent pfas concentrations that measured decreasing concentrations of pfoa and pfos in a large municipal treatment plant in australia over a period of 10 years gallen et al 2022 a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that gallen et al 2022 focused on a single wwtp whereas our meta regression included observations from 35 wwtps serving different communities within australia persistent patterns of pfoa and pfos in wwtp effluent are particularly interesting due to the significant global efforts to limit their production and use over the past decade although the stockholm convention has been ratified by 152 countries enforcement of pfas regulations are not guaranteed or consistent between countries brennan et al 2021 similarly in the united states and australia standards for pfas are suggested federally but enforced individually by states and territories brennan et al 2021 as a result the effectiveness of limitations set by these varying bodies on the production and distribution of pfas should be examined closely reducing societal dependence on and human exposure to legacy pfas faces many challenges even after regulations were put in place industrial wastewaters have been observed with elevated concentrations of pfoa or pfos highlighting possible ongoing application of these compounds houtz et al 2016 perkola and sainio 2013 wang et al 2020 alternatively the global persistence of pfoa and pfos in municipal wastewater may result from global distribution and use of products containing these legacy compounds in addition pfoa and pfos in municipal wastewater may be a result of re circulation of historically manufactured and released pfas filipovic and berger 2015 found that in a swedish wwtp 40 of each measured pfsa and up to 30 of each measured pfca originated from tap water even with effective limitations on pfas manufacture and application legacy pfas can persist and circulate through the environment water distribution systems and wwtps the positive correlations between gdp per capita and pfas concentrations in wwtp effluent suggest economic output is a potentially useful indicator of pfas concentrations in wastewater lenka et al 2021 note that due to the lack of monitoring in certain areas especially developing countries it is challenging to develop estimates of the global distribution of pfas in wastewater our results suggest that developing countries are likely to have had historically lower pfas concentrations in their wastewater however these concentrations could significantly increase with time e g china in fig 7 in addition there remains significant variability in the data possibly due to regional variability within countries this suggests the potential for regional variability within countries caused by variations of gdp per capita and pfas concentrations in wwtp effluent within individual countries our country level results suggest the potential for extending this analysis to a regional level by considering gdp per capita in the vicinity of each treatment plant however analyses of localized gdp per capita typically show more significant variability between countries than within countries kummu et al 2018 this suggests that given inconsistent availability of localized data corresponding to each wwtp a country level analysis provides a reasonable estimate of the relationship between gdp per capita and pfas concentrations in wwtp effluent the results of our analyses provide bounds on estimates of historical releases of pfas from wastewater treatment plants and evidence of correlations between gdp per capita and pfas concentrations in wastewater however there remains significant unexplained variability in the observations future efforts to explain more of this variability would benefit from standardized approaches to reporting of related data e g details of treatment processes population served details of service area more qualitative and quantitative description of waste generators etc for example effluent concentrations from wwtps grouped by quantitative estimates of industrial contributions to their influent exhibited less variance than those grouped by qualitative descriptors of the wastewater source similarly contributions of pfas in wastewater can be interpreted better if specifications of combined sewerage systems or acceptance of landfill leachate are described for each wwtp in addition sampling methods should be carefully considered with respect to the future utility of the results for example composite samples provide more robust measurements of actual pfas loads than grab samples lastly our results suggest that pfas adsorbed to suspended solids can be a significant source of pfas entering the environment which should be accounted for when designing sampling and analytical protocols 5 conclusion we collected concentrations of pfas from municipal wwtp influent and effluent reported in 44 peer reviewed scientific articles the studies included 310 wwtps in 21 countries and concentrations of the 8 most frequently reported pfas pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfna pfda pfbs pfhxs and pfos we used this compiled global data set to quantify patterns and trends of pfas concentrations in wastewater the results from our analyses of this global data set confirm some of the conclusions from smaller scale previous studies i conventional wwtps do not effectively remove any of the pfas considered in our study ii pfca and pfsa liquid stream concentrations commonly increase in wwtps a likely result of the presence of pfas precursor compounds in influent wastewater iii pfas adsorbed to spm can have similar concentrations as dissolved pfas although they are not commonly measured and iv higher industrial contributions to source water often leads to higher concentrations of pfas we also used the large data set to analyze less well studied patterns and trends of pfas in waste streams we performed a linear mixed effect regression to quantify temporal trends of pfas concentrations in wastewater from 2004 to 2020 despite shifts in the manufacturing of pfoa and pfos concentrations in wastewater of these compounds have not decreased significantly with time in most countries alternatively short chained compounds pfbs pfhxa pfhxs and pfhpa have increased on average by 23 16 10 and 8 respectively each year in municipal wastewater in addition we were able to analyze specific trends from countries with greater reported measurements although measured concentrations of pfas from wastewater in the united states are historically higher the observed temporal trends of pfas are generally lower than global average trends whereas concentrations reported from china are historically similar to the global average but are increasing at rates above the global average rates lastly we showed that gdp per capita is associated with high overall concentrations of pfas in municipal waste waters these results suggest that reducing pfas in the countries included in our study with higher access to consumer goods and household products even early adopters of pfas regulations is an ongoing challenge whereas the countries with lower gdp per capita had historically lower concentrations of pfas that could increase significantly with time supplementary

15785,despite increasing regulatory efforts to reduce production of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas continued human and ecological exposure to pfas has led to concerns about historical releases municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps provide important conduits between waste sources and the environment we present a meta analysis of results reported in 44 peer reviewed publications that include 460 influent and 528 effluent samples collected from 21 countries for which some or all of five perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas and three perfluorinated sulfonic acids pfsas were measured our meta analysis revealed global patterns and trends that to our knowledge have not been reported elsewhere regression analyses of samples collected from 2004 to 2020 quantified the temporal trends of global wastewater effluent concentrations of each of the pfas and the corresponding mean concentration for each country although legacy compounds perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos have been reported with the highest measured concentrations their global temporal trends are lowest of all pfas considered concentrations of most pfas analyzed in wastewater in the united states have not changed significantly with time whereas reported pfas concentrations in wastewater effluent from china have increased from 11 to 37 per year in addition our results show significant positive correlations between previous wastewater effluent concentrations of individual pfas and the gross domestic product per capita of each country our analysis of this global data set also confirmed conclusions from previous studies on smaller data sets i none of the pfas studied are effectively removed by conventional treatment processes ii effluents from treatment plants that include a significant industrial component to their influent tend to have higher pfas concentrations and iii the few studies that measured both aqueous concentrations and concentrations adsorbed to suspended particulate matter spm indicate that pfas adsorbed to spm can contribute significantly to the total pfas load keywords pfas wastewater historical pacs 0000 1111 msc 0000 1111 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are a widespread family of over 4000 man made chemicals composed of a carbon fluorine tail and polar functional group buck et al 2021 nakayama et al 2019 perfluoroalkyl acids can have different c f chain lengths and depending on their functional groups can be categorized as either perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids c n f 2 n 1 cooh pfcas or perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids c n f 2 n 1 so 3 h pfsas due to their hydrophobic and amphiphilic chemical structure pfas are highly effective surfactants they have been manufactured since the 1950s and are used in applications ranging from industrial processes e g metal plating and firefighting to common domestic and commercial products e g waterproof clothing and food packaging widespread use of pfas has led to release into the environment at all stages of their life cycle including manufacture application and disposal dasu et al 2022 significant sources of pfas in the environment include application of aqueous film forming foam afff used for firefighting moody et al 2003 atmospheric emissions from industrial processes schroeder et al 2021 leaching from landfills lang et al 2017 perkola and sainio 2013 and discharge of treated wastewater coggan et al 2019 hu et al 2016 sinclair and kannan 2006 due to their solubility in water pfas are mobile in the environment and have been detected in surface water kunacheva et al 2012 podder et al 2021 groundwater shin et al 2011 sediments higgins and luthy 2006 mussabek et al 2019 and even snow in polar regions zhao et al 2012 as a result pfas have been increasingly detected in drinking water supplies globally domingo and nadal 2019 hu et al 2016 leading to increased concerns over human exposure consumption of water containing long chained pfas leads to bio accumulation bartell et al 2010 and as a result serum measurements of most people in industrialized countries indicate the presence of pfas steenland et al 2010 historical exposure of perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos the two most well studied pfas has been linked to decreased kidney function c8 science panel 2012 kataria et al 2015 watkins et al 2013 non hodgkin lymphoma testicular kidney prostate and ovarian cancers vieira et al 2013 and increased risk of infertility for women fei et al 2009 the growing list of health risks of pfoa and pfos has led to voluntary phase out of their production in 2000 and 2002 in the united states respectively usepa 2002 more recently these concerns led to international recognition through listing in the stockholm convention of persistent organic pollutants annex a pfos in 2019 and annex b pfoa in 2009 respectively brennan et al 2021 stockholm convention 2019 however shorter chained alternatives c 6 which are suspected to have negative health effects similar to pfoa and pfos wang et al 2017 remain under review by regulating bodies although widespread concern for human health has increased research interest the effect of restrictions and regulations on the global circulation of pfas is still not well understood combining sample results from the scientific literature provides a means for testing the viability of previously observed patterns at larger scales and for identifying new patterns prevedouros et al 2006 reviewed pfca sources fate and transport and estimated the total global emissions and mass inventories of pfcas whereas podder et al 2021 reviewed the occurrence of pfas in surface water and through analysis of the combined data showed spatio temporal variability of three pfcas and two pfsas in surface waters across different continents they suggest that the inclusion of pfos in the stockholm list of persistent organic pollutants has impacted global surface water concentrations however acknowledge a need for further validation and studies considering the more recent inclusion of pfoa understanding and managing the release of pfas in the global environment requires more detailed analyses of direct and indirect sources and release to the environment we focus here on wastewater treatment plants wwtps which are ubiquitous throughout industrialized countries and provide a critical link between producers and users of pfas containing products and the environment becker et al 2008 bossi et al 2008 campo et al 2014 concentrations of pfas in waste streams are influenced by the regional population size gallen et al 2018 consumption patterns industrial applications clara et al 2008 wastewater source type coggan et al 2019 shivakoti et al 2010 yu et al 2009 and country shigei et al 2020 due to the chemical thermal and biological stability imparted by their c f bonds pfas are not effectively removed by conventional wwtp processes and are commonly detected in both wwtp influent and effluent ahrens et al 2009 lenka et al 2021 sinclair and kannan 2006 yu et al 2009 furthermore polyfluoroalkyl precursors such as fluorotelomer alcohols and perfluorooctane sulfonamides can degrade to pfcas and pfsas during secondary wastewater treatment resulting in measured concentrations of pfcas and pfsas increasing from influent to effluent arvaniti et al 2012 coggan et al 2019 guerra et al 2014 sinclair and kannan 2006 xiao et al 2012 yu et al 2009 the main mechanism of removal of pfas in conventional wwtps is adsorption to sludge which increases with chain length and is stronger for pfsas than pfcas arvaniti et al 2012 zareitalabad et al 2013 pfas have also been shown to adsorb to suspended particulate matter spm although current measurement of this partitioning in wastewater is limited elmoznino et al 2018 shivakoti et al 2010 vierke et al 2013 yu et al 2009 pfas concentrations in wastewater vary widely reflecting the diversity of sources waste streams with higher industrial contributions tend to have higher concentrations of pfas castiglioni et al 2015 clara et al 2008 coggan et al 2019 dauchy et al 2017 sinclair and kannan 2006 xiao et al 2012 however pfas sources vary in industrial wastewater sources metal plating textile paper etc and in municipal wastewater sources food packaging impregnation agents cleansers etc clara et al 2008 kunacheva et al 2011 vo et al 2020 furthermore the pfas load of similar products and industries can vary by country vo et al 2020 or region positive correlations between pfas concentrations and the gross domestic product gdp of cities across china suggest a connection between economic activity and pfas in wastewater wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 similarly shigei et al 2020 attributed low concentrations of pfas measured in wastewater from jordan to lower access to pfas containing products however to our knowledge there have been no efforts to explore this connection between socioeconomic conditions and pfas concentrations in waste streams at the global scale restrictions of pfoa and pfos production have led to shifts in the application of pfas over time wang et al 2013 despite phase out by major producers pfoa pfos and their precursors are still commonly detected in industrial and municipal wastewater coggan et al 2019 dauchy et al 2017 houtz et al 2016 a monitoring campaign of two australian wwtps was conducted by nguyen et al 2019 between 2014 and 2017 to investigate temporal trends of pfas in wwtp influent they found that over time per capita mass loads increased for most pfcas and decreased for most pfsas in addition coggan et al 2019 and houtz et al 2016 compared measurements of pfas from their sampling campaign of national australian wwtps in 2017 and regional california wwtps in 2014 respectively to similar campaigns conducted four to five years prior gallen et al 2018 klosterhaus et al 2013 in contrast to nguyen et al 2019 they found increases in short chained pfcas concentrations but no significant changes for pfoa or pfos more recently gallen et al 2022 completed a 10 year study of wastewater influent to a single municipal wwtp to provide an improved longer term analysis of temporal trends they found decreasing concentrations of most pfas studied including pfoa and pfos but observed shifts in the distribution of pfas toward shorter chained compounds a recent meta analysis from the united states of wastewater with no stated industrial sources indicated that only pfoa from the 8 pfas analyzed showed a decreasing trend thompson et al 2022 we compiled data reported in the scientific literature from 2004 to 2020 and performed a meta analysis to quantify global patterns and trends of pfas measured in wastewater our analysis includes measured concentrations of 5 pfcas perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa c 6 perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa c 7 pfoa c 8 perfluorononanoic acid pfna c 9 and perfluorodecanoic acid pfda c 10 and 3 pfsas perfluorobutanesulfonic acid pfbs c 4 perfluorohexanesulfonic acid pfhxs c 6 and pfos c 8 from hundreds of wwtps we evaluated differences in pfas particulate phase concentrations pfas removal efficiencies and wastewater sources to quantify these properties at the global scale from this analysis of published data we developed models to quantify international temporal trends of pfas concentrations in waste streams and associated variability by country lastly we used our model results to evaluate the connection between the economic output of each country and pfas concentrations in its wastewater 2 methods 2 1 overview of data used in this study compiling data for analysis of pfas in wastewater involved reviewing related literature and defining criteria for inclusion of reported results in our analyses we describe this process in more detail in the remainder of this section 2 1 1 data collection we searched for data published in peer reviewed literature by searching keywords such as pfas perfluoroalkyl perfluorinated wastewater and wwtp using web of science and google scholar in our review of related literature we screened studies based on wastewater source and treatment type we collected publications that reported data from wwtps with municipal or mixed municipal and industrial wastewater sources and chose not to include publications with measurements from only industrial wastewater as the pfas loads of different industrial wastewater sources can vary significantly depending on the specific industry clara et al 2008 dauchy et al 2017 vo et al 2020 and analyzing such variability is beyond the scope of this paper the portion of the influent wastewater generated by industrial sources is included when reported in table s1 wwtps can use a wide array of treatment methods we included papers that studied conventional wastewater treatment plants with secondary biological treatment such as conventional activated sludge anaerobic anoxic oxic and sequencing batch reactor systems though advanced treatment systems such as reverse osmosis and anion exchange resin can remove pfas these methods are not widely used for wastewater treatment so we did not include them in our study table 1 summarizes the papers included in our analyses 2 1 2 data processing we collected influent and effluent concentrations of five pfcas pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfna pfda and three pfsas pfbs pfhxs pfos the entire data set is included in table s1 we selected these 8 pfas because they represent a diverse mix of chain lengths and their concentrations were measured in a wide range of studies table 1 summarizes which pfas were measured in each of the selected studies the most commonly reported pfas were pfoa and pfos in addition effluent was measured for pfas more frequently than influent which may be due to complications of analyzing untreated wastewater lenka et al 2021 different indicators may be used to assess the environmental impact of pfas in wwtp effluent the daily pfas mass load from a treatment plant provides a measure of the contribution of a given wwtp to the local environment however it is difficult to compare different wwtps which may differ significantly in the numbers of people served or volumes of wastewater treated thus normalizing mass load by the number of people served or volume of water treated provides metrics that may be more meaningfully compared across wwtps however we note that for samples where the size of the population served was available concentration is strongly correlated with mass load per capita per day fig s1 there are many reasons for studying and measuring pfas in conventional wwtps and this leads to disparate reporting of information in the published literature when provided we obtained the operating flow rate served population wastewater source type and measurement date of each wwtp although other details of wwtp conditions such as temperature guerra et al 2014 ph tavasoli 2020 solid retention time srt gallen et al 2018 guerra et al 2014 kibambe et al 2020 yu et al 2009 hydraulic retention time hrt guerra et al 2014 and total suspended solids shivakoti et al 2010 were reported in detail by some authors they were not reported in the majority of the included papers although we could not determine details of each individual wwtp we determined estimates of overall variability in pfas removal efficiencies from the collection of reported concentrations most studies only measured aqueous phase pfas concentrations and relatively few measured pfas adsorbed to suspended particulate matter spm we collected available measurements of pfas adsorbed to spm in wastewater from the few studies that reported them elmoznino et al 2018 shivakoti et al 2010 vierke et al 2013 yu et al 2009 concentrations of pfas adsorbed to spm were reported as mass per sampled water volume ng l shivakoti et al 2010 vierke et al 2013 mass loads mg day elmoznino et al 2018 yu et al 2009 and mass ratios ng g becker et al 2008 elmoznino et al 2018 vierke et al 2013 we used information provided on the total suspended solids or flow rate to convert all concentrations to mass adsorbed to spm per volume of wastewater ng l table s3 we neglected studies that did not include sufficient details to quantify mass adsorbed to spm per volume of wastewater arvaniti et al 2012 becker et al 2008 methods for analyses sample preparation extraction and measurement of pfas are still evolving and all studies considered here precede any standardized protocol for measurement of pfas in wastewater usepa 2019 2021 the lack of standardized methods leads to variability in measurement techniques choices of solvents and reagents container materials and preservation methods lenka et al 2021 these differences influence measurement sensitivity and can lead to losses from sorption to laboratory materials lath et al 2019 method detection limits vary between pfas and sample and ranged from 0 01 ng l shivakoti et al 2010 to 10 ng l sinclair and kannan 2006 to avoid systematically excluding low concentrations from our analyses we assigned measurements below the limit of detection l o d a concentration of half the lod c 0 5 l o d we similarly assigned concentrations below the limit of quantitation l o q or blank b l a n k as half the loq or blank concentration 95 of the non quantified measurements had a reported limit below 5 ng l 2 1 3 additional data considerations in addition to differences in measurement techniques sampling approaches vary between studies wastewater can be collected as grab samples or as flow or time proportionate composite samples grab samples represent snapshots in time and may not reflect short term fluctuations that occur in wwtps influent and effluent grab samples could be collected from different parcels of water if the hrt of a wwtp is not appropriately incorporated to the timing of sampling however most authors do not report details of how and when grab samples were collected furthermore diurnal variability of pfas concentrations may vary by wwtp but this has not been measured in most papers presenting pfas concentrations in wastewater one exception was a study from south korea that measured hourly samples from municipal wwtps and showed variations of less than 12 during a 24 h period joo et al 2021 although grab samples were the more common method some studies took flow or time proportionate composite samples which average out hour to hour changes in wastewater castiglioni et al 2015 clara et al 2008 coggan et al 2019 elmoznino et al 2018 nguyen et al 2019 pan et al 2011 perkola and sainio 2013 schultz et al 2006 sinclair and kannan 2006 and thus better represent daily average concentrations the sampling method for each study is shown in table 1 2 2 probabilistic principal component analysis we analyzed correlations between the pfas compounds to determine if there was any linear dependence or opportunity for dimensional reduction principal component analysis pca linearly combines observed interrelated variables to a set of orthogonal variables the subset of the orthogonal variables that preserve the most important features of the data are considered the principal components pcs ideally only a few pcs are required to describe the majority of the variance within the data thus pca simplifies pattern recognition across our collection of pfas measurements because not all eight pfas were analyzed in each study table 1 we used probabilistic pca an extended form of pca that solves for principal components pcs of sparse data sets instead of performing a linear transformation of observed variables probabilistic pca uses an iterative expectation maximization algorithm to solve for pcs and any missing data which are both treated as latent variables we performed the probabilistic pca on the z scores of log effluent pfas concentrations using the ppca function in matlab 2021 we calculated the z scores i e transformed to zero mean unit standard deviation for each pfas compound in the data set to ensure uniform relative weight of each compound in the analysis 2 3 regression analysis we performed standard linear regressions and linear mixed effect lme regressions on log c eff with respect to sample collection date for each pfas each regression was performed individually for each pfas therefore only studies that analyzed the relevant pfas were included in each regression the standard linear model weighs all observations equally and does not distinguish between geographical variability and temporal variability many of the observations took place within a single year for a given country table 1 due to the limited data we were unable to perform an individual linear regression for each country countries with more observations such as the united states could contribute disproportionately to the regression results and bias the global expected concentrations lme models are an extension of the standard linear model that determine shared behavior of different groups while also allowing for variance across groups as a result lme models are less susceptible to bias introduced by disproportionate reporting from different groups here we group the available data by country because countries generally represent regions in which regulations governing production and use of pfas are uniform in some cases there may be local variability in these regulations but the availability of data does not support a more detailed regional analysis we note that all countries in our data set include samples from at least 4 wwtps with the exception of 5 countries kenya 3 taiwan 3 singapore 2 mexico 1 and uganda 1 we used the fitlme function from matlab 2021 to fit a lme model lme1 with fixed slope m and intercept that varied by country to determine the relationship between sample date t and measured pfas concentrations in wastewater effluent c eff 1 log c eff m t b z b e where b n 0 σ b 2 e n 0 σ e 2 where b is the mean intercept and b is a one dimensional

each observation e is a zero mean one dimensional vector length n o b s of model residuals with variance σ e 2 b b then quantifies the mean estimated log concentration of wastewater effluent measured in 2012 mean measurement year of global data set for each country because different countries are at different stages of their use and regulation of pfas it is possible they do not all follow the global average trend we performed a second lme regression lme2 on a subset of the data that included only observations from countries us italy australia south korea and china that had at least 30 observations n 30 across a minimum of three years to test the variability in international trends this secondary model estimates deviations from both the mean intercept b and slope m for each of the five countries and can be expressed as follows 2 log c eff m z m t b z b e where b n 0 σ b 2 m n 0 σ m 2 e n 0 σ e 2 where the variance of m is σ m 2 lastly we tested correlations between the average gdp per capita of different countries and their relative concentrations of pfas in their wwtp effluent we chose to normalize the total gdp of each country by its population to provide a global and standard comparison between average income of individuals and relative application or consumption of pfas although gdp per capita varies regionally within a country the variability across different countries considered in this analysis is significantly larger than regional differences within countries kummu et al 2018 3 results 3 1 liquid particulate partitioning fig 1 compares concentrations of pfas dissolved in the aqueous phase c liq to concentrations of pfas adsorbed to spm c spm at different stages of treatment from 30 wwtps in five different countries elmoznino et al 2018 shivakoti et al 2010 vierke et al 2013 yu et al 2009 the filled circles represent effluent samples and the open symbols are samples taken from influent and intermediate treatment stages in general higher c spm corresponds with higher c liq measured c spm of each pfas are mostly between 0 01 c liq and 1 c liq short chained pfsas pfbs and pfhxs were detected on spm in fewer samples likely due to their lower hydrophobic interaction and adsorption capacity gagliano et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 only shivakoti et al 2010 measured all eight pfas adsorbed to spm in effluent samples from 10 wwtps and marked by cyan circles in fig 1 whereas elmoznino et al 2018 detected all pfas excluding pfhxa pfhpa and pfbs adsorbed to spm from 9 different wwtps and marked by violet circles in fig 1 these effluent observations were closely grouped with the observations from samples collected before and during treatment all pfas had at least one effluent measurement where the c spm was greater than 0 8 c liq these observations demonstrate that pfas adsorbed to spm can contribute significantly to total pfas discharged from wwtps as a result monitoring studies that do not measure pfas in the particulate phase may significantly underestimate the total pfas discharge to the environment 3 2 influent versus effluent concentrations to evaluate the effect of conventional wwtp processes on pfas concentrations we plotted log effluent concentrations log c eff versus log influent concentrations log c inf for all observations for which pfas were detected in both influent and effluent fig 2 for each pfas the observations generally cluster around the black line representing log c eff log c inf in addition observations of pfcas top row are more frequently located in the yellow region indicating log c eff log c inf and observations of pfsas bottom row are more frequently located in the blue region indicating log c eff log c inf to quantify the mean change in concentration from influent to effluent we fit the line log c eff a log c inf plotted as a red line for each of the pfas the results indicate that log c eff is relatively well correlated with log c inf for all pfas evaluated r 0 7 except pfda r 0 57 the intercept a quantifies the mean relative change in concentration between influent and effluent c eff c inf 10 a for pfcas the average relative change in concentrations from influent to effluent ranged from 11 to 48 conversely the average relative change of pfsa concentrations from influent to effluent ranged from 1 to 26 in addition to these mean changes in concentrations between influent and effluent fig 2 indicates significant variability in the influent effluent relationship across the entire data set used for our study this is not surprising because the results include samples from a wide variety of treatment processes and waste streams 3 3 wastewater sources effluent concentrations of each of the eight pfas are significantly and positively correlated with each other p 0 01 with pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0 27 to 0 65 fig s1 fig 3 shows a biplot from the probabilistic pca on all collected effluent concentrations the vectors in fig 3 indicate the contribution of each pfas to the first and second pcs the first principal component pc1 and second principal component pc2 explain 51 1 and 8 8 of the variance of the original data all eight pfas contribute positively to pc1 reflecting their significant positive correlation separation of pfas coefficients vary more widely across pc2 with more positive coefficients for pfcas than pfsas markers in fig 3 indicate how each wastewater source was described or the relative industrial contribution when reported when the industrial contribution was quantified we categorized wastewater samples with 0 5 industrial contribution as domestic with 5 25 as mixed with 35 industrial contribution as high ind when the specific industrial contribution was not reported we referenced descriptions given by the original studies for example when wwtps were described as domestic campo et al 2014 municipal bossi et al 2008 wang et al 2020 or domestic and commercial guo et al 2010 sinclair and kannan 2006 we categorized them as domestic when a mixture of both domestic and industrial sources were indicated for a wwtp rodríguez varela et al 2021 shivakoti et al 2010 we generalized them as mixed in fig 3 marker color indicates the wastewater source category and marker type indicates qualitative open circle or quantitative filled circle categorization of the wastewater source the box chart in the bottom panel of fig 3 shows the pc1 score distributions by source category in general samples with higher industrial wastewater contributions have higher values of pc1 than samples with lower industrial contributions high pc1 scores indicate high concentrations of overall pfas because all pfas contribute positively to pc1 these results suggest that wastewater with high industrial contribution have high overall concentrations of pfas whereas domestic waste streams have low overall concentrations of pfas this grouping by source type along pc1 is consistent with observations from previous smaller scale studies where industrial sources were often correlated with elevated pfas concentrations in wastewater clara et al 2008 coggan et al 2019 vo et al 2020 the median pc1 scores are similar between similar source categories that were qualitatively and quantitatively identified however source groups with qualitative descriptions had higher variance in pc1 scores than groups with quantified industrial source percentages in particular the median of high ind pc1 scores is within the third quartile of the mixed n a pc1 scores wide overlap of mixed n a wwtp pc1 scores with high ind wwtp scores suggest that unspecified industrial contributions may contribute significantly to the variance in reported pfas concentrations we removed samples from the mixed n a high ind n a and high ind 35 categories from the regression analyses presented in sections 3 4 and 3 5 3 4 temporal trends in effluent concentrations we first analyzed long term trends of pfas concentrations in municipal wastewater through a simple linear regression the observations marked by country and fitted results black line of log c eff with respect to time are shown in fig 4 the regression included data from 17 different countries not all pfas were measured in each country pfas concentrations from different countries tended to fall either above or below the regression line notably the united states had the largest sample size and measured concentrations consistently higher than predicted concentrations for all pfas observed whereas observations from greece were mostly below the regression line although fewer in number there were even fewer data from countries such as uganda singapore and denmark table 1 to better represent international variability in concentrations we performed a lme regression with a fixed slope and random effect intercepts for each country lme1 on effluent concentrations of pfas with respect to time similar to the standard linear regression lme1 incorporated all available observations from wwtps that met our source criteria which included observations from 17 different countries the mean estimated results of lme1 with b 0 is shown by the blue line in fig 4 the actual prediction of log concentrations of pfas for each country is shifted by b either above b 0 or below b 0 the depicted black trend line the model predictions for pfas concentrations in wastewater by country have the lowest uncertainty at the center of their sampled dates the lme1 intercepts b b indicate log concentrations of wwtp effluent in 2012 see markers in fig 5 the fixed effect intercept b estimated by lme1 of pfoa and pfos c eff 10 b indicate global mean concentrations that were 11 2 ng l 6 8 18 6 95 ci and 6 1 ng l 3 3 11 3 95 ci respectively which were the highest of all pfas the country effects b suggest that united states canada japan and austria had relatively high concentrations of most pfas considered whereas countries such as uganda greece italy and spain had relatively low concentrations of pfas in particular uganda had estimated concentrations that deviated from the mean of all countries by over one log unit b 1 for pfhxa and pfhpa it is worth noting that the model estimates had greater uncertainty for shorter chained pfas c 8 which have not been measured as frequently as long chained pfas and countries with fewer observations uganda south africa and germany the fixed effect or global mean slopes m predicted by lme1 for each pfas indicate mean changes in log pfas concentrations log c eff per year in global wastewater see markers with confidence intervals in fig 6 these slopes indicate that all short chained pfas analyzed pfhxa pfhpa pfbs and pfhxs are increasing in concentration with time in global wastewater effluent conversely pfoa pfda and pfos which are all long chained pfas are not increasing significantly or are decreasing with time p 0 05 to explore whether the global average trends predicted by lme1 reflect trends in individual countries we performed a separate lme regression in which the slope was also a random effect lme2 for this analysis we excluded countries with limited measurements from different years this resulted in a reduced data set that included samples from only the united states italy australia south korea and china although lme2 incorporated fewer data and more model complexity the estimated country specific intercepts and global mean temporal trends estimated are consistent with the results of lme1 lme2 also yields estimates of adjustments to the global mean trend for each country and pfas the most significant perturbations from the mean trends occur in the united states and china which are also the countries with the largest numbers of samples fig 7 illustrates the estimated trends of pfas reported in wastewater effluent from the united states and china for short and long chain pfcas and pfsas although the intercepts from both lme1 and lme2 suggest that concentrations of overall pfas reported in wastewater effluent from the united states were higher than the global mean in 2012 fig 5 the lme2 model suggest that the slopes are all lower for the united states than the global average fig 6 furthermore the lme2 slopes suggest that pfas concentrations in wastewater from the united states are not significantly changing with time in contrast the lme2 model intercepts suggest that wastewater concentrations from china were not historically different from the global mean but they have increased in concentration quickly relative to the global mean trends for all pfas analyzed here in addition temporal trends of short chain pfca and pfsa compounds c 8 are overall greater than long chained pfas compounds c 8 across all five countries analyzed in lme2 similar to the lme1 estimates 3 5 pfas and gdp per capita we evaluated the relationship between measured pfas concentrations in wastewater effluent and national gdp per capita as a metric of the net economic output of each country measured concentrations of pfas increase with the national gdp per capita see fig 8 although there is high variability in the measured pfas concentrations which are not explained by gdp per capita alone our results indicate a significant p 0 05 positive correlation between gdp per capita and wastewater effluent concentrations for all pfas considered here these results suggest that countries with populations with higher income use manufacture or apply more of these pfas leading to elevated pfas concentrations 4 discussion results in section 3 2 show that reported effluent concentrations are typically higher than influent concentrations for the pfcas studied here this has been attributed to transformation of precursors such as fluorotelomer alcohols dauchy et al 2017 our results are consistent with others in suggesting that these pfca precursor loads can influence effluent concentrations more significantly than removal processes houtz et al 2016 removal of pfas in liquid streams in conventional wwtps mostly occurs through adsorption to solids including activated sludge and suspended particulate matter which are ultimately likely to be released into the environment hamid and li 2016 vierke et al 2013 our results indicate that across most of the 17 countries included in our study concentrations of short chained pfas e g pfhxa pfhpa pfbs and pfhxs in wwtp effluent have increased with time which is generally consistent with the few other studies that quantified temporal changes in effluent pfas concentrations gallen et al 2022 nguyen et al 2019 thompson et al 2022 however each of these previous studies focused on temporal changes within a single country or even a single treatment plant gallen et al 2022 our results include estimates of global mean trends and for a subset of countries variability of those trends between countries globally our results suggest that effluent concentrations of pfoa and pfos have not changed significantly with time but there are noticeable deviations from this global trend in the us decreasing pfoa china increasing pfoa and pfos and south korea decreasing pfos our estimate of pfoa concentrations in wwtp effluent decreasing at about 12 per year is consistent with a recent study that considered wwtp effluent in the us thompson et al 2022 they found annual changes of pfoa of 13 yr all data included to 12 yr known industrial sources excluded alternatively in our study australia exhibited negligible trends for pfoa and pfos which contrasts with a recent comprehensive study of temporal trends of effluent pfas concentrations that measured decreasing concentrations of pfoa and pfos in a large municipal treatment plant in australia over a period of 10 years gallen et al 2022 a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that gallen et al 2022 focused on a single wwtp whereas our meta regression included observations from 35 wwtps serving different communities within australia persistent patterns of pfoa and pfos in wwtp effluent are particularly interesting due to the significant global efforts to limit their production and use over the past decade although the stockholm convention has been ratified by 152 countries enforcement of pfas regulations are not guaranteed or consistent between countries brennan et al 2021 similarly in the united states and australia standards for pfas are suggested federally but enforced individually by states and territories brennan et al 2021 as a result the effectiveness of limitations set by these varying bodies on the production and distribution of pfas should be examined closely reducing societal dependence on and human exposure to legacy pfas faces many challenges even after regulations were put in place industrial wastewaters have been observed with elevated concentrations of pfoa or pfos highlighting possible ongoing application of these compounds houtz et al 2016 perkola and sainio 2013 wang et al 2020 alternatively the global persistence of pfoa and pfos in municipal wastewater may result from global distribution and use of products containing these legacy compounds in addition pfoa and pfos in municipal wastewater may be a result of re circulation of historically manufactured and released pfas filipovic and berger 2015 found that in a swedish wwtp 40 of each measured pfsa and up to 30 of each measured pfca originated from tap water even with effective limitations on pfas manufacture and application legacy pfas can persist and circulate through the environment water distribution systems and wwtps the positive correlations between gdp per capita and pfas concentrations in wwtp effluent suggest economic output is a potentially useful indicator of pfas concentrations in wastewater lenka et al 2021 note that due to the lack of monitoring in certain areas especially developing countries it is challenging to develop estimates of the global distribution of pfas in wastewater our results suggest that developing countries are likely to have had historically lower pfas concentrations in their wastewater however these concentrations could significantly increase with time e g china in fig 7 in addition there remains significant variability in the data possibly due to regional variability within countries this suggests the potential for regional variability within countries caused by variations of gdp per capita and pfas concentrations in wwtp effluent within individual countries our country level results suggest the potential for extending this analysis to a regional level by considering gdp per capita in the vicinity of each treatment plant however analyses of localized gdp per capita typically show more significant variability between countries than within countries kummu et al 2018 this suggests that given inconsistent availability of localized data corresponding to each wwtp a country level analysis provides a reasonable estimate of the relationship between gdp per capita and pfas concentrations in wwtp effluent the results of our analyses provide bounds on estimates of historical releases of pfas from wastewater treatment plants and evidence of correlations between gdp per capita and pfas concentrations in wastewater however there remains significant unexplained variability in the observations future efforts to explain more of this variability would benefit from standardized approaches to reporting of related data e g details of treatment processes population served details of service area more qualitative and quantitative description of waste generators etc for example effluent concentrations from wwtps grouped by quantitative estimates of industrial contributions to their influent exhibited less variance than those grouped by qualitative descriptors of the wastewater source similarly contributions of pfas in wastewater can be interpreted better if specifications of combined sewerage systems or acceptance of landfill leachate are described for each wwtp in addition sampling methods should be carefully considered with respect to the future utility of the results for example composite samples provide more robust measurements of actual pfas loads than grab samples lastly our results suggest that pfas adsorbed to suspended solids can be a significant source of pfas entering the environment which should be accounted for when designing sampling and analytical protocols 5 conclusion we collected concentrations of pfas from municipal wwtp influent and effluent reported in 44 peer reviewed scientific articles the studies included 310 wwtps in 21 countries and concentrations of the 8 most frequently reported pfas pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfna pfda pfbs pfhxs and pfos we used this compiled global data set to quantify patterns and trends of pfas concentrations in wastewater the results from our analyses of this global data set confirm some of the conclusions from smaller scale previous studies i conventional wwtps do not effectively remove any of the pfas considered in our study ii pfca and pfsa liquid stream concentrations commonly increase in wwtps a likely result of the presence of pfas precursor compounds in influent wastewater iii pfas adsorbed to spm can have similar concentrations as dissolved pfas although they are not commonly measured and iv higher industrial contributions to source water often leads to higher concentrations of pfas we also used the large data set to analyze less well studied patterns and trends of pfas in waste streams we performed a linear mixed effect regression to quantify temporal trends of pfas concentrations in wastewater from 2004 to 2020 despite shifts in the manufacturing of pfoa and pfos concentrations in wastewater of these compounds have not decreased significantly with time in most countries alternatively short chained compounds pfbs pfhxa pfhxs and pfhpa have increased on average by 23 16 10 and 8 respectively each year in municipal wastewater in addition we were able to analyze specific trends from countries with greater reported measurements although measured concentrations of pfas from wastewater in the united states are historically higher the observed temporal trends of pfas are generally lower than global average trends whereas concentrations reported from china are historically similar to the global average but are increasing at rates above the global average rates lastly we showed that gdp per capita is associated with high overall concentrations of pfas in municipal waste waters these results suggest that reducing pfas in the countries included in our study with higher access to consumer goods and household products even early adopters of pfas regulations is an ongoing challenge whereas the countries with lower gdp per capita had historically lower concentrations of pfas that could increase significantly with time supplementary

15786,considerable attention has been paid in recent years to the recovery and effective utilization of organic matter in municipal wastewater for the establishment of a circular economy direct membrane filtration dmf of municipal wastewater using microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membranes to retain and concentrate the organic matter in municipal wastewater could be a practical option for this purpose however severe membrane fouling and high concentrations of organic matter remaining in the dmf permeate are concerns to be addressed application of a simple pretreatment using fixed biofilms was investigated to address these issues in this study experiments were carried out at an existing municipal wastewater treatment plant a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr process operated under a very short hrt of 1 h and do concentration of 0 5 mg l selectively degraded low molecular weight dissolved organic matter in municipal wastewater without degradation of membrane recoverable suspended and colloidal organic matter application of the pretreatment did not reduce the amount of organic carbon recovered by dmf using an mf membrane approximately 70 of the influent cod being recovered while it dramatically mitigated the membrane fouling probably due to the alteration of characteristics of dissolved organic matter in wastewater the pretreatment also reduced the concentration of organic matter in the dmf permeate by 41 cod concentration in the dmf permeate was as low as 40 mg l with the established mbbr pretreatment performances of mf 0 1 µm and uf molecular weight cut off 150 000 membranes for dmf were compared in parallel it was found that the increase of the recoverable amount of organic matter by using uf was marginal about 5 whereas fouling in uf was much more severe than that in mf the severe fouling in uf was caused by inorganic colloids such as fes that could pass through mf membranes but be retained by uf membranes based on the results obtained in this study it is concluded that mf is more suitable than uf for efficient dmf graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater carbon recovery direct membrane filtration mbbr membrane fouling inorganic colloid data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment consumes enormous amounts of energy it is estimated that 1 of the total electricity consumption in developed countries is accounted for by municipal wastewater treatment longo et al 2016 meerburg et al 2016 currently the most common technology for treating municipal wastewater is the activated sludge system this technology which requires intensive aeration to degrade and mineralize organic matter in municipal wastewater consumes 0 3 0 6 kwh of electricity for 1 m3 of wastewater li et al 2015 wastewater treatment in many developing countries is still not adequate but this situation must be addressed in the near future however the use of the energy intensive activated sludge system for wastewater treatment in developing countries could have a serious impact on global energy demand it is therefore necessary to develop energy saving municipal wastewater treatment technology as an alternative to the activated sludge system municipal wastewater contains large amounts of useful resources such as organic matter nutrients and heat mccarty et al 2011 although many approaches for utilization of these resources have been investigated this study focused on the recovery of organic matter from municipal wastewater it is estimated that 1 93 kwh m3 of electricity can theoretically be recovered from municipal wastewater with a chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of 500 mg l mccarty et al 2011 while cod concentrations above 1500 2000 mg l are considered to be appropriate for anaerobic digestion typical cod concentrations in municipal wastewater are in the range of 250 800 mg l metcalf and eddy 2003 in this context studies on technologies for the concentration and recovery of organic matter in municipal wastewater have received increasing attention guven et al 2019 he et al 2021 the majority 70 80 of organic matter in municipal wastewater is larger than colloidal size levine et al 1985 ødegaard 1998 based on this fact direct membrane filtration dmf of wastewater using microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membranes for concentration and recovery of organic matter in municipal wastewater has been suggested gong et al 2019 hube et al 2020 lateef et al 2013 recovery and or utilization of organic matter from municipal wastewater by the dmf based approach would be advantageous over competing technologies such as high rate activated sludge hras and direct anaerobic treatment the recovery rate of organic matter achievable by hras totally relies on settleability of flocs which is still difficult to control and the system configuration of hras is complicated the low temperature of municipal wastewater e g 20 makes direct application of anaerobic treatment difficult the activity of anaerobic microbes significantly decreases at low temperatures heating the entire municipal wastewater is not economically feasible in addition sulfate causes problems in direct anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater competition between methane producing microbes and sulfate reducing bacteria and the production of sulphide are inevitable these sulfate related problems can be avoided by using dmf the net energy balance in wastewater treatment using dmf is likely to be positive because dmf is driven by a low energy consumption compared to the current treatment methods e g conventional activated sludge cas system kimura et al 2021 and sufficient energy can be recovered by anaerobic digestion from organic matter that dmf concentrates gong et al 2021 jin et al 2020 however membrane fouling that occurs in dmf can be very serious previous studies in which continuous operation of dmf was attempted ended up with a short operational period due to difficulties in controlling membrane fouling huang et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 various methods to control membrane fouling in dmf have been investigated the effectiveness of chemically enhanced backwash ceb using acids alkalis and oxidants lateef et al 2013 and the effectiveness of lateral vibration of the membrane module kimura et al 2017 have been reported physical membrane cleaning by aeration which is commonly used in aerobic membrane bioreactors mbrs can also be effective in dmf however intensive and continuous aeration in dmf should be avoided because it lowers the rate of organic matter recovery due to promotion of aerobic decomposition of organic matter the effectiveness of pretreatment with metal salts e g fecl3 and powdered activated carbon for mitigating membrane fouling in dmf has also been investigated jin et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 although those studies showed that membrane fouling was effectively controlled constant doses of those chemicals is not always economically feasible additionally inorganic flocculants have been reported to have a negative impact on anaerobic digestion and to reduce biogas production guven et al 2019 much more investigation is needed for the development of fouling control methods that enable a long term operation of dmf another concern for dmf using mf uf membranes is the high concentration of organic matter remaining in the permeate in dmf biodegradation of organic matter should be avoided and removal of organic matter simply relies on membrane based solid liquid separation dissolved organic matter that is smaller than the membrane pores can permeate the membrane and organic matter removal in dmf is therefore not sufficient more than 90 of organic matter can be removed by conventional wastewater treatment methods chan et al 2009 on the other hand in dmf using mf uf the rate of organic matter removal is limited up to 80 lateef et al 2013 a treatment process that enables retention of suspended colloidal organic matter and selective degradation of dissolved organic matter in wastewater would be an efficient pretreatment for dmf by which the quality of the permeate would be improved such pretreatment may also be effective for mitigating membrane fouling in dmf it has been reported that dissolved organic matter in wastewater causes membrane fouling via adsorption in membrane pores aryal et al 2009 kimura et al 2015 by using the pretreatment suggested above dissolved organic matter that is involved in membrane fouling in dmf could be degraded biological treatment with an extremely short hydraulic retention time hrt results in preferential degradation of dissolved organic matter while degradation of suspended organic matter in the wastewater is suppressed ødegaard et al 2000 we hypothesized that such biological treatment could be used as a pretreatment for dmf that would result in reduction of the concentration of organic matter in permeate maintenance of the amount of recoverable organic matter by dmf and mitigation of fouling in dmf consumption of energy for aeration used in such a short duration aerobic treatment would be considerably less than that in typical biological treatment of municipal wastewater the amount of energy consumed by aeration for quick aerobic treatment hrt of 0 25 2 h such as the hras process has been reported to be around 0 02 0 07 kwh m3 huang et al 2019 taboada santos et al 2020 which is about 20 of that for typical municipal wastewater treatment e g cas system in this study a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr ødegaard 1999 saidulu et al 2021 was operated under an extremely short hrt and used as a pretreatment for dmf mbbr technology has various advantages compared to other biofilm processes including a small footprint robustness to fluctuations in feed water quality such as ph and temperature less clogging and no need for backwashing di biase et al 2019 leyva díaz et al 2020 as described later this trial was successful membrane fouling in dmf could be efficiently controlled and the concentration of organic matter in the dmf permeate could be greatly reduced with the mbbr pretreatment while the recovery rate of organic matter was maintained either mf or uf membranes were used in most previous studies on dmf gong et al 2019 kimura et al 2017 nascimento and miranda 2021 influences of membrane pore size on membrane fouling have been discussed and reported for other applications of membranes such as drinking water productions kimura and kume 2020 and mbrs miyoshi et al 2015 there is still not any universal conclusion as to the best pore size for those applications to prevent membrane fouling however it would also have impacts on fouling in dmf this point has never been examined so far in this study mf and uf membranes made from the same material polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf were operated with the mbbr pretreatment side by side and their performances for dmf in terms of membrane fouling recovery of organic matter and quality of the permeates were compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup this study was conducted at an existing municipal wastewater treatment plant soseigawa wastewater treatment plant sapporo japan connected to a combined sewer system organic matter that settles in the primary sedimentation basin is easily recovered and anaerobic digestion can be applied to this organic matter to produce biogas in our previous study it was demonstrated that fouling was accelerated when dmf was performed using the influent of primary sedimentation as the feed kimura et al 2021 thus the effluent from the primary sedimentation was used as the feed for dmf in this study table 1 shows the quality of the effluent from primary sedimentation used in this study we did not receive the influent to the primary settling during this study according to the annual report released by the wastewater treatment plant where this study was carried out one third of the organic matter in the influent was removed by the primary sedimentation basin on average based on this information the influent cod concentration in this study was estimated to be 360 mg l fig 1 shows a flow diagram of the bench scale experimental set up used in this study in which an mbbr was installed for pretreatment ahead of the dmf tanks in this study as examined in our previous studies lateef et al 2013 kimura et al 2017 2021 dmf was carried out by using two stage membrane filtration sponge carriers 3 mm 4 mm 5 mm were placed in the mbbr reaction tank effective tank volume 5 l at an apparent volume fraction of 20 a mesh was installed at the top of the mbbr tank to prevent washout of the sponge carriers preliminary experiments were carried out to find hrt and do that would suppress the degradation of suspended organic matter in the feedwater effluent from primary sedimentation and allow selective degradation of dissolved organic matter in this preliminary experiment the performance of the mbbr was examined under three hrt conditions of 15 30 and 60 min and under two do conditions of low do 0 3 0 5 mg l and high do 1 5 2 0 mg l totally six conditions were tested the best performance was observed under the conditions of hrt of 60 min and low do in those conditions the removal rate of dissolved organic matter reached about 40 whereas the removal rate of suspended organic matter was limited to around 5 based on the results of the preliminary tests the mbbr was operated under conditions of hrt of 60 min and low do and used as a pretreatment for dmf the results of the preliminary test suggested that hrt longer than 60 min would lead to more degradation of suspended organic matter which should be avoided in this study therefore longer hrt was not examined in this study acclimatization of the mbbr process was carried out by operating it under the above conditions for about two weeks after confirming that the biofilm had grown sufficiently on the carriers and removal of organic matter was stable operation of dmf using the effluent from the mbbr tank as the feed was initiated in this study two membrane filtration tanks effective tank volume 2 7 l were connected in series to concentrate and recover organic matter in the wastewater hollow fiber membranes were immersed in each tank and filtration was performed at a constant flow rate by using peristaltic pumps the effective surface area of each membrane immersed in each tank was 0 28 m2 the concentration factor defined as the ratio of the volume of influent wastewater to the volume of concentrated wastewater was set to 2 1 and 24 in tanks 1 and 2 respectively to achieve an overall concentration factor of 50 in our previous study in which pretreatment was not carried out operating conditions that could reduce chemical and energy consumption for this style of dmf were established kimura et al 2021 those established conditions were used in this study in brief intermittent filtration was carried out with a 12 min filtration 3 min relaxation cycle and the membrane module was subjected to transverse vibration amplitude 6 cm frequency 0 9 hz backwashing with tap water 100 lmh 30 s every 3 h of filtration and intermittent aeration 4 l min 1 min every 1 h were performed in each tank chemically enhanced backwash ceb with sodium hypochlorite 500 ppm was performed once every 3 days for 30 s at a backwash flux of 100 lmh in both tanks use of pvdf membranes enabled us to conduct frequent cebs membrane filtration was carried out with permeate flux of 6 8 lmh and 6 0 lmh in tank 1 and tank 2 respectively combined hrt in tank 1 and tank 2 was 2 3 h within the operation of a few days apparent steady states were observed in both tanks in this study two identical dmf units were operated side by side to verify the effect of the pretreatment one unit was operated with the mbbr pretreatment and the other was operated without the pretreatment the effluent from the primary sedimentation basin was used as the feed for this unit in this operation for examination of the effectiveness of the mbbr pretreatment for dmf designated as run 1 hereafter both of the dmf units were equipped with mf membranes made from pvdf with a nominal pore size of 0 1 µm in the next operation designated as run 2 hereafter both of the dmf units were operated with the mbbr pretreatment one unit was equipped with the same mf membrane as that used in run1 and the other unit was equipped with a uf membrane made from pvdf with a molecular weight cut off mwco of 150 000 in run 2 the two dmf units with mf and uf membranes were operated side by side and performances of the mf and uf membranes were directly compared operating conditions in the dmf units are summarized

physical cleaning and fouling that cannot be removed by physical cleaning respectively kimura et al 2017 at the end of run 1 the fouled membrane was taken out from the tank and the foulant that had been deposited on the membrane surface was removed by wiping with a soft sponge the membrane filtration resistance was then measured using tap water and the degree of reversible membrane fouling was assessed on the basis of the decrease in resistance the degree of irreversible membrane fouling was assessed on the basis of the difference between the membrane filtration resistance of the new membrane and that of the membrane after sponge wiping 2 3 analytical methods cod nh4 n and t p concentrations were measured using hach reagents loveland usa product no 2125851 2125951 2606945 and

distribution of dissolved organic matter was determined using a liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection lc ocd system model 8 doc labor karlsruhe germany in this study a modified lc ocd

detected as a single peak with a molecular weight of 20 kda actually biopolymers are comprised of molecules with a wide range of molecular weights ranging from 10 kda to 1000 kda kimura et al 2018 extraction of organic and inorganic foulants from the fouled membrane was carried out using sodium hydroxide ph 12 and hydrochloric acid ph 2 respectively at the end of the operation of run 2 0 014 m2 of the fouled membrane was randomly cut from the membrane module the specimen was subsequently immersed in 40 ml of a chemical solution poured in a conical flask and the flask was shaken for 24 h at

plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes icpe 9000 shimadzu kyoto japan was used for analysis of the extracted inorganic matter the surface structure of the fouled membrane was observed using scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6510la jeol tokyo japan the structure of the fouling layer was fixed by the protocol described elsewhere ninomiya et al 2021 during the sem observations the distribution of inorganic elements on the surface of the fouled membrane was also analyzed using x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds batch anaerobic digestion experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential of biogas production from organic matter recovered by dmf the method used in our previous study kimura et al 2021 was followed for evaluation of the potential of biogas production 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in dissolved organic matter in municipal wastewater caused by the mbbr pretreatment changes in organic matter in the primary effluent caused by the mbbr pretreatment with an extremely short hrt 1 h were investigated dissolved cod in the primary effluent was reduced by 47 on average by the pretreatment average total cod and dissolved cod in the effluent from the mbbr treatment were 209 36 mg l and 48 13 mg l respectively suspended cod slightly increased 8 on average after the pretreatment the slight increase in suspended cod in the mbbr treatment was probably due to the growth of bacteria that utilized dissolved cod thus as intended the mbbr pretreatment examined in this study selectively degraded dissolved cod whereas degradation of suspended cod which should be recovered in the subsequent dmf was suppressed fig 2 shows the molecular weight distributions of dissolved organic matter in the effluent from the primary sedimentation

kda and 550 da respectively cai et al 2020 huber et al 2011 as mentioned before biopolymers are comprised of molecules with a wide range of molecular weights ranging from 10 kda to 1000 kda kimura et al 2018 it is obvious from fig 2a that lmw organic matter in the primary effluent was significantly removed or degraded by the mbbr a part of that organic matter was used for the bacterial growth it is known that bacteria excrete high molecular weight organic compounds which can be detected as biopolymers in lc ocd during consumption of lmw substrates rittmann and mccarty 2001 the slight increase in the peak of biopolymers in the lc ocd chromatogram after the mbbr treatment could be attributed to those high molecular weight organic compounds released by bacteria lc ocd measurements were accompanied by ultra violet detection uvd and lc uvd data were also available lc uvd chromatograms of the samples corresponding to lc ocd fig 2a are shown in fig 2b it is shown that the mbbr treatment significantly reduced uv absorbance of the constituents with low molecular weights retention time of 100 min which indicated the degradation of organic matter with low molecular weights and is in accordance with the lc ocd data fig 2a it should be noted that different trends were recognized between lc ocd and lc uvd for the biopolymer fraction retention time of 90 min the biopolymer fraction consists mainly of polysaccharides and proteins her et al 2003 strong signals around retention times of 60 80 min in fig 2b lc uvd indicate that biopolymers in the primary effluent had features of proteins these signals disappeared in the lc uvd chromatogram obtained for the mbbr effluent whereas slight increases were seen at the corresponding retention time in the lc ocd chromatogram fig 2a obtained for the mbbr effluent it is thought that protein like biopolymers present in the primary effluents were degraded by or adsorbed onto biomass in the mbbr process and that the biomass excreted polysaccharide like biopolymers as metabolic products polysaccharides are uv insensitive 3 2 impact of the mbbr pretreatment on dmf 3 2 1 fouling mitigation fig 3 shows the increases in tmp observed in the two dmf units that were operated in parallel to investigate the effect of the pretreatment run 1 the effluent from the primary sedimentation basin was used as the feed for one unit and the mbbr effluent was used as the feed for the other unit in run 1 as mentioned above both of the dmf units were equipped mf membranes 0 1 µm at the start of the operation increases in tmp were slow in both systems regardless of application of the pretreatment around day 5 of the operation the increase in tmp became significant in tank 1 of the dmf unit that received the primary effluent as the feed water the value of tmp temporally decreased after implementation of ceb performed every three days however it rapidly increased when the operation was restarted in tank 1 of the dmf unit filtering the primary effluent control of fouling was very difficult after 20 days of operation an effect of ceb was no longer recognized and tmp reached approximately 60 kpa after 26 days of operation in contrast in the dmf unit with the mbbr pretreatment an increase in tmp was hardly seen in both tanks over about 1 month operation a positive effect of the mbbr pretreatment on mitigation of fouling in dmf was clearly demonstrated in run 1 as shown in fig 2 the mbbr pretreatment removed large amounts of building blocks and lmw substances which would be responsible for the mitigation of fouling in addition high molecular weight dissolved organic matter produced via microbial metabolism i e biopolymers is thought to play an important role in the evolution of membrane fouling in both drinking water treatment and wastewater treatment jin et al 2013 kimura et al 2014 tian et al 2013 wang and li 2008 as mentioned above the concentration of biopolymers increased in the mbbr treatment in this study fig 2a but degradation of protein like substances in biopolymers also occurred fig 2b thus the characteristics of biopolymers in the primary effluent and those of biopolymers in the mbbr effluent were considerably different and the difference in characteristics could also explain the mitigation of fouling by the mbbr pretreatment in this study ceb using naclo wang et al 2018 was carried out to remove organic foulants in a study in which cleaning of membranes used for an mbr was investigated it was reported that naclo was less effective for removal of uv absorbing compounds from fouled membranes than were naoh and h2o2 batsch et al 2005 in the dmf unit operated without the pretreatment a large amount of uv absorbing organic matter for which removal by naclo was difficult was deposited on the membrane which lowered the effectiveness of ceb in contrast in the dmf unit operated with the mbbr pretreatment uv absorbing organic matter i e protein like biopolymers in the feed was decomposed fig 2b making ceb with naclo more effective reversible irreversible membrane filtration resistance was assessed at the end of run 1 for all membranes used in run 1 reversible membrane filtration resistance that could be cancelled by sponge cleaning was dominant 70 of the total membrane filtration resistance as shown in fig 2 the mbbr pretreatment degraded much of the building blocks and lmw substances it has been suggested that small organic molecules e g building blocks and lmw substances contribute to the formation of a densely structured less permeable cake layer novoa et al 2020 also the mbbr pretreatment degraded protein like biopolymers involvement of proteins in the formation of cake layers on membranes used for mbrs and dmf has been reported horstmeyer et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 thus it was thought that the mbbr pretreatment degraded dissolved agents that were important for the formation of a dense cake layer leading to mitigation of fouling in the subsequent dmf unit 3 2 2 permeate quality and organic recovery rate a high concentration of residual organic matter in the permeate is a major problem to be addressed for dmf of municipal wastewater lateef et al 2013 the mbbr pretreatment examined in this study reduced the concentration of low molecular weight organic matter in wastewater fig 2a and could solve this problem fig 4 shows the cod concentration in the permeate in run 1 average values of the permeates obtained from tank 1 and tank 2 are shown in fig 4 the cod concentrations in the membrane permeate with and without the pretreatment were 40 15 mg l and 68 30 mg l respectively indicating that the pretreatment reduced the cod concentration in the permeate by 41 the cod concentration in the dmf permeate 40 mg l corresponds to approximately 90 removal of cod entering the wastewater treatment plant the average bod concentrations in the dmf permeate with and without the pretreament were 8 4 mg l and 20 3 mg l respectively thus by using dmf with the mbbr pretreatment organic removal comparable to that when using the cas system can be achieved fig 5 shows the average cod concentration of the concentrated wastewater product in fig 1 and recovery rate of the organic matter in run 1 the concentrations of the concentrated organic matter with and without the pretreatment were 4902 1010 mg l and 4300 914 mg l respectively the use of the mbbr pretreatment increased the cod concentration in the product by 14 the recovery rate of organic matter also increased by 5 with the use of the pretreatment since the pretreatment examined in this study involved the biodegradation of organic matter there was a possibility that the recovery rate of organic matter declined with the pretreatment reduction in the concentration of dissolved organic matter in the mbbr pretreatment occurred via not only degradation but also separation bio adsorption via these two paths a fraction of the dissolved organic matter was incorporated into the biofilm in the mbbr a part of the degraded organic matter was utilized for growth of biomass in the biofilm then a part of the biofilm sloughed off during the continuous operation and was introduced into the subsequent dmf process which was eventually recovered as concentrated organic matter this brought about the increase in the amount of recoverable organic matter shown in fig 5 in this study organic matter in the effluent from the primary sedimentation basin was recovered by membranes this organic matter should be combined with organic matter settled in the primary sedimentation and anaerobic digestion should be carried out for the mixture overall it was estimated that approximately 70 of the organic matter entering the primary sedimentation basin in run 1 could be used for anaerobic digestion which is comparable to the values in previous dmf studies conducted at the same wastewater treatment plant lateef et al 2013 kimura et al 2017 2021 thus it can be concluded that the pretreatment does not reduce the amount of organic carbon that can be recovered by dmf it should be noted that fouling was substantially mitigated and quality of the dmf permeate was considerably improved by the pretreatment however phosphorus and nitrogen were not focused on in this study these nutrients were found to be present at high concentrations nh4 n 16 4 5 8 mg l t p 1 5 0 8 mg l in the dmf permeate with the pretreatment nitrogen and phosphorus in municipal wastewater are also useful resources recovery of those nutrients from the dmf permeate should be considered in future studies the dmf permeate is free from suspended solids and therefore application of technology for recovery of those nutrients would be easy membrane pretreatment is provided materials designed for adsorption of ammonia cruz et al 2020 and phosphate pitakteeratham et al 2013 are available and they would be suitable for recovery of nutrients from the dmf permeate 3 3 comparison of mf and uf 3 3 1 membrane fouling it is thought that constituents involved in membrane fouling are dependent on pore sizes of membranes shang et al 2015 there have been few reports focusing on this issue in the context of dmf although we used an mf membrane 0 1 µm in this study and in previous studies lateef et al 2013 kimura et al 2017 2021 the use of a tight membrane i e uf membrane may exhibit different performances in run 2 the dmf units used in run 1 were operated with mf and uf membranes side by side and their performances were compared fig 6 shows the increases in tmp in run 2 in which the mbbr effluent was used as the feed for the two dmf units operational conditions in run 2 were identical to those set in run 1 except for the membranes used in the unit in which the mf membrane was used development of membrane fouling was almost completely controlled the reproducibility of the effectiveness of the mbbr pretreatment shown in section 3 2 was confirmed it is thought that the fouling observed in this study was flux dependent high fluxes are desirable from the economical point of view in this study it was shown that the mbbr pretreatment was effective for fouling mitigation in dmf using mf operated under the flux of 6 0 6 8 lmh this does not guarantee a stable operation of dmf with higher fluxes which should be tested in future studies on the other hand in the unit in which the uf membrane was used a rapid increase in tmp was observed after about 10 days of operation in tank 2 after 19 days of operation stable operation became difficult in the unit in which the uf membrane was used and the operation was stopped in run 2 ceb using naclo was performed every 3 days in both units it was thought that naclo cleaning was effective for organic fouling but it was not effective for the uf membrane poor performance of the ceb for the uf membrane suggests that organic matter was not responsible for the fouling in the uf membrane shown in fig 6 rather inorganic constituents in the municipal wastewater might have a strong influence on the fouling in dmf using uf membranes we hypothesized that components that could pass through the pores of the mf membrane but were retained by the uf membrane accumulated on in the uf membrane and caused the significant fouling foulants were extracted by chemical reagents at the end of run 2 and were analyzed acids can extract mainly inorganic components while alkalis can extract mainly organic components mo and huang 2003 in this experiment hcl ph 2 and naoh ph 12 were used for extraction of inorganic matter and organic matter respectively fig 7 shows ftir spectra measured for the foulants extracted from each fouled membrane by naoh the presence of polysaccharides and lipids is suggested by peaks at wavenumbers of 3400 1000 cm 1 and 2900 cm 1 respectively villacorte et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 peaks at wavenumbers of 1620 cm 1 and 1130 cm 1 are related to ketone carboxylic acid quinone and ethers aromatic esters respectively wang et al 2021 results of ftir analysis showed that organic matter extracted from all of the tested membranes was similar no characteristic peaks were found in the ftir spectra of the foulant extracted from the membrane used in uf tank 2 in which significant membrane fouling was observed fig 6 this implies that some specific organic matter did not cause the significant fouling in uf tank 2 the amounts of toc extracted by naoh from a specific membrane area were 38 1 mg m2 50 3 mg m2 32 4 mg m2 and 42 4 mg m2 for mf tank 1 mf tank 2 uf tank 1 and uf tank 2 respectively there was no correlation between the degree of membrane fouling and the amount of toc extracted these results support the hypothesis mentioned above that organic matter was not an important player in the fouling in uf tank 2 fig 8 shows the amounts of inorganic elements extracted from the fouled membrane by hcl at the end of run 2 in this study elements that were found to be major inorganic foulants in previous studies including ca fe and si munla et al 2012 sahinkaya et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 were quantified large amounts of fe and s were extracted from the fouled membrane used in uf tank 2 in which the most severe fouling was observed it is therefore thought that iron sulfide played an important role in fouling in uf tank 2 tanks used for dmf are operated under anaerobic conditions and therefore sulfate reduction reaction is prone to occur it was reported that iron sulfide that formed in the cake layer caused membrane fouling in an anaerobic mbr sahinkaya et al 2018 visual observation also suggested the formation of iron sulfide in uf tank 2 the deposit was black which is characteristic for iron sulfide the surface structures of the fouling layer that formed on the membrane surface were observed by using sem at the end of run 2 sem images of the fouled membrane taken from mf tank 2 and uf tank 2 are shown in fig s1 on the surface of the mf membrane there were almost no deposits indicating little membrane fouling fig 6 in contrast on the surface of the uf membrane a dense layer was formed elemental analysis was performed for the dense layer on the uf membrane by using eds and it was shown that iron and sulfur were dominant in the dense layer being in accordance with the results of icp analysis described above eds analysis also indicated that iron and sulfur were minor on the mf membrane surface data not shown based on the results shown above the accumulation of iron sulfide on the membrane surface of the uf tank 2 membrane was mainly responsible for the severe fouling in uf tank 2 in run 2 particle size of inorganic matter in the dmf system may explain why accumulation of iron sulfide on the membrane surface occurred only in the case of uf and caused the fouling fig 9 shows the concentrations of inorganic elements in the permeates collected after 15 days of operation in run 2 it is shown that most of the inorganic elements investigated were present at similar concentrations in all membrane permeates implying that most of them were present in dissolved probably ionic forms it should be noted that concentrations of fe and s in the permeate from mf tank 1 were significantly higher than the concentrations of other elements suggesting the presence of non ionic forms of iron or sulfur in the permeate from mf tank 1 colloidal sulfides including iron sulfide would be present in the permeate from mf tank 1 they could pass through the mf membrane but be retained by the uf membrane these colloidal sulfides presumably caused the severe fouling in uf in run 2 to mitigate such fouling chemicals other than naclo should be used for routine ceb also particle size of inorganic matter in dmf processes should be monitored more intensively for a deeper understanding of fouling in dmf these should be investigated in future studies 3 3 2 differences in permeate quality and organic recovery rate fig 10 shows the cod concentrations in the dmf permeates in run 2 cod concentrations in the dmf permeates obtained with the mf and uf membranes were 33 8 mg l and 29 7 mg l respectively average bod concentrations in the dmf permeates obtained with the mf and the uf membranes were 6 6 and 6 0 mg l respectively concentrations of organic matter in the dmf permeates obtained from mf and uf membranes were similar the benefit of using uf membranes in terms of permeate quality was not obvious fig 11 shows the cod concentration of the concentrated organic matter product in fig 1 in run 2 the units with the mf membrane and the uf membrane produced concentrated organic matter with cod concentrations of 5925 1115 mg l and 6240 995 mg l respectively the corresponding organic recovery rates in dmf using mf and uf were 47 and 49 respectively in run 2 the unit used with the mf membrane was identical to that tested with the pretreatment in run 1 however cod concentration in concentrated organic matter observed with the mf in run 2 5925 mg l was higher than that with the pretreatment in run 1 4902 mg l fig 5 this difference could be attributed to the fact that the feed wastewater used in this study was real municipal wastewater fluctuation in the quality of the feed was inevitable nevertheless a similar level of organic recovery of about 50 was achieved in the two operations conduced in different periods also as mentioned before excellent fouling control was reproduced in the unit operated with the mf membrane in run 2 reduction in cod concentrations in the uf permeate and increase in cod concentration in the organic matter concentrated by the uf membrane were not obvious the severe membrane fouling observed with uf fig 6 cannot be necessarily compensated by those marginal benefits brought by the use of uf based on the results obtained in the present study the use of mf is recommended for dmf however membranes with different pore sizes mwcos might show different results further studies are needed to determine the optimum pore sizes mwcos for dmf that can be generally applied 3 4 biogas production potential of organic matter obtained by dmf with the mbbr pretreatment the ultimate goal of dmf is to generate methane gas from concentrated organic matter for energy conversion compared to the excess sludge generated from activated sludge processes the concentrated organic matter from dmf is expected to have a high potential for production of methane gas this is because excess sludge from activated sludge processes is mainly composed of bacteria and has a complex structure resulting in a low rate of conversion to methane gas qiao et al 2011 whereas concentrated organic matter from dmf is composed of organic matter that is readily biodegradable before being converted into biomass however since biological treatment was applied as a pretreatment for dmf in this study some of the organic matter in the raw wastewater was converted into biomass as mentioned above therefore the methane gas production potential of the concentrated organic matter obtained in this study might be lowered to investigate this point a batch anaerobic digestion test was conducted with the concentrated organic matter obtained in run 2 amounts of methane gas production for a specific mass of vs input were 372 19 ml ch4 g vsfed and 371 10 ml ch4 g vsfed for the organic concentrate obtained with the mf and uf membranes respectively the amount of methane gas production observed in this study was much larger than that observed with the excess sludge generated from the same wastewater treatment plant as that examined in this study 230 ml ch4 g vsfed kimura et al 2021 little difference in methane gas production potential between the mf and uf membranes was observed a similar batch anaerobic digestion test was conducted in a previous study using concentrated organic matter obtained by dmf without pretreatment of the primary effluent of the same treatment plant as that tested in this study the methane gas production in that study was 387 ml ch4 g vsfed kimura et al 2021 although the amount of methane gas production may slightly decrease with implementation of the pretreatment the slight increase in recovery of organic matter with the use of pretreatment section 3 2 2 could offset it to some extent based on the biogas production potential obtained in this study and information that is available in the literature an energy balance in dmf accompanied by the mbbr pretreatment was estimated table 2 summarizes the information used for estimation of the energy balance our proposed dmf shares many aspects with conventional aerobic mbrs therefore energy consumption in dmf was estimated on the basis of information reported for large scale mbrs judd et al 2018 yamashita et al 2019 electricity consumption in the mbbr was estimated from a norwegian design guideline for the mbbr process johannessen 2020 dmf with the mbbr pretreatment can be net energy positive the energy to operate the dmf system 0 062 wh m3 is smaller than that produced from organic matter recovered from wastewater 0 201 kwh m3 it should be noted that wastewater tested in this study collected via a combined sewer was weak the concentration of cod in typical wastewater would be 500 mg l or more mccarty et al 2011 in that case amounts of electricity generated can be easily increased and feasibility of the proposed dmf system can be enhanced 4 conclusion in this study we investigated the effect of mbbr pretreatment on dmf and compared mf uf membranes in terms of membrane fouling organic recovery and permeate quality in dmf the mbbr pretreatment dramatically mitigated membrane fouling in dmf which was explained by removal of small organic molecules and degradation of uv sensitive biopolymers with the pretreatment operation of dmf with a higher flux might be possible and that should be investigated in a future study the pretreatment used in this study selectively degraded dissolved organic matter with low molecular weights and converted it to suspended biomass this resulted in a significant decrease in the concentration of organic matter in the dmf permeate and an increase in the amount of organic matter recoverable by dmf it was thought that inorganic colloids including fes in wastewater could pass through the mf membrane but were retained by the uf membrane resulting in severe fouling in uf compared to dmf using mf dmf using uf improved the quality of permeate and increased the recovery of organic matter however the benefits of the use of uf were limited much less fouling observed with mf supports the use of mf for dmf instead of uf it was confirmed that the mbbr pretreatment had no adverse effect on methane gas generation from the recovered organic matter methods for recovering nutrients from dmf treated water should be examined in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15786,considerable attention has been paid in recent years to the recovery and effective utilization of organic matter in municipal wastewater for the establishment of a circular economy direct membrane filtration dmf of municipal wastewater using microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membranes to retain and concentrate the organic matter in municipal wastewater could be a practical option for this purpose however severe membrane fouling and high concentrations of organic matter remaining in the dmf permeate are concerns to be addressed application of a simple pretreatment using fixed biofilms was investigated to address these issues in this study experiments were carried out at an existing municipal wastewater treatment plant a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr process operated under a very short hrt of 1 h and do concentration of 0 5 mg l selectively degraded low molecular weight dissolved organic matter in municipal wastewater without degradation of membrane recoverable suspended and colloidal organic matter application of the pretreatment did not reduce the amount of organic carbon recovered by dmf using an mf membrane approximately 70 of the influent cod being recovered while it dramatically mitigated the membrane fouling probably due to the alteration of characteristics of dissolved organic matter in wastewater the pretreatment also reduced the concentration of organic matter in the dmf permeate by 41 cod concentration in the dmf permeate was as low as 40 mg l with the established mbbr pretreatment performances of mf 0 1 µm and uf molecular weight cut off 150 000 membranes for dmf were compared in parallel it was found that the increase of the recoverable amount of organic matter by using uf was marginal about 5 whereas fouling in uf was much more severe than that in mf the severe fouling in uf was caused by inorganic colloids such as fes that could pass through mf membranes but be retained by uf membranes based on the results obtained in this study it is concluded that mf is more suitable than uf for efficient dmf graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater carbon recovery direct membrane filtration mbbr membrane fouling inorganic colloid data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment consumes enormous amounts of energy it is estimated that 1 of the total electricity consumption in developed countries is accounted for by municipal wastewater treatment longo et al 2016 meerburg et al 2016 currently the most common technology for treating municipal wastewater is the activated sludge system this technology which requires intensive aeration to degrade and mineralize organic matter in municipal wastewater consumes 0 3 0 6 kwh of electricity for 1 m3 of wastewater li et al 2015 wastewater treatment in many developing countries is still not adequate but this situation must be addressed in the near future however the use of the energy intensive activated sludge system for wastewater treatment in developing countries could have a serious impact on global energy demand it is therefore necessary to develop energy saving municipal wastewater treatment technology as an alternative to the activated sludge system municipal wastewater contains large amounts of useful resources such as organic matter nutrients and heat mccarty et al 2011 although many approaches for utilization of these resources have been investigated this study focused on the recovery of organic matter from municipal wastewater it is estimated that 1 93 kwh m3 of electricity can theoretically be recovered from municipal wastewater with a chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of 500 mg l mccarty et al 2011 while cod concentrations above 1500 2000 mg l are considered to be appropriate for anaerobic digestion typical cod concentrations in municipal wastewater are in the range of 250 800 mg l metcalf and eddy 2003 in this context studies on technologies for the concentration and recovery of organic matter in municipal wastewater have received increasing attention guven et al 2019 he et al 2021 the majority 70 80 of organic matter in municipal wastewater is larger than colloidal size levine et al 1985 ødegaard 1998 based on this fact direct membrane filtration dmf of wastewater using microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membranes for concentration and recovery of organic matter in municipal wastewater has been suggested gong et al 2019 hube et al 2020 lateef et al 2013 recovery and or utilization of organic matter from municipal wastewater by the dmf based approach would be advantageous over competing technologies such as high rate activated sludge hras and direct anaerobic treatment the recovery rate of organic matter achievable by hras totally relies on settleability of flocs which is still difficult to control and the system configuration of hras is complicated the low temperature of municipal wastewater e g 20 makes direct application of anaerobic treatment difficult the activity of anaerobic microbes significantly decreases at low temperatures heating the entire municipal wastewater is not economically feasible in addition sulfate causes problems in direct anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater competition between methane producing microbes and sulfate reducing bacteria and the production of sulphide are inevitable these sulfate related problems can be avoided by using dmf the net energy balance in wastewater treatment using dmf is likely to be positive because dmf is driven by a low energy consumption compared to the current treatment methods e g conventional activated sludge cas system kimura et al 2021 and sufficient energy can be recovered by anaerobic digestion from organic matter that dmf concentrates gong et al 2021 jin et al 2020 however membrane fouling that occurs in dmf can be very serious previous studies in which continuous operation of dmf was attempted ended up with a short operational period due to difficulties in controlling membrane fouling huang et al 2017 zhao et al 2020 various methods to control membrane fouling in dmf have been investigated the effectiveness of chemically enhanced backwash ceb using acids alkalis and oxidants lateef et al 2013 and the effectiveness of lateral vibration of the membrane module kimura et al 2017 have been reported physical membrane cleaning by aeration which is commonly used in aerobic membrane bioreactors mbrs can also be effective in dmf however intensive and continuous aeration in dmf should be avoided because it lowers the rate of organic matter recovery due to promotion of aerobic decomposition of organic matter the effectiveness of pretreatment with metal salts e g fecl3 and powdered activated carbon for mitigating membrane fouling in dmf has also been investigated jin et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 although those studies showed that membrane fouling was effectively controlled constant doses of those chemicals is not always economically feasible additionally inorganic flocculants have been reported to have a negative impact on anaerobic digestion and to reduce biogas production guven et al 2019 much more investigation is needed for the development of fouling control methods that enable a long term operation of dmf another concern for dmf using mf uf membranes is the high concentration of organic matter remaining in the permeate in dmf biodegradation of organic matter should be avoided and removal of organic matter simply relies on membrane based solid liquid separation dissolved organic matter that is smaller than the membrane pores can permeate the membrane and organic matter removal in dmf is therefore not sufficient more than 90 of organic matter can be removed by conventional wastewater treatment methods chan et al 2009 on the other hand in dmf using mf uf the rate of organic matter removal is limited up to 80 lateef et al 2013 a treatment process that enables retention of suspended colloidal organic matter and selective degradation of dissolved organic matter in wastewater would be an efficient pretreatment for dmf by which the quality of the permeate would be improved such pretreatment may also be effective for mitigating membrane fouling in dmf it has been reported that dissolved organic matter in wastewater causes membrane fouling via adsorption in membrane pores aryal et al 2009 kimura et al 2015 by using the pretreatment suggested above dissolved organic matter that is involved in membrane fouling in dmf could be degraded biological treatment with an extremely short hydraulic retention time hrt results in preferential degradation of dissolved organic matter while degradation of suspended organic matter in the wastewater is suppressed ødegaard et al 2000 we hypothesized that such biological treatment could be used as a pretreatment for dmf that would result in reduction of the concentration of organic matter in permeate maintenance of the amount of recoverable organic matter by dmf and mitigation of fouling in dmf consumption of energy for aeration used in such a short duration aerobic treatment would be considerably less than that in typical biological treatment of municipal wastewater the amount of energy consumed by aeration for quick aerobic treatment hrt of 0 25 2 h such as the hras process has been reported to be around 0 02 0 07 kwh m3 huang et al 2019 taboada santos et al 2020 which is about 20 of that for typical municipal wastewater treatment e g cas system in this study a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr ødegaard 1999 saidulu et al 2021 was operated under an extremely short hrt and used as a pretreatment for dmf mbbr technology has various advantages compared to other biofilm processes including a small footprint robustness to fluctuations in feed water quality such as ph and temperature less clogging and no need for backwashing di biase et al 2019 leyva díaz et al 2020 as described later this trial was successful membrane fouling in dmf could be efficiently controlled and the concentration of organic matter in the dmf permeate could be greatly reduced with the mbbr pretreatment while the recovery rate of organic matter was maintained either mf or uf membranes were used in most previous studies on dmf gong et al 2019 kimura et al 2017 nascimento and miranda 2021 influences of membrane pore size on membrane fouling have been discussed and reported for other applications of membranes such as drinking water productions kimura and kume 2020 and mbrs miyoshi et al 2015 there is still not any universal conclusion as to the best pore size for those applications to prevent membrane fouling however it would also have impacts on fouling in dmf this point has never been examined so far in this study mf and uf membranes made from the same material polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf were operated with the mbbr pretreatment side by side and their performances for dmf in terms of membrane fouling recovery of organic matter and quality of the permeates were compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup this study was conducted at an existing municipal wastewater treatment plant soseigawa wastewater treatment plant sapporo japan connected to a combined sewer system organic matter that settles in the primary sedimentation basin is easily recovered and anaerobic digestion can be applied to this organic matter to produce biogas in our previous study it was demonstrated that fouling was accelerated when dmf was performed using the influent of primary sedimentation as the feed kimura et al 2021 thus the effluent from the primary sedimentation was used as the feed for dmf in this study table 1 shows the quality of the effluent from primary sedimentation used in this study we did not receive the influent to the primary settling during this study according to the annual report released by the wastewater treatment plant where this study was carried out one third of the organic matter in the influent was removed by the primary sedimentation basin on average based on this information the influent cod concentration in this study was estimated to be 360 mg l fig 1 shows a flow diagram of the bench scale experimental set up used in this study in which an mbbr was installed for pretreatment ahead of the dmf tanks in this study as examined in our previous studies lateef et al 2013 kimura et al 2017 2021 dmf was carried out by using two stage membrane filtration sponge carriers 3 mm 4 mm 5 mm were placed in the mbbr reaction tank effective tank volume 5 l at an apparent volume fraction of 20 a mesh was installed at the top of the mbbr tank to prevent washout of the sponge carriers preliminary experiments were carried out to find hrt and do that would suppress the degradation of suspended organic matter in the feedwater effluent from primary sedimentation and allow selective degradation of dissolved organic matter in this preliminary experiment the performance of the mbbr was examined under three hrt conditions of 15 30 and 60 min and under two do conditions of low do 0 3 0 5 mg l and high do 1 5 2 0 mg l totally six conditions were tested the best performance was observed under the conditions of hrt of 60 min and low do in those conditions the removal rate of dissolved organic matter reached about 40 whereas the removal rate of suspended organic matter was limited to around 5 based on the results of the preliminary tests the mbbr was operated under conditions of hrt of 60 min and low do and used as a pretreatment for dmf the results of the preliminary test suggested that hrt longer than 60 min would lead to more degradation of suspended organic matter which should be avoided in this study therefore longer hrt was not examined in this study acclimatization of the mbbr process was carried out by operating it under the above conditions for about two weeks after confirming that the biofilm had grown sufficiently on the carriers and removal of organic matter was stable operation of dmf using the effluent from the mbbr tank as the feed was initiated in this study two membrane filtration tanks effective tank volume 2 7 l were connected in series to concentrate and recover organic matter in the wastewater hollow fiber membranes were immersed in each tank and filtration was performed at a constant flow rate by using peristaltic pumps the effective surface area of each membrane immersed in each tank was 0 28 m2 the concentration factor defined as the ratio of the volume of influent wastewater to the volume of concentrated wastewater was set to 2 1 and 24 in tanks 1 and 2 respectively to achieve an overall concentration factor of 50 in our previous study in which pretreatment was not carried out operating conditions that could reduce chemical and energy consumption for this style of dmf were established kimura et al 2021 those established conditions were used in this study in brief intermittent filtration was carried out with a 12 min filtration 3 min relaxation cycle and the membrane module was subjected to transverse vibration amplitude 6 cm frequency 0 9 hz backwashing with tap water 100 lmh 30 s every 3 h of filtration and intermittent aeration 4 l min 1 min every 1 h were performed in each tank chemically enhanced backwash ceb with sodium hypochlorite 500 ppm was performed once every 3 days for 30 s at a backwash flux of 100 lmh in both tanks use of pvdf membranes enabled us to conduct frequent cebs membrane filtration was carried out with permeate flux of 6 8 lmh and 6 0 lmh in tank 1 and tank 2 respectively combined hrt in tank 1 and tank 2 was 2 3 h within the operation of a few days apparent steady states were observed in both tanks in this study two identical dmf units were operated side by side to verify the effect of the pretreatment one unit was operated with the mbbr pretreatment and the other was operated without the pretreatment the effluent from the primary sedimentation basin was used as the feed for this unit in this operation for examination of the effectiveness of the mbbr pretreatment for dmf designated as run 1 hereafter both of the dmf units were equipped with mf membranes made from pvdf with a nominal pore size of 0 1 µm in the next operation designated as run 2 hereafter both of the dmf units were operated with the mbbr pretreatment one unit was equipped with the same mf membrane as that used in run1 and the other unit was equipped with a uf membrane made from pvdf with a molecular weight cut off mwco of 150 000 in run 2 the two dmf units with mf and uf membranes were operated side by side and performances of the mf and uf membranes were directly compared operating conditions in the dmf units are summarized

the reversible membrane fouling resistance m 1 and rirr is the irreversible membrane fouling resistance m 1 reversible fouling and irreversible fouling are defined as fouling that can be removed by physical cleaning and fouling that cannot be removed by physical cleaning respectively kimura et al 2017 at the end of run 1 the fouled membrane was taken out from the tank and the foulant that had been deposited on the membrane surface was removed by wiping with a soft sponge the membrane filtration resistance was then measured using tap water and the degree of reversible membrane fouling was assessed on the basis of the decrease in resistance the degree of irreversible membrane fouling was assessed on the basis of the difference between the membrane filtration resistance of the new membrane and that of the membrane after sponge wiping 2 3 analytical methods cod nh4 n and t p concentrations were measured using hach reagents loveland usa product no 2125851 2125951 2606945 and 2742645 dissolved cod was measured for samples passing through a 0 45 µm ptfe filter advantec tokyo japan tss and vss were measured according to the standard method apha et al 2017 molecular weight distribution of dissolved organic matter was determined using a liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection lc ocd system model 8 doc labor karlsruhe germany in this study a modified lc ocd column setting kimura et al 2018 which enabled us to further fractionate biopolymers was used to investigate details of biopolymers with the conventional column setting of lc ocd biopolymers are detected as a single peak with a molecular weight of 20 kda actually biopolymers are comprised of molecules with a wide range of molecular weights ranging from 10 kda to 1000 kda kimura et al 2018 extraction of organic and inorganic foulants from the fouled membrane was carried out using sodium hydroxide ph 12 and hydrochloric acid ph 2 respectively at the end of the operation of run 2 0 014 m2 of the fouled membrane was randomly cut from the membrane module the specimen was subsequently immersed in 40 ml of a chemical solution poured in a conical flask and the flask was shaken for 24 h at 30 to extract the foulant a fourier transform infrared ftir spectrophotometer ir 7500s shimadzu kyoto japan was used for analysis of the extracted organic matter and inorganic inductivity coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes icpe 9000 shimadzu kyoto japan was used for analysis of the extracted inorganic matter the surface structure of the fouled membrane was observed using scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6510la jeol tokyo japan the structure of the fouling layer was fixed by the protocol described elsewhere ninomiya et al 2021 during the sem observations the distribution of inorganic elements on the surface of the fouled membrane was also analyzed using x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy eds batch anaerobic digestion experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential of biogas production from organic matter recovered by dmf the method used in our previous study kimura et al 2021 was followed for evaluation of the potential of biogas production 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in dissolved organic matter in municipal wastewater caused by the mbbr pretreatment changes in organic matter in the primary effluent caused by the mbbr pretreatment with an extremely short hrt 1 h were investigated dissolved cod in the primary effluent was reduced by 47 on average by the pretreatment average total cod and dissolved cod in the effluent from the mbbr treatment were 209 36 mg l and 48 13 mg l respectively suspended cod slightly increased 8 on average after the pretreatment the slight increase in suspended cod in the mbbr treatment was probably due to the growth of bacteria that utilized dissolved cod thus as intended the mbbr pretreatment examined in this study selectively degraded dissolved cod whereas degradation of suspended cod which should be recovered in the subsequent dmf was suppressed fig 2 shows the molecular weight distributions of dissolved organic matter in the effluent from the primary sedimentation and the mbbr treated water which were determined by lc ocd humic substances building blocks and low molecular weight lmw substances determined by lc ocd have molecular weights of 2 3 7 kda 0 55 1 5 kda and 550 da respectively cai et al 2020 huber et al 2011 as mentioned before biopolymers are comprised of molecules with a wide range of molecular weights ranging from 10 kda to 1000 kda kimura et al 2018 it is obvious from fig 2a that lmw organic matter in the primary effluent was significantly removed or degraded by the mbbr a part of that organic matter was used for the bacterial growth it is known that bacteria excrete high molecular weight organic compounds which can be detected as biopolymers in lc ocd during consumption of lmw substrates rittmann and mccarty 2001 the slight increase in the peak of biopolymers in the lc ocd chromatogram after the mbbr treatment could be attributed to those high molecular weight organic compounds released by bacteria lc ocd measurements were accompanied by ultra violet detection uvd and lc uvd data were also available lc uvd chromatograms of the samples corresponding to lc ocd fig 2a are shown in fig 2b it is shown that the mbbr treatment significantly reduced uv absorbance of the constituents with low molecular weights retention time of 100 min which indicated the degradation of organic matter with low molecular weights and is in accordance with the lc ocd data fig 2a it should be noted that different trends were recognized between lc ocd and lc uvd for the biopolymer fraction retention time of 90 min the biopolymer fraction consists mainly of polysaccharides and proteins her et al 2003 strong signals around retention times of 60 80 min in fig 2b lc uvd indicate that biopolymers in the primary effluent had features of proteins these signals disappeared in the lc uvd chromatogram obtained for the mbbr effluent whereas slight increases were seen at the corresponding retention time in the lc ocd chromatogram fig 2a obtained for the mbbr effluent it is thought that protein like biopolymers present in the primary effluents were degraded by or adsorbed onto biomass in the mbbr process and that the biomass excreted polysaccharide like biopolymers as metabolic products polysaccharides are uv insensitive 3 2 impact of the mbbr pretreatment on dmf 3 2 1 fouling mitigation fig 3 shows the increases in tmp observed in the two dmf units that were operated in parallel to investigate the effect of the pretreatment run 1 the effluent from the primary sedimentation basin was used as the feed for one unit and the mbbr effluent was used as the feed for the other unit in run 1 as mentioned above both of the dmf units were equipped mf membranes 0 1 µm at the start of the operation increases in tmp were slow in both systems regardless of application of the pretreatment around day 5 of the operation the increase in tmp became significant in tank 1 of the dmf unit that received the primary effluent as the feed water the value of tmp temporally decreased after implementation of ceb performed every three days however it rapidly increased when the operation was restarted in tank 1 of the dmf unit filtering the primary effluent control of fouling was very difficult after 20 days of operation an effect of ceb was no longer recognized and tmp reached approximately 60 kpa after 26 days of operation in contrast in the dmf unit with the mbbr pretreatment an increase in tmp was hardly seen in both tanks over about 1 month operation a positive effect of the mbbr pretreatment on mitigation of fouling in dmf was clearly demonstrated in run 1 as shown in fig 2 the mbbr pretreatment removed large amounts of building blocks and lmw substances which would be responsible for the mitigation of fouling in addition high molecular weight dissolved organic matter produced via microbial metabolism i e biopolymers is thought to play an important role in the evolution of membrane fouling in both drinking water treatment and wastewater treatment jin et al 2013 kimura et al 2014 tian et al 2013 wang and li 2008 as mentioned above the concentration of biopolymers increased in the mbbr treatment in this study fig 2a but degradation of protein like substances in biopolymers also occurred fig 2b thus the characteristics of biopolymers in the primary effluent and those of biopolymers in the mbbr effluent were considerably different and the difference in characteristics could also explain the mitigation of fouling by the mbbr pretreatment in this study ceb using naclo wang et al 2018 was carried out to remove organic foulants in a study in which cleaning of membranes used for an mbr was investigated it was reported that naclo was less effective for removal of uv absorbing compounds from fouled membranes than were naoh and h2o2 batsch et al 2005 in the dmf unit operated without the pretreatment a large amount of uv absorbing organic matter for which removal by naclo was difficult was deposited on the membrane which lowered the effectiveness of ceb in contrast in the dmf unit operated with the mbbr pretreatment uv absorbing organic matter i e protein like biopolymers in the feed was decomposed fig 2b making ceb with naclo more effective reversible irreversible membrane filtration resistance was assessed at the end of run 1 for all membranes used in run 1 reversible membrane filtration resistance that could be cancelled by sponge cleaning was dominant 70 of the total membrane filtration resistance as shown in fig 2 the mbbr pretreatment degraded much of the building blocks and lmw substances it has been suggested that small organic molecules e g building blocks and lmw substances contribute to the formation of a densely structured less permeable cake layer novoa et al 2020 also the mbbr pretreatment degraded protein like biopolymers involvement of proteins in the formation of cake layers on membranes used for mbrs and dmf has been reported horstmeyer et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 thus it was thought that the mbbr pretreatment degraded dissolved agents that were important for the formation of a dense cake layer leading to mitigation of fouling in the subsequent dmf unit 3 2 2 permeate quality and organic recovery rate a high concentration of residual organic matter in the permeate is a major problem to be addressed for dmf of municipal wastewater lateef et al 2013 the mbbr pretreatment examined in this study reduced the concentration of low molecular weight organic matter in wastewater fig 2a and could solve this problem fig 4 shows the cod concentration in the permeate in run 1 average values of the permeates obtained from tank 1 and tank 2 are shown in fig 4 the cod concentrations in the membrane permeate with and without the pretreatment were 40 15 mg l and 68 30 mg l respectively indicating that the pretreatment reduced the cod concentration in the permeate by 41 the cod concentration in the dmf permeate 40 mg l corresponds to approximately 90 removal of cod entering the wastewater treatment plant the average bod concentrations in the dmf permeate with and without the pretreament were 8 4 mg l and 20 3 mg l respectively thus by using dmf with the mbbr pretreatment organic removal comparable to that when using the cas system can be achieved fig 5 shows the average cod concentration of the concentrated wastewater product in fig 1 and recovery rate of the organic matter in run 1 the concentrations of the concentrated organic matter with and without the pretreatment were 4902 1010 mg l and 4300 914 mg l respectively the use of the mbbr pretreatment increased the cod concentration in the product by 14 the recovery rate of organic matter also increased by 5 with the use of the pretreatment since the pretreatment examined in this study involved the biodegradation of organic matter there was a possibility that the recovery rate of organic matter declined with the pretreatment reduction in the concentration of dissolved organic matter in the mbbr pretreatment occurred via not only degradation but also separation bio adsorption via these two paths a fraction of the dissolved organic matter was incorporated into the biofilm in the mbbr a part of the degraded organic matter was utilized for growth of biomass in the biofilm then a part of the biofilm sloughed off during the continuous operation and was introduced into the subsequent dmf process which was eventually recovered as concentrated organic matter this brought about the increase in the amount of recoverable organic matter shown in fig 5 in this study organic matter in the effluent from the primary sedimentation basin was recovered by membranes this organic matter should be combined with organic matter settled in the primary sedimentation and anaerobic digestion should be carried out for the mixture overall it was estimated that approximately 70 of the organic matter entering the primary sedimentation basin in run 1 could be used for anaerobic digestion which is comparable to the values in previous dmf studies conducted at the same wastewater treatment plant lateef et al 2013 kimura et al 2017 2021 thus it can be concluded that the pretreatment does not reduce the amount of organic carbon that can be recovered by dmf it should be noted that fouling was substantially mitigated and quality of the dmf permeate was considerably improved by the pretreatment however phosphorus and nitrogen were not focused on in this study these nutrients were found to be present at high concentrations nh4 n 16 4 5 8 mg l t p 1 5 0 8 mg l in the dmf permeate with the pretreatment nitrogen and phosphorus in municipal wastewater are also useful resources recovery of those nutrients from the dmf permeate should be considered in future studies the dmf permeate is free from suspended solids and therefore application of technology for recovery of those nutrients would be easy membrane pretreatment is provided materials designed for adsorption of ammonia cruz et al 2020 and phosphate pitakteeratham et al 2013 are available and they would be suitable for recovery of nutrients from the dmf permeate 3 3 comparison of mf and uf 3 3 1 membrane fouling it is thought that constituents involved in membrane fouling are dependent on pore sizes of membranes shang et al 2015 there have been few reports focusing on this issue in the context of dmf although we used an mf membrane 0 1 µm in this study and in previous studies lateef et al 2013 kimura et al 2017 2021 the use of a tight membrane i e uf membrane may exhibit different performances in run 2 the dmf units used in run 1 were operated with mf and uf membranes side by side and their performances were compared fig 6 shows the increases in tmp in run 2 in which the mbbr effluent was used as the feed for the two dmf units operational conditions in run 2 were identical to those set in run 1 except for the membranes used in the unit in which the mf membrane was used development of membrane fouling was almost completely controlled the reproducibility of the effectiveness of the mbbr pretreatment shown in section 3 2 was confirmed it is thought that the fouling observed in this study was flux dependent high fluxes are desirable from the economical point of view in this study it was shown that the mbbr pretreatment was effective for fouling mitigation in dmf using mf operated under the flux of 6 0 6 8 lmh this does not guarantee a stable operation of dmf with higher fluxes which should be tested in future studies on the other hand in the unit in which the uf membrane was used a rapid increase in tmp was observed after about 10 days of operation in tank 2 after 19 days of operation stable operation became difficult in the unit in which the uf membrane was used and the operation was stopped in run 2 ceb using naclo was performed every 3 days in both units it was thought that naclo cleaning was effective for organic fouling but it was not effective for the uf membrane poor performance of the ceb for the uf membrane suggests that organic matter was not responsible for the fouling in the uf membrane shown in fig 6 rather inorganic constituents in the municipal wastewater might have a strong influence on the fouling in dmf using uf membranes we hypothesized that components that could pass through the pores of the mf membrane but were retained by the uf membrane accumulated on in the uf membrane and caused the significant fouling foulants were extracted by chemical reagents at the end of run 2 and were analyzed acids can extract mainly inorganic components while alkalis can extract mainly organic components mo and huang 2003 in this experiment hcl ph 2 and naoh ph 12 were used for extraction of inorganic matter and organic matter respectively fig 7 shows ftir spectra measured for the foulants extracted from each fouled membrane by naoh the presence of polysaccharides and lipids is suggested by peaks at wavenumbers of 3400 1000 cm 1 and 2900 cm 1 respectively villacorte et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 peaks at wavenumbers of 1620 cm 1 and 1130 cm 1 are related to ketone carboxylic acid quinone and ethers aromatic esters respectively wang et al 2021 results of ftir analysis showed that organic matter extracted from all of the tested membranes was similar no characteristic peaks were found in the ftir spectra of the foulant extracted from the membrane used in uf tank 2 in which significant membrane fouling was observed fig 6 this implies that some specific organic matter did not cause the significant fouling in uf tank 2 the amounts of toc extracted by naoh from a specific membrane area were 38 1 mg m2 50 3 mg m2 32 4 mg m2 and 42 4 mg m2 for mf tank 1 mf tank 2 uf tank 1 and uf tank 2 respectively there was no correlation between the degree of membrane fouling and the amount of toc extracted these results support the hypothesis mentioned above that organic matter was not an important player in the fouling in uf tank 2 fig 8 shows the amounts of inorganic elements extracted from the fouled membrane by hcl at the end of run 2 in this study elements that were found to be major inorganic foulants in previous studies including ca fe and si munla et al 2012 sahinkaya et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 were quantified large amounts of fe and s were extracted from the fouled membrane used in uf tank 2 in which the most severe fouling was observed it is therefore thought that iron sulfide played an important role in fouling in uf tank 2 tanks used for dmf are operated under anaerobic conditions and therefore sulfate reduction reaction is prone to occur it was reported that iron sulfide that formed in the cake layer caused membrane fouling in an anaerobic mbr sahinkaya et al 2018 visual observation also suggested the formation of iron sulfide in uf tank 2 the deposit was black which is characteristic for iron sulfide the surface structures of the fouling layer that formed on the membrane surface were observed by using sem at the end of run 2 sem images of the fouled membrane taken from mf tank 2 and uf tank 2 are shown in fig s1 on the surface of the mf membrane there were almost no deposits indicating little membrane fouling fig 6 in contrast on the surface of the uf membrane a dense layer was formed elemental analysis was performed for the dense layer on the uf membrane by using eds and it was shown that iron and sulfur were dominant in the dense layer being in accordance with the results of icp analysis described above eds analysis also indicated that iron and sulfur were minor on the mf membrane surface data not shown based on the results shown above the accumulation of iron sulfide on the membrane surface of the uf tank 2 membrane was mainly responsible for the severe fouling in uf tank 2 in run 2 particle size of inorganic matter in the dmf system may explain why accumulation of iron sulfide on the membrane surface occurred only in the case of uf and caused the fouling fig 9 shows the concentrations of inorganic elements in the permeates collected after 15 days of operation in run 2 it is shown that most of the inorganic elements investigated were present at similar concentrations in all membrane permeates implying that most of them were present in dissolved probably ionic forms it should be noted that concentrations of fe and s in the permeate from mf tank 1 were significantly higher than the concentrations of other elements suggesting the presence of non ionic forms of iron or sulfur in the permeate from mf tank 1 colloidal sulfides including iron sulfide would be present in the permeate from mf tank 1 they could pass through the mf membrane but be retained by the uf membrane these colloidal sulfides presumably caused the severe fouling in uf in run 2 to mitigate such fouling chemicals other than naclo should be used for routine ceb also particle size of inorganic matter in dmf processes should be monitored more intensively for a deeper understanding of fouling in dmf these should be investigated in future studies 3 3 2 differences in permeate quality and organic recovery rate fig 10 shows the cod concentrations in the dmf permeates in run 2 cod concentrations in the dmf permeates obtained with the mf and uf membranes were 33 8 mg l and 29 7 mg l respectively average bod concentrations in the dmf permeates obtained with the mf and the uf membranes were 6 6 and 6 0 mg l respectively concentrations of organic matter in the dmf permeates obtained from mf and uf membranes were similar the benefit of using uf membranes in terms of permeate quality was not obvious fig 11 shows the cod concentration of the concentrated organic matter product in fig 1 in run 2 the units with the mf membrane and the uf membrane produced concentrated organic matter with cod concentrations of 5925 1115 mg l and 6240 995 mg l respectively the corresponding organic recovery rates in dmf using mf and uf were 47 and 49 respectively in run 2 the unit used with the mf membrane was identical to that tested with the pretreatment in run 1 however cod concentration in concentrated organic matter observed with the mf in run 2 5925 mg l was higher than that with the pretreatment in run 1 4902 mg l fig 5 this difference could be attributed to the fact that the feed wastewater used in this study was real municipal wastewater fluctuation in the quality of the feed was inevitable nevertheless a similar level of organic recovery of about 50 was achieved in the two operations conduced in different periods also as mentioned before excellent fouling control was reproduced in the unit operated with the mf membrane in run 2 reduction in cod concentrations in the uf permeate and increase in cod concentration in the organic matter concentrated by the uf membrane were not obvious the severe membrane fouling observed with uf fig 6 cannot be necessarily compensated by those marginal benefits brought by the use of uf based on the results obtained in the present study the use of mf is recommended for dmf however membranes with different pore sizes mwcos might show different results further studies are needed to determine the optimum pore sizes mwcos for dmf that can be generally applied 3 4 biogas production potential of organic matter obtained by dmf with the mbbr pretreatment the ultimate goal of dmf is to generate methane gas from concentrated organic matter for energy conversion compared to the excess sludge generated from activated sludge processes the concentrated organic matter from dmf is expected to have a high potential for production of methane gas this is because excess sludge from activated sludge processes is mainly composed of bacteria and has a complex structure resulting in a low rate of conversion to methane gas qiao et al 2011 whereas concentrated organic matter from dmf is composed of organic matter that is readily biodegradable before being converted into biomass however since biological treatment was applied as a pretreatment for dmf in this study some of the organic matter in the raw wastewater was converted into biomass as mentioned above therefore the methane gas production potential of the concentrated organic matter obtained in this study might be lowered to investigate this point a batch anaerobic digestion test was conducted with the concentrated organic matter obtained in run 2 amounts of methane gas production for a specific mass of vs input were 372 19 ml ch4 g vsfed and 371 10 ml ch4 g vsfed for the organic concentrate obtained with the mf and uf membranes respectively the amount of methane gas production observed in this study was much larger than that observed with the excess sludge generated from the same wastewater treatment plant as that examined in this study 230 ml ch4 g vsfed kimura et al 2021 little difference in methane gas production potential between the mf and uf membranes was observed a similar batch anaerobic digestion test was conducted in a previous study using concentrated organic matter obtained by dmf without pretreatment of the primary effluent of the same treatment plant as that tested in this study the methane gas production in that study was 387 ml ch4 g vsfed kimura et al 2021 although the amount of methane gas production may slightly decrease with implementation of the pretreatment the slight increase in recovery of organic matter with the use of pretreatment section 3 2 2 could offset it to some extent based on the biogas production potential obtained in this study and information that is available in the literature an energy balance in dmf accompanied by the mbbr pretreatment was estimated table 2 summarizes the information used for estimation of the energy balance our proposed dmf shares many aspects with conventional aerobic mbrs therefore energy consumption in dmf was estimated on the basis of information reported for large scale mbrs judd et al 2018 yamashita et al 2019 electricity consumption in the mbbr was estimated from a norwegian design guideline for the mbbr process johannessen 2020 dmf with the mbbr pretreatment can be net energy positive the energy to operate the dmf system 0 062 wh m3 is smaller than that produced from organic matter recovered from wastewater 0 201 kwh m3 it should be noted that wastewater tested in this study collected via a combined sewer was weak the concentration of cod in typical wastewater would be 500 mg l or more mccarty et al 2011 in that case amounts of electricity generated can be easily increased and feasibility of the proposed dmf system can be enhanced 4 conclusion in this study we investigated the effect of mbbr pretreatment on dmf and compared mf uf membranes in terms of membrane fouling organic recovery and permeate quality in dmf the mbbr pretreatment dramatically mitigated membrane fouling in dmf which was explained by removal of small organic molecules and degradation of uv sensitive biopolymers with the pretreatment operation of dmf with a higher flux might be possible and that should be investigated in a future study the pretreatment used in this study selectively degraded dissolved organic matter with low molecular weights and converted it to suspended biomass this resulted in a significant decrease in the concentration of organic matter in the dmf permeate and an increase in the amount of organic matter recoverable by dmf it was thought that inorganic colloids including fes in wastewater could pass through the mf membrane but were retained by the uf membrane resulting in severe fouling in uf compared to dmf using mf dmf using uf improved the quality of permeate and increased the recovery of organic matter however the benefits of the use of uf were limited much less fouling observed with mf supports the use of mf for dmf instead of uf it was confirmed that the mbbr pretreatment had no adverse effect on methane gas generation from the recovered organic matter methods for recovering nutrients from dmf treated water should be examined in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15787,recently the biotransformation of sulfamethoxazole smx by microalgae has attracted increasing interest in particular cytochrome p450 cyp450 has been suggested to be the main enzymatic contributor to this biodegradation however the molecular evidence of cyp450 enzymes being involved in smx biodegradation remains relatively unclear hindering its applicability herein the biodegradation of smx by chlorella sorokiniana c sorokiniana was investigated and comprehensively elucidated the reaction mechanism underlying cyp450 mediated smx metabolism c sorokiniana was able to efficiently remove over 80 of smx mainly through biodegradation in which cyp450 enzymes responded substantially to metabolize smx in cells additionally screening of transformation products tps revealed that n4 hydroxylation smx tp270 was the main tp in the smx biodegradation pathway of microalgae molecular dynamics md simulation suggested that the aniline of smx was the most prone to undergo metabolism while density functional theory dft indicated that smx was metabolized by cyp450 enzymes through h abstraction oh rebound reaction collectively this work reveals key details of the hydroxylamine group of smx elucidates the smx biodegradation pathway involving cyp450 in microalgae in detail and accelerates the development of using microalgae mediated cyp450 to eliminate antibiotics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microalgae antibiotics sulfonamide cytochrome p450 molecular dynamics simulation dft 1 introduction sulfamethoxazole smx a kind of widely prescribed antimicrobial agent is used to treat infectious disease as well as to promote growth in livestock production with a global average annual consumption of over 84 240 tons shao et al 2021 unfortunately only a small amount of smx can be metabolized or absorbed by living systems and consequently about 70 of them are excreted via feces or urine and subsequently discharged into the wastewater treatment plants wwtps cheng et al 2018 moreover due to current wastewater technologies are only insufficiently for removal of such antibiotics substantially high concentrations of smx were

pyrenoidosa pan et al 2021 furthermore more insights have been discovered regarding the elimination routes of antibiotic removal by microalgae demonstrating biodegradation and bioadsorption are the mainly contributor to antibiotic removal xiong et al 2018 it is well known that bioadsorption in microalgae relies on cell wall component and the excretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps to provide adsorption sites xie et al 2020 in contrast biodegradation occurs via enzyme catalyzed metabolic reactions that degrade complex parent compounds resulting in the formation of metabolic intermediates maes et al 2014 the biodegradation mechanism of antibiotics in microalgae is still unclear and the exact role of these corresponding driven enzymes remains elusive cyp450 is a major member of the heme monooxygenase superfamily that can catalyze organic compounds into reactive metabolites through hydroxylation decarboxylation and oxidation guengerich 2018 it is also recognized as the main element of microalgae involved in antibiotics biodegradation pflugmacher and sandermann 1998 however the role of cyp450 in microalgal biodegradation is still ambiguous fang et al 2021 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 until now only few studies speculated the catalytic process of cyp450 based on the proposed pathway for limited organic contaminants for example the presence of distinct cyp450 isoforms has been reported in cultures of chlorella sorokiniana during the n demethylation of metflurazon thies et al 1996 and the epoxidation of antibiotics was attributed to the cyp450 present in chlamydomonas mexicana xiong et al 2016 in other words there remains a large knowledge gap regarding the biodegradation mechanisms e g key catalytic enzymes biodegradation intermediates and remove pathways of antibiotics in microalgae to fill this gap this work aimed to perform a detailed examination of the biodegradation behavior and metabolism of antibiotics by microalgae in wastewater with a deep analysis of the key catalytic role of cyp450 in microalgae as summarized this work clearly investigates the metabolic properties and elimination routes of smx in microalgae demonstrating the key role of cyp450 in the metabolic fate of smx more importantly through molecular dynamics md simulation and density functional theory dft calculation we revealed the reactivity and accessibility of

pbr the artificial wastewater was prepared as characterized in table s2 the smx exposure concentrations were established at 0 1 mg l l smx and 5 mg l h smx and the volume of the solvent spiked into the culture was less than 0 05 v v all the experiments were performed for 10 days and all measurements were conducted in triplicate 2 3 sulfamethoxazole removal to investigate the smx removal pathway in microalgae a series of batch experiments were conducted two groups experiments were carried out to explore the contribution of abiotic degradation photolysis and hydrolysis and biotic degradation biosorption and biodegradation respectively furthermore the removal efficiency in deionized water was also evaluated under the same condition to determine whether the wastewater would affect the smx removal process the microalgae cultivation process and treatments methods are detailed in text s1 2 4 cytochrome p450 enzyme assay to determine the role of cyp450 in the biodegradation of smx the activities of cyp450 levels among treatments were compared to reveal the contribution of cyp450 meanwhile a specific enzyme inhibitor abt was used in the cell culture to monitor the smx biodegradation rate the inhibition test was conducted to explore the change in dissipation of smx biodegradation a detailed experimental process is described in text s2 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 measurement of

according to bradford method and the activity of cyp450 enzyme level was expressed as u mg prot bradford 1976 2 5 3 smx and its transformation products tps analysis concentrations of the parent compound smx was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent technologies santa clara ca usa with an ecc18 column 2 7 mm particle size 4 6 100 mm agilent and the corresponding tps of smx were analyzed by a uplc coupled to a time of flight mass spectrometry in negative ionization mode with an electrospray ionization esi source uplc qtof ms g6540a agilent the detailed operational parameters and data analysis are presented in texts s3 s5 furthermore the ecotoxicity of smx and the biodegraded intermediates were estimated with the ecosar class program version 1 11 as described in text s6 2 6 computational simulation 2 6 1 molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation the initial amino acid sequence of c sorokiniana cyp450 enzyme was downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi https www ncbi nlm nih gov which provides the functional annotation information of the enzyme sequences genbank prw58849 1 the cyp450 enzyme pdb 2ve4 in complex with heme moiety was utilized as a template to build the 3d structure of the cyp450 enzyme through the swiss model server http swissmodel expasy org the crystal structure of the template was obtained from the rcsb protein data bank http www rcsb org pdb in addition the heme moiety structure of the cyp450 enzyme was modeled based on the target template by using the pymol https www pymol org lastly the cyp450 enzyme structure quality was evaluated using the saves program https saves mbi ucla edu fig s5 furthermore to obtain compound i cpd i an oxygen atom was added to the heme moiety fe o bond 1 70 å as the key oxidation reaction of the substrate for the 3d structure of ligand smx gauss view 5 0 8 was used to sketch and optimize its structure dennington et al 2008 then the substrate smx was docked into the cyp450 molecule using auto dock 4 2 morris et al 2009 the best orientation of the conformation complex was selected for subsequent molecular simulation all md simulations were performed using the gromacs 2019 3 package abraham et al 2015 the molecular mechanics generalized born surface area method mm pbsa was used to estimate the binding affinity kumari et al 2014 detailed methods of the cyp450 homology modeling molecular docking and md simulation are provided in texts s7 and s8 2 6 2 dft mechanism calculation the geometry optimization and energy calculations of md simulation system were performed using the gaussian 16 software package frisch et al 2016 additionally this combination of the functional and basis sets used in the present work is consistent with previous studies and demonstrated to be reliable detailed parameters and processes are described in text s9 2 7 statistical analyses all the experimental data are presented with the mean standard values statistically significant effects in smx removal and cyp450 enzyme activities were calculated by origin 2020 originlab northampton ma usa software p 0 05 using one way anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal efficiency and mechanism of smx in microalgae as shown in fig 1 a the microalgal biomass varied non significantly among the control and two smx treatment groups demonstrating that the smx concentration has no obviously inhibition on the cell growth this is consistent with research indicating that c sorokiniana can greatly resist antibiotics with continued excellent growth ability suggesting it has potential to dissipate various kinds of xenobiotics gao et al 2011 song et al 2019 xiong et al 2017 notably after 10 days 86 57 2 8 of removal efficiency was reached in the h smx group whereas only 60 36 2 1 of removal efficiency was observed in the l smx group fig 1b demonstrating that the cellular metabolic activity of c sorokiniana rather than cell biomass determined its ability to biodegrade smx xiong et al 2019 overall the superior smx removal performance may indicated the huge potential of microalgae to treat antibiotics wastewater to better understand the removal mechanism of smx a series of experiments using abiotic biotic and deionized water conditions were then conducted as shown in fig 1c suggesting that the environmental factors i e ionic concentration stirring and co2 aeration did not affect smx degradation moreover the smx degradation through photolysis and hydrolysis was also negligible 1 fig 1d clearly indicating that the biotic reactions were the main routes to smx degradation in microalgae treatments it is known that the biotic pathways to remove antibiotics in microalgae mainly involve biosorption extracellular and biodegradation intracellular tiwari et al 2017 in biosorption extracellular polymeric substances eps are generally considered to be the main biosorption site for antibiotics xiao and zheng 2016 yu 2020 as shown in fig s1 the average protein polysaccharide pn ps of the h smx treatment 0 088 was higher than that of the control indicating that microalgal eps offers sufficient adsorption sites and capacity for smx removal mei et al 2009 additionally 3d eem analysis further indicated that proteins substances tryptophan like in eps were found to effectively adsorption smx fig s2 nevertheless there is no obviously differences in the adsorption percentage of smx were observed between the two smx groups in which all less than 10 table s5 thus smx removal here was mainly achieved by biodegradation and its biotransformation followed a first order reaction model notably compared with the l smx group the biodegradation of smx in the h smx group reached 80 which was 1 39 times that of the l smx group table s6 this difference may indicate that the intracellular enzymes in cells play an important role in the degradation process 3 2 role of cyp p450 in smx biodegradation as shown in fig 2 a the cyp450 activity in the two smx groups increased more significantly than that in the control reasoning that cyp450 might be the main functional enzyme to the biodegradation metabolism of smx in microalgae additionally rather than microalgal biomass fig 1a the cyp450 activity highly responded to smx concentration the h smx group was 36 higher than the l smx group fig 2b confirming that cyp450 enzyme is largely responsible for degrading smx to further dissect the role of the cyp450 enzyme in smx biodegradation we performed enzyme inhibition experiments with a nonselective substrate inhibitor 1 aminobenzotriazole abt as reported abt is often used in plant microalgae experiments to explore the potential role of cyp450s in the catalytic or degradation of organic pollutions chen et al 2017 as shown in fig s3 abt had nearly no influence for the growth of microalgae in comparison with control group but significantly inhibited the activity of cyp450 with increased concentrations therefore 5 μmol l was selected for further degradation experiments with abt addition we observed that the removal efficiency and specific biotransformation rate of smx were lower than control no abt addition fig 2c and table s1 especially at high concentration of smx abt significantly inhibited the removal efficiency of h smx 14 fig 2d similarly a significant decrease in smx removal after cyp450 inhibitor addition in the sludge system jia et al 2019 corroborated by the observation of abt inhibition therefore the cyp450 enzyme in microalgae can play a vital role in intracellular smx biodegradation 3 3 proposed biodegradation pathway of smx by microalgae and toxicity assessment of its intermediates to further understand the metabolic role of cyp450 participated on degrading smx the transformation products tps associated with the possible degradation pathways of smx were then examined with an uplc qtof ms fig s4 and table s7 it was proposed that the biodegradation of smx in microalgae mainly involved two pathways based on the chemical structure of smx a aniline hydroxylation and b isoxazole ring opening fig 3 a based on the uplb qtof ms results most tps were obtained via pathway a involving the aniline ring moiety of smx in pathway a smx was initially oxidized into electrophilic intermediates to produce n4 hydroxyl smx a tp1 m z 270 product n4 hydroxyl smx is generally associated with cyp450 enzyme as it is involved in a typical smx biodegradation process in human liver microbes cribb et al 1992 furthermore cyp450 enzyme was also recognized to have a key role in hydroxylation of aniline in activated sludge zhang et al 2020 notably it is the first time that n4 hydroxyl smx was detected in microalgae which may result in better smx biodegradation as mentioned above because n4 hydroxyl smx may be more reactive and readily went through further biodegradation process than smx owing to its hydroxyl groups cheng et al 2021 as expected further reactions of the pa1 pa3 pathways detected in this work corroborate this view in pathway a1 hydroxy sulfanilic acid a1 tp1 m z 191 and 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole a1 tp2 m z 99 intermediates were observed due to the s n bond breaking of a tp1 as reported the hydroxylation of smx is significant in s n bond cleavage song et al 2021 the s atom on smx is the most favorable site for cleavage owing to its susceptibleness and fragility yin et al 2017 in pathway a2 n4 nitro smx a2 tp2 m z 284 is the common degradation intermediate detected in previous literature that could be directly formed from the parent compound xiong et al 2019 notably as reported for smx metabolism by ammonia oxidizing bacteria smx might be processed through multiple biodegradation steps before forming n4 nitro smx bonvin et al 2013 kassotaki et al 2016 however little is known about the association of n4 nitro smx with smx biodegradation in microalgae in this work the hnoh moiety of a tp1 was further converted into n4 nitroso smx a2 tp1 m z 268 under the action of nadph followed by the oxidation on the nitroso group to formate the more stable n4 nitro smx liu et al 2017 tailor et al 2019 however the n4 nitroso smx intermediate was not detected in the present work most likely owing to its quick transformation into other degradation intermediates e g n4 smx glutathione conjugate callan et al 2009 dudley et al 2018 in pathway a3 a novel biodegradation process base on a tp1 was observed including oxidation cleavage and hydroxylation it was previously reported that n4 formyl smx a3 tp1 m z 282 degradation in activated sludge can be formed directly from smx or as part of the pterin conjugate pathway achermann et al 2018 notable our results suggest that n4 formyl smx was produced by the addition of a ch2 group and oxidation at the hydroxylamine functional group of a tp1 wang and wang 2018 in good agreement with previous research dulieu et al 2019 afterwards formyl group oxidation mainly occurred in the a3 tp1 intermediate producing ac oh smx a3 tp2 m z 312 which can be further converted into hydroxy smx a3 tp3 m z 255 and glycine a3 tp4 m z 155 through hydroxylation benzene ring and cn bond cleavage respectively following this glycine was then metabolized by microalgae in the final step additionally a dominant cleavage pathway of smx was also observed including γ α and ε cleavage the cn bond of n4 formyl smx was broken and subsequently formed the n4 formyl sfa a3 tp5 m z 201 intermediate additionally the a3 tp5 intermediate was transformed to n4 formyl bqi a3 tp6 m z 138 through ε cleavage c s bond which further generated bqi a3 tp7 m z 108 through the formyl group breaking the c n bond critically a similar reaction pathway was observed here indicating bond cleavage is an important elimination pathway for smx in microalgae xiong et al 2020 overall these inferred reactions in pathway a clearly demonstrate that n4 hydroxyl smx as the key intermediate mediated via cyp450 played an irreplaceable role in smx biodegradation in pathway b tps were mainly formed from isoxazole ring reactions this pathway followed three continuous steps involving the dihydroxylation of the isoxazole ring on smx the opening of the ring isoxazole structure and direct sulfonamide bond cleavage ouyang et al 2021 initially the b tp1 m z 288 intermediate is a di hydroxylated derivative with hydroxylation occurring at the isoxazole moiety of smx which is an often detected intermediate of smx metabolism in activated sludge system jia et al 2017 thereafter the b tp2 m z 274 intermediate was inferred to result from the fracture of no bond isoxazole ring group of b tp1 m z 288 via further oxidation which was attributed to being catalyzed by nadh dependent reductase zhang et al 2008 another ring opening intermediate at the same site b tp4 m z 256 was identified as the reductive cleavage of isoxazole moiety the formation of b tp4 has also been reported in a microbial anaerobic system which was initiated by the cleavage of the no bond through nucleophilic attack by a reducing agent on the n atom ouyang et al 2021 subsequently both b tp2 and b tp4 intermediates were easily cleaved by various oxidants resulting in the generation of the b tp3 m z 156 intermediate which is similar to pathway a1 yang et al 2017 additionally we used ecosar program to evaluate the toxicity of smx and its biodegradation intermediates to three aquatic species fish daphnia and green algae in this study the toxicity classification of intermediates was assessed by the calculated ig lc50 ec50 values and classified as very toxic ig lc50 ec50 0 mg l toxic 0 mg l ig lc50 ec50 1 mg l harmful 1 mg l ig lc50 ec50 2 mg l and not harmful 2 mg l ig lc50 ec50 gao et al 2014 as shown in fig 3b the chronic toxicity values for smx were predicted to be 0 70 mg l for fish 1 05 mg l for green algae and 1 17 mg l for daphnia suggesting that smx may present a potential ecological risk for pathway a the acute and chronic toxicity of all intermediates were decreased to varying degrees compared to the parent smx except for a2 tp2 whose the chronic toxicity to fish ig lc50 0 48 mg l was greater than smx ig lc50 0 70 mg l besides the chronic toxicity of a tp1 a3 tp1 and a3 tp3 remained at a toxic level without exhibiting considerable toxicity table s8 by contrast the toxicity of all intermediates from pathway b remained at a merely harmful or not harmful level regardless of the acute and chronic toxicity from the perspective of ecological safety these results implied that smx biodegradation by microalgae can effectively meet the practical demands of an environmental assessment in contrast with previous studies we here portray a comparatively integrated metabolic picture of smx biodegradation these pathways plausibly explain how cyp450 enzyme function in smx biodegradation in a way that is consistent with both the enzymatic activity assay and batch inhibition test shown in fig 2 furthermore n4 hydroxyl smx was the key intermediate among all of the aforementioned pathways which could be directly catalyzed by cyp450 enzyme however a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions between smx and cyp450 enzyme still requires further investigation 3 4 molecular observation of the interaction between cyp450 and smx and its catalytic mechanism although cyp450 is capable of oxidizing many exogenous compounds shaik et al 2007 yu et al 2021 the molecular mechanism of cyp450 mediated smx biodegradation remains unclear to further verify this we predicted the potential metabolism site between cyp450 and smx via molecular docking and md simulation the most favorable conformation based on top scores from the docking analysis was selected as a representative subject for md simulation to analyze the binding mechanism of the complex the general stability and conformational change of the cyp450 smx complex were analyzed by rmsd rg and rmsf based on the md trajectories rmsd demonstrates that the system entered a convergent after approximately 70 ns suggesting the conformational appeared to be relatively stable fig s6 rg is an important indicator to judge whether the system reaches a stable conformation which reflects the compactness of protein structure fig s7 shows that the rg value of cyp450 smx during all simulations fluctuated between 2 19 2 24 nm indicating a reasonably well folded cyp450 smx besides the average rg value of the cyp450 smx 2 14 nm was lower than that of the apo cyp450 2 17 nm hence verifying the stability of the cyp450 enzyme while binding to smx rmsf is widely employed to describe the fluctuation of individual residue during the simulation to reflect the protein structural changes it is generally believed that a high frequency of amino acid fluctuation indicates that the protein has relative flexibility and vice versa bahaman et al 2021 rmsf profiles show that a slightly decreased rmsf value of the residues 60 90 and 170 230 led to a limited movement in the cyp450 smx system compared to those of the apo cyp450 proving the cyp450 can be tightly bonded to smx fig s8 these results demonstrate that the conformation was suitable for performing the binding pattern analysis furthermore cyp450 undergoing conformational changes upon binding with smx in its original state may indicate the catalytic effect of cyp450 via binding ability between them accordingly the conformation showed that the substrate was positioned into the center of key metabolic hub for regulating the activation of cyp450 enzyme while the aniline of smx was more favorably oriented toward cpd i fig 4 a the oxidized site for the metabolism was defined by the distance between the oxygen atom of feiv o in cpd i and the possible reaction site of the substrate de graaf et al 2006 sykes et al 2008 vasanthanathan et al 2009 hence the distance between n atom smx and o atom cpd i was stable at approximately 3 10 å during the dynamic process and the related angle between the two action sites was in the range of 137 5 demonstrating that the metabolic reaction can easily occur fig 4b to better explain the interaction between cyp450 and smx we used the mm pbsa method to calculated the free binding energy which involved the van der waals interaction electrostatic interaction and polar solvation and nonpolar solvation interaction lin et al 2021 binding energy analysis shows that the binding energy of complex was estimated to be 21 61 5 6 kcal mol indicating that smx could be strongly bound to the cyp450 enzyme fig s9 in terms of energy contribution the electrostatic energy 23 48 7 4 kcal mol and non polar free energy 10 14 5 4 kcal mol contributed relatively less for the formation of the complex compared to other binding energies the van der waals interaction was 92 55 17 2 kcal mol which showed a significant impact on the complex binding energies thus the van der waals interaction was the source of the main driving energy responsible for the formation of cyp450 smx which can characterize the strength of hydrophobic interaction between the complex we also evaluated the contribution of the cyp450 residue to the binding of smx by further residue energy decomposition generally a residue with binding energy contribution less than 1 0 kcal mol is considered as the main residue for exploring the molecular recognition of small molecular on enzyme cao et al 2019 in figs 4c and s10 a residue decomposition of cyp450 enzyme illustrated that lys58 arg60 lys73 val84 arg168 thr237 and ala284 were from 1 17 to 7 53 kcal mol which provided the largest contribution to the binding free energy for smx among them arg60 lys73 and val84 are located at the entrance of the cavity and have strong affinity though electrostatic interaction and van der waals interaction additionally the smx sulfonyl group and pyrimidine ring could participate in the h bonding interaction with the amino and guanidino groups in ala72 and arg168 and the distances were 3 1 and 3 0 å respectively which tightly and effectively bound smx to cyp450 fig 4d another hydrogen bond formed with cpd i oxygen played a crucial role in the smx catalytic process meanwhile pi akyl hydrophobic interaction was observed between the alkyl atoms val232 ala233 and ala284 and the benzene and pyrimidine ring of smx which verified their influence on the orientation of smx and promoted a catalytic conformation other hydrophobic interaction residues like val69 gly71 val84 and leu229 surrounded with the active site of cyp450 enzymes can also support the favorable smx catalytic orientation fig 4e together these results provide an understanding of how cyp450 interacted with smx clearly indicating that the orientation and accessibility of nitrogen on the amine of smx toward the cpd i of cyp450 were determinants for cyp catalyzed oxidation of smx leth et al 2019 to precisely explore the metabolic site and the mechanism of smx n4 hydroxylation the potential energy profile and structure for smx by cyp450 were also calculated fig 4f regarding the hydroxylation reaction of cyp450 e g aromatic hydrocarbon alkanes revealing that the doublet state of cyp450 is beneficial for the rebound step shaik et al 2005 zhang et al 2021 we focused on the low spin state of cpd i and results suggested the hydrogen abstraction and rebound was the main mechanism of smx n4 hydroxylation by cyp450 fig 4g the reaction started from the reactant complex rc in which the hydrogen atom abstracted from the n amino was 1 19 å away from the feiv o moiety in cpd i furthermore the transition state ts1 of the h abstraction pathway was determined by the approximate linearity n h o angle 169 4 the intermediate complex imh was formated through the h abstraction transition state ts1 then after im was generated the oh radical rebounds from feiv oh onto the substrate radical the energy barrier of the rebound pathway 15 8 kcal mol was dramatically lower than that of the hydrogen abstraction step 19 3 kcal mol suggesting that hydrogen abstraction plays a decisive role in the metabolic reaction of smx it has been previously demonstrated that the key rate limiting step of cyp450 catalyzed hydroxylation is the hydrogen abstraction zhang et al 2018 the above calculation indicated that the hydroxylation reaction of smx aniline ring catalyzed by cyp450 was highly probable corresponding with the position nearest to cyp450 reactive center cpd i as revealed by md simulation 4 conclusion this work is among the first studies to systemically investigate the potential biodegradation mechanism of smx by microalgae clearly identifying the key role of cyp450 in intracellular degradation of smx the experimental results suggested that the clear pattern of cyp450 activity variation was strongly associated with the biodegradation of smx a key n4 hydroxylated product a tp1 m z 270 formed via pathway a clearly corroborated the role of cyp450 in smx metabolism through detailed examination of the tps produced during microalgal biodegradation the md simulation associated with dft was accessed from a molecular perspective to elucidate the importance of cyp450 mediated smx degradation fig 5 md simulation provided an in depth analysis of the binding mode of the smx interaction with cyp450 clearly indicating the aniline ring site was easily accessible for the metabolism more precisely dft theoretical calculation indicated that the proposed degradation pathway of smx by cyp450 was convincible under the given binding mode of md simulation providing new mechanistic insights into the direct hydroxylation of the smx mechanism collectively the revealed insights into the cyp450 mediated enzymatic degradation pathway indicated by this work will inform advances in the enhancement and application of microalgae based antibiotic biodegradation especially with regard to wastewater

15787,recently the biotransformation of sulfamethoxazole smx by microalgae has attracted increasing interest in particular cytochrome p450 cyp450 has been suggested to be the main enzymatic contributor to this biodegradation however the molecular evidence of cyp450 enzymes being involved in smx biodegradation remains relatively unclear hindering its applicability herein the biodegradation of smx by chlorella sorokiniana c sorokiniana was investigated and comprehensively elucidated the reaction mechanism underlying cyp450 mediated smx metabolism c sorokiniana was able to efficiently remove over 80 of smx mainly through biodegradation in which cyp450 enzymes responded substantially to metabolize smx in cells additionally screening of transformation products tps revealed that n4 hydroxylation smx tp270 was the main tp in the smx biodegradation pathway of microalgae molecular dynamics md simulation suggested that the aniline of smx was the most prone to undergo metabolism while density functional theory dft indicated that smx was metabolized by cyp450 enzymes through h abstraction oh rebound reaction collectively this work reveals key details of the hydroxylamine group of smx elucidates the smx biodegradation pathway involving cyp450 in microalgae in detail and accelerates the development of using microalgae mediated cyp450 to eliminate antibiotics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microalgae antibiotics sulfonamide cytochrome p450 molecular dynamics simulation dft 1 introduction sulfamethoxazole smx a kind of widely prescribed antimicrobial agent is used to treat infectious disease as well as to promote growth in livestock production with a global average annual consumption of over 84 240 tons shao et al 2021 unfortunately only a small amount of smx can be metabolized or absorbed by living systems and consequently about 70 of them are excreted via feces or urine and subsequently discharged into the wastewater treatment plants wwtps cheng et al 2018 moreover due to current wastewater technologies are only insufficiently for removal of such antibiotics substantially high concentrations of smx were widely detected in the effluent of medical industrial 28 000 49 000 ng l khan et al 2013 municipal sewage 80 450 ng l carneiro et al 2022 and livestock farm discharges 440 8840 ng l etc wei et al 2011 notably the residues of smx in wwtps inevitably lead to the transmission of antibiotic resistant genes and super bacteria posing a severe risk to the ecological environment and public health li et al 2021 microalgae as a sustainable alternative for biological wastewater treatment which was verified effectively eliminate many kinds of antibiotics wang et al 2016 li et al 2022 as reported chlamydomonas sp tai 03 removed 100 of ciprofloxacin from synthetic wastewater xie et al 2020 the concentration of tetracycline decreased from 10 mg l to 0 65 mg l achieving 93 9 removal by chlorella pyrenoidosa pan et al 2021 furthermore more insights have been discovered regarding the elimination routes of antibiotic removal by microalgae demonstrating biodegradation and bioadsorption are the mainly contributor to antibiotic removal xiong et al 2018 it is well known that bioadsorption in microalgae relies on cell wall component and the excretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps to provide adsorption sites xie et al 2020 in contrast biodegradation occurs via enzyme catalyzed metabolic reactions that degrade complex parent compounds resulting in the formation of metabolic intermediates maes et al 2014 the biodegradation mechanism of antibiotics in microalgae is still unclear and the exact role of these corresponding driven enzymes remains elusive cyp450 is a major member of the heme monooxygenase superfamily that can catalyze organic compounds into reactive metabolites through hydroxylation decarboxylation and oxidation guengerich 2018 it is also recognized as the main element of microalgae involved in antibiotics biodegradation pflugmacher and sandermann 1998 however the role of cyp450 in microalgal biodegradation is still ambiguous fang et al 2021 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 until now only few studies speculated the catalytic process of cyp450 based on the proposed pathway for limited organic contaminants for example the presence of distinct cyp450 isoforms has been reported in cultures of chlorella sorokiniana during the n demethylation of metflurazon thies et al 1996 and the epoxidation of antibiotics was attributed to the cyp450 present in chlamydomonas mexicana xiong et al 2016 in other words there remains a large knowledge gap regarding the biodegradation mechanisms e g key catalytic enzymes biodegradation intermediates and remove pathways of antibiotics in microalgae to fill this gap this work aimed to perform a detailed examination of the biodegradation behavior and metabolism of antibiotics by microalgae in wastewater with a deep analysis of the key catalytic role of cyp450 in microalgae as summarized this work clearly investigates the metabolic properties and elimination routes of smx in microalgae demonstrating the key role of cyp450 in the metabolic fate of smx more importantly through molecular dynamics md simulation and density functional theory dft calculation we revealed the reactivity and accessibility of cyp450 mediated smx metabolism thus elucidating the cyp450 catalytic reaction mechanism of smx collectively this work clarifies the role of cyp450 in the intracellular biodegradation of smx in microalgae and improves our fundamental understanding of the biotransformation of pollutants during microalgal wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sulfamethoxazole smx purity 99 5 table s1 and 1 aminobenzotriazole abt were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa all the other chemicals were of analytical reagent grade which purchased from damao chemical reagent factory tianjin china deionized water and ultrapure water used in this study were produced from milli q system us millipore bedford ma usa 2 2 experimental design the microalgae c sorokiniana freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology wuhan china was axenically pre incubated in bg11 medium at 30 c 200 μmol m2 s and 200 rpm under 2 co2 and with a specialized 0 5 l photobioreactor pbr the artificial wastewater was prepared as characterized in table s2 the smx exposure concentrations were established at 0 1 mg l l smx and 5 mg l h smx and the volume of the solvent spiked into the culture was less than 0 05 v v all the experiments were performed for 10 days and all measurements were conducted in triplicate 2 3 sulfamethoxazole removal to investigate the smx removal pathway in microalgae a series of batch experiments were conducted two groups experiments were carried out to explore the contribution of abiotic degradation photolysis and hydrolysis and biotic degradation biosorption and biodegradation respectively furthermore the removal efficiency in deionized water was also evaluated under the same condition to determine whether the wastewater would affect the smx removal process the microalgae cultivation process and treatments methods are detailed in text s1 2 4 cytochrome p450 enzyme assay to determine the role of cyp450 in the biodegradation of smx the activities of cyp450 levels among treatments were compared to reveal the contribution of cyp450 meanwhile a specific enzyme inhibitor abt was used in the cell culture to monitor the smx biodegradation rate the inhibition test was conducted to explore the change in dissipation of smx biodegradation a detailed experimental process is described in text s2 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 measurement of cell growth the microalgae growth was monitored by a uvmini 1240 spectrophotometer shimadzu japan which measure the optical density of the sample at 680 nm and converted to a biomass concentration via the following equation dry cell weight g l 0 125 xo d 680 r 2 0 992 2 5 2 cytochrome p450 enzyme activity detection the cyp450 enzymatic activity of c sorokiniana was monitored using the corresponding kit enzymatic assays were measured at 37 c by recording the absorbance at 450 nm with an infinite m1000 plate reader tecan männedorf switzerland the total soluble protein concentration was determinate according to bradford method and the activity of cyp450 enzyme level was expressed as u mg prot bradford 1976 2 5 3 smx and its transformation products tps analysis concentrations of the parent compound smx was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent technologies santa clara ca usa with an ecc18 column 2 7 mm particle size 4 6 100 mm agilent and the corresponding tps of smx were analyzed by a uplc coupled to a time of flight mass spectrometry in negative ionization mode with an electrospray ionization esi source uplc qtof ms g6540a agilent the detailed operational parameters and data analysis are presented in texts s3 s5 furthermore the ecotoxicity of smx and the biodegraded intermediates were estimated with the ecosar class program version 1 11 as described in text s6 2 6 computational simulation 2 6 1 molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation the initial amino acid sequence of c sorokiniana cyp450 enzyme was downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi https www ncbi nlm nih gov which provides the functional annotation information of the enzyme sequences genbank prw58849 1 the cyp450 enzyme pdb 2ve4 in complex with heme moiety was utilized as a template to build the 3d structure of the cyp450 enzyme through the swiss model server http swissmodel expasy org the crystal structure of the template was obtained from the rcsb protein data bank http www rcsb org pdb in addition the heme moiety structure of the cyp450 enzyme was modeled based on the target template by using the pymol https www pymol org lastly the cyp450 enzyme structure quality was evaluated using the saves program https saves mbi ucla edu fig s5 furthermore to obtain compound i cpd i an oxygen atom was added to the heme moiety fe o bond 1 70 å as the key oxidation reaction of the substrate for the 3d structure of ligand smx gauss view 5 0 8 was used to sketch and optimize its structure dennington et al 2008 then the substrate smx was docked into the cyp450 molecule using auto dock 4 2 morris et al 2009 the best orientation of the conformation complex was selected for subsequent molecular simulation all md simulations were performed using the gromacs 2019 3 package abraham et al 2015 the molecular mechanics generalized born surface area method mm pbsa was used to estimate the binding affinity kumari et al 2014 detailed methods of the cyp450 homology modeling molecular docking and md simulation are provided in texts s7 and s8 2 6 2 dft mechanism calculation the geometry optimization and energy calculations of md simulation system were performed using the gaussian 16 software package frisch et al 2016 additionally this combination of the functional and basis sets used in the present work is consistent with previous studies and demonstrated to be reliable detailed parameters and processes are described in text s9 2 7 statistical analyses all the experimental data are presented with the mean standard values statistically significant effects in smx removal and cyp450 enzyme activities were calculated by origin 2020 originlab northampton ma usa software p 0 05 using one way anova 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal efficiency and mechanism of smx in microalgae as shown in fig 1 a the microalgal biomass varied non significantly among the control and two smx treatment groups demonstrating that the smx concentration has no obviously inhibition on the cell growth this is consistent with research indicating that c sorokiniana can greatly resist antibiotics with continued excellent growth ability suggesting it has potential to dissipate various kinds of xenobiotics gao et al 2011 song et al 2019 xiong et al 2017 notably after 10 days 86 57 2 8 of removal efficiency was reached in the h smx group whereas only 60 36 2 1 of removal efficiency was observed in the l smx group fig 1b demonstrating that the cellular metabolic activity of c sorokiniana rather than cell biomass determined its ability to biodegrade smx xiong et al 2019 overall the superior smx removal performance may indicated the huge potential of microalgae to treat antibiotics wastewater to better understand the removal mechanism of smx a series of experiments using abiotic biotic and deionized water conditions were then conducted as shown in fig 1c suggesting that the environmental factors i e ionic concentration stirring and co2 aeration did not affect smx degradation moreover the smx degradation through photolysis and hydrolysis was also negligible 1 fig 1d clearly indicating that the biotic reactions were the main routes to smx degradation in microalgae treatments it is known that the biotic pathways to remove antibiotics in microalgae mainly involve biosorption extracellular and biodegradation intracellular tiwari et al 2017 in biosorption extracellular polymeric substances eps are generally considered to be the main biosorption site for antibiotics xiao and zheng 2016 yu 2020 as shown in fig s1 the average protein polysaccharide pn ps of the h smx treatment 0 088 was higher than that of the control indicating that microalgal eps offers sufficient adsorption sites and capacity for smx removal mei et al 2009 additionally 3d eem analysis further indicated that proteins substances tryptophan like in eps were found to effectively adsorption smx fig s2 nevertheless there is no obviously differences in the adsorption percentage of smx were observed between the two smx groups in which all less than 10 table s5 thus smx removal here was mainly achieved by biodegradation and its biotransformation followed a first order reaction model notably compared with the l smx group the biodegradation of smx in the h smx group reached 80 which was 1 39 times that of the l smx group table s6 this difference may indicate that the intracellular enzymes in cells play an important role in the degradation process 3 2 role of cyp p450 in smx biodegradation as shown in fig 2 a the cyp450 activity in the two smx groups increased more significantly than that in the control reasoning that cyp450 might be the main functional enzyme to the biodegradation metabolism of smx in microalgae additionally rather than microalgal biomass fig 1a the cyp450 activity highly responded to smx concentration the h smx group was 36 higher than the l smx group fig 2b confirming that cyp450 enzyme is largely responsible for degrading smx to further dissect the role of the cyp450 enzyme in smx biodegradation we performed enzyme inhibition experiments with a nonselective substrate inhibitor 1 aminobenzotriazole abt as reported abt is often used in plant microalgae experiments to explore the potential role of cyp450s in the catalytic or degradation of organic pollutions chen et al 2017 as shown in fig s3 abt had nearly no influence for the growth of microalgae in comparison with control group but significantly inhibited the activity of cyp450 with increased concentrations therefore 5 μmol l was selected for further degradation experiments with abt addition we observed that the removal efficiency and specific biotransformation rate of smx were lower than control no abt addition fig 2c and table s1 especially at high concentration of smx abt significantly inhibited the removal efficiency of h smx 14 fig 2d similarly a significant decrease in smx removal after cyp450 inhibitor addition in the sludge system jia et al 2019 corroborated by the observation of abt inhibition therefore the cyp450 enzyme in microalgae can play a vital role in intracellular smx biodegradation 3 3 proposed biodegradation pathway of smx by microalgae and toxicity assessment of its intermediates to further understand the metabolic role of cyp450 participated on degrading smx the transformation products tps associated with the possible degradation pathways of smx were then examined with an uplc qtof ms fig s4 and table s7 it was proposed that the biodegradation of smx in microalgae mainly involved two pathways based on the chemical structure of smx a aniline hydroxylation and b isoxazole ring opening fig 3 a based on the uplb qtof ms results most tps were obtained via pathway a involving the aniline ring moiety of smx in pathway a smx was initially oxidized into electrophilic intermediates to produce n4 hydroxyl smx a tp1 m z 270 product n4 hydroxyl smx is generally associated with cyp450 enzyme as it is involved in a typical smx biodegradation process in human liver microbes cribb et al 1992 furthermore cyp450 enzyme was also recognized to have a key role in hydroxylation of aniline in activated sludge zhang et al 2020 notably it is the first time that n4 hydroxyl smx was detected in microalgae which may result in better smx biodegradation as mentioned above because n4 hydroxyl smx may be more reactive and readily went through further biodegradation process than smx owing to its hydroxyl groups cheng et al 2021 as expected further reactions of the pa1 pa3 pathways detected in this work corroborate this view in pathway a1 hydroxy sulfanilic acid a1 tp1 m z 191 and 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole a1 tp2 m z 99 intermediates were observed due to the s n bond breaking of a tp1 as reported the hydroxylation of smx is significant in s n bond cleavage song et al 2021 the s atom on smx is the most favorable site for cleavage owing to its susceptibleness and fragility yin et al 2017 in pathway a2 n4 nitro smx a2 tp2 m z 284 is the common degradation intermediate detected in previous literature that could be directly formed from the parent compound xiong et al 2019 notably as reported for smx metabolism by ammonia oxidizing bacteria smx might be processed through multiple biodegradation steps before forming n4 nitro smx bonvin et al 2013 kassotaki et al 2016 however little is known about the association of n4 nitro smx with smx biodegradation in microalgae in this work the hnoh moiety of a tp1 was further converted into n4 nitroso smx a2 tp1 m z 268 under the action of nadph followed by the oxidation on the nitroso group to formate the more stable n4 nitro smx liu et al 2017 tailor et al 2019 however the n4 nitroso smx intermediate was not detected in the present work most likely owing to its quick transformation into other degradation intermediates e g n4 smx glutathione conjugate callan et al 2009 dudley et al 2018 in pathway a3 a novel biodegradation process base on a tp1 was observed including oxidation cleavage and hydroxylation it was previously reported that n4 formyl smx a3 tp1 m z 282 degradation in activated sludge can be formed directly from smx or as part of the pterin conjugate pathway achermann et al 2018 notable our results suggest that n4 formyl smx was produced by the addition of a ch2 group and oxidation at the hydroxylamine functional group of a tp1 wang and wang 2018 in good agreement with previous research dulieu et al 2019 afterwards formyl group oxidation mainly occurred in the a3 tp1 intermediate producing ac oh smx a3 tp2 m z 312 which can be further converted into hydroxy smx a3 tp3 m z 255 and glycine a3 tp4 m z 155 through hydroxylation benzene ring and cn bond cleavage respectively following this glycine was then metabolized by microalgae in the final step additionally a dominant cleavage pathway of smx was also observed including γ α and ε cleavage the cn bond of n4 formyl smx was broken and subsequently formed the n4 formyl sfa a3 tp5 m z 201 intermediate additionally the a3 tp5 intermediate was transformed to n4 formyl bqi a3 tp6 m z 138 through ε cleavage c s bond which further generated bqi a3 tp7 m z 108 through the formyl group breaking the c n bond critically a similar reaction pathway was observed here indicating bond cleavage is an important elimination pathway for smx in microalgae xiong et al 2020 overall these inferred reactions in pathway a clearly demonstrate that n4 hydroxyl smx as the key intermediate mediated via cyp450 played an irreplaceable role in smx biodegradation in pathway b tps were mainly formed from isoxazole ring reactions this pathway followed three continuous steps involving the dihydroxylation of the isoxazole ring on smx the opening of the ring isoxazole structure and direct sulfonamide bond cleavage ouyang et al 2021 initially the b tp1 m z 288 intermediate is a di hydroxylated derivative with hydroxylation occurring at the isoxazole moiety of smx which is an often detected intermediate of smx metabolism in activated sludge system jia et al 2017 thereafter the b tp2 m z 274 intermediate was inferred to result from the fracture of no bond isoxazole ring group of b tp1 m z 288 via further oxidation which was attributed to being catalyzed by nadh dependent reductase zhang et al 2008 another ring opening intermediate at the same site b tp4 m z 256 was identified as the reductive cleavage of isoxazole moiety the formation of b tp4 has also been reported in a microbial anaerobic system which was initiated by the cleavage of the no bond through nucleophilic attack by a reducing agent on the n atom ouyang et al 2021 subsequently both b tp2 and b tp4 intermediates were easily cleaved by various oxidants resulting in the generation of the b tp3 m z 156 intermediate which is similar to pathway a1 yang et al 2017 additionally we used ecosar program to evaluate the toxicity of smx and its biodegradation intermediates to three aquatic species fish daphnia and green algae in this study the toxicity classification of intermediates was assessed by the calculated ig lc50 ec50 values and classified as very toxic ig lc50 ec50 0 mg l toxic 0 mg l ig lc50 ec50 1 mg l harmful 1 mg l ig lc50 ec50 2 mg l and not harmful 2 mg l ig lc50 ec50 gao et al 2014 as shown in fig 3b the chronic toxicity values for smx were predicted to be 0 70 mg l for fish 1 05 mg l for green algae and 1 17 mg l for daphnia suggesting that smx may present a potential ecological risk for pathway a the acute and chronic toxicity of all intermediates were decreased to varying degrees compared to the parent smx except for a2 tp2 whose the chronic toxicity to fish ig lc50 0 48 mg l was greater than smx ig lc50 0 70 mg l besides the chronic toxicity of a tp1 a3 tp1 and a3 tp3 remained at a toxic level without exhibiting considerable toxicity table s8 by contrast the toxicity of all intermediates from pathway b remained at a merely harmful or not harmful level regardless of the acute and chronic toxicity from the perspective of ecological safety these results implied that smx biodegradation by microalgae can effectively meet the practical demands of an environmental assessment in contrast with previous studies we here portray a comparatively integrated metabolic picture of smx biodegradation these pathways plausibly explain how cyp450 enzyme function in smx biodegradation in a way that is consistent with both the enzymatic activity assay and batch inhibition test shown in fig 2 furthermore n4 hydroxyl smx was the key intermediate among all of the aforementioned pathways which could be directly catalyzed by cyp450 enzyme however a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions between smx and cyp450 enzyme still requires further investigation 3 4 molecular observation of the interaction between cyp450 and smx and its catalytic mechanism although cyp450 is capable of oxidizing many exogenous compounds shaik et al 2007 yu et al 2021 the molecular mechanism of cyp450 mediated smx biodegradation remains unclear to further verify this we predicted the potential metabolism site between cyp450 and smx via molecular docking and md simulation the most favorable conformation based on top scores from the docking analysis was selected as a representative subject for md simulation to analyze the binding mechanism of the complex the general stability and conformational change of the cyp450 smx complex were analyzed by rmsd rg and rmsf based on the md trajectories rmsd demonstrates that the system entered a convergent after approximately 70 ns suggesting the conformational appeared to be relatively stable fig s6 rg is an important indicator to judge whether the system reaches a stable conformation which reflects the compactness of protein structure fig s7 shows that the rg value of cyp450 smx during all simulations fluctuated between 2 19 2 24 nm indicating a reasonably well folded cyp450 smx besides the average rg value of the cyp450 smx 2 14 nm was lower than that of the apo cyp450 2 17 nm hence verifying the stability of the cyp450 enzyme while binding to smx rmsf is widely employed to describe the fluctuation of individual residue during the simulation to reflect the protein structural changes it is generally believed that a high frequency of amino acid fluctuation indicates that the protein has relative flexibility and vice versa bahaman et al 2021 rmsf profiles show that a slightly decreased rmsf value of the residues 60 90 and 170 230 led to a limited movement in the cyp450 smx system compared to those of the apo cyp450 proving the cyp450 can be tightly bonded to smx fig s8 these results demonstrate that the conformation was suitable for performing the binding pattern analysis furthermore cyp450 undergoing conformational changes upon binding with smx in its original state may indicate the catalytic effect of cyp450 via binding ability between them accordingly the conformation showed that the substrate was positioned into the center of key metabolic hub for regulating the activation of cyp450 enzyme while the aniline of smx was more favorably oriented toward cpd i fig 4 a the oxidized site for the metabolism was defined by the distance between the oxygen atom of feiv o in cpd i and the possible reaction site of the substrate de graaf et al 2006 sykes et al 2008 vasanthanathan et al 2009 hence the distance between n atom smx and o atom cpd i was stable at approximately 3 10 å during the dynamic process and the related angle between the two action sites was in the range of 137 5 demonstrating that the metabolic reaction can easily occur fig 4b to better explain the interaction between cyp450 and smx we used the mm pbsa method to calculated the free binding energy which involved the van der waals interaction electrostatic interaction and polar solvation and nonpolar solvation interaction lin et al 2021 binding energy analysis shows that the binding energy of complex was estimated to be 21 61 5 6 kcal mol indicating that smx could be strongly bound to the cyp450 enzyme fig s9 in terms of energy contribution the electrostatic energy 23 48 7 4 kcal mol and non polar free energy 10 14 5 4 kcal mol contributed relatively less for the formation of the complex compared to other binding energies the van der waals interaction was 92 55 17 2 kcal mol which showed a significant impact on the complex binding energies thus the van der waals interaction was the source of the main driving energy responsible for the formation of cyp450 smx which can characterize the strength of hydrophobic interaction between the complex we also evaluated the contribution of the cyp450 residue to the binding of smx by further residue energy decomposition generally a residue with binding energy contribution less than 1 0 kcal mol is considered as the main residue for exploring the molecular recognition of small molecular on enzyme cao et al 2019 in figs 4c and s10 a residue decomposition of cyp450 enzyme illustrated that lys58 arg60 lys73 val84 arg168 thr237 and ala284 were from 1 17 to 7 53 kcal mol which provided the largest contribution to the binding free energy for smx among them arg60 lys73 and val84 are located at the entrance of the cavity and have strong affinity though electrostatic interaction and van der waals interaction additionally the smx sulfonyl group and pyrimidine ring could participate in the h bonding interaction with the amino and guanidino groups in ala72 and arg168 and the distances were 3 1 and 3 0 å respectively which tightly and effectively bound smx to cyp450 fig 4d another hydrogen bond formed with cpd i oxygen played a crucial role in the smx catalytic process meanwhile pi akyl hydrophobic interaction was observed between the alkyl atoms val232 ala233 and ala284 and the benzene and pyrimidine ring of smx which verified their influence on the orientation of smx and promoted a catalytic conformation other hydrophobic interaction residues like val69 gly71 val84 and leu229 surrounded with the active site of cyp450 enzymes can also support the favorable smx catalytic orientation fig 4e together these results provide an understanding of how cyp450 interacted with smx clearly indicating that the orientation and accessibility of nitrogen on the amine of smx toward the cpd i of cyp450 were determinants for cyp catalyzed oxidation of smx leth et al 2019 to precisely explore the metabolic site and the mechanism of smx n4 hydroxylation the potential energy profile and structure for smx by cyp450 were also calculated fig 4f regarding the hydroxylation reaction of cyp450 e g aromatic hydrocarbon alkanes revealing that the doublet state of cyp450 is beneficial for the rebound step shaik et al 2005 zhang et al 2021 we focused on the low spin state of cpd i and results suggested the hydrogen abstraction and rebound was the main mechanism of smx n4 hydroxylation by cyp450 fig 4g the reaction started from the reactant complex rc in which the hydrogen atom abstracted from the n amino was 1 19 å away from the feiv o moiety in cpd i furthermore the transition state ts1 of the h abstraction pathway was determined by the approximate linearity n h o angle 169 4 the intermediate complex imh was formated through the h abstraction transition state ts1 then after im was generated the oh radical rebounds from feiv oh onto the substrate radical the energy barrier of the rebound pathway 15 8 kcal mol was dramatically lower than that of the hydrogen abstraction step 19 3 kcal mol suggesting that hydrogen abstraction plays a decisive role in the metabolic reaction of smx it has been previously demonstrated that the key rate limiting step of cyp450 catalyzed hydroxylation is the hydrogen abstraction zhang et al 2018 the above calculation indicated that the hydroxylation reaction of smx aniline ring catalyzed by cyp450 was highly probable corresponding with the position nearest to cyp450 reactive center cpd i as revealed by md simulation 4 conclusion this work is among the first studies to systemically investigate the potential biodegradation mechanism of smx by microalgae clearly identifying the key role of cyp450 in intracellular degradation of smx the experimental results suggested that the clear pattern of cyp450 activity variation was strongly associated with the biodegradation of smx a key n4 hydroxylated product a tp1 m z 270 formed via pathway a clearly corroborated the role of cyp450 in smx metabolism through detailed examination of the tps produced during microalgal biodegradation the md simulation associated with dft was accessed from a molecular perspective to elucidate the importance of cyp450 mediated smx degradation fig 5 md simulation provided an in depth analysis of the binding mode of the smx interaction with cyp450 clearly indicating the aniline ring site was easily accessible for the metabolism more precisely dft theoretical calculation indicated that the proposed degradation pathway of smx by cyp450 was convincible under the given binding mode of md simulation providing new mechanistic insights into the direct hydroxylation of the smx mechanism collectively the revealed insights into the cyp450 mediated enzymatic degradation pathway indicated by this work will inform advances in the enhancement and application of microalgae based antibiotic biodegradation especially with regard to wastewater

15788,in view of the insufficient coagulation efficiency of traditional inorganic coagulants a series of al ti gels with different ti triethanolamine tea ti h2o and ti al molar ratios were prepared by sol gel process in this study fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of the al ti gels preliminarily confirmed the interaction between al and ti by detecting the appearance of the al o ti bond the peak shift of the chemical bonds in x ray photoelectron spectra xps and the transformation of the hydrolysate species in the al ti gels were analyzed to further explore the interaction mechanism between al and ti it was found that moderate tea could inhibit the hydrolysis of ti precursors by taking up the coordination sites of h2o to form a co ti bond density functional theory dft calculation results showed that ti could be incorporated into the framework of aluminum hydrolysates to form an al o ti bond and al2ti2 oh x tea y h2o 8 x y 14 x was the most possible copolymerization hydrolysate based on the above research results the most efficient al ti gel was selected and applied to the actual lake water treatment the highest uv254 removal efficiency with the addition of al ti gel was 60 nearly 25 higher than that of ti gel the hydrolysates of al ti gel such as tio oh 2 am al oh 3 am and al2ti2 oh x tea y h2o 8 x y 14 x could remove organic matters through the incorporation of charge neutralization adsorption complexation and sweeping effects these results provide a new idea for studying the interaction mechanism between al and ti in composite coagulants and have theoretical guiding significance to actual water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword composite coagulant polymerization mechanism hydrolysate characteristic lake water treatment theoretical arithmetic data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the coagulation sedimentation process has been extensively used in water and wastewater treatment due to its low cost easy operation and high efficiency in removing suspended particles and organic substances chen et al 2016 gan et al 2021b peydayesh et al 2021 the type of coagulant is the key factor to determine coagulation efficiency traditional inorganic coagulants containing al based and fe based salts have been widely used to remove contaminants abujazar et al 2022 li et al 2020 however some insufficiency of the traditional inorganic coagulants has gradually emerged e g large dosage huge sludge emission and inefficiency in removing small molecular organics eslami et al 2020 ti based polymer as a nontoxic inorganic coagulant draws increasing attention for its strong binding affinity with organic matters and suspended particles hussain et al 2019 wan et al 2019 flocs formed by ti based coagulants have large sizes and excellent sedimentation ability zhang et al 2018 the resultant chemical sludge can be collected and calcined into tio2 for secondary utilization zhao et al 2020 nevertheless ti based coagulants are difficult to store for their fast hydrolysis rate the hydrolyzed h can also lead to a significant decrease in the effluent ph wang et al 2021 in contrast to single ti based coagulants the combination of titanium and other metal salts is expected to give full play to the advantages of two or more metal coagulants and make up for the deficiency of the single metal based coagulants huang et al 2020a over the past few years some ti containing composite coagulants including poly silicate titanium ferrum huang et al 2020b polyferric titanium silicate sulfate coagulant huang et al 2020a polyferric titanium coagulant chen et al 2016 polyaluminum titanium silicate liao and zhang 2018 and polyaluminium titanium composite coagulant liu et al 2022 have been prepared by alkali pre hydrolysis under alkaline condition their coagulation efficiency and mechanism were preliminarily investigated in different water or wastewater treatment it was found that the composites of titanium and other metal salts enhanced the coagulation efficiency in removing organics turbidity and chromaticity however although the stability and coagulation efficiency of ti containing composites have been improved their decontamination efficiency is still not satisfactory besides those composite coagulants with high basicity are still unstable during storage therefore it is a challenge to improve the stability and efficiency of ti containing composite coagulants the sol gel process has been recognized as a promising technique to regulate the hydrolysis polymerization degree of ti precursors wang et al 2018b wang et al 2018c some researchers prepared titanium xerogel coagulants txc by gelation process and explored their performance in removing organics turbidity arsenic and algae wang et al 2018b wang et al 2016 xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 it was found that txc was more efficient in removing pollutants than the polytitanium chloride prepared by alkali pre hydrolysis in the sol gel process the inhibitor could take up the coordination sites of h2o and limit the hydrolysis rate of ti precursors thus making the polymerization process controllable wang et al 2016 therefore the development of ti containing composite coagulants by the sol gel process is expected to retain the dual merits of the composite process and sol gel method the resultant composite coagulants are hopeful to own outstanding stability and coagulation efficiency different hydrolysates have distinct binding affinity to pollutants which affect the coagulation behavior of coagulants song et al 2019 therefore the hydrolysate species of the coagulants directly affect the coagulation mechanism and then determine the coagulation efficiency an et al 2021 wenyu et al 2018a for the composite coagulants the coexistence of multiple metal salts will affect the hydrolysis process owing to their competition for oh cheng et al 2022 sun et al 2011 furthermore the interaction among different metal salts promotes the formation of novel bonds and changes the intrinsic framework of the hydrolysates formed by the single metal salts the novel framework would promote the formation of the hydrolysates with unique structures chen et al chen et al 2016 reported that the hydrolysates of polyferric titanium sulfate showed a compact network structure while those of polyferric sulfate exhibited a three dimensional 3d granular structure shi et al shi et al 2019 confirmed that the introduction of ti into polyferric sulfate promoted the formation of the hydrolysates with a flower like structure our previous study liu et al 2022 also observed a 4 atom ring in the structure of the hydrolysates of polyaluminium titanium composite coagulant patc and discovered an obvious difference in the distribution of ala mononuclear species alb medium polymer species and alc colloidal species content between patc and pac based on the above literature reviews previous studies only demonstrated that the structures of the hydrolysates of the composite coagulants were different from those of the single metal coagulants however there are few researches on the preferential reactive sites of the metal hydrolysates specific hydrolysis process with the coexistence of multiple metal salts and the skeleton structure of the copolymerized hydrolysates in addition the interaction between the metal salts in the sol gel process is different from that of the pre hydrolyzation process therefore exploring the interaction mechanism between the metal salts in the sol gel process is meaningful and essential to develop high performance composite coagulants and understand their coagulation mechanism in this study a series of al ti gels were prepared by the sol gel process using low toxicity triethanolamine tea as a hydrolysis inhibitor the interaction between al and ti was analyzed by investigating the functional groups and chemical bonds of the al ti gels with different ti tea ti h2o and ti al molar ratios the reactive sites and binding modes among tea ti hydrolysates and al hydrolysates were predicted using the fukui function and atoms in molecules aim methodology the reaction probability and the hydrolysate framework were discussed according to the results of the density functional theory dft calculation the coagulation efficiency of the al ti gel was investigated in the actual lake water treatment finally the coagulation mechanism of the al ti gel was discussed from the transformation process of the hydrolysates 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and test water chemical reagents e g ethanol triethanolamine tea and humic acid ha originated from aladdin biochemical technology co ltd alcl3 6h2o and kaolin were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd ticl4 with the purity 99 was offered by macklin biochemical technology co ltd the artificial test water of ha kaolin was prepared by adding 1 0 ml ha stock solution 1 0 g l and kaolin suspension into 1 0 l tap water and the turbidity was kept in 14 5 15 5 the actual water was obtained from a lake in qingdao shandong province china the specific properties of the water quality are listed in table 1 2 2 preparation of the al ti gel al ti gel was prepared by the sol gel process using tea as a hydrolysis inhibitor the specific procedure is illustrated below i the predetermined tea was mixed with 20 ml ethanol and the mixture was stirred for 20 min ii accurate 3 ml ticl4 was added dropwise into the mixture with vigorous stirring iii moreover alcl3 6h2o was dissolved with 10 ml ethanol and a predetermined amount of deionized water the amount of alcl3 6h2o and deionized water was calculated according to the ti al and ti h2o molar ratios iv then the al containing solution was dropwise added into the ti containing solution after 2 h of stirring the mixture was aged at 90 c in a water bath for 1 h v finally the semi dried product was dissolved with a certain amount of deionized water to produce the al ti gel solution with a concentration of 1 0 mol ti4 l 2 3 analysis methods the functional groups of the dried al gel ti gel and al ti gel were determined using a thermo scientific nicolet fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir the ftir spectrometer was conducted in transmittance mode the x ray photoelectron xps spectra of the dried al gel ti gel and al ti gel were measured using a thermo scientific escalab xi xps spectrometer the charge density of the al ti gel was measured in its solution state 1 0 g ti4 l by a charge densities analyzer pcd 05 mutek germany with sodium polythene sulfonate solution using as the standard titrant 2 4 dft calculation dft calculation was used to obtain the optimized geometry and geometrical parameter of the metal hydrolysates the dft study was conducted in the gaussian software program using m06 2x hybrid exchange related functional together with 6 311 g d p basis set the molecular electrostatic potential esp evaluation code was employed based on the libreta library zhang and lu 2021 the esp color van der waals surface map was drawn using vmd based on the output file of multiwfn lu and chen 2012 the bonding types of the chemical bonds were determined using the atoms in molecules aim methodology 2 5 coagulation and floc dynamic experiment coagulation experiments were carried out in a jar test instrument zr4 6 at ambient temperature a predetermined amount of the coagulants was added to the water and stirred at the speed of 200 rpm for 30 s next the stirring speed was adjusted to 35 rpm and maintained for 15 min subsequently the mixture was settled for 30 min without stirring after coagulation the supernatant was obtained to measure the uv254 residual turbidity zeta potential and 3d eem using the tu 1810 uv spectrophotometer 2100 q portable turbidimeter zetasizer nano zs analyzer and fluorescence spectrophotometer respectively fluorescence regional integration fri was used for quantitative analysis of

dynamic was online determined using a mastersizer 3000 particle size scattering instrument malvern uk the operation procedure was largely consistent with the above jar test procedure but a breakage

according to the values of floc size the formulas of the above factors are presented in supporting information text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of the al ti gels with different ti tea molar ratios 3 1 1 physicochemical property a series of al ti gels with the same ti h2o and ti al molar ratios but different ti tea molar ratios were prepared and investigated in this section the ftir spectra xps spectra and charge densities of the al ti gels are shown in fig 1 compared with the ftir spectrum of ti gel in fig 1a a small peak at 764 cm 1 can be observed in the spectrum of al ti gel which confirms the formation of the al o ti bond liu et al 2022 as shown in fig 1b adsorption peaks at 3300 3160 cm 1 belonged to the oh and ch vibration of tea long et al 2021 rahman et al 2020 the peak at 1640 cm 1 was assigned to the bending vibration of the ho h bond in intermolecular bound water patel et al 2021 al oh and ti o ti stretching modes were identified at 595 cm 1 and 820 cm 1 respectively sun et al 2011 the sharp adsorption peak at 917 cm 1 belonged to the vibration of m oh m was ti or al with the increase of tea dosage the intensity of the ho h and ti o ti peaks decreased while that of oh and m oh peaks significantly increased the introduction of tea could inhibit the hydrolysis rate of ti precursors which was one reason for weakening the intensity of the ti o ti bond besides the appearance of the al o ti bond confirmed the occurrence of the interaction between al iii and ti iv which could also reduce the amount of the ti o ti bond with the increase of tea dosage the intensity of the ho h peak decreased due to the gradual dehydration during condensation xps spectra of al ti gel ti gel and al gel in fig s2 show obvious differences in peak positions which further confirms the interaction between al and ti in al ti gel the chemical states of the ti element were determined by xps fig 1c two characteristic peaks at 457 9 ev and 463 6 ev were observed in ti2p spectra of the al ti gels which represented the ti2p2 3 and ti2p1 2 of tio2 li et al 2022 li et al 2021 the al ti gels with different ti tea molar ratios showed a consistent difference value 5 7 ev of the binding energy between ti2p2 3 and ti2p1 2 which indicated a normal state of ti4 zhao et al 2020 xps o1s spectra in fig 1d show two peaks at the binding energy of 529 ev o 1 and 530 5 ev o 2 which represent the lattice oxygen and the chemisorbed oxygen in the surface of ti respectively shao et al 2019 as the dosage of tea increased the peaks at 529 ev and 530 5 ev shifted towards the high binding energy which indicated a reduction in the electron cloud density of the o atom the above result was due to that ti had a bigger atomic radius and higher electron density than the al atom in consequence ti was easily incorporated into the framework of al hydrolysates to form an al o ti bond thus reducing the electron density of o connected to ti pan et al 2022 notably the content of the lattice oxygen tended to first decrease and then increase with tea dosage increasing where ti tea 1 2 was the transition the peak at the binding energy of 531 ev o 3 was assigned to the oh connected to al and its intensity was significantly correlated with the dosage of tea pan et al 2022 when the ti tea molar ratio reached 1 2 the intensity of the peak at 531 ev decreased and the al3 peak 74 4 in al2p spectra shifted to the low binding energy fig 1e which was owing to the occurrence of the complexation between the residual tea and al3 zhang et al 2019 based on the results of xps spectra it was found that the increase of tea dosage could inhibit the hydrolysis process of ti precursors and promote the formation of the al o ti bond however excessive dosage of tea would result in the formation of al tea complexes by complexation which limited the polymerization of ti al based hydrolysates as shown in fig 1f with the increase of tea dosage the charge densities of the al ti gels first increased and then decreased and the highest charge density was obtained at ti tea 1 2 3 1 2 hydrolysate property and coagulation efficiency according to the findings in section 3 1 1 it was found that the molar ratio of ti tea played an important role in the hydrolysis process of ti and the polymerization between the hydrolysates of al and ti the al ti gels with different ti tea molar ratios were used for the ha kaolin artificial water treatment the distribution of hydrolysate species and the coagulation efficiency of the al ti gels are presented in fig 2 the dosages of the al ti gels were measured using the optimization experiment and an optimal dosage of 0 65 mmol ti4 l was applied fig s4 as shown in fig 2a b with the increase of tea dosages the content of medium polymerized hydrolysates decreased while that of colloidal hydrolysates showed a general uptrend it was likely due to that tea could act as a bridge between the hydrolysates thus high tea content contributed to the formation of the hydrolysates with high molecular weight as the previous study reported that medium polymerized hydrolysates were the most efficient species in removing contaminants due to their strong charge neutralization ability wang et al 2019 as shown in fig 2d the removal efficiency of uv254 decreased with the increase of tea dosage which was owing to that charge neutralization provided by the al ti gels with high tea content was weak due to the lack of medium polymerized hydrolysates the decreasing trend of the zeta potentials in fig s5 also confirmed the gradually weakened charge neutralization ability of the al ti gels as the content of tea increased different from the removal efficiency of uv254 the turbidity in fig 2e showed an upward trend with the increase of tea content which benefited from the strong sweeping effect provided by the colloidal hydrolysates of al ti gels the stability of the al ti gels was analyzed according to their appearance and coagulation efficiency after 30 d the pictures of the al ti gels after aging for 30 d show a significant muddy phenomenon due to the formation of hydrous titanium dioxide but the muddy degree is relatively light with a high tea dosage notably the performance of al ti gels for uv254 removals showed an obvious improvement after 30 d the reasons could be concluded from the adsorption capacity of tio oh 2 the sweeping effects of ti al tea complexes and the abundant active sites of tea monomers however the residual tea was a potential contaminant in water so the excessive dosage of tea was desirable accordingly the ti tea molar ratio of 1 2 was taken in the following sections by comprehensively considering the contaminant removal efficiency and stability of the al ti gels furthermore the binding modes among tea ti and al were preliminarily inferred and the possible structural formulas for the hydrolysates of the al ti gels are illustrated in fig 2c 3 2 analysis of the al ti gels with different ti h2o molar ratios herein the al ti gels with the same ti tea 1 2 and ti al 3 1 molar ratios but different ti h2o molar ratios were prepared the properties of the al ti gels determined by ftir xps and charge density analysis are displayed in fig 3 the ftir spectra in fig 3a show a significant difference in the intensity of the peaks at 1640 cm 1 and 823 cm 1 which represent the intermolecular bound water and the ti o ti bond respectively the ti o ti bond appeared when ti h2o molar ratio reached 1 6 and its intensity increased with the increase of water content consistent with the ti o ti bond the peak intensity of the bound water increased as the water content increased the above results demonstrated that the ti h2o molar ratio played a critical role in the hydrolysis process of ti precursors a consecutive hydrolysis process of ti was proposed as illustrated in fig 3d hydroxyl chloride hydroxyl complex polynuclear hydroxyl complex titanate ion and hydrated titanium dioxide were formed sequentially the electrical properties of the above hydrolysates changed from negative to positive and then to negative however the charge densities of the al ti gels presented a general uptrend with the increase of water content fig 3b which indicated that the hydrolysis of ti precursors was incomplete until the ti h2o molar ratio reached 1 10 in the studied range of ti h2o molar ratio the hydrolysates of ti existed mostly as the hydroxyl chloride hydroxyl complexes and polynuclear hydroxyl complexes the ftir results showed that polynuclear hydroxyl complexes appeared when the ti h2o molar ratio reached 1 6 xps spectra of the gels in fig 3c present a slight shift of the o 1 lattice oxygen o 2 chemisorbed oxygen and o 3 oh peaks which demonstrates that the change of ti h2o molar ratio primarily affects the hydrolysis degree of ti precursors but has little effect on the binding behavior among tea ti and al hydrolysates as shown in fig 4 a b the content of the mononuclear and medium polymerized species decreased with the increase of water content when ti h2o molar ratio was higher than 1 4 while that of the colloidal hydrolysates showed an opposite trend the phenomenon demonstrated that further hydrolysis of titanium made the mononuclear and medium polymerized species convert into the colloidal species the al ti gels with different ti h2o molar ratios showed a slight difference in the removal efficiency of uv254 and turbidity fig 4c however the zeta potentials of flocs significantly decreased with the increase of water content which changed from 4 mv to 2 mv fig 4d accordingly a conclusion was proposed that charge neutralization was the dominant coagulation mechanism of the al ti gels with low water content while bridging and sweeping effects gradually played an important role with the increase of water content after 30 d although a muddy phenomenon appeared in al ti gels their coagulation efficiency was not worsened and even the removal efficiency of turbidity was enhanced however the zeta potentials of flocs showed a decreasing tendency which meant that the charge neutralization ability of the al ti gels was weakened after 30 d the reason was that adsorption and sweeping effects of al ti gels were enhanced due to the continuous hydrolysis during 30 d of storage which made up for the insufficiency of charge neutralization 3 3 analysis of the al ti gels with different ti al molar ratios in this section the al ti gels with the same ti tea 1 2 and ti h2o 1 6 molar ratios but different ti al molar ratios were investigated the characteristics and coagulation efficiency of the al ti gels are presented in fig 5 the ftir spectra of the different al ti gels show a significant difference in the intensity of the peaks at 3030 2420 1640 830 and 595 cm 1 fig 5a the peaks at 3030 2920 cm 1 belonged to the stretching vibration of ch asymmetric and symmetrical stretching vibration of ch2 in ethanol the peaks at 1640 830 and 595 cm 1 represented the intermolecular bound water ti o ti bond and al oh bond respectively the intensity of the peaks at 3030 2920 1640 830 and 595 cm 1 increased with the increase of al content when ti al molar ratio reached 2 1 a significant increase in the peak intensity was observed for the ch2 ti o ti and al oh characteristic peaks more importantly a new peak at 2420 cm 1 appeared at the ti al molar ratio of 2 1 which could be assigned to the vibration of the al o al bond accordingly an excessively high amount of al led to strong competition for oh thus making a considerable number of ti based hydrolysates exist as ti or n tea xps spectra of the al ti gels in fig 5b show no shift in the binding energy of the characteristic peaks with the change of ti al molar ratio which confirms that the content of al will not affect the binding sites between al and ti however xps o1s spectra show some differences in the intensity of the o 1 o 2 and o 3 peaks which demonstrates that the content of al can affect the hydrolysis and polymerization process of ti and al as shown in fig 5c with the increase of al content the proportion of mononuclear and medium polymerized species increased while that of the colloidal hydrolysates decreased notably there were no colloidal species when the ti al reached 2 1 because the lack of oh made the hydrolysis of al and ti stay in the primary stage the result was consistent with the ratiocination from ftir and xps results that the excessive dosage of al limited the polymerization between al and ti the charge density and removal capacity for uv254 of the al ti gels increased with the increase of al content however the al ti gel with excessive content of al was inefficient in removing turbidity fig 5d f in conclusion a moderate ti al molar ratio could enhance the coagulation performance of al ti gel but an excessive increase of al content would have a negative impact on the effluent quality zeta potentials of the flocs fig s11 show an upward trend with the increase of al content which indicates that charge neutralization plays a dominant role in the coagulation process by considering the results of ftir and xps the high content of al resulted in the incomplete hydrolysis of al and ti due to the lack of oh therefore the preliminary hydrolysates e g al oh 2 al oh 2 or al2 oh 2 4 ti or 3 tea dominated the coagulation process by adsorbing and neutralizing the negatively charged ha and kaolin particles in conclusion ti al molar ratio had little effect on the binding sites and bonding modes between al and ti but it played a vital role in the coagulation mechanism by affecting the hydrolysis degree of al and ti 3 4 insight into the interaction mechanism the binding behavior among tea ti and al as well as the possible hydrolysate structure of the al ti gel were hypothesized based on the findings in sections 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 the hypothetical reaction pathway is presented in fig 6 a furthermore the potential intermolecular interaction and preferential reaction sites were verified by investigating the gibbs free energy changes esp analysis aim analysis and reduced fukui function gibbs free energies of the reagents and products were obtained at ambient temperature table s1 the possibility of the reaction among tea ti precursors and al hydrolysates was confirmed by the free energy changes that the free energy of the products minus the reactants was negative the chemical reactivity of the reactants was explored using esp analysis the difference in the electrical property of the nuclear charges contributed to the various distributions of the electrostatic potential esp analysis in fig 6b shows that the electrostatic potential around the n and o atoms is negative while that around c h ti and al atoms is positive in accordance with the principle of electrostatic potential complementarity the positively charged nuclear charges tended to contact the negatively charged ones and then promoted the transformation of the electrons cao et al 2022 accordingly the interaction between tea and ti precursors occurred under the action of the electrostatic potential complementarity between the negatively charged area around the o atom and the positively charged area around the ti atom electrostatic potential close to the or groups in ti or 3 tea showed a high positive value while that close to the al o showed a high negative value therefore the combination of the hydrolysates between al and ti could also be interpreted by electrostatic attraction the preferential reaction sites were forecasted using the reduced fukui function table s2 5 the f of tea showed relatively positive values in c h and o atoms which were 0 0017 0 0019 and 0 0020 respectively the maximum f value of ti or 4 was found in h atoms in methyl the reaction sites of tea and ti precursors might be the hydroxyl of tea and the or of ti precursors which could lead to the formation of the co ti bond by abandoning an ethanol molecule the maximum f and f values of the hydrolysates of ti and al were observed in h atoms which was consistent with our hypothesis that hydroxyl groups in the hydrolysates of al and ti first contacted with each other by the formation of hydrogen bonds subsequently the hydrolysates of al and ti were polymerized by dehydration condensation reaction to form an al o ti bond after the geometry optimization the hydrolysate with the framework of the al o ti bond was confirmed stable no 5 in fig 6a the bonding types of co ti and al o ti bonds in the products were further studied using the aim methodology fig 6c and table s6 the topological properties at the bond critical point bcp such as laplacian of electron density 2ρ r the energy density of all electrons ρ r energy density e r lagrangian kinetic energy g r and the ratio of v r g r can represent the interaction type between atoms cao et al 2022 for the co bond its 2ρ r 0 ρ r 0 and e r 0 which indicated a typical covalent interaction for the ti o bond its 2ρ r 0 1 v r g r 2 which represented the electrovalent interaction the ratio of v r g r was lower than 1 for the al o bond which corresponded to the closed shell interplay espinosa et al 2002 3 5 coagulation performance in actual lake water treatment based on the above research results an al ti gel with the ti tea of 1 2 ti h2o of 1 6 and ti al of 3 1 was selected and investigated for actual lake water treatment also the single ti gel and al gel with the same ti tea and ti h2o molar ratio as al ti gel were taken as a control experiment the coagulation efficiency and floc properties of the al ti gel ti gel and al gel are shown in fig 7 ti gel al ti gel and al gel had the same mass concentration of the ti4 or al3 but they showed a far different appearance fig s12 a muddy phenomenon with a turbidity of 191 0 ntu was observed in al gel which was due to the formation of al2o3 in consequence al gel was inefficient in removing uv254 and turbidity because it was insufficient in active aluminum species fig s13 notably al ti gel was a clarified solution which further confirmed the aforementioned conclusion that al ti gel was a novel composite instead of a mixture of al gel and ti gel as shown in fig 7a al ti gel showed a better removal capacity for turbidity and uv254 compared with ti gel after al ti gel coagulation the residual turbidity was lower than 1 0 ntu and the removal efficiency of uv254 could exceed 60 when the dosage reached 0 8 mmol ti4 l however the highest uv254 removal efficiency with the addition of ti gel was lower than 40 even though the dosage increased to 1 2 mmol ti4 l based on the results in fig 7a the optimal dosage of 0 76 mmol ti4 l for ti gel and al ti gel was used in the following work the dosage of al gel was 0 25 mmol l to keep consistent with the al mass concentration of al ti gel the 3d eem spectrum of the actual lake water in fig 7b can be divided into 5 regions which represent the tyrosine like proteins region i tryptophan like proteins region ii fulvic fa like matters region iii intermediate products of metabolism region iv and humic acid like substances region v respectively wang et al 2018c after coagulation the fluorescence intensity of the 5 regions exhibited a significant reduction especially in ti gel and al ti gel coagulation systems compared with ti gel al ti gel had a better capacity in reducing the fluorescence intensity of region iii iv and v especially region v fig 7c it was therefore indicated that al ti gel was more efficient in removing fa ha and intermediate products of metabolism than ti gel the actual lake water had an alkaline condition with a ph value of 9 69 0 31 the hydrolysis process of ti precursors could release h consequently the effluent ph after coagulation by ti gel or al ti gel was 7 25 and 7 27 respectively the hydrolysates of ti primarily existed as tio oh 2 in the ph range of 7 0 10 0 which could entrap contaminants primarily by adsorption and sweeping effects gan et al 2021a however the hydrolysate species of al would transfer from al oh to al oh 3 am and positively charged al hydroxide with the decrease of the ph from 10 0 to 7 0 gan et al 2021a accordingly the hydrolysates of the al ti gel consisted of tio oh 2 al oh 3 am positively charged al hydroxide and al2ti2 oh 8 6 which could eliminate organic matters by the incorporation of charge neutralization sweeping effects and complexation zeta potentials of the flocs formed by the single ti or al gel were negatively charged and the values were hardly affected by the dosage of the gels fig s14 however the al ti gel significantly enhanced the zeta potentials of flocs with the increase of the dosage which demonstrated that al ti gel could provide charge neutralization due to its positively charged hydrolysates floc properties in fig 7d e indicated that al ti gel as compared with ti gel promoted the formation of the flocs with a larger size and more compact structure however the sf and rf values of the flocs formed by al ti gel were smaller than those by ti gel notably the flocs formed by the ti or al gel could be fully regenerated after breakage however a previous study wang et al 2016 reported that flocs formed by sweeping effects could not be regenerated after crushing which conflicted with our results the above contradiction could be explained as that the al or ti gel could release tea monomer under the alkaline condition fig s16 which could act as a bridge among the floc fragments nevertheless the al ti gel was more stable and released less tea monomer due to the interaction between al and ti by considering the recovery ability and zeta potentials of the flocs formed by the al ti gel it was found that charge neutralization was not the only coagulation mechanism and sweeping effects played an essential role in organic removals 4 conclusion in this study a series of al ti gels with different ti tea ti h2o and ti al molar ratios were prepared by the sol gel process using tea as a hydrolysis inhibitor ftir and xps spectra of the al ti gels confirmed the interaction between al and ti the experimental results indicated that tea could inhibit the hydrolysis rate of ti precursors by taking up the coordination sites of h2o to form a co ti bond although ti h2o and ti al molar ratios had little influence on the binding sites and modes between al and ti the transformation process of the hydrolysates was significantly affected due to the different degree of hydrolysis of al and ti the results of the dft calculation revealed that ti could be homogenously incorporated into the framework of aluminum hydrolysates to form an al o ti bond and al2ti2 oh x tea y h2o 8 x y 14 x was the most possible copolymerization hydrolysate of al and ti the coagulation performance of different coagulants in the lake water treatment showed that compared with ti gel al ti gel performed better in removing ha fa and intermediate products of metabolism the highest uv254 removal efficiency with the addition of al ti gel was 60 and the minimum residual turbidity was lower than 1 0 ntu the al ti gel could hydrolyze into tio oh 2 al oh 3 am positively charged al hydroxide and al2ti2 oh x tea y h2o 8 x y 14 x which could remove contaminants by the combined action of charge neutralization adsorption complexation and sweeping effects this study developed a novel al ti composite coagulant and provided a new idea for studying the interaction mechanism between al and ti the systematic investigation of the coagulation

15788,in view of the insufficient coagulation efficiency of traditional inorganic coagulants a series of al ti gels with different ti triethanolamine tea ti h2o and ti al molar ratios were prepared by sol gel process in this study fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of the al ti gels preliminarily confirmed the interaction between al and ti by detecting the appearance of the al o ti bond the peak shift of the chemical bonds in x ray photoelectron spectra xps and the transformation of the hydrolysate species in the al ti gels were analyzed to further explore the interaction mechanism between al and ti it was found that moderate tea could inhibit the hydrolysis of ti precursors by taking up the coordination sites of h2o to form a co ti bond density functional theory dft calculation results showed that ti could be incorporated into the framework of aluminum hydrolysates to form an al o ti bond and al2ti2 oh x tea y h2o 8 x y 14 x was the most possible copolymerization hydrolysate based on the above research results the most efficient al ti gel was selected and applied to the actual lake water treatment the highest uv254 removal efficiency with the addition of al ti gel was 60 nearly 25 higher than that of ti gel the hydrolysates of al ti gel such as tio oh 2 am al oh 3 am and al2ti2 oh x tea y h2o 8 x y 14 x could remove organic matters through the incorporation of charge neutralization adsorption complexation and sweeping effects these results provide a new idea for studying the interaction mechanism between al and ti in composite coagulants and have theoretical guiding significance to actual water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword composite coagulant polymerization mechanism hydrolysate characteristic lake water treatment theoretical arithmetic data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the coagulation sedimentation process has been extensively used in water and wastewater treatment due to its low cost easy operation and high efficiency in removing suspended particles and organic substances chen et al 2016 gan et al 2021b peydayesh et al 2021 the type of coagulant is the key factor to determine coagulation efficiency traditional inorganic coagulants containing al based and fe based salts have been widely used to remove contaminants abujazar et al 2022 li et al 2020 however some insufficiency of the traditional inorganic coagulants has gradually emerged e g large dosage huge sludge emission and inefficiency in removing small molecular organics eslami et al 2020 ti based polymer as a nontoxic inorganic coagulant draws increasing attention for its strong binding affinity with organic matters and suspended particles hussain et al 2019 wan et al 2019 flocs formed by ti based coagulants have large sizes and excellent sedimentation ability zhang et al 2018 the resultant chemical sludge can be collected and calcined into tio2 for secondary utilization zhao et al 2020 nevertheless ti based coagulants are difficult to store for their fast hydrolysis rate the hydrolyzed h can also lead to a significant decrease in the effluent ph wang et al 2021 in contrast to single ti based coagulants the combination of titanium and other metal salts is expected to give full play to the advantages of two or more metal coagulants and make up for the deficiency of the single metal based coagulants huang et al 2020a over the past few years some ti containing composite coagulants including poly silicate titanium ferrum huang et al 2020b polyferric titanium silicate sulfate coagulant huang et al 2020a polyferric titanium coagulant chen et al 2016 polyaluminum titanium silicate liao and zhang 2018 and polyaluminium titanium composite coagulant liu et al 2022 have been prepared by alkali pre hydrolysis under alkaline condition their coagulation efficiency and mechanism were preliminarily investigated in different water or wastewater treatment it was found that the composites of titanium and other metal salts enhanced the coagulation efficiency in removing organics turbidity and chromaticity however although the stability and coagulation efficiency of ti containing composites have been improved their decontamination efficiency is still not satisfactory besides those composite coagulants with high basicity are still unstable during storage therefore it is a challenge to improve the stability and efficiency of ti containing composite coagulants the sol gel process has been recognized as a promising technique to regulate the hydrolysis polymerization degree of ti precursors wang et al 2018b wang et al 2018c some researchers prepared titanium xerogel coagulants txc by gelation process and explored their performance in removing organics turbidity arsenic and algae wang et al 2018b wang et al 2016 xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 it was found that txc was more efficient in removing pollutants than the polytitanium chloride prepared by alkali pre hydrolysis in the sol gel process the inhibitor could take up the coordination sites of h2o and limit the hydrolysis rate of ti precursors thus making the polymerization process controllable wang et al 2016 therefore the development of ti containing composite coagulants by the sol gel process is expected to retain the dual merits of the composite process and sol gel method the resultant composite coagulants are hopeful to own outstanding stability and coagulation efficiency different hydrolysates have distinct binding affinity to pollutants which affect the coagulation behavior of coagulants song et al 2019 therefore the hydrolysate species of the coagulants directly affect the coagulation mechanism and then determine the coagulation efficiency an et al 2021 wenyu et al 2018a for the composite coagulants the coexistence of multiple metal salts will affect the hydrolysis process owing to their competition for oh cheng et al 2022 sun et al 2011 furthermore the interaction among different metal salts promotes the formation of novel bonds and changes the intrinsic framework of the hydrolysates formed by the single metal salts the novel framework would promote the formation of the hydrolysates with unique structures chen et al chen et al 2016 reported that the hydrolysates of polyferric titanium sulfate showed a compact network structure while those of polyferric sulfate exhibited a three dimensional 3d granular structure shi et al shi et al 2019 confirmed that the introduction of ti into polyferric sulfate promoted the formation of the hydrolysates with a flower like structure our previous study liu et al 2022 also observed a 4 atom ring in the structure of the hydrolysates of polyaluminium titanium composite coagulant patc and discovered an obvious difference in the distribution of ala mononuclear species alb medium polymer species and alc colloidal species content between patc and pac based on the above literature reviews previous studies only demonstrated that the structures of the hydrolysates of the composite coagulants were different from those of the single metal coagulants however there are few researches on the preferential reactive sites of the metal hydrolysates specific hydrolysis process with the coexistence of multiple metal salts and the skeleton structure of the copolymerized hydrolysates in addition the interaction between the metal salts in the sol gel process is different from that of the pre hydrolyzation process therefore exploring the interaction mechanism between the metal salts in the sol gel process is meaningful and essential to develop high performance composite coagulants and understand their coagulation mechanism in this study a series of al ti gels were prepared by the sol gel process using low toxicity triethanolamine tea as a hydrolysis inhibitor the interaction between al and ti was analyzed by investigating the functional groups and chemical bonds of the al ti gels with different ti tea ti h2o and ti al molar ratios the reactive sites and binding modes among tea ti hydrolysates and al hydrolysates were predicted using the fukui function and atoms in molecules aim methodology the reaction probability and the hydrolysate framework were discussed according to the results of the density functional theory dft calculation the coagulation efficiency of the al ti gel was investigated in the actual lake water treatment finally the coagulation mechanism of the al ti gel was discussed from the transformation process of the hydrolysates 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and test water chemical reagents e g ethanol triethanolamine tea and humic acid ha originated from aladdin biochemical technology co ltd alcl3 6h2o and kaolin were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd ticl4 with the purity 99 was offered by macklin biochemical technology co ltd the artificial test water of ha kaolin was prepared by adding 1 0 ml ha stock solution 1 0 g l and kaolin suspension into 1 0 l tap water and the turbidity was kept in 14 5 15 5 the actual water was obtained from a lake in qingdao shandong province china the specific properties of the water quality are listed in table 1 2 2 preparation of the al ti gel al ti gel was prepared by the sol gel process using tea as a hydrolysis inhibitor the specific procedure is illustrated below i the predetermined tea was mixed with 20 ml ethanol and the mixture was stirred for 20 min ii accurate 3 ml ticl4 was added dropwise into the mixture with vigorous stirring iii moreover alcl3 6h2o was dissolved with 10 ml ethanol and a predetermined amount of deionized water the amount of alcl3 6h2o and deionized water was calculated according to the ti al and ti h2o molar ratios iv then the al containing solution was dropwise added into the ti containing solution after 2 h of stirring the mixture was aged at 90 c in a water bath for 1 h v finally the semi dried product was dissolved with a certain amount of deionized water to produce the al ti gel solution with a concentration of 1 0 mol ti4 l 2 3 analysis methods the functional groups of the dried al gel ti gel and al ti gel were determined using a thermo scientific nicolet fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir the ftir spectrometer was conducted in transmittance mode the x ray photoelectron xps spectra of the dried al gel ti gel and al ti gel were measured using a thermo scientific escalab xi xps spectrometer the charge density of the al ti gel was measured in its solution state 1 0 g ti4 l by a charge densities analyzer pcd 05 mutek germany with sodium polythene sulfonate solution using as the standard titrant 2 4 dft calculation dft calculation was used to obtain the optimized geometry and geometrical parameter of the metal hydrolysates the dft study was conducted in the gaussian software program using m06 2x hybrid exchange related functional together with 6 311 g d p basis set the molecular electrostatic potential esp evaluation code was employed based on the libreta library zhang and lu 2021 the esp color van der waals surface map was drawn using vmd based on the output file of multiwfn lu and chen 2012 the bonding types of the chemical bonds were determined using the atoms in molecules aim methodology 2 5 coagulation and floc dynamic experiment coagulation experiments were carried out in a jar test instrument zr4 6 at ambient temperature a predetermined amount of the coagulants was added to the water and stirred at the speed of 200 rpm for 30 s next the stirring speed was adjusted to 35 rpm and maintained for 15 min subsequently the mixture was settled for 30 min without stirring after coagulation the supernatant was obtained to measure the uv254 residual turbidity zeta potential and 3d eem using the tu 1810 uv spectrophotometer 2100 q portable turbidimeter zetasizer nano zs analyzer and fluorescence spectrophotometer respectively fluorescence regional integration fri was used for quantitative analysis of

dynamic was online determined using a mastersizer 3000 particle size scattering instrument malvern uk the operation procedure was largely consistent with the above jar test procedure but a breakage

according to the values of floc size the formulas of the above factors are presented in supporting information text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of the al ti gels with different ti tea molar ratios 3 1 1 physicochemical property a series of al ti gels with the same ti h2o and ti al molar ratios but different ti tea molar ratios were prepared and investigated in this section the ftir spectra xps spectra and charge densities of the al ti gels are shown in fig 1 compared with the ftir spectrum of ti gel in fig 1a a small peak at 764 cm 1 can be observed in the spectrum of al ti gel which confirms the formation of the al o ti bond liu et al 2022 as shown in fig 1b adsorption peaks at 3300 3160 cm 1 belonged to the oh and ch vibration of tea long et al 2021 rahman et al 2020 the peak at 1640 cm 1 was assigned to the bending vibration of the ho h bond in intermolecular bound water patel et al 2021 al oh and ti o ti stretching modes were identified at 595 cm 1 and 820 cm 1 respectively sun et al 2011 the sharp adsorption peak at 917 cm 1 belonged to the vibration of m oh m was ti or al with the increase of tea dosage the intensity of the ho h and ti o ti peaks decreased while that of oh and m oh peaks significantly increased the introduction of tea could inhibit the hydrolysis rate of ti precursors which was one reason for weakening the intensity of the ti o ti bond besides the appearance of the al o ti bond confirmed the occurrence of the interaction between al iii and ti iv which could also reduce the amount of the ti o ti bond with the increase of tea dosage the intensity of the ho h peak decreased due to the gradual dehydration during condensation xps spectra of al ti gel ti gel and al gel in fig s2 show obvious differences in peak positions which further confirms the interaction between al and ti in al ti gel the chemical states of the ti element were determined by xps fig 1c two characteristic peaks at 457 9 ev and 463 6 ev were observed in ti2p spectra of the al ti gels which represented the ti2p2 3 and ti2p1 2 of tio2 li et al 2022 li et al 2021 the al ti gels with different ti tea molar ratios showed a consistent difference value 5 7 ev of the binding energy between ti2p2 3 and ti2p1 2 which indicated a normal state of ti4 zhao et al 2020 xps o1s spectra in fig 1d show two peaks at the binding energy of 529 ev o 1 and 530 5 ev o 2 which represent the lattice oxygen and the chemisorbed oxygen in the surface of ti respectively shao et al 2019 as the dosage of tea increased the peaks at 529 ev and 530 5 ev shifted towards the high binding energy which indicated a reduction in the electron cloud density of the o atom the above result was due to that ti had a bigger atomic radius and higher electron density than the al atom in consequence ti was easily incorporated into the framework of al hydrolysates to form an al o ti bond thus reducing the electron density of o connected to ti pan et al 2022 notably the content of the lattice oxygen tended to first decrease and then increase with tea dosage increasing where ti tea 1 2 was the transition the peak at the binding energy of 531 ev o 3 was assigned to the oh connected to al and its intensity was significantly correlated with the dosage of tea pan et al 2022 when the ti tea molar ratio reached 1 2 the intensity of the peak at 531 ev decreased and the al3 peak 74 4 in al2p spectra shifted to the low binding energy fig 1e which was owing to the occurrence of the complexation between the residual tea and al3 zhang et al 2019 based on the results of xps spectra it was found that the increase of tea dosage could inhibit the hydrolysis process of ti precursors and promote the formation of the al o ti bond however excessive dosage of tea would result in the formation of al tea complexes by complexation which limited the polymerization of ti al based hydrolysates as shown in fig 1f with the increase of tea dosage the charge densities of the al ti gels first increased and then decreased and the highest charge density was obtained at ti tea 1 2 3 1 2 hydrolysate property and coagulation efficiency according to the findings in section 3 1 1 it was found that the molar ratio of ti tea played an important role in the hydrolysis process of ti and the polymerization between the hydrolysates of al and ti the al ti gels with different ti tea molar ratios were used for the ha kaolin artificial water treatment the distribution of hydrolysate species and the coagulation efficiency of the al ti gels are presented in fig 2 the dosages of the al ti gels were measured using the optimization experiment and an optimal dosage of 0 65 mmol ti4 l was applied fig s4 as shown in fig 2a b with the increase of tea dosages the content of medium polymerized hydrolysates decreased while that of colloidal hydrolysates showed a general uptrend it was likely due to that tea could act as a bridge between the hydrolysates thus high tea content contributed to the formation of the hydrolysates with high molecular weight as the previous study reported that medium polymerized hydrolysates were the most efficient species in removing contaminants due to their strong charge neutralization ability wang et al 2019 as shown in fig 2d the removal efficiency of uv254 decreased with the increase of tea dosage which was owing to that charge neutralization provided by the al ti gels with high tea content was weak due to the lack of medium polymerized hydrolysates the decreasing trend of the zeta potentials in fig s5 also confirmed the gradually weakened charge neutralization ability of the al ti gels as the content of tea increased different from the removal efficiency of uv254 the turbidity in fig 2e showed an upward trend with the increase of tea content which benefited from the strong sweeping effect provided by the colloidal hydrolysates of al ti gels the stability of the al ti gels was analyzed according to their appearance and coagulation efficiency after 30 d the pictures of the al ti gels after aging for 30 d show a significant muddy phenomenon due to the formation of hydrous titanium dioxide but the muddy degree is relatively light with a high tea dosage notably the performance of al ti gels for uv254 removals showed an obvious improvement after 30 d the reasons could be concluded from the adsorption capacity of tio oh 2 the sweeping effects of ti al tea complexes and the abundant active sites of tea monomers however the residual tea was a potential contaminant in water so the excessive dosage of tea was desirable accordingly the ti tea molar ratio of 1 2 was taken in the following sections by comprehensively considering the contaminant removal efficiency and stability of the al ti gels furthermore the binding modes among tea ti and al were preliminarily inferred and the possible structural formulas for the hydrolysates of the al ti gels are illustrated in fig 2c 3 2 analysis of the al ti gels with different ti h2o molar ratios herein the al ti gels with the same ti tea 1 2 and ti al 3 1 molar ratios but different ti h2o molar ratios were prepared the properties of the al ti gels determined by ftir xps and charge density analysis are displayed in fig 3 the ftir spectra in fig 3a show a significant difference in the intensity of the peaks at 1640 cm 1 and 823 cm 1 which represent the intermolecular bound water and the ti o ti bond respectively the ti o ti bond appeared when ti h2o molar ratio reached 1 6 and its intensity increased with the increase of water content consistent with the ti o ti bond the peak intensity of the bound water increased as the water content increased the above results demonstrated that the ti h2o molar ratio played a critical role in the hydrolysis process of ti precursors a consecutive hydrolysis process of ti was proposed as illustrated in fig 3d hydroxyl chloride hydroxyl complex polynuclear hydroxyl complex titanate ion and hydrated titanium dioxide were formed sequentially the electrical properties of the above hydrolysates changed from negative to positive and then to negative however the charge densities of the al ti gels presented a general uptrend with the increase of water content fig 3b which indicated that the hydrolysis of ti precursors was incomplete until the ti h2o molar ratio reached 1 10 in the studied range of ti h2o molar ratio the hydrolysates of ti existed mostly as the hydroxyl chloride hydroxyl complexes and polynuclear hydroxyl complexes the ftir results showed that polynuclear hydroxyl complexes appeared when the ti h2o molar ratio reached 1 6 xps spectra of the gels in fig 3c present a slight shift of the o 1 lattice oxygen o 2 chemisorbed oxygen and o 3 oh peaks which demonstrates that the change of ti h2o molar ratio primarily affects the hydrolysis degree of ti precursors but has little effect on the binding behavior among tea ti and al hydrolysates as shown in fig 4 a b the content of the mononuclear and medium polymerized species decreased with the increase of water content when ti h2o molar ratio was higher than 1 4 while that of the colloidal hydrolysates showed an opposite trend the phenomenon demonstrated that further hydrolysis of titanium made the mononuclear and medium polymerized species convert into the colloidal species the al ti gels with different ti h2o molar ratios showed a slight difference in the removal efficiency of uv254 and turbidity fig 4c however the zeta potentials of flocs significantly decreased with the increase of water content which changed from 4 mv to 2 mv fig 4d accordingly a conclusion was proposed that charge neutralization was the dominant coagulation mechanism of the al ti gels with low water content while bridging and sweeping effects gradually played an important role with the increase of water content after 30 d although a muddy phenomenon appeared in al ti gels their coagulation efficiency was not worsened and even the removal efficiency of turbidity was enhanced however the zeta potentials of flocs showed a decreasing tendency which meant that the charge neutralization ability of the al ti gels was weakened after 30 d the reason was that adsorption and sweeping effects of al ti gels were enhanced due to the continuous hydrolysis during 30 d of storage which made up for the insufficiency of charge neutralization 3 3 analysis of the al ti gels with different ti al molar ratios in this section the al ti gels with the same ti tea 1 2 and ti h2o 1 6 molar ratios but different ti al molar ratios were investigated the characteristics and coagulation efficiency of the al ti gels are presented in fig 5 the ftir spectra of the different al ti gels show a significant difference in the intensity of the peaks at 3030 2420 1640 830 and 595 cm 1 fig 5a the peaks at 3030 2920 cm 1 belonged to the stretching vibration of ch asymmetric and symmetrical stretching vibration of ch2 in ethanol the peaks at 1640 830 and 595 cm 1 represented the intermolecular bound water ti o ti bond and al oh bond respectively the intensity of the peaks at 3030 2920 1640 830 and 595 cm 1 increased with the increase of al content when ti al molar ratio reached 2 1 a significant increase in the peak intensity was observed for the ch2 ti o ti and al oh characteristic peaks more importantly a new peak at 2420 cm 1 appeared at the ti al molar ratio of 2 1 which could be assigned to the vibration of the al o al bond accordingly an excessively high amount of al led to strong competition for oh thus making a considerable number of ti based hydrolysates exist as ti or n tea xps spectra of the al ti gels in fig 5b show no shift in the binding energy of the characteristic peaks with the change of ti al molar ratio which confirms that the content of al will not affect the binding sites between al and ti however xps o1s spectra show some differences in the intensity of the o 1 o 2 and o 3 peaks which demonstrates that the content of al can affect the hydrolysis and polymerization process of ti and al as shown in fig 5c with the increase of al content the proportion of mononuclear and medium polymerized species increased while that of the colloidal hydrolysates decreased notably there were no colloidal species when the ti al reached 2 1 because the lack of oh made the hydrolysis of al and ti stay in the primary stage the result was consistent with the ratiocination from ftir and xps results that the excessive dosage of al limited the polymerization between al and ti the charge density and removal capacity for uv254 of the al ti gels increased with the increase of al content however the al ti gel with excessive content of al was inefficient in removing turbidity fig 5d f in conclusion a moderate ti al molar ratio could enhance the coagulation performance of al ti gel but an excessive increase of al content would have a negative impact on the effluent quality zeta potentials of the flocs fig s11 show an upward trend with the increase of al content which indicates that charge neutralization plays a dominant role in the coagulation process by considering the results of ftir and xps the high content of al resulted in the incomplete hydrolysis of al and ti due to the lack of oh therefore the preliminary hydrolysates e g al oh 2 al oh 2 or al2 oh 2 4 ti or 3 tea dominated the coagulation process by adsorbing and neutralizing the negatively charged ha and kaolin particles in conclusion ti al molar ratio had little effect on the binding sites and bonding modes between al and ti but it played a vital role in the coagulation mechanism by affecting the hydrolysis degree of al and ti 3 4 insight into the interaction mechanism the binding behavior among tea ti and al as well as the possible hydrolysate structure of the al ti gel were hypothesized based on the findings in sections 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 the hypothetical reaction pathway is presented in fig 6 a furthermore the potential intermolecular interaction and preferential reaction sites were verified by investigating the gibbs free energy changes esp analysis aim analysis and reduced fukui function gibbs free energies of the reagents and products were obtained at ambient temperature table s1 the possibility of the reaction among tea ti precursors and al hydrolysates was confirmed by the free energy changes that the free energy of the products minus the reactants was negative the chemical reactivity of the reactants was explored using esp analysis the difference in the electrical property of the nuclear charges contributed to the various distributions of the electrostatic potential esp analysis in fig 6b shows that the electrostatic potential around the n and o atoms is negative while that around c h ti and al atoms is positive in accordance with the principle of electrostatic potential complementarity the positively charged nuclear charges tended to contact the negatively charged ones and then promoted the transformation of the electrons cao et al 2022 accordingly the interaction between tea and ti precursors occurred under the action of the electrostatic potential complementarity between the negatively charged area around the o atom and the positively charged area around the ti atom electrostatic potential close to the or groups in ti or 3 tea showed a high positive value while that close to the al o showed a high negative value therefore the combination of the hydrolysates between al and ti could also be interpreted by electrostatic attraction the preferential reaction sites were forecasted using the reduced fukui function table s2 5 the f of tea showed relatively positive values in c h and o atoms which were 0 0017 0 0019 and 0 0020 respectively the maximum f value of ti or 4 was found in h atoms in methyl the reaction sites of tea and ti precursors might be the hydroxyl of tea and the or of ti precursors which could lead to the formation of the co ti bond by abandoning an ethanol molecule the maximum f and f values of the hydrolysates of ti and al were observed in h atoms which was consistent with our hypothesis that hydroxyl groups in the hydrolysates of al and ti first contacted with each other by the formation of hydrogen bonds subsequently the hydrolysates of al and ti were polymerized by dehydration condensation reaction to form an al o ti bond after the geometry optimization the hydrolysate with the framework of the al o ti bond was confirmed stable no 5 in fig 6a the bonding types of co ti and al o ti bonds in the products were further studied using the aim methodology fig 6c and table s6 the topological properties at the bond critical point bcp such as laplacian of electron density 2ρ r the energy density of all electrons ρ r energy density e r lagrangian kinetic energy g r and the ratio of v r g r can represent the interaction type between atoms cao et al 2022 for the co bond its 2ρ r 0 ρ r 0 and e r 0 which indicated a typical covalent interaction for the ti o bond its 2ρ r 0 1 v r g r 2 which represented the electrovalent interaction the ratio of v r g r was lower than 1 for the al o bond which corresponded to the closed shell interplay espinosa et al 2002 3 5 coagulation performance in actual lake water treatment based on the above research results an al ti gel with the ti tea of 1 2 ti h2o of 1 6 and ti al of 3 1 was selected and investigated for actual lake water treatment also the single ti gel and al gel with the same ti tea and ti h2o molar ratio as al ti gel were taken as a control experiment the coagulation efficiency and floc properties of the al ti gel ti gel and al gel are shown in fig 7 ti gel al ti gel and al gel had the same mass concentration of the ti4 or al3 but they showed a far different appearance fig s12 a muddy phenomenon with a turbidity of 191 0 ntu was observed in al gel which was due to the formation of al2o3 in consequence al gel was inefficient in removing uv254 and turbidity because it was insufficient in active aluminum species fig s13 notably al ti gel was a clarified solution which further confirmed the aforementioned conclusion that al ti gel was a novel composite instead of a mixture of al gel and ti gel as shown in fig 7a al ti gel showed a better removal capacity for turbidity and uv254 compared with ti gel after al ti gel coagulation the residual turbidity was lower than 1 0 ntu and the removal efficiency of uv254 could exceed 60 when the dosage reached 0 8 mmol ti4 l however the highest uv254 removal efficiency with the addition of ti gel was lower than 40 even though the dosage increased to 1 2 mmol ti4 l based on the results in fig 7a the optimal dosage of 0 76 mmol ti4 l for ti gel and al ti gel was used in the following work the dosage of al gel was 0 25 mmol l to keep consistent with the al mass concentration of al ti gel the 3d eem spectrum of the actual lake water in fig 7b can be divided into 5 regions which represent the tyrosine like proteins region i tryptophan like proteins region ii fulvic fa like matters region iii intermediate products of metabolism region iv and humic acid like substances region v respectively wang et al 2018c after coagulation the fluorescence intensity of the 5 regions exhibited a significant reduction especially in ti gel and al ti gel coagulation systems compared with ti gel al ti gel had a better capacity in reducing the fluorescence intensity of region iii iv and v especially region v fig 7c it was therefore indicated that al ti gel was more efficient in removing fa ha and intermediate products of metabolism than ti gel the actual lake water had an alkaline condition with a ph value of 9 69 0 31 the hydrolysis process of ti precursors could release h consequently the effluent ph after coagulation by ti gel or al ti gel was 7 25 and 7 27 respectively the hydrolysates of ti primarily existed as tio oh 2 in the ph range of 7 0 10 0 which could entrap contaminants primarily by adsorption and sweeping effects gan et al 2021a however the hydrolysate species of al would transfer from al oh to al oh 3 am and positively charged al hydroxide with the decrease of the ph from 10 0 to 7 0 gan et al 2021a accordingly the hydrolysates of the al ti gel consisted of tio oh 2 al oh 3 am positively charged al hydroxide and al2ti2 oh 8 6 which could eliminate organic matters by the incorporation of charge neutralization sweeping effects and complexation zeta potentials of the flocs formed by the single ti or al gel were negatively charged and the values were hardly affected by the dosage of the gels fig s14 however the al ti gel significantly enhanced the zeta potentials of flocs with the increase of the dosage which demonstrated that al ti gel could provide charge neutralization due to its positively charged hydrolysates floc properties in fig 7d e indicated that al ti gel as compared with ti gel promoted the formation of the flocs with a larger size and more compact structure however the sf and rf values of the flocs formed by al ti gel were smaller than those by ti gel notably the flocs formed by the ti or al gel could be fully regenerated after breakage however a previous study wang et al 2016 reported that flocs formed by sweeping effects could not be regenerated after crushing which conflicted with our results the above contradiction could be explained as that the al or ti gel could release tea monomer under the alkaline condition fig s16 which could act as a bridge among the floc fragments nevertheless the al ti gel was more stable and released less tea monomer due to the interaction between al and ti by considering the recovery ability and zeta potentials of the flocs formed by the al ti gel it was found that charge neutralization was not the only coagulation mechanism and sweeping effects played an essential role in organic removals 4 conclusion in this study a series of al ti gels with different ti tea ti h2o and ti al molar ratios were prepared by the sol gel process using tea as a hydrolysis inhibitor ftir and xps spectra of the al ti gels confirmed the interaction between al and ti the experimental results indicated that tea could inhibit the hydrolysis rate of ti precursors by taking up the coordination sites of h2o to form a co ti bond although ti h2o and ti al molar ratios had little influence on the binding sites and modes between al and ti the transformation process of the hydrolysates was significantly affected due to the different degree of hydrolysis of al and ti the results of the dft calculation revealed that ti could be homogenously incorporated into the framework of aluminum hydrolysates to form an al o ti bond and al2ti2 oh x tea y h2o 8 x y 14 x was the most possible copolymerization hydrolysate of al and ti the coagulation performance of different coagulants in the lake water treatment showed that compared with ti gel al ti gel performed better in removing ha fa and intermediate products of metabolism the highest uv254 removal efficiency with the addition of al ti gel was 60 and the minimum residual turbidity was lower than 1 0 ntu the al ti gel could hydrolyze into tio oh 2 al oh 3 am positively charged al hydroxide and al2ti2 oh x tea y h2o 8 x y 14 x which could remove contaminants by the combined action of charge neutralization adsorption complexation and sweeping effects this study developed a novel al ti composite coagulant and provided a new idea for studying the interaction mechanism between al and ti the systematic investigation of the coagulation mechanism of the composite coagulant has theoretical guiding significance for the efficient treatment of actual surface water declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this study was

15789,microbial removal of trace organic micropollutants omps from drinking water sources remains challenging nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria in rapid sand filters rsfs are capable of biodegrading omps while growing on ammonia and dissolved organic matter dom the loading patterns of ammonia and dom may therefore affect microbial activities as well as omp biodegradation so far there is very limited information on the effect of substrate loading on omp biodegradation at environmentally relevant concentrations 1 µg l in rsfs we investigated the biodegradation rates of 16 omps at various substrate loading rates and or empty bed contact times ebct the presence of dom improved the biodegradation of paracetamol 41 8 by functioning as supplementary carbon source for the heterotrophic degrader while hindering the biodegradation of 2 4 d mecoprop and benzotriazole due to substrate competition lower loading ratios of dom benzotriazole benefited benzotriazole biodegradation by reducing substrate competition higher ammonia loading rates enhanced benzotriazole removal by stimulating nitrification based co metabolism however stimulating nitrification inhibited heterotrophic activity which in turn inhibited the biodegradation of paracetamol 2 4 d and mecoprop a longer ebct promoted metformin biodegradation as it is a slowly biodegradable compound but suppressed the biodegradation of paracetamol and benzotriazole due to limited substrate supply therefore the optimal substrate loading pattern is contingent on the type of omp which can be chosen based on the priority compounds in practice the overall results contribute to understanding omp biodegradation mechanisms at trace concentrations and offer a step towards enhancing microbial removal of omps from drinking water by optimally using rsfs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutant biodegradation dissolved organic matter ammonia substrate loading rate empty bed

et al 2011 and industrial compounds are present at trace concentrations in surface water and groundwater schwarzenbach et al 2006 public concerns about the occurrences ecotoxicities and fates of omps in drinking water production are continuously rising due to their potential toxicity to both environmental and human health ben et al 2018 even though many techniques such as activated carbon adsorption kim and kang 2008 piai et al 2019 advanced oxidation westerhoff et al 2005 ormad et al 2008 ultraviolet irradiation yang et al 2014 and membrane filtration košutić et al 2005 sarkar et al 2007 effectively remove certain omps from drinking water they share the disadvantages of high cost and high energy consumption košutić et al 2005 sarkar et al 2007 an economically promising approach would be to remove omps using indigenous microbial communities in rapid sand filters rsfs hedegaard et al 2014 feld et al 2016 2018 zhou et al 2022 a widely installed facility at drinking water production plants dwpps benner et al 2013 various microbial communities that colonize sand granules as biofilm can facilitate the biological conversion of multiple substrates in rsfs hu et al 2020 for instance nitrifying bacteria catalyze the oxidation of ammonia lee et al 2014 fowler et al 2018 albers et al 2018 poghosyan et al 2020 whereas heterotrophic bacteria can mineralize dissolved organic matters dom bar zeev et al 2012 terry and summers 2018 hu et al 2020 both of them have been reported as omp degraders benner et al 2013 wang et al 2021 nitrifying bacteria can biodegrade omps via co metabolism fernandez fontaina et al 2016 trejo castillo et al 2021 wang et al 2022 rattier et al 2014 reported that using a nitrification inhibitor limited or even stopped the removal of ketoprofen gemfibrozil furosemide acetaminophen caffeine and lincomycin which confirmed the key role of nitrifying bacteria in omp biodegradation in addition heterotrophic bacteria can biotransform omps or even mineralize them as energy sources elhadi et al 2006 hedegaard et al 2014 albers et al 2015 vandermaesen et al 2016 due to their trace concentrations several ng l µg l in drinking water sources omps mainly serve as secondary substrates for microbial co metabolisms stratton et al 1983 zearley and summers 2012 as the typical threshold concentrations for primary cellular bioprocesses are way higher 40 800 µg l stratton et al 1983 consequently the availability of primary substrates e g ammonia and dom may influence the degraders activity and hence the omp biodegradation maeng et al 2011 liu et al 2014 trejo castillo et al 2021 moreover omps differ in their biodegradability resulting in different removal patterns for a mix of omps under stable substrate concentrations he et al 2018 however little is known about the effects of availability of ammonia and dom on the biodegradation of multiple omps especially under rsfs like hydraulic conditions interrogating the omp biodegradation behaviors in an environment realistic continuous mode will help to understand the effects of primary substrate availability on omp biodegradation in field rsfs in rsfs the loading rate of substrates determines their availability for microorganisms which in turn influences the microbial activities lee et al 2014 reported that the nitrification activity of rsfs was dictated by the ammonia loading rate rather than ammonia concentration or volumetric flow velocity individually loading rates of ammonia and dom influence the activities of nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria in rsfs and may therefore determine the biodegradation rates of omps yet knowledge about the effects of primary substrate loading rates on omp biodegradation rate is scarce we hereby propose two hypotheses i higher ammonia loading rates result in higher nitrification activity and may thereby enhance the autotrophic co metabolism of omps ii increasing the dom loading rate on the one hand improves omp biodegradation by enhancing the activity of the heterotrophic community but on the other hand reduces omp biodegradation due to substrate competition with a fixed sand bed height changing the volumetric flow velocity results in different empty bed contact times ebct ebct can critically affect omp biodegradation paredes et al 2016 wang et al 2021 shorter ebct could benefit the biodegradation of easily biodegradable compounds as increased substrate loading rates support microbial activity and can compensate for lower contact time between omps and biofilms paredes et al 2016 however it may limit the degradation of slowly biodegradable compounds due to the reduction in contact time paredes et al 2016 thus a prolonged ebct might be advantageous for the biodegradation of slowly biodegradable omps but negligibly or even negatively affects the elimination of readily biodegradable omps the aim of this research is to systematically investigate the effects of additional primary substrates substrate loading rates and ebcts on the biodegradation rates of a range of trace omps in rsfs a mixture of sixteen omps including nine pesticides four pharmaceuticals and three industrial chemicals was spiked at a concentration of approximately 1 µg l in column scale rsfs three columns were parallelly operated with different feeding strategies without ammonia and dom control only with dom and only with ammonia by changing either the initial substrate concentrations or volumetric flow velocity dynamic loading rates of ammonia dom and omps as well as ebcts were applied in different operational phases the omp biodegradation kinetic of each phase was determined by pseudo first order kinetic models the results expand our understanding of omp biodegradation processes and offer insight into optimizing the operational conditions to improve biological removal of omps in rsfs 2 materials and methods 2 1 organic micropollutants and dissolved organic matters this study

a broad variety of physicochemical properties table s1 they have been observed in water sources for drinking water production in the netherlands and are regarded as priority omps for removal the commercial companies and stock preparation of omps are given in text s1 the measured concentrations of all omps in spiked influent were around 800 ng l except for salicylic acid which was at a median concentration of 76 ng l fig s1 salicylic acid as a readily biodegradable compound combarros et al 2014 hack et al 2015 could have been biodegraded in the feeding tubes dom were extracted from a compost soil purchased from semillas batlle company barcelona spain and stored at 4 prior to use detailed in text s2 the obtained dom stock solution contained 1062 8 40 7 mg c l 225 0 50 8 mg total

length and 10 cm in diameter figs 1 and s2 the columns were filled with a support layer of 8 cm gravel granule size 5 7 mm and covered by a working layer of 32 cm sand granule size 0 8 1 25 mm above the sand layer a supernatant water layer with a height of 10 cm was maintained column a was the control column without the spiking of ammonia and dom column b was spiked with dom up to 6 mg c l and column c was spiked with ammonia up to 2 5 mg nh4 n l fig 1 three columns were run in parallel for 178 days including one inoculation phase starting up one selective enrichment phase phase 0 and five experimental phases fig s3 the strategies of inoculation selective enrichment and spiking were described in text s3 the columns were run in the dark by being fully covered with aluminum foil to avoid algal growth and omp photodegradation each column was operated in an open headspace and connected with a small glass tube as an overflow weir to obtain a stable effluent flow and supernatant height backwashing was conducted when clogging occurred in columns at least weekly by backwashing program box each filter was backwashed by the pressurized tap water for 5 min omps were spiked into the feeding at the concentration of approximately 1 µg l during the experimental phases where different loading rates of dom ammonia and omps were applied table 1 briefly high loading rates of dom or ammonia were applied at phase i iii and v while lower ones of dom or ammonia were set at phase ii and iv at phase ii the lower loading rates of dom or ammonia were achieved by decreasing the initial concentration of dom and ammonia differently the loading rates of dom ammonia and omps were achieved by decreasing the volumetric flow velocity at phase iv so that the ebcts were consequently longer than other phases the pumps were recalibrated at the end of each phase to ensure stable flow rates and ebcts the theoretical values of operational parameters in table 1 were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 the loading ratio of dom omp was determined by eq 3 1 t h s q 10 3 2 s l r c s u b s t r a t e q 3 y s l r d o m s l r o m p where t h is empty bed contact time ebct the h m is the height of sand layer without the support layer s m2 represents the cross sectional area of the column q l h is the volumetric flow velocity slr µg h for omp or mg h for dom and ammonia means the substrate loading rate csubstrate µg l for omp or mg l for dom and ammonia is the substrate concentration in inlet y is the loading ratio of dom omp to monitor the performance of columns the multiple chemical parameters described in section 2 4 in both influent and effluent were measured every two or three days during the last week of each experimental phase the triplicate samples were collected from the top middle and bottom layers of sand bed to show the vertical removal of contaminants within the columns at the end of each phase all columns were drained off where sand samples approximately 2 ml were taken from different layers for further molecular analysis the removal performance of omp was represented by the residual omp in effluent which was calculated by eq 4 4 r c c o 100 where r represents the residual percentage of omps in effluent c ng l and c 0 ng l are the concentrations of omps in effluent and influent respectively 2 3 chemical analytical methods the collected samples were filtered through 0 45 µm syringe filters and then stored at 4 prior to measurement or at 20 if the storage time was more than one week ammonia nh4 n and total nitrogen tn were measured by hach tntplus chemistries kits with a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach usa nitrate no3 n and nitrite no2 n were quantified by an ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 thermo usa equipped with an as17 column the

values in effluent were recorded by a datalogger consort d230 belgium with real time ph electrodes prosense qp108x the netherlands another set of liquid samples 2 ml for omp quantification was mixed with acetonitrile 5 v v to avoid omp sorption onto centrifuge tubes and was centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 10 min the supernatants were stored in autosampler vials at 20 before analysis omp quantification was performed on an ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc equipped with a triple quad mass spectrometer sciex triple quad 5500 usa see details in text s4 the limits of quantification in the sample matrix were 25 ng l and detection limit was not measured in this experiment 2 4 molecular analysis genomic dna was extracted from sand samples approximately 1000 mg by dneasy powersoil kit qiagen hilden germany the concentration and quality of extracted dna were measured by a nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific nd 2000 usa dna samples were stored at

enzyme representing nitrifying bacteria fowler et al 2018 and three functional genes involved in pesticide biodegradation including tfda gene involving in 2 4 d biodegradation bælum et al 2008 and rdpa and sdpa genes responsible for mecoprop degradation feld et al 2016 each sample was assayed in triplicates by using a c1000 thermal cycler cfx384 real time system bio rad laboratories usa with iqtm sybr green supermix bio rad laboratories usa standard calibration curves were obtained by using gradient concentrations of plasmid dna containing the target genes further information of primers and cycling sequences applied for qpcr were listed in table s5 2 5 kinetic analysis kinetic analysis was used to compare omp biodegradation rates in different phases previous studies demonstrated the microbial transformation of pollutants in biofilms followed pseudo first order kinetic model smook et al 2008 zearley and summers 2012 in addition the biodegradation pattern of trace organic pollutants that are not supporting bacterial growth is best fit by pseudo first order kinetic model schmidt et al 1985 therefore the pseudo first order kinetic models eq 5 was applied to analyze the biodegradation processes of omps under different conditions in this study 5 ln c c 0 k t where c ng l and c 0 ng l were the concentrations of omps in effluent and influent t h was ebct and k h 1 was the first order rate constant 2 6 statistical analysis the student s test t test was carried out to identify the significance of differences for omp removal among three columns and omp biodegradation kinetic constants in different operational phases all the statistical analyses were performed by using r version 4 1 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 the activities of heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria affect omp removal the adsorption batch assay see details in text s5 showed that adsorption to sand did not significantly contribute to the removal of selected omps fig s6 as was also confirmed by other studies zearley and summers 2012 biodegradation was therefore proposed as the main removal process of omps in columns ten compounds were negligibly removed throughout the experiments and were thus regarded as recalcitrant compounds in this study fig s7 the addition of dom or ammonia dictated the activity of heterotrophic or nitrifying bacteria with varied biodegradation capacities for paracetamol benzotriazole 2 4 d and mecoprop the biodegradation of paracetamol 2 4 d and mecoprop was stimulated by the addition of dom as their median removal increased from 20 6 fig 2 a 32 5 fig 2c and 26 4 fig 2d in the control column to 62 4 fig 2a 52 6 fig 2c and 54 4 fig 2d in the dom column respectively in contrast their biodegradation was suppressed in the ammonia column where the median removal decreased to 0 8 for paracetamol fig 2a 2 9 for 2 4 d fig 2c and 1 8 for mecoprop fig 2d the addition of ammonia combined with a limited dom feeding in the ammonia column might allow nitrifying bacteria to outcompete the heterotrophic degraders therefore the biodegradation of paracetamol 2 4 d and mecoprop was most likely attributed to the activity of the heterotrophic community rather than that of nitrifying community in contrast to the aforementioned three omps benzotriazole showed an opposite removal behavior with the addition of dom or ammonia fig 2b benzotriazole biodegradation was inhibited by the addition of dom with a median removal of 36 5 in the dom column as compared to the control column with 83 0 fig 2b the inhibited biodegradation of benzotriazole in the dom column could be due to substrate competition between dom and benzotriazole previous studies indicated that the presence of biodegradable dom could reduce microbial biodegradation preference for certain omps e g caffeine due to the substrate competition he et al 2018 therefore microorganisms able to degrade benzotriazole may prefer to metabolize biodegradable dom instead of benzotriazole if excess dom is available in addition benzotriazole biodegradation was enhanced by the addition of ammonia with a median removal of 93 5 fig 2b the improved removal of benzotriazole under nitrification conditions was most likely due to the autotrophic co metabolisms trejo castillo et al 2021 reported that benzotriazole could be co metabolically biodegraded in nitrifying cultures and increasing the initial ammonia concentration resulted in an increase in benzothiazole co metabolism it was also observed that the ammonium monooxygenase amo enzyme can oxidize a broad range of organic compounds by hydroxylating alkyl groups or aromatic ring fernandez fontaina et al 2016 we therefore conclude that nitrifying bacteria may contribute to benzotriazole biodegradation 3 2 dom loading patterns dictate omp biodegradation rates 3 2 1 the loading ratio of dom benzotriazole determines benzotriazole biodegradation rates lower dom loading rates benefited benzotriazole biodegradation the average removal of benzotriazole was 20 1 14 2 in the phases with high dom loading rates 31 4 4 4 mg c h 1 whereas was 48 1 9 2 in the phases with low dom loading rates 11 8 2 6 mg c h 1 fig s8a there was a significant difference p value 6 99 10 6 t test in benzotriazole removal between the high dom loading phases and the low dom loading phases the negative effects of dom loading rates on benzotriazole biodegradation were consistent with the finding in section 3 1 where the presence of dom negatively affect benzotriazole removal we subsequently examined the effects of substrate competition on the biodegradation rate of benzotriazole the loading ratio of dom benzotriazole represents the level of substrate competition while biodegradation kinetic constants show the biodegradation rate the results revealed that biodegradation kinetic constant of benzotriazole was highest in phase ii where the loading ratio of dom benzotriazole is lowest fig 3 in addition vertical removal data showed that more benzotriazole was removed in the bottom half of dom column fig s8b this could be the result of a lower loading ratio of dom benzotriazole due to partial dom consumption in the top half of the column thus the lower loading ratio of dom benzotriazole established a condition with less substrate competition which was beneficial for benzotriazole biodegradation an improved removal of benzotriazole under carbon limited conditions was also observed in sequential managed aquifer recharge systems müller et al 2017 hellauer et al 2018a 2018b in these systems benzotriazole was recalcitrant in the first aquifer passage hellauer et al 2018a 2018b where higher concentrations of degradable dom were present regnery et al 2016 benzotriazole was efficiently biodegraded in the second aquifer passage hellauer et al 2018a 2018b where water was carbon depleted as the easily biodegradable dom was consumed in the first passage these findings combined with our results could verify the fact that dom overloading is disadvantageous for benzotriazole biodegradation due to the stronger substrate competition the surplus biodegradable dom increased microbial preferences for utilizing dom instead of benzotriazole in addition dom consists of a range of organic molecules with different biodegradation rates thus dom containing different biodegradable fractions may show variable biodegradability and hence affect the substrate competition 3 2 2 dom loading enhances heterotrophic bacteria growth for paracetamol biodegradation long term operation resulted in the growth of heterotrophic communities to degrade paracetamol in both the control and the dom column biodegradation kinetic constants of paracetamol gradually increased over the course of the 109 days of omp exposure fig 4 a the temporary decrease in phase iv was most likely due to the longer ebcts which will be discussed in section 3 4 it has been widely reported that omp biodegradation was increased after exposure to omps for an adaption period in filtration system hedegaard et al 2014 bertelkamp et al 2016 modrzyński et al 2021 found that the biodegradation of paracetamol was completed after 15 weeks microbial adaption in a column scale aquifer the discussion in section 3 1 suggested that paracetamol biodegradation was contingent on the activity of heterotrophic community thus the microbial adaption for paracetamol biodegradation could be the proliferation of heterotrophic degraders the feeding with dom promoted the growth of heterotrophic degrader and hence shortened the adaption time during the first three phases the biodegradation kinetic constants of paracetamol in dom column were 6 2 fold 5 2 fold and 2 3 fold compared to the ones in the control column fig 4a in addition the kinetic constants reached to above 3 0 h 1 within three phases 66 days in the dom column while it needed five phases 109 days in the control column to reach the same extent fig 4a the longer adaption time in control column might be due to the slower growth of heterotrophs with limited biodegradable dom the copy numbers of total bacterial 16s rrna gene in the control column were less than in the dom column at the end of phase 0 and phase i fig s9b suggesting the bacterial community grew up more slowly in the control column additionally most of paracetamol was removed at the top half of the dom column fig s9a with more available dom and higher bacterial abundance fig s9b confirming the biodegradation of paracetamol required a sufficient activity of the heterotrophic community therefore feeding with dom can contribute to the establishment of enough heterotrophic degraders and hence shorten the microbial adaption time for paracetamol biodegradation 3 2 3 2 4 d and mecoprop biodegradation decreased due to substrate competition the feeding with dom temporarily supported 2 4 d and mecoprop biodegradation in phase i and ii while the biodegradation rates of both herbicides decreased after phase ii in the dom column and after phase iii in the control column fig 4b and c in our experiment biodegradation of 2 4 d and mecoprop at concentrations of 1 µg l was most likely under nongrowth kinetics toräng et al 2003 thus feeding with dom could improve herbicide biodegradation rates by supporting the growth of the herbicide degrader previous studies suggested that the reduced omp biodegradation activity was associated with the loss of degrader cells albers et al 2015 horemans et al 2017 the bacterial loss mechanisms include loss from backwashing from protozoan predation and from starvation albers et al 2015 however the reduction in biodegradation activity in our reactors could not be explained by the loss of degraders since the abundances of the tfda gene involving in 2 4 d biodegradation fig s10a and the sdpa gene required for mecoprop biodegradation fig s10b were at a stable level or even increased in the last three phases the rdpa gene was not detectable in our study which agrees with other reports paulin et al 2011 feld et al 2016 a potential mechanism for diminished biodegradation of 2 4 d and mecoprop during long term column operation is substrate competition in the adaptive phase without omp spiking phase 0 the abundance of tfda and sdpa genes was higher in the dom column than in the control column fig s10 implying that the 2 4 d and mecoprop degraders can grow on dom as a result the specific degrading microorganisms might adapt to dom dependent growth instead of utilizing 2 4 d and mecoprop as carbon sources this microbial adaption was delayed in the control column fig 4b and c and might be the result of the lower degradability of tap water dom compared with compost dom therefore the feeding of dom temporarily benefits 2 4 d and mecoprop biodegradation by providing an extra carbon source for degrader growth but the biodegradation activity diminished with time due to substrate competition after a long term operation 3 3 nitrification rates dictate benzotriazole biodegradation rates the removal behavior of benzotriazole in ammonia column revealed the effect of ammonia loading rates on benzotriazole biodegradation the removal efficiency was improved with the increase in ammonia loading rates the high ammonia loading rates 13 4 1 0 mg nh4 n h 1 resulted in an average removal of 72 4 16 2 while the removal for the low loading rates 2 7 0 3 mg nh4 n h 1 was 32 2 9 0 fig s11a the benzotriazole removal was significantly different p value 4 47 10 7 t test between the high ammonia loading phases and the low ammonia loading phases furthermore ammonia loading rates positively affect benzotriazole biodegradation rates with an average kinetic constant of 3 2 1 6 h 1 in phase i iii and v compared with 0 4 0 4 h 1 in phase ii and iv fig 5 a the nitrification rates appear strongly correlated with ammonia loading rates fig 5a as previously suggested by lee et al 2014 hence the activity of nitrifying bacteria dictates benzotriazole biodegradation rates which is verified by the vertical removal pattern of benzotriazole and the abundance of amoa gene with depth fig 5b represents how the majority of benzotriazole was removed in the top half of column where the nitrification process mainly took place fig 5c moreover the copy numbers of amoa genes representing the abundance of nitrifying bacteria fowler et al 2018 was higher in the top layer than in the bottom layer fig 5d the negligible nitrite formation indicates the presence of complete ammonia oxidizing comammox nitrifier in the column figs 5c and s12 it has been reported that comammox nitrifier like nitrospira dominated the nitrifying community in field rsfs fowler et al 2018 poghosyan et al 2020 hu et al 2020 wang et al 2022 these outcomes show that the high loading rates of ammonia can promote benzotriazole biodegradation rates by stimulating the activity of nitrifying bacteria 3 4 effects of ebct on omp biodegradation rates in this study control column was fed with neither additional ammonia nor biodegradable dom where ebct was therefore the sole controlled changing factor during all the phases of the experiment table 1 therefore the biodegradation performances in control column were used for understanding the impacts of ebct on omp biodegradation rates a prolonged ebct limits the biodegradation activities of paracetamol and benzotriazole as a 5 longer ebct in phase iv resulted in lower biodegradation kinetic constants for paracetamol and benzotriazole fig 6 a and b the prolonged ebcts can reduce the microbial activity by limiting substrate loading rates and hence result in inhibitory effects on omp biodegradation paredes et al 2016 wang et al 2021 our results showed that paracetamol biodegradation was contingent on the activity of the heterotrophic community figs 2a and 4a therefore the longer ebct may limit the activity of heterotrophic degraders by decreasing dom loading rates and thus reduce the biodegradation rates of paracetamol the prolonged ebct reduced the loading rates of both dom and benzotriazole and hence resulted in a similar competitive condition for benzotriazole biodegradation this demonstrates that the reduced activity for benzotriazole biodegradation with prolonged ebct may result from the deceased substrate loading rates rather than the substrate competition in contrast a longer ebct improved metformin biodegradation efficiency in all the columns fig s13 especially in the control column the removal efficiency of metformin during phase iv was 46 4 12 8 while the average removal during other phases were 2 5 7 4 fig s13a moreover the biodegradation rate of metformin at phase iv was the highest with a kinetic constant of 0 3 0 1 h 1 versus an average constant of 0 06 0 2 h 1 for other phases fig 6c the biodegradation kinetic constant of metformin was lower than paracetamol and benzotriazole indicating a lower biodegradation rate for metformin fig 6 in addition metformin was previously categorized as not a readily biodegradable compound trautwein and kümmerer 2011 and its biodegradation thus required long residence times scheurer et al 2012 a microbial degradation of metformin occurred in a drinking water aquifer with a residence time of about one year scheurer et al 2012 while another considerable biodegradation of metformin more than 85 was achieved in a managed aquifer recharge with a travel time of 4 08 and 11 76 h hellauer et al 2018a therefore a longer ebct may benefit metformin biodegradation in rsfs as the degraders need sufficient time to induce biotransformation 4 conclusion and field implications the use of rsfs to biodegrade omps is receiving increasing interest but is challenging as biodegradation patterns of omps under multiple operational conditions are not yet sufficiently understood to the best of our knowledge this is the first paper examining omp biodegradation behaviors vis à vis substrate and contaminant loading patterns in a continuous filter system with multiple omps at trace concentrations the feed of dom promotes paracetamol biodegradation by supporting the growth of heterotrophic degraders while inhibiting benzotriazole biodegradation due to substrate competition the substrate competition also reduces the biodegradation of 2 4 d and mecoprop with time we therefore propose two mechanisms for omp biodegradation by heterotrophic populations i paracetamol is degraded by general heterotrophic communities where the generated enzymes for dom utilization are also capable of degrading paracetamol ii benzotriazole 2 4 d and mecoprop are degraded by specific degraders that can utilize both dom and omps high dom loading rates can therefore reduce the microbial preference for omps via substrate competition two field strategies can hereby be envisioned to improve the biodegradation of benzotriazole 2 4 d and mecoprop first two filter units can be designed in series where a majority of biodegradable dom can be consumed in the primary unit while the secondary filter can provide favorable low dom conditions for omp biodegradation instead of building a secondary filter unit extending the sand bed can be another option to create a low dom condition it is assumed that assimilable dom is utilized by communities in the upper part of the filter making the lower part of the filter suitable for benzotriazole 2 4 d and mecoprop biodegradation additionally we need to consider the effects of dom biodegradability on omp biodegradation in practice the dom in the field inlet can be more recalcitrant than the compost dom used in this study thus the substrate competition may be less pronounced in field rsf in contrast adding biodegradable dom in influent is a possible solution to enhance microbial elimination of paracetamol in this case the residual dom in effluent if any needs to be strictly monitored and removed to ensure proper drinking water quality stimulating nitrification enhances the co metabolism of benzotriazole but inhibits biodegradation of paracetamol 2 4 d and mecoprop therefore a promising alternative for improving benzotriazole biodegradation is to boost nitrifying bacteria growth by adding additional ammonia in rsfs to avoid the excess nitrate production or increased oxygen consumption in daily operation periodically backwashing the sand bed with ammonia could be an attractive strategy similarly as aeration is an upstream facility for rsfs in dwpps limiting nitrification there can improve ammonia loading amounts thereby supporting nitrification activity in rsfs however it should be noted that certain omps like paracetamol 2 4 d and mecoprop are mainly degraded by heterotrophic bacteria therefore an improving nitrification activity may be detrimental for their removal as autotrophs will dominate over heterotrophic communities prolonging ebct improves metformin removal by providing sufficient contact time but reduces biodegradation rates of paracetamol and benzotriazole due to the substrate supply limitation it seems unrealistic to guarantee a satisfactory removal of multiple compounds with one ebct however ebcts need to be prolonged when slow biodegrading compounds are present in the inlet water to prevent the reduced biodegradation rate of other compounds from decreasing substrate loading rates a thicker sand bed could be an option to offer a longer ebct without reducing flow velocity overall this research contributes to an improved understanding of how substrate loading patterns determine omp biodegradation activity in rsfs providing a key foundation for optimizing rsfs for the removal of omps from

15789,microbial removal of trace organic micropollutants omps from drinking water sources remains challenging nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria in rapid sand filters rsfs are capable of biodegrading omps while growing on ammonia and dissolved organic matter dom the loading patterns of ammonia and dom may therefore affect microbial activities as well as omp biodegradation so far there is very limited information on the effect of substrate loading on omp biodegradation at environmentally relevant concentrations 1 µg l in rsfs we investigated the biodegradation rates of 16 omps at various substrate loading rates and or empty bed contact times ebct the presence of dom improved the biodegradation of paracetamol 41 8 by functioning as supplementary carbon source for the heterotrophic degrader while hindering the biodegradation of 2 4 d mecoprop and benzotriazole due to substrate competition lower loading ratios of dom benzotriazole benefited benzotriazole biodegradation by reducing substrate competition higher ammonia loading rates enhanced benzotriazole removal by stimulating nitrification based co metabolism however stimulating nitrification inhibited heterotrophic activity which in turn inhibited the biodegradation of paracetamol 2 4 d and mecoprop a longer ebct promoted metformin biodegradation as it is a slowly biodegradable compound but suppressed the biodegradation of paracetamol and benzotriazole due to limited substrate supply therefore the optimal substrate loading pattern is contingent on the type of omp which can be chosen based on the priority compounds in practice the overall results contribute to understanding omp biodegradation mechanisms at trace concentrations and offer a step towards enhancing microbial removal of omps from drinking water by optimally using rsfs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutant biodegradation dissolved organic matter ammonia substrate loading rate empty bed

et al 2011 and industrial compounds are present at trace concentrations in surface water and groundwater schwarzenbach et al 2006 public concerns about the occurrences ecotoxicities and fates of omps in drinking water production are continuously rising due to their potential toxicity to both environmental and human health ben et al 2018 even though many techniques such as activated carbon adsorption kim and kang 2008 piai et al 2019 advanced oxidation westerhoff et al 2005 ormad et al 2008 ultraviolet irradiation yang et al 2014 and membrane filtration košutić et al 2005 sarkar et al 2007 effectively remove certain omps from drinking water they share the disadvantages of high cost and high energy consumption košutić et al 2005 sarkar et al 2007 an economically promising approach would be to remove omps using indigenous microbial communities in rapid sand filters rsfs hedegaard et al 2014 feld et al 2016 2018 zhou et al 2022 a widely installed facility at drinking water production plants dwpps benner et al 2013 various microbial communities that colonize sand granules as biofilm can facilitate the biological conversion of multiple substrates in rsfs hu et al 2020 for instance nitrifying bacteria catalyze the oxidation of ammonia lee et al 2014 fowler et al 2018 albers et al 2018 poghosyan et al 2020 whereas heterotrophic bacteria can mineralize dissolved organic matters dom bar zeev et al 2012 terry and summers 2018 hu et al 2020 both of them have been reported as omp degraders benner et al 2013 wang et al 2021 nitrifying bacteria can biodegrade omps via co metabolism fernandez fontaina et al 2016 trejo castillo et al 2021 wang et al 2022 rattier et al 2014 reported that using a nitrification inhibitor limited or even stopped the removal of ketoprofen gemfibrozil furosemide acetaminophen caffeine and lincomycin which confirmed the key role of nitrifying bacteria in omp biodegradation in addition heterotrophic bacteria can biotransform omps or even mineralize them as energy sources elhadi et al 2006 hedegaard et al 2014 albers et al 2015 vandermaesen et al 2016 due to their trace concentrations several ng l µg l in drinking water sources omps mainly serve as secondary substrates for microbial co metabolisms stratton et al 1983 zearley and summers 2012 as the typical threshold concentrations for primary cellular bioprocesses are way higher 40 800 µg l stratton et al 1983 consequently the availability of primary substrates e g ammonia and dom may influence the degraders activity and hence the omp biodegradation maeng et al 2011 liu et al 2014 trejo castillo et al 2021 moreover omps differ in their biodegradability resulting in different removal patterns for a mix of omps under stable substrate concentrations he et al 2018 however little is known about the effects of availability of ammonia and dom on the biodegradation of multiple omps especially under rsfs like hydraulic conditions interrogating the omp biodegradation behaviors in an environment realistic continuous mode will help to understand the effects of primary substrate availability on omp biodegradation in field rsfs in rsfs the loading rate of substrates determines their availability for microorganisms which in turn influences the microbial activities lee et al 2014 reported that the nitrification activity of rsfs was dictated by the ammonia loading rate rather than ammonia concentration or volumetric flow velocity individually loading rates of ammonia and dom influence the activities of nitrifying and heterotrophic bacteria in rsfs and may therefore determine the biodegradation rates of omps yet knowledge about the effects of primary substrate loading rates on omp biodegradation rate is scarce we hereby propose two hypotheses i higher ammonia loading rates result in higher nitrification activity and may thereby enhance the autotrophic co metabolism of omps ii increasing the dom loading rate on the one hand improves omp biodegradation by enhancing the activity of the heterotrophic community but on the other hand reduces omp biodegradation due to substrate competition with a fixed sand bed height changing the volumetric flow velocity results in different empty bed contact times ebct ebct can critically affect omp biodegradation paredes et al 2016 wang et al 2021 shorter ebct could benefit the biodegradation of easily biodegradable compounds as increased substrate loading rates support microbial activity and can compensate for lower contact time between omps and biofilms paredes et al 2016 however it may limit the degradation of slowly biodegradable compounds due to the reduction in contact time paredes et al 2016 thus a prolonged ebct might be advantageous for the biodegradation of slowly biodegradable omps but negligibly or even negatively affects the elimination of readily biodegradable omps the aim of this research is to systematically investigate the effects of additional primary substrates substrate loading rates and ebcts on the biodegradation rates of a range of trace omps in rsfs a mixture of sixteen omps including nine pesticides four pharmaceuticals and three industrial chemicals was spiked at a concentration of approximately 1 µg l in column scale rsfs three columns were parallelly operated with different feeding strategies without ammonia and dom control only with dom and only with ammonia by changing either the initial substrate concentrations or volumetric flow velocity dynamic loading rates of ammonia dom and omps as well as ebcts were applied in different operational phases the omp biodegradation kinetic of each phase was determined by pseudo first order kinetic models the results expand our understanding of omp biodegradation processes and offer insight into optimizing the operational conditions to improve biological removal of omps in rsfs 2 materials and methods 2 1 organic micropollutants and dissolved organic matters this study selected nine pesticides 2 6 dichlorobenzamide bam mecoprop 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d chloridazon methyl desphenyl chloridazon desphenyl chloridazon bentazone metolachlor and metribuzin four pharmaceuticals paracetamol salicylic acid caffeine and metformin and three industrial chemicals perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa diglyme and benzotriazole as target compounds these compounds display a broad variety of physicochemical properties table s1 they have been observed in water sources for drinking water production in the netherlands and are regarded as priority omps for removal the commercial companies and stock preparation of omps are given in text s1 the measured concentrations of all omps in spiked influent were around 800 ng l except for salicylic acid which was at a median concentration of 76 ng l fig s1 salicylic acid as a readily biodegradable compound combarros et al 2014 hack et al 2015 could have been biodegraded in the feeding tubes dom were extracted from a compost soil purchased from semillas batlle company barcelona spain and stored at 4 prior to use detailed in text s2 the obtained dom stock solution contained 1062 8 40 7 mg c l 225 0 50 8 mg total nitrogen tn l 151 0 18 7 mg no3 n l 1 5 0 2 mg no2 n l and 10 3 3 9 mg nh4 n l 2 2 column setup and operation the column scale rapid sand filter module consisted of three quartz columns with 60 cm in length and 10 cm in diameter figs 1 and s2 the columns were filled with a support layer of 8 cm gravel granule size 5 7 mm and covered by a working layer of 32 cm sand granule size 0 8 1 25 mm above the sand layer a supernatant water layer with a height of 10 cm was maintained column a was the control column without the spiking of ammonia and dom column b was spiked with dom up to 6 mg c l and column c was spiked with ammonia up to 2 5 mg nh4 n l fig 1 three columns were run in parallel for 178 days including one inoculation phase starting up one selective enrichment phase phase 0 and five experimental phases fig s3 the strategies of inoculation selective enrichment and spiking were described in text s3 the columns were run in the dark by being fully covered with aluminum foil to avoid algal growth and omp photodegradation each column was operated in an open headspace and connected with a small glass tube as an overflow weir to obtain a stable effluent flow and supernatant height backwashing was conducted when clogging occurred in columns at least weekly by backwashing program box each filter was backwashed by the pressurized tap water for 5 min omps were spiked into the feeding at the concentration of approximately 1 µg l during the experimental phases where different loading rates of dom ammonia and omps were applied table 1 briefly high loading rates of dom or ammonia were applied at phase i iii and v while lower ones of dom or ammonia were set at phase ii and iv at phase ii the lower loading rates of dom or ammonia were achieved by decreasing the initial concentration of dom and ammonia differently the loading rates of dom ammonia and omps were achieved by decreasing the volumetric flow velocity at phase iv so that the ebcts were consequently longer than other phases the pumps were recalibrated at the end of each phase to ensure stable flow rates and ebcts the theoretical values of operational parameters in table 1 were calculated by eqs 1 and 2 the loading ratio of dom omp was determined by eq 3 1 t h s q 10 3 2 s l r c s u b s t r a t e q 3 y s l r d o m s l r o m p where t h is empty bed contact time ebct the h m is the height of sand layer without the support layer s m2 represents the cross sectional area of the column q l h is the volumetric flow velocity slr µg h for omp or mg h for dom and ammonia means the substrate loading rate csubstrate µg l for omp or mg l for dom and ammonia is the substrate concentration in inlet y is the loading ratio of dom omp to monitor the performance of columns the multiple chemical parameters described in section 2 4 in both influent and effluent were measured every two or three days during the last week of each experimental phase the triplicate samples were collected from the top middle and bottom layers of sand bed to show the vertical removal of contaminants within the columns at the end of each phase all columns were drained off where sand samples approximately 2 ml were taken from different layers for further molecular analysis the removal performance of omp was represented by the residual omp in effluent which was calculated by eq 4 4 r c c o 100 where r represents the residual percentage of omps in effluent c ng l and c 0 ng l are the concentrations of omps in effluent and influent respectively 2 3 chemical analytical methods the collected samples were filtered through 0 45 µm syringe filters and then stored at 4 prior to measurement or at 20 if the storage time was more than one week ammonia nh4 n and total nitrogen tn were measured by hach tntplus chemistries kits with a spectrophotometer dr3900 hach usa nitrate no3 n and nitrite no2 n were quantified by an ion chromatography dionex ics 2100 thermo usa equipped with an as17 column the dom concentration was quantified by the total amount of organic carbon toc toc non purgeable organic carbon concentration was assessed by toc lcph analyzer with an asi l autosampler shimadzu japan ph values in effluent were recorded by a datalogger consort d230 belgium with real time ph electrodes prosense qp108x the netherlands another set of liquid samples 2 ml for omp quantification was mixed with acetonitrile 5 v v to avoid omp sorption onto centrifuge tubes and was centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 10 min the supernatants were stored in autosampler vials at 20 before analysis omp quantification was performed on an ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc equipped with a triple quad mass spectrometer sciex triple quad 5500 usa see details in text s4 the limits of quantification in the sample matrix were 25 ng l and detection limit was not measured in this experiment 2 4 molecular analysis genomic dna was extracted from sand samples approximately 1000 mg by dneasy powersoil kit qiagen hilden germany the concentration and quality of extracted dna were measured by a nanodrop spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific nd 2000 usa dna samples were stored at 80 prior to further analysis quantitative pcr qpcr was used to quantify the copy numbers of total bacterial 16s rrna gene representing total bacteria amoa gene coding for ammonia monooxygenase amo enzyme representing nitrifying bacteria fowler et al 2018 and three functional genes involved in pesticide biodegradation including tfda gene involving in 2 4 d biodegradation bælum et al 2008 and rdpa and sdpa genes responsible for mecoprop degradation feld et al 2016 each sample was assayed in triplicates by using a c1000 thermal cycler cfx384 real time system bio rad laboratories usa with iqtm sybr green supermix bio rad laboratories usa standard calibration curves were obtained by using gradient concentrations of plasmid dna containing the target genes further information of primers and cycling sequences applied for qpcr were listed in table s5 2 5 kinetic analysis kinetic analysis was used to compare omp biodegradation rates in different phases previous studies demonstrated the microbial transformation of pollutants in biofilms followed pseudo first order kinetic model smook et al 2008 zearley and summers 2012 in addition the biodegradation pattern of trace organic pollutants that are not supporting bacterial growth is best fit by pseudo first order kinetic model schmidt et al 1985 therefore the pseudo first order kinetic models eq 5 was applied to analyze the biodegradation processes of omps under different conditions in this study 5 ln c c 0 k t where c ng l and c 0 ng l were the concentrations of omps in effluent and influent t h was ebct and k h 1 was the first order rate constant 2 6 statistical analysis the student s test t test was carried out to identify the significance of differences for omp removal among three columns and omp biodegradation kinetic constants in different operational phases all the statistical analyses were performed by using r version 4 1 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 the activities of heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria affect omp removal the adsorption batch assay see details in text s5 showed that adsorption to sand did not significantly contribute to the removal of selected omps fig s6 as was also confirmed by other studies zearley and summers 2012 biodegradation was therefore proposed as the main removal process of omps in columns ten compounds were negligibly removed throughout the experiments and were thus regarded as recalcitrant compounds in this study fig s7 the addition of dom or ammonia dictated the activity of heterotrophic or nitrifying bacteria with varied biodegradation capacities for paracetamol benzotriazole 2 4 d and mecoprop the biodegradation of paracetamol 2 4 d and mecoprop was stimulated by the addition of dom as their median removal increased from 20 6 fig 2 a 32 5 fig 2c and 26 4 fig 2d in the control column to 62 4 fig 2a 52 6 fig 2c and 54 4 fig 2d in the dom column respectively in contrast their biodegradation was suppressed in the ammonia column where the median removal decreased to 0 8 for paracetamol fig 2a 2 9 for 2 4 d fig 2c and 1 8 for mecoprop fig 2d the addition of ammonia combined with a limited dom feeding in the ammonia column might allow nitrifying bacteria to outcompete the heterotrophic degraders therefore the biodegradation of paracetamol 2 4 d and mecoprop was most likely attributed to the activity of the heterotrophic community rather than that of nitrifying community in contrast to the aforementioned three omps benzotriazole showed an opposite removal behavior with the addition of dom or ammonia fig 2b benzotriazole biodegradation was inhibited by the addition of dom with a median removal of 36 5 in the dom column as compared to the control column with 83 0 fig 2b the inhibited biodegradation of benzotriazole in the dom column could be due to substrate competition between dom and benzotriazole previous studies indicated that the presence of biodegradable dom could reduce microbial biodegradation preference for certain omps e g caffeine due to the substrate competition he et al 2018 therefore microorganisms able to degrade benzotriazole may prefer to metabolize biodegradable dom instead of benzotriazole if excess dom is available in addition benzotriazole biodegradation was enhanced by the addition of ammonia with a median removal of 93 5 fig 2b the improved removal of benzotriazole under nitrification conditions was most likely due to the autotrophic co metabolisms trejo castillo et al 2021 reported that benzotriazole could be co metabolically biodegraded in nitrifying cultures and increasing the initial ammonia concentration resulted in an increase in benzothiazole co metabolism it was also observed that the ammonium monooxygenase amo enzyme can oxidize a broad range of organic compounds by hydroxylating alkyl groups or aromatic ring fernandez fontaina et al 2016 we therefore conclude that nitrifying bacteria may contribute to benzotriazole biodegradation 3 2 dom loading patterns dictate omp biodegradation rates 3 2 1 the loading ratio of dom benzotriazole determines benzotriazole biodegradation rates lower dom loading rates benefited benzotriazole biodegradation the average removal of benzotriazole was 20 1 14 2 in the phases with high dom loading rates 31 4 4 4 mg c h 1 whereas was 48 1 9 2 in the phases with low dom loading rates 11 8 2 6 mg c h 1 fig s8a there was a significant difference p value 6 99 10 6 t test in benzotriazole removal between the high dom loading phases and the low dom loading phases the negative effects of dom loading rates on benzotriazole biodegradation were consistent with the finding in section 3 1 where the presence of dom negatively affect benzotriazole removal we subsequently examined the effects of substrate competition on the biodegradation rate of benzotriazole the loading ratio of dom benzotriazole represents the level of substrate competition while biodegradation kinetic constants show the biodegradation rate the results revealed that biodegradation kinetic constant of benzotriazole was highest in phase ii where the loading ratio of dom benzotriazole is lowest fig 3 in addition vertical removal data showed that more benzotriazole was removed in the bottom half of dom column fig s8b this could be the result of a lower loading ratio of dom benzotriazole due to partial dom consumption in the top half of the column thus the lower loading ratio of dom benzotriazole established a condition with less substrate competition which was beneficial for benzotriazole biodegradation an improved removal of benzotriazole under carbon limited conditions was also observed in sequential managed aquifer recharge systems müller et al 2017 hellauer et al 2018a 2018b in these systems benzotriazole was recalcitrant in the first aquifer passage hellauer et al 2018a 2018b where higher concentrations of degradable dom were present regnery et al 2016 benzotriazole was efficiently biodegraded in the second aquifer passage hellauer et al 2018a 2018b where water was carbon depleted as the easily biodegradable dom was consumed in the first passage these findings combined with our results could verify the fact that dom overloading is disadvantageous for benzotriazole biodegradation due to the stronger substrate competition the surplus biodegradable dom increased microbial preferences for utilizing dom instead of benzotriazole in addition dom consists of a range of organic molecules with different biodegradation rates thus dom containing different biodegradable fractions may show variable biodegradability and hence affect the substrate competition 3 2 2 dom loading enhances heterotrophic bacteria growth for paracetamol biodegradation long term operation resulted in the growth of heterotrophic communities to degrade paracetamol in both the control and the dom column biodegradation kinetic constants of paracetamol gradually increased over the course of the 109 days of omp exposure fig 4 a the temporary decrease in phase iv was most likely due to the longer ebcts which will be discussed in section 3 4 it has been widely reported that omp biodegradation was increased after exposure to omps for an adaption period in filtration system hedegaard et al 2014 bertelkamp et al 2016 modrzyński et al 2021 found that the biodegradation of paracetamol was completed after 15 weeks microbial adaption in a column scale aquifer the discussion in section 3 1 suggested that paracetamol biodegradation was contingent on the activity of heterotrophic community thus the microbial adaption for paracetamol biodegradation could be the proliferation of heterotrophic degraders the feeding with dom promoted the growth of heterotrophic degrader and hence shortened the adaption time during the first three phases the biodegradation kinetic constants of paracetamol in dom column were 6 2 fold 5 2 fold and 2 3 fold compared to the ones in the control column fig 4a in addition the kinetic constants reached to above 3 0 h 1 within three phases 66 days in the dom column while it needed five phases 109 days in the control column to reach the same extent fig 4a the longer adaption time in control column might be due to the slower growth of heterotrophs with limited biodegradable dom the copy numbers of total bacterial 16s rrna gene in the control column were less than in the dom column at the end of phase 0 and phase i fig s9b suggesting the bacterial community grew up more slowly in the control column additionally most of paracetamol was removed at the top half of the dom column fig s9a with more available dom and higher bacterial abundance fig s9b confirming the biodegradation of paracetamol required a sufficient activity of the heterotrophic community therefore feeding with dom can contribute to the establishment of enough heterotrophic degraders and hence shorten the microbial adaption time for paracetamol biodegradation 3 2 3 2 4 d and mecoprop biodegradation decreased due to substrate competition the feeding with dom temporarily supported 2 4 d and mecoprop biodegradation in phase i and ii while the biodegradation rates of both herbicides decreased after phase ii in the dom column and after phase iii in the control column fig 4b and c in our experiment biodegradation of 2 4 d and mecoprop at concentrations of 1 µg l was most likely under nongrowth kinetics toräng et al 2003 thus feeding with dom could improve herbicide biodegradation rates by supporting the growth of the herbicide degrader previous studies suggested that the reduced omp biodegradation activity was associated with the loss of degrader cells albers et al 2015 horemans et al 2017 the bacterial loss mechanisms include loss from backwashing from protozoan predation and from starvation albers et al 2015 however the reduction in biodegradation activity in our reactors could not be explained by the loss of degraders since the abundances of the tfda gene involving in 2 4 d biodegradation fig s10a and the sdpa gene required for mecoprop biodegradation fig s10b were at a stable level or even increased in the last three phases the rdpa gene was not detectable in our study which agrees with other reports paulin et al 2011 feld et al 2016 a potential mechanism for diminished biodegradation of 2 4 d and mecoprop during long term column operation is substrate competition in the adaptive phase without omp spiking phase 0 the abundance of tfda and sdpa genes was higher in the dom column than in the control column fig s10 implying that the 2 4 d and mecoprop degraders can grow on dom as a result the specific degrading microorganisms might adapt to dom dependent growth instead of utilizing 2 4 d and mecoprop as carbon sources this microbial adaption was delayed in the control column fig 4b and c and might be the result of the lower degradability of tap water dom compared with compost dom therefore the feeding of dom temporarily benefits 2 4 d and mecoprop biodegradation by providing an extra carbon source for degrader growth but the biodegradation activity diminished with time due to substrate competition after a long term operation 3 3 nitrification rates dictate benzotriazole biodegradation rates the removal behavior of benzotriazole in ammonia column revealed the effect of ammonia loading rates on benzotriazole biodegradation the removal efficiency was improved with the increase in ammonia loading rates the high ammonia loading rates 13 4 1 0 mg nh4 n h 1 resulted in an average removal of 72 4 16 2 while the removal for the low loading rates 2 7 0 3 mg nh4 n h 1 was 32 2 9 0 fig s11a the benzotriazole removal was significantly different p value 4 47 10 7 t test between the high ammonia loading phases and the low ammonia loading phases furthermore ammonia loading rates positively affect benzotriazole biodegradation rates with an average kinetic constant of 3 2 1 6 h 1 in phase i iii and v compared with 0 4 0 4 h 1 in phase ii and iv fig 5 a the nitrification rates appear strongly correlated with ammonia loading rates fig 5a as previously suggested by lee et al 2014 hence the activity of nitrifying bacteria dictates benzotriazole biodegradation rates which is verified by the vertical removal pattern of benzotriazole and the abundance of amoa gene with depth fig 5b represents how the majority of benzotriazole was removed in the top half of column where the nitrification process mainly took place fig 5c moreover the copy numbers of amoa genes representing the abundance of nitrifying bacteria fowler et al 2018 was higher in the top layer than in the bottom layer fig 5d the negligible nitrite formation indicates the presence of complete ammonia oxidizing comammox nitrifier in the column figs 5c and s12 it has been reported that comammox nitrifier like nitrospira dominated the nitrifying community in field rsfs fowler et al 2018 poghosyan et al 2020 hu et al 2020 wang et al 2022 these outcomes show that the high loading rates of ammonia can promote benzotriazole biodegradation rates by stimulating the activity of nitrifying bacteria 3 4 effects of ebct on omp biodegradation rates in this study control column was fed with neither additional ammonia nor biodegradable dom where ebct was therefore the sole controlled changing factor during all the phases of the experiment table 1 therefore the biodegradation performances in control column were used for understanding the impacts of ebct on omp biodegradation rates a prolonged ebct limits the biodegradation activities of paracetamol and benzotriazole as a 5 longer ebct in phase iv resulted in lower biodegradation kinetic constants for paracetamol and benzotriazole fig 6 a and b the prolonged ebcts can reduce the microbial activity by limiting substrate loading rates and hence result in inhibitory effects on omp biodegradation paredes et al 2016 wang et al 2021 our results showed that paracetamol biodegradation was contingent on the activity of the heterotrophic community figs 2a and 4a therefore the longer ebct may limit the activity of heterotrophic degraders by decreasing dom loading rates and thus reduce the biodegradation rates of paracetamol the prolonged ebct reduced the loading rates of both dom and benzotriazole and hence resulted in a similar competitive condition for benzotriazole biodegradation this demonstrates that the reduced activity for benzotriazole biodegradation with prolonged ebct may result from the deceased substrate loading rates rather than the substrate competition in contrast a longer ebct improved metformin biodegradation efficiency in all the columns fig s13 especially in the control column the removal efficiency of metformin during phase iv was 46 4 12 8 while the average removal during other phases were 2 5 7 4 fig s13a moreover the biodegradation rate of metformin at phase iv was the highest with a kinetic constant of 0 3 0 1 h 1 versus an average constant of 0 06 0 2 h 1 for other phases fig 6c the biodegradation kinetic constant of metformin was lower than paracetamol and benzotriazole indicating a lower biodegradation rate for metformin fig 6 in addition metformin was previously categorized as not a readily biodegradable compound trautwein and kümmerer 2011 and its biodegradation thus required long residence times scheurer et al 2012 a microbial degradation of metformin occurred in a drinking water aquifer with a residence time of about one year scheurer et al 2012 while another considerable biodegradation of metformin more than 85 was achieved in a managed aquifer recharge with a travel time of 4 08 and 11 76 h hellauer et al 2018a therefore a longer ebct may benefit metformin biodegradation in rsfs as the degraders need sufficient time to induce biotransformation 4 conclusion and field implications the use of rsfs to biodegrade omps is receiving increasing interest but is challenging as biodegradation patterns of omps under multiple operational conditions are not yet sufficiently understood to the best of our knowledge this is the first paper examining omp biodegradation behaviors vis à vis substrate and contaminant loading patterns in a continuous filter system with multiple omps at trace concentrations the feed of dom promotes paracetamol biodegradation by supporting the growth of heterotrophic degraders while inhibiting benzotriazole biodegradation due to substrate competition the substrate competition also reduces the biodegradation of 2 4 d and mecoprop with time we therefore propose two mechanisms for omp biodegradation by heterotrophic populations i paracetamol is degraded by general heterotrophic communities where the generated enzymes for dom utilization are also capable of degrading paracetamol ii benzotriazole 2 4 d and mecoprop are degraded by specific degraders that can utilize both dom and omps high dom loading rates can therefore reduce the microbial preference for omps via substrate competition two field strategies can hereby be envisioned to improve the biodegradation of benzotriazole 2 4 d and mecoprop first two filter units can be designed in series where a majority of biodegradable dom can be consumed in the primary unit while the secondary filter can provide favorable low dom conditions for omp biodegradation instead of building a secondary filter unit extending the sand bed can be another option to create a low dom condition it is assumed that assimilable dom is utilized by communities in the upper part of the filter making the lower part of the filter suitable for benzotriazole 2 4 d and mecoprop biodegradation additionally we need to consider the effects of dom biodegradability on omp biodegradation in practice the dom in the field inlet can be more recalcitrant than the compost dom used in this study thus the substrate competition may be less pronounced in field rsf in contrast adding biodegradable dom in influent is a possible solution to enhance microbial elimination of paracetamol in this case the residual dom in effluent if any needs to be strictly monitored and removed to ensure proper drinking water quality stimulating nitrification enhances the co metabolism of benzotriazole but inhibits biodegradation of paracetamol 2 4 d and mecoprop therefore a promising alternative for improving benzotriazole biodegradation is to boost nitrifying bacteria growth by adding additional ammonia in rsfs to avoid the excess nitrate production or increased oxygen consumption in daily operation periodically backwashing the sand bed with ammonia could be an attractive strategy similarly as aeration is an upstream facility for rsfs in dwpps limiting nitrification there can improve ammonia loading amounts thereby supporting nitrification activity in rsfs however it should be noted that certain omps like paracetamol 2 4 d and mecoprop are mainly degraded by heterotrophic bacteria therefore an improving nitrification activity may be detrimental for their removal as autotrophs will dominate over heterotrophic communities prolonging ebct improves metformin removal by providing sufficient contact time but reduces biodegradation rates of paracetamol and benzotriazole due to the substrate supply limitation it seems unrealistic to guarantee a satisfactory removal of multiple compounds with one ebct however ebcts need to be prolonged when slow biodegrading compounds are present in the inlet water to prevent the reduced biodegradation rate of other compounds from decreasing substrate loading rates a thicker sand bed could be an option to offer a longer ebct without reducing flow velocity overall this research contributes to an improved understanding of how substrate loading patterns determine omp biodegradation activity in rsfs providing a key foundation for optimizing rsfs for the removal of omps from
