17510,the membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr is an emerging wastewater treatment technology that uses o2 supplying membranes as a biofilm support because o2 is supplied from the biofilm base instead of the bulk liquid mabr biofilms have distinct microbial community structures and behavior past research showed that protozoan predation in mabr biofilms can greatly increase biofilm porosity producing a void layer at the base of the biofilm we hypothesized that this void layer could weaken the biofilm and promote sloughing and investigated this with heterotrophic mabr biofilms a rheometer was used to measure biofilm mechanical strength and mabr flow cells were used to explore detachment mabrs supplied with cycloheximide a protozoan inhibitor were used as controls predation increased the internal void ratio from 6 7 to 50 16 the storage modulus was 1 780 1 180 pa with predation condition compared to 9 800 4 290 pa for the control similarly the loss modulus was 1 580 729 pa with predation and 363 189 pa for the control when subjected to an increased flow the biofilm loss was 44 24 for the flow cell with predation while only 7 9 for the control this research shows that predation can have an important impact on biofilm porosity in mabrs reducing the mechanical strength and increasing detachment understanding this phenomenon can help develop more effective biofilm

mabr is an emerging wastewater treatment technology that greatly improves o2 transfer efficiency ote reducing energy requirements in the mabr o2 is supplied through a gas transferring membrane directly to a biofilm growing on the membrane surface when operated with closed end membranes the ote can be as high as 100 ahmad et al 2004 martin and nerenberg 2012 pankhania et al 1994 perez calleja et al 2017 semmens 2005 mabr biofilms are counter diffusional i e o2 is transferred from the base of the biofilm while the electron donor is supplied from bulk liquid this gives mabr biofilms distinct behavior compared to conventional co diffusional biofilms nerenberg 2016 for example thin mabr biofilms can have low contaminant removal fluxes due to biomass limitation similar to conventional co diffusional biofilms but excessively thick mabr biofilms can also have low removal fluxes since substrates diffuse from opposite sides of the biofilm essila et al 2000 martin and nerenberg 2012 as a result biofilm accumulation plays a particularly important role in mabrs biofilm accumulation depends on bacterial growth decay detachment and predation rittmann and mccarty 2012 parry 2004 detachment can be erosive when small amounts of outer biofilm are removed or via sloughing when a significant depth of biofilm is lost at one time stewart 1993 predation can have an important impact on biofilm accumulation aybar et al 2019 derlon et al 2012 huws et al 2005 parry 2004 since most protozoa are aerobic or grow faster under aerobic conditions fenchel 2014 the rate of predation can vary with depth within biofilms in conventional biofilms grazing rates are usually highest at the biofilm exterior where the dissolved oxygen concentrations are high however in mabr biofilms the outer portions are typically anoxic anaerobic and the base is aerobic in past studies researchers found that predation occurred primarily at the aerobic base of the biofilm resulting in a near continuous void layer aybar et al 2019 these voids formed only when the electron donor did not fully penetrate the biofilm when the donor fully penetrated the biofilm the microbial growth rate appeared to exceed the predation rate preventing void formation although detachment was not studied by aybar et al 2019 a void layer deep in the biofilm would seem likely to weaken the biofilm and potentially promote sloughing this is consistent with an observations in a past mabr pilot study semmens 2005 in this research we explored the effects of predation on the mechanical strength and detachment in heterotrophic mabr biofilms we hypothesized that predation would lead to increased biofilm sloughing rheometry was used to assess biofilm mechanical strength a separate reactor was used for these tests detachment tests were used to explore the effect of predation on detachment a flow cell operated with cycloheximide as a protozoan inhibitor derlon et al 2012 was used as a control to better understand the mechanisms of biofilm colonization by protozoa we explored the effect of initially suppressing protozoa but then re inoculating the mature biofilm with protozoa 2 materials and methods we studied predation and detachment for an experimental reactor and two controls 1 the base condition included protozoa from the beginning of the experiment 2 the suppressed condition was a control with predation suppressed by cycloheximide and 3 the delayed condition was a control where predation was suppressed with cycloheximide during the initial stages of biofilm formation but then re inoculated and continued without cycloheximide each condition was run in triplicate two types of experiments were carried out 1 detachment tests where biofilms were exposed to increase shear flow these tests were used to explore the effect of predation on detachment and 2 mechanical property tests where viscoelastic parameters were measured with rheometer these tests explored the effects of predation on the biofilm mechanical properties 2 1 experimental setup and operating conditions detachment tests were run for the base suppressed and delayed conditions each condition was run in triplicate mechanical property tests were only run for the base and suppressed conditions one reactor was run for each condition but multiple mechanical assays were carried on each after the biofilms grew to steady state the biofilm mechanical properties were assessed the proportion of eukaryotes to eukaryotes plus prokaryotes was measured and the detachment when exposed to increased flow rates was performed a summary of the tests and parameters measured is provided in table 1 flow cells for detachment tests flow cells were constructed from plexiglas blocks by creating three transversal slots in each block each slot was 8 mm depth 25 mm long and 3 mm wide providing a working volume of 0 531 ml the top and bottom of each slot was covered with a flat sheet silicone membrane 200 µm thick sspm823005 12 interstate specialty prod inc ma us creating the flow cells air diffused passively through the silicone membranes from atmosphere to the biofilm growing on the interior of the membrane surface the influent was pumped through holes drilled into each end of the flow cells see fig 1 below and fig s1 in the supplementary information for a schematic and image of flow cells flow cells for mechanical property tests for the mechanical property tests special mabr flow cells were built the plexiglas blocks and silicone membranes were the same as described above but a large circular opening was cut into the plexiglas blocks each opening was 805 mm2 area and 11 mm height providing a working volume of 8 9 ml the same type of flat sheet silicone membrane described above covered the top and bottom of each block the influent was pumped through a hole drilled into one end of the flow cells and the effluent left the flow cell through the opposite end see fig 1 below and fig s2 in the supplementary information for a schematic and image of the flow cell growth media and an acetate stock solution were stored in separate bottles and pumped at a 1 1 volumetric ratio using a multichannel peristaltic pump dynamax rp 1 rainin woburn ma usa to a mixing chamber fig 1 the combined media was continuously purged with n2 at a rate of 14 2 ml min to strip any dissolved o2 then pumped into the detachment and the mechanical test reactors at a flow rate of 1 67 ml h hrt 20 min and 27 9 ml h hrt 20 min respectively throughout the study the influent and effluent ph were maintained at 7 0 0 2 the study was conducted at room temperature approximately 23 c 2 2 media the growth medium was made with distilled water and included 2 77 g l na2hpo4 1 7 g l kh2po4 0 41 g l

solution in the mixing chamber the acetate solution for the control included 300 mg l as cod and 500 mg l of cycloheximide as a eukaryotic inhibitor 2 3 flow cell inoculation and growth activated sludge from a local wastewater treatment plant mishawaka in u s was used as the inoculum activated sludge was vigorously mixed and settled 1 ml of supernatant was injected to the medium filled reactors as an inoculum after inoculation the reactors both detachment reactor and mechanical property reactor were recirculated at 16 7 ml h with a multichannel peristaltic pump dynamax rp 1 rainin woburn ma usa for approximately 24 h for the initial attachment of microorganisms to the membrane then the reactors were run with continuous feed the initial attachment was confirmed through optical coherence tomography oct ganymede ii spectral domain oct system thorlabs inc small biofilm clusters of around 10 µm could be seen initially the delayed condition reactors were supplied with cycloheximide during the initial biofilm development and then protozoa were added by re inoculating with activated sludge table 1 in this case 1 ml of inoculum was injected into the reactor daily from day 51 to day 58 tests were carried out two weeks after the flow cells reached steady state the steady state was assessed based on the steady effluent soluble cod scod concentrations and biofilm thicknesses the biofilm thickness was measured by oct as described below 2 4 analytical methods for total solids ts measurement from the detachment tests the effluent from each mabr was collected and mixed thoroughly then 10 ml of the effluent was used for measuring ts following standard methods 2540b baird et al 2012 the ph of the influent and the effluent was measured with a ph meter 13 620 631 accumet ab250 ph ise fisher scientific usa for the scod measurement around 5 ml of the effluent was collected in a sterile vial and filtered through a 0 2 µm pore size nylon membrane z290823 millipore sigma usa the soluble sample was then diluted 10 times for the colorimetrical cod measurement hach k 7355 chemetrics usa 2 5 detachment tests to explore the effects of predation on detachment the flow rate was increased from 1 67 re 1 to 1476 ml h re 14 for around 90 s detachment was assessed by imaging and by monitoring the change in effluent total solid ts around 35 ml of the effluent was collected 10 ml was used for ts measurement the remaining 25 ml and biofilm supporting membranes were stored at 20 c for the subsequent microbial community analysis oct images of the biofilm before and after the increased flow were used to calculate the change in biofilm area 2 6 microbial community analysis the abundance of total eukaryotes and prokaryotes in the inoculum and biofilm samples i e effluent and membranes were assessed using droplet digital polymeric chain reaction ddpcr the detached biofilm collected from the detachment test was centrifuged and dna was extracted from the pellet using a dneasy powerbiofilm kit qiagen valencia ca usa following the manufacturer s protocol the quantity and quality of the extracted dna were checked with a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific for quantifying eukaryotes protozoa the universal primer set 1380f 1510r amaral zettler et al 2009 was used for quantifying prokaryotes bacteria the universal primer set 515f 926r walters et al 2016 was used the reaction mix included 10 µl of evagreen supermix biorad hercules ca usa 1 µl of 250 nm primer sets 7 µl of molecular grade water and 1 µl of dna sample one no template control ntc assay was included for each assay by replacing a dna sample with molecular grade water a qx200 droplet generator biorad generated droplets from a reaction mix first ddpcr was conducted with primer sets and the extracted dna from inoculum to find the concentration of primers and a temperature setting that produces the best separation between negative and positive droplets 250 nm and 55 c showed the best result for both primer sets and the condition was maintained for ddpcr with samples all the samples were optimized to be run at a dna dilution that shows the best separation between negative and positive droplets thermocycler conditions were 1 cycle of 95 c for 5minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 30 s and 55 c for 1 min and the droplets were stabilized at 4 c for 5 min and finished with 1 cycle of 90 c for 5 min the droplets were counted with an abs experiment type qx200 droplet reader biorad stachler et al 2019 this step was repeated if a sample had less than 10 000 droplets for data analysis 2 7 biofilm imaging the biofilms were imaged using oct since the silicone membrane was translucent to oct it was possible to image the biofilms non destructively without removing them from the flow cell oct profiles were taken along lines drawn on the membrane fig 2 for each flow cell 18 biofilm profiles were taken i e 9 profiles from each membrane on top and bottom fig 2 the 18 images were used to determine the average biofilm cross sectional area and voids size for comparing the biofilm before and after detachment the same spots were tracked carefully by using reference marks drawn on each flow cell 2 8 image analysis oct images were digitally processed using a matlab routine matlab r2013a the mathworks inc to determine areas and internal void fractions of the biofilm images the matlab codes were adapted from lewandowski and beyenal 2013 first background noise was removed and biofilm structure was isolated then the image was converted to gray scale thresholded by an iterative selection method lewandowski and beyenal 2013 and transformed into binary images i e black and white the binary images were then converted to a data matrix for calculating the biofilm area and void fractions the internal void fraction was calculated as the ratio of internal void pixels to the total number of pixels void and filled the total number of filled pixels was considered to be the biofilm area void pixels inside biofilm profiles were not included the conversion of pixels into microns was done using the oct scale bar the 100 µm scale bar was measured as 25 5 pixels with the matlab routine then this ratio 3 92 µm pixel was used to convert pixels into a numerical biofilm area for the detachment tests the amount of detached biomass was assessed by the relative detached area the total detached area m m 2 the initial biofilm area m m 2 100 and the relative detached ts ts removed mg the initial biofilm area m m 2 2 9 rheometry analysis the biofilm storage modulus g and loss modulus g for the base and suppressed conditions were determined by shear rheometry hr 2 discovery hybrid rheometer ta instruments new castle delaware usa the following approach was adapted from towler et al 2003 and moresi et al 2004 an 8 mm diameter stainless steel plate with parallel geometry was used the membrane was cut from the reactor using a scalpel and transferred immediately to the rheometer before measurement the gap between upper and lower plates of the rheometer were zeroed using a clean blank membrane sample attached membrane was then placed on the lower plate for testing a drop of pbs buffer was added on the sample to prevent dehydration dynamic strain sweep tests were conducted with a frequency of 1 hz a temperature of 25 c and a strain range of 0 01 100 the gap between two plates during the tests was set as the average biofilm thickness which was determined by oct the storage and loss moduli were measured as a function of shear strain for each measurement g and g were obtained by averaging the values within the linear viscoelastic region rheometry tests were conducted in four different locations on the same biofilm sample the average and standard deviation values of the four replicates were reported 3 results 3 1 operation of flow cells after inoculation the flow cells were run continuously to steady state steady state was assumed to have been reached when the effluent soluble cod scod and biofilm thicknesses became stable for the base condition which was subject to predation it took around 20 days to reach steady state the detachment tests were carried out around two weeks later day 35 the steady state average effluent scod for the three replicate flow cells was 26 0 6 mg l fig 3 a the average biofilm thickness was 200 µm for the suppressed condition steady state conditions were reached at around 30 days and the detachment tests were conducted around two weeks later day 45 the average effluent scod was 985 25 mg l fig 3b and the average biofilm thickness was 500 µm the significantly higher scod was due to the 500 mg l of cycloheximide in the medium which has a theoretical cod of 1025 mg l non biodegradable cod for the delayed condition steady state with cycloheximide was reached at around 46 days with 1050 53 mg l effluent scod fig 3c at day 51 the influent medium was replaced with a new one without cycloheximide scod was not measured during the seven day inoculation period day 51 58 another steady state without cycloheximide was reached at around 78 days with 43 15 mg l effluent scod fig 3c the average biofilm thickness was 350 µm the detachment tests were carried out at around 90 days 3 2 effect of predation on void formation oct analysis was used to determine the effect of predation on void formation a significant difference was observed between the base and suppressed conditions fig 4 the average void ratio was 50 16 for the base 6 7 for the suppressed and 12 5 for the delayed condition the difference between the base and suppressed conditions was statistically significant t test p 0 05 suggesting that predation results in a higher internal void ratio 3 3 effects of predation on detachment detachment tests were conducted by significantly increasing the flow to each flow cell for 90 s typical oct images before and after the increased flow are shown in fig 5 the degree of detachment based on oct analysis and effluent ts for each condition is shown in fig 6 based on oct the detachment ratios were 44 24 for the base condition 7 9 for the suppressed condition and 15 9 for the delayed condition the ts results were consistent with the oct analyses the base condition showed a ts concentration of 4110 763 mgts mm 2 while the suppressed had 309 26 mgts mm 2 and the delayed had 688 181 mgts mm 2 the ts values measured before the detachment test were non detectable 3 4 relative abundance of eukaryotes the relative abundance of eukaryotes i e amount of eukaryotes relative to eukaryotes plus prokaryotes was assessed by ddpcr the percentage of eukaryotes was 13 6 in the inoculum 7 2 0 8 for the base condition 2 4 2 5 for the suppressed condition and 10 6 9 6 for the delayed condition fig 7 the addition of cycloheximide reduced the abundance of eukaryotes but did not eliminate them completely 3 5 effect of predation on biofilm mechanical properties as mentioned above the average thickness i e the thickness of biofilms plus internal voids for the base condition was around 200 µm while it was around 500 µm for the suppressed condition these thicknesses were used to set the disk heights for the rheometry tests results of the rheometry tests are shown in fig 8 the storage modulus representing the biofilm elastic behavior was 1780 1180 pa for the base condition and 9800 4290 pa for the suppressed condition similarly the loss modulus representing the biofilm viscous behavior was 1580 729 pa for the base condition and 363 189 pa for the suppressed condition 4 discussion 4 1 flow cell operation high levels of cod removal were obtained in all tested conditions a convenient way to compare removals is via the removal flux where overall removals for the flow cell are normalized to the membrane surface area fluxes are affected by the influent loading type of substrate air supply pressure and membrane material among others for the base condition the removal flux was 72 gcod m 2 d 1 with a steady state effluent cod concentration of 26 mg l the effluent concentration was similar to the low cod condition from aybar et al 2019 which was 38 mg l cod however the removal flux for aybar et al was lower around 6 gcod m 2 d 1 this may be because aybar et al operated their reactors in completely mixed fashion while in this research the reactors were plug flow cycloheximide is commonly used to suppress protozoa as it interferes with trna molecules on the mrna ribosomal complex of eukaryotic organisms derlon et al 2012 kota et al 1999 while it is not known to inhibit to bacteria it could have some effect on bacterial growth rates bartling et al 2009 however given the similarity in fluxes and biofilm thickness in the base and suppressed conditions i e without and with cycloheximide cycloheximide is unlikely to have had an appreciable effect on growth rates cycloheximide is not known to be readily biodegradable and therefore should not have been significantly transformed in the flow cells thiele bruhn 2003 thus the change in scod between the flow cell influent and effluent can be attributed to the oxidation of acetate scod not oxidation of cycloheximide scod 4 2 effect of predation on void formation counter diffusional mabr biofilms have uniquely stratified environments with specific ph nutrients and electron donor and acceptor profiles nerenberg 2016 the aerobic zone is typically located near the membrane which is where the substrate and nutrient concentrations are lowest low bulk liquid cod concentrations lead to substrate limiting conditions near the membrane biofilm interface resulting in low bacterial growth rates once the biofilm has reached a certain thickness this zone however is more favorable for protozoan growth as it has high oxygen concentrations the combination of low bacterial growth rates and high predation rates can explain the large voids fig 5 a in our study the internal voids were mainly produced near the membrane and the void ratio was 50 16 fig 4a with an effluent cod concentration of 26 0 6 mg l this is similar to the results reported by aybar et al 2019 who found void ratios of 45 4 5 4 for an effluent cod concentration of 38 mg l cod at higher bulk cod concentrations they observed fewer voids this coincided with greater penetration of scod providing higher bacterial growth rates at the base of the biofilm aybar et al 2019 biofilms are believed to be more resistant to predation than planktonic growth darby et al 2002 depas et al 2014 hosseinidoust et al 2013 jurgens and gude 1994 matz and kjelleberg 2005 matz et al 2005 perez et al 2016 not only do predation rates decrease with larger aggregate sizes chrzanowski and simek 1990 epstein and shiaris 1992 gonzalez et al 1990 matz and kjelleberg 2005 but quorum sensing in biofilms can lead to the production of predator inhibiting toxins matz et al 2004 weitere et al 2005 despite these added protections biofilms are still susceptible to predation mabr biofilms may be more susceptible to predation than conventional biofilms first substrate can be limiting in the deep aerobic region this results in lower bacterial growth rates where predation rates are likely to be highest furthermore research has shown that protozoa increase predation rates when nutrients are limiting nygaard and tobiesen 1993 under substrate limiting conditions as in the base of the mabr biofilms bacteria may enter stationary phase lazazzera 2000 where production of potentially protective toxins or virulent chemicals is reduced merrell et al 2003 nakamura et al 2006 nicholson et al 2009 lastly bacteria can change from biofilm to planktonic growth depending on the environmental conditions in order to disperse to new more favorable environments petrova and sauer 2016 sauer et al 2002 stoodley et al 2002 substrate and nutrient limiting conditions at the biofilm base could stimulates planktonic growth within voids enhancing predation 4 3 abundance of protozoa the suppressed condition had a lower relative abundance of protozoa than the base condition as expected but not zero this suggests that either cycloheximide did not fully inhibit protozoa or that some protozoa remained from the initial inoculation interestingly the relative abundance of protozoa was higher for the delayed condition than for the base condition this may be due to the re inoculation with protozoa after growing the biofilm with cycloheximide despite the higher abundance of protozoa the void ratio and relative detachment were much lower than the base condition and only slightly higher than the suppressed condition this could be explained if predation mainly was at the biofilm surface as discussed further below aybar et al 2019 hypothesized that voids in mabr biofilms were initiated by amoeba which prey on the biofilm interior then expanded by grazing protozoa such as flagellates and ciliates which colonized the voids if protozoa were not present from the beginning of biofilm formation they would face impediments for colonization one impediment is the low dissolved o2 in the bulk environment when present from the initial stages of biofilm formation the protozoa can access the aerobic zone adjacent to the membrane when the predators are introduced after the biofilm is established they are exposed to an anaerobic bulk while many protozoa can persist at low oxygen concentrations their growth rates are much lower fenchel 2014 another impediment is that when added to an established biofilm the biofilm itself presents a physical barrier to penetration this could prevent or delay amoeba reaching the aerobic zone a third impediment is relevant to grazing protozoa like flagellates and ciliates aybar et al 2019 found these growing inside the voids at the base of the biofilm but it is not clear how they reached there it is possible that at the early stages of biofilm formation they were attracted to the aerobic zone and became embedded in the biofilm then they could occupy the voids once formed by amoeba another possibility is that they accessed the voids by grazing on the outer biofilm before it became too thick once the biofilm is established it is probably more difficult for grazers to access interior voids 4 4 detachment and mechanical properties our results showed that biofilms in the suppressed condition were less susceptible to detachment than in the base or delayed conditions fig 6 this can be linked to the void ratios and relative abundance of protozoa the resistance to detachment forces can be related to the mechanical properties then comparison of viscoelastic properties between base and suppressed conditions could explain the different response to the detachment force biofilms are viscoelastic materials showing both viscous and elastic characteristics viscoelastic properties of biofilms can influence the removal of biofilms from attached surfaces peterson et al 2015 the viscous and elastic properties allow biofilms to absorb the energy of external forces providing resistance to detachment flemming 2011 gresham 2008 russell and johnson 2012 in our studies biofilms with predation base condition showed lower viscoelastic parameters than without predation suppressed condition fig 8 internal voids could cause this decrease there was a positive correlation between the internal void abundance and detachment figs 4 and 6 note that our studies were carried out at relatively low fluid shear stresses higher shear stresses typically lead to denser biofilms which may behave differently with respect to predation 4 5 mechanical properties the biofilms had a higher g representing the elastic component than g representing the viscous component g 1780 1180 pa g 363 189 pa for the base condition and g 9800 4290 pa g 1580 729 pa for the suppressed condition the ratio of g over g for the suppressed condition was higher than it with base condition indicating a more elastic dominant character both g and g were larger in the suppressed condition than the base condition indicating the voids played had an important impact on biofilm mechanical strength the weaker strength with predation was confirmed by the detachment tests figs 4 and 6 when the internal voids dominated fig 4 the biofilm had a smaller g and g and a larger detachment ratio fig 6 a large variability of biofilm mechanical properties has been reported for different types of biofilms bol et al 2013 with a range of several orders of magnitude the large differences of mechanical properties relate to multiple factors such as biological constituents growth conditions kreth et al 2004 support materials bayoudh et al 2005 and hydrodynamic conditions stoodley et al 1998 table 2 lists different g and g of various biofilms from previous studies note the previous research was for co diffusional biofilms when comparing the base and suppressed conditions to other studies the void formation made significant changes in the mechanical properties table 2 in particular the storage modulus for the base condition was lower than for the other condition biofilms while in the suppressed condition was higher 5 conclusions the main findings of this research are large voids form in cod limited mabr biofilms due to predation predation weaken biofilms the weaker biofilms detach more easily predation has a smaller effect when the biofilm is grown before exposing to protozoa this research shows that predation can have important impacts on biofilm accumulation since biofilm thickness is critical to the performance of mabr biofilms further research is needed to better understand predation and void formation for example this research was carried out for heterotrophic biofilms future research should address whether similar effects are observed for nitrifying biofilms these have slower growth rates which may make them more susceptible to predation but also form denser biofilms which may provide protection also the smaller effect of predation on mature biofilms may help devise control strategies if protozoa can be avoided during biofilm growth or selectively killed after biofilm formation it may provide long lasting protection of the biofilm interior declaration of competing interest the authors

mabr is an emerging wastewater treatment technology that greatly improves o2 transfer efficiency ote reducing energy requirements in the mabr o2 is supplied through a gas transferring membrane directly to a biofilm growing on the membrane surface when operated with closed end membranes the ote can be as high as 100 ahmad et al 2004 martin and nerenberg 2012 pankhania et al 1994 perez calleja et al 2017 semmens 2005 mabr biofilms are counter diffusional i e o2 is transferred from the base of the biofilm while the electron donor is supplied from bulk liquid this gives mabr biofilms distinct behavior compared to conventional co diffusional biofilms nerenberg 2016 for example thin mabr biofilms can have low contaminant removal fluxes due to biomass limitation similar to conventional co diffusional biofilms but excessively thick mabr biofilms can also have low removal fluxes since substrates diffuse from opposite sides of the biofilm essila et al 2000 martin and nerenberg 2012 as a result biofilm accumulation plays a particularly important role in mabrs biofilm accumulation depends on bacterial growth decay detachment and predation rittmann and mccarty 2012 parry 2004 detachment can be erosive when small amounts of outer biofilm are removed or via sloughing when a significant depth of biofilm is lost at one time stewart 1993 predation can have an important impact on biofilm accumulation aybar et al 2019 derlon et al 2012 huws et al 2005 parry 2004 since most protozoa are aerobic or grow faster under aerobic conditions fenchel 2014 the rate of predation can vary with depth within biofilms in conventional biofilms grazing rates are usually highest at the biofilm exterior where the dissolved oxygen concentrations are high however in mabr biofilms the outer portions are typically anoxic anaerobic and the base is aerobic in past studies researchers found that predation occurred primarily at the aerobic base of the biofilm resulting in a near continuous void layer aybar et al 2019 these voids formed only when the electron donor did not fully penetrate the biofilm when the donor fully penetrated the biofilm the microbial growth rate appeared to exceed the predation rate preventing void formation although detachment was not studied by aybar et al 2019 a void layer deep in the biofilm would seem likely to weaken the biofilm and potentially promote sloughing this is consistent with an observations in a past mabr pilot study semmens 2005 in this research we explored the effects of predation on the mechanical strength and detachment in heterotrophic mabr biofilms we hypothesized that predation would lead to increased biofilm sloughing rheometry was used to assess biofilm mechanical strength a separate reactor was used for these tests detachment tests were used to explore the effect of predation on detachment a flow cell operated with cycloheximide as a protozoan inhibitor derlon et al 2012 was used as a control to better understand the mechanisms of biofilm colonization by protozoa we explored the effect of initially suppressing protozoa but then re inoculating the mature biofilm with protozoa 2 materials and methods we studied predation and detachment for an experimental reactor and two controls 1 the base condition included protozoa from the beginning of the experiment 2 the suppressed condition was a control with predation suppressed by cycloheximide and 3 the delayed condition was a control where predation was suppressed with cycloheximide during the initial stages of biofilm formation but then re inoculated and continued without cycloheximide each condition was run in triplicate two types of experiments were carried out 1 detachment tests where biofilms were exposed to increase shear flow these tests were used to explore the effect of predation on detachment and 2 mechanical property tests where viscoelastic parameters were measured with rheometer these tests explored the effects of predation on the biofilm mechanical properties 2 1 experimental setup and operating conditions detachment tests were run for the base suppressed and delayed conditions each condition was run in triplicate mechanical property tests were only run for the base and suppressed conditions one reactor was run for each condition but multiple mechanical assays were carried on each after the biofilms grew to steady state the biofilm mechanical properties were assessed the proportion of eukaryotes to eukaryotes plus prokaryotes was measured and the detachment when exposed to increased flow rates was performed a summary of the tests and parameters measured is provided in table 1 flow cells for detachment tests flow cells were constructed from plexiglas blocks by creating three transversal slots in each block each slot was 8 mm depth 25 mm long and 3 mm wide providing a working volume of 0 531 ml the top and bottom of each slot was covered with a flat sheet silicone membrane 200 µm thick sspm823005 12 interstate specialty prod inc ma us creating the flow cells air diffused passively through the silicone membranes from atmosphere to the biofilm growing on the interior of the membrane surface the influent was pumped through holes drilled into each end of the flow cells see fig 1 below and fig s1 in the supplementary information for a schematic and image of flow cells flow cells for mechanical property tests for the mechanical property tests special mabr flow cells were built the plexiglas blocks and silicone membranes were the same as described above but a large

solution in the mixing chamber the acetate solution for the control included 300 mg l as cod and 500 mg l of cycloheximide as a eukaryotic inhibitor 2 3 flow cell inoculation and growth activated sludge from a local wastewater treatment plant mishawaka in u s was used as the inoculum activated sludge was vigorously mixed and settled 1 ml of supernatant was injected to the medium filled reactors as an inoculum after inoculation the reactors both detachment reactor and mechanical property reactor were recirculated at 16 7 ml h with a multichannel peristaltic pump dynamax rp 1 rainin woburn ma usa for approximately 24 h for the initial attachment of microorganisms to the membrane then the reactors were run with continuous feed the initial attachment was confirmed through optical coherence tomography oct ganymede ii spectral domain oct system thorlabs inc small biofilm clusters of around 10 µm could be seen initially the delayed condition reactors were supplied with cycloheximide during the initial biofilm development and then protozoa were added by re inoculating with activated sludge table 1 in this case 1 ml of inoculum was injected into the reactor daily from day 51 to day 58 tests were carried out two weeks after the flow cells reached steady state the steady state was assessed based on the steady effluent soluble cod scod concentrations and biofilm thicknesses the biofilm thickness was measured by oct as described below 2 4 analytical methods for total solids ts measurement from the detachment tests the effluent from each mabr was collected and mixed thoroughly then 10 ml of the effluent was used for measuring ts following standard methods 2540b baird et al 2012 the ph of the influent and the effluent was measured with a ph meter 13 620 631 accumet ab250 ph ise fisher scientific usa for the scod measurement around 5 ml of the effluent was collected in a sterile vial and filtered through a 0 2 µm pore size nylon membrane z290823 millipore sigma usa the soluble sample was then diluted 10 times for the colorimetrical cod measurement hach k 7355 chemetrics usa 2 5 detachment tests to explore the effects of predation on detachment the flow rate was increased from 1 67 re 1 to 1476 ml h re 14 for around 90 s detachment was assessed by imaging and by monitoring the change in effluent total solid ts around 35 ml of the effluent was collected 10 ml was used for ts measurement the remaining 25 ml and biofilm supporting membranes were stored at 20 c for the subsequent microbial community analysis oct images of the biofilm before and after the increased flow were used to calculate the change in biofilm area 2 6 microbial community analysis the abundance of total eukaryotes and prokaryotes in the inoculum and biofilm samples i e effluent and membranes were assessed using droplet digital polymeric chain reaction ddpcr the detached biofilm collected from the detachment test was centrifuged and dna was extracted from the pellet using a dneasy powerbiofilm kit qiagen valencia ca usa following the manufacturer s protocol the quantity and quality of the extracted dna were checked with a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific for quantifying eukaryotes protozoa the universal primer set 1380f 1510r amaral zettler et al 2009 was used for quantifying prokaryotes bacteria the universal primer set 515f 926r walters et al 2016 was used the reaction mix included 10 µl of evagreen supermix biorad hercules ca usa 1 µl of 250 nm primer sets 7 µl of molecular grade water and 1 µl of dna sample one no template control ntc assay was included for each assay by replacing a dna sample with molecular grade water a qx200 droplet generator biorad generated droplets from a reaction mix first ddpcr was conducted with primer sets and the extracted dna from inoculum to find the concentration of primers and a temperature setting that produces the best separation between negative and positive droplets 250 nm and 55 c showed the best result for both primer sets and the condition was maintained for ddpcr with samples all the samples were optimized to be run at a dna dilution that shows the best separation between negative and positive droplets thermocycler conditions were 1 cycle of 95 c for 5minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 30 s and 55 c for 1 min and the droplets were stabilized at 4 c for 5 min and finished with 1 cycle of 90 c for 5 min the droplets were counted with an abs experiment type qx200 droplet reader biorad stachler et al 2019 this step was repeated if a sample had less than 10 000 droplets for data analysis 2 7 biofilm imaging the biofilms were imaged using oct since the silicone membrane was translucent to oct it was possible to image the biofilms non destructively without removing them from the flow cell oct profiles were taken along lines drawn on the membrane fig 2 for each flow cell 18 biofilm profiles were taken i e 9 profiles from each membrane on top and bottom fig 2 the 18 images were used to determine the average biofilm cross sectional area and voids size for comparing the biofilm before and after detachment the same spots were tracked carefully by using reference marks drawn on each flow cell 2 8 image analysis oct images were digitally processed using a matlab routine matlab r2013a the mathworks inc to determine areas and internal void fractions of the biofilm images the matlab codes were adapted from lewandowski and beyenal 2013 first background noise was removed and biofilm structure was isolated then the image was converted to gray scale thresholded by an iterative selection method lewandowski and beyenal 2013 and transformed into binary images i e black and white the binary images were then converted to a data matrix for calculating the biofilm area and void fractions the internal void fraction was calculated as the ratio of internal void pixels to the total number of pixels void and filled the total number of filled pixels was considered to be the biofilm area void pixels inside biofilm profiles were not included the conversion of pixels into microns was done using the oct scale bar the 100 µm scale bar was measured as 25 5 pixels with the matlab routine then this ratio 3 92 µm pixel was used to convert pixels into a numerical biofilm area for the detachment tests the amount of detached biomass was assessed by the relative detached area the total detached area m m 2 the initial biofilm area m m 2 100 and the relative detached ts ts removed mg the initial biofilm area m m 2 2 9 rheometry analysis the biofilm storage modulus g and loss modulus g for the base and suppressed conditions were determined by shear rheometry hr 2 discovery hybrid rheometer ta instruments new castle delaware usa the following approach was adapted from towler et al 2003 and moresi et al 2004 an 8 mm diameter stainless steel plate with parallel geometry was used the membrane was cut from the reactor using a scalpel and transferred immediately to the rheometer before measurement the gap between upper and lower plates of the rheometer were zeroed using a clean blank membrane sample attached membrane was then placed on the lower plate for testing a drop of pbs buffer was added on the sample to prevent dehydration dynamic strain sweep tests were conducted with a frequency of 1 hz a temperature of 25 c and a strain range of 0 01 100 the gap between two plates during the tests was set as the average biofilm thickness which was determined by oct the storage and loss moduli were measured as a function of shear strain for each measurement g and g were obtained by averaging the values within the linear viscoelastic region rheometry tests were conducted in four different locations on the same biofilm sample the average and standard deviation values of the four replicates were reported 3 results 3 1 operation of flow cells after inoculation the flow cells were run continuously to steady state steady state was assumed to have been reached when the effluent soluble cod scod and biofilm thicknesses became stable for the base condition which was subject to predation it took around 20 days to reach steady state the detachment tests were carried out around two weeks later day 35 the steady state average effluent scod for the three replicate flow cells was 26 0 6 mg l fig 3 a the average biofilm thickness was 200 µm for the suppressed condition steady state conditions were reached at around 30 days and the detachment tests were conducted around two weeks later day 45 the average effluent scod was 985 25 mg l fig 3b and the average biofilm thickness was 500 µm the significantly higher scod was due to the 500 mg l of cycloheximide in the medium which has a theoretical cod of 1025 mg l non biodegradable cod for the delayed condition steady state with cycloheximide was reached at around 46 days with 1050 53 mg l effluent scod fig 3c at day 51 the influent medium was replaced with a new one without cycloheximide scod was not measured during the seven day inoculation period day 51 58 another steady state without cycloheximide was reached at around 78 days with 43 15 mg l effluent scod fig 3c the average biofilm thickness was 350 µm the detachment tests were carried out at around 90 days 3 2 effect of predation on void formation oct analysis was used to determine the effect of predation on void formation a significant difference was observed between the base and suppressed conditions fig 4 the average void ratio was 50 16 for the base 6 7 for the suppressed and 12 5 for the delayed condition the difference between the base and suppressed conditions was statistically significant t test p 0 05 suggesting that predation results in a higher internal void ratio 3 3 effects of predation on detachment detachment tests were conducted by significantly increasing the flow to each flow cell for 90 s typical oct images before and after the increased flow are shown in fig 5 the degree of detachment based on oct analysis and effluent ts for each condition is shown in fig 6 based on oct the detachment ratios were 44 24 for the base condition 7 9 for the suppressed condition and 15 9 for the delayed condition the ts results were consistent with the oct analyses the base condition showed a ts concentration of 4110 763 mgts mm 2 while the suppressed had 309 26 mgts mm 2 and the delayed had 688 181 mgts mm 2 the ts values measured before the detachment test were non detectable 3 4 relative abundance of eukaryotes the relative abundance of eukaryotes i e amount of eukaryotes relative to eukaryotes plus prokaryotes was assessed by ddpcr the percentage of eukaryotes was 13 6 in the inoculum 7 2 0 8 for the base condition 2 4 2 5 for the suppressed condition and 10 6 9 6 for the delayed condition fig 7 the addition of cycloheximide reduced the abundance of eukaryotes but did not eliminate them completely 3 5 effect of predation on biofilm mechanical properties as mentioned above the average thickness i e the thickness of biofilms plus internal voids for the base condition was around 200 µm while it was around 500 µm for the suppressed condition these thicknesses were used to set the disk heights for the rheometry tests results of the rheometry tests are shown in fig 8 the storage modulus representing the biofilm elastic behavior was 1780 1180 pa for the base condition and 9800 4290 pa for the suppressed condition similarly the loss modulus representing the biofilm viscous behavior was 1580 729 pa for the base condition and 363 189 pa for the suppressed condition 4 discussion 4 1 flow cell operation high levels of cod removal were obtained in all tested conditions a convenient way to compare removals is via the removal flux where overall removals for the flow cell are normalized to the membrane surface area fluxes are affected by the influent loading type of substrate air supply pressure and membrane material among others for the base condition the removal flux was 72 gcod m 2 d 1 with a steady state effluent cod concentration of 26 mg l the effluent concentration was similar to the low cod condition from aybar et al 2019 which was 38 mg l cod however the removal flux for aybar et al was lower around 6 gcod m 2 d 1 this may be because aybar et al operated their reactors in completely mixed fashion while in this research the reactors were plug flow cycloheximide is commonly used to suppress protozoa as it interferes with trna molecules on the mrna ribosomal complex of eukaryotic organisms derlon et al 2012 kota et al 1999 while it is not known to inhibit to bacteria it could have some effect on bacterial growth rates bartling et al 2009 however given the similarity in fluxes and biofilm thickness in the base and suppressed conditions i e without and with cycloheximide cycloheximide is unlikely to have had an appreciable effect on growth rates cycloheximide is not known to be readily biodegradable and therefore should not have been significantly transformed in the flow cells thiele bruhn 2003 thus the change in scod between the flow cell influent and effluent can be attributed to the oxidation of acetate scod not oxidation of cycloheximide scod 4 2 effect of predation on void formation counter diffusional mabr biofilms have uniquely stratified environments with specific ph nutrients and electron donor and acceptor profiles nerenberg 2016 the aerobic zone is typically located near the membrane which is where the substrate and nutrient concentrations are lowest low bulk liquid cod concentrations lead to substrate limiting conditions near the membrane biofilm interface resulting in low bacterial growth rates once the biofilm has reached a certain thickness this zone however is more favorable for protozoan growth as it has high oxygen concentrations the combination of low bacterial growth rates and high predation rates can explain the large voids fig 5 a in our study the internal voids were mainly produced near the membrane and the void ratio was 50 16 fig 4a with an effluent cod concentration of 26 0 6 mg l this is similar to the results reported by aybar et al 2019 who found void ratios of 45 4 5 4 for an effluent cod concentration of 38 mg l cod at higher bulk cod concentrations they observed fewer voids this coincided with greater penetration of scod providing higher bacterial growth rates at the base of the biofilm aybar et al 2019 biofilms are believed to be more resistant to predation than planktonic growth darby et al 2002 depas et al 2014 hosseinidoust et al 2013 jurgens and gude 1994 matz and kjelleberg 2005 matz et al 2005 perez et al 2016 not only do predation rates decrease with larger aggregate sizes chrzanowski and simek 1990 epstein and shiaris 1992 gonzalez et al 1990 matz and kjelleberg 2005 but quorum sensing in biofilms can lead to the production of predator inhibiting toxins matz et al 2004 weitere et al 2005 despite these added protections biofilms are still susceptible to predation mabr biofilms may be more susceptible to predation than conventional biofilms first substrate can be limiting in the deep aerobic region this results in lower bacterial growth rates where predation rates are likely to be highest furthermore research has shown that protozoa increase predation rates when nutrients are limiting nygaard and tobiesen 1993 under substrate limiting conditions as in the base of the mabr biofilms bacteria may enter stationary phase lazazzera 2000 where production of potentially protective toxins or virulent chemicals is reduced merrell et al 2003 nakamura et al 2006 nicholson et al 2009 lastly bacteria can change from biofilm to planktonic growth depending on the environmental conditions in order to disperse to new more favorable environments petrova and sauer 2016 sauer et al 2002 stoodley et al 2002 substrate and nutrient limiting conditions at the biofilm base could stimulates planktonic growth within voids enhancing predation 4 3 abundance of protozoa the suppressed condition had a lower relative abundance of protozoa than the base condition as expected but not zero this suggests that either cycloheximide did not fully inhibit protozoa or that some protozoa remained from the initial inoculation interestingly the relative abundance of protozoa was higher for the delayed condition than for the base condition this may be due to the re inoculation with protozoa after growing the biofilm with cycloheximide despite the higher abundance of protozoa the void ratio and relative detachment were much lower than the base condition and only slightly higher than the suppressed condition this could be explained if predation mainly was at the biofilm surface as discussed further below aybar et al 2019 hypothesized that voids in mabr biofilms were initiated by amoeba which prey on the biofilm interior then expanded by grazing protozoa such as flagellates and ciliates which colonized the voids if protozoa were not present from the beginning of biofilm formation they would face impediments for colonization one impediment is the low dissolved o2 in the bulk environment when present from the initial stages of biofilm formation the protozoa can access the aerobic zone adjacent to the membrane when the predators are introduced after the biofilm is established they are exposed to an anaerobic bulk while many protozoa can persist at low oxygen concentrations their growth rates are much lower fenchel 2014 another impediment is that when added to an established biofilm the biofilm itself presents a physical barrier to penetration this could prevent or delay amoeba reaching the aerobic zone a third impediment is relevant to grazing protozoa like flagellates and ciliates aybar et al 2019 found these growing inside the voids at the base of the biofilm but it is not clear how they reached there it is possible that at the early stages of biofilm formation they were attracted to the aerobic zone and became embedded in the biofilm then they could occupy the voids once formed by amoeba another possibility is that they accessed the voids by grazing on the outer biofilm before it became too thick once the biofilm is established it is probably more difficult for grazers to access interior voids 4 4 detachment and mechanical properties our results showed that biofilms in the suppressed condition were less susceptible to detachment than in the base or delayed conditions fig 6 this can be linked to the void ratios and relative abundance of protozoa the resistance to detachment forces can be related to the mechanical properties then comparison of viscoelastic properties between base and suppressed conditions could explain the different response to the detachment force biofilms are viscoelastic materials showing both viscous and elastic characteristics viscoelastic properties of biofilms can influence the removal of biofilms from attached surfaces peterson et al 2015 the viscous and elastic properties allow biofilms to absorb the energy of external forces providing resistance to detachment flemming 2011 gresham 2008 russell and johnson 2012 in our studies biofilms with predation base condition showed lower viscoelastic parameters than without predation suppressed condition fig 8 internal voids could cause this decrease there was a positive correlation between the internal void abundance and detachment figs 4 and 6 note that our studies were carried out at relatively low fluid shear stresses higher shear stresses typically lead to denser biofilms which may behave differently with respect to predation 4 5 mechanical properties the biofilms had a higher g representing the elastic component than g representing the viscous component g 1780 1180 pa g 363 189 pa for the base condition and g 9800 4290 pa g 1580 729 pa for the suppressed condition the ratio of g over g for the suppressed condition was higher than it with base condition indicating a more elastic dominant character both g and g were larger in the suppressed condition than the base condition indicating the voids played had an important impact on biofilm mechanical strength the weaker strength with predation was confirmed by the detachment tests figs 4 and 6 when the internal voids dominated fig 4 the biofilm had a smaller g and g and a larger detachment ratio fig 6 a large variability of biofilm mechanical properties has been reported for different types of biofilms bol et al 2013 with a range of several orders of magnitude the large differences of mechanical properties relate to multiple factors such as biological constituents growth conditions kreth et al 2004 support materials bayoudh et al 2005 and hydrodynamic conditions stoodley et al 1998 table 2 lists different g and g of various biofilms from previous studies note the previous research was for co diffusional biofilms when comparing the base and suppressed conditions to other studies the void formation made significant changes in the mechanical properties table 2 in particular the storage modulus for the base condition was lower than for the other condition biofilms while in the suppressed condition was higher 5 conclusions the main findings of this research are large voids form in cod limited mabr biofilms due to predation predation weaken biofilms the weaker biofilms detach more easily predation has a smaller effect when the biofilm is grown before exposing to protozoa this research shows that predation can have important impacts on biofilm accumulation since biofilm thickness is critical to the performance of mabr biofilms further research is needed to better understand predation and void formation for example this research was carried out for heterotrophic biofilms future research should address whether similar effects are observed for nitrifying biofilms these have slower growth rates which may make them more susceptible to predation but also form denser biofilms which may provide protection also the smaller effect of predation on mature biofilms may help devise control strategies if protozoa can be avoided during biofilm growth or selectively killed after biofilm formation it may provide long lasting protection of the biofilm interior declaration of competing interest the authors

17511,ozone has a strong oxidation power that allows effective inactivation of waterborne viruses few studies have accurately measured the kinetic relationship between virus inactivation and ozone exposure because the high reactivity of ozone makes it difficult to measure them simultaneously a continuous quench flow system cqfs is a possible solution for analyzing such a fast reaction however previous studies reported that cqfs provided different results of inactivation rate constants from the batch system the objectives of this study were 1 to develop a cqfs to evaluate the kinetics of microbial inactivation accurately 2 to evaluate the inactivation rate constants of waterborne virus by ozone and 3 to compare the results with previous studies the results indicated that the simple plug flow assumption in the reaction tube of cqfs led to underestimation of the rate constants the accurate measurement of rate constants was achieved by the pseudo first order reaction model that takes the residence time distribution rtd i e the laminar flow assumption into account the results of inactivation experiments suggested that the resistance of viruses were getting higher in the following order qβ ms2 fr ga cvb5 faulkner φx 174 pv1 sabin cvb3 nancy the environmental isolates of cvb3 and cvb5 had a 2 fold higher resistance compared with their lab strains predicted ct values for 4 log inactivation ranged from 0 018 mg sec l 1 qβ to 0 31 mg sec l 1 cvb3 environmental strain the required ct values for 4 log pv1 inactivation was 0 15 mg sec l 1 which was 166 fold smaller than those reported in the united states environmental protection agency guidance manuals the overestimation in previous studies was due to the sparse assumption of rtd in the reactor consequently the required ozone ct values for virus inactivation should be reconsidered to minimize the health risks and environmental costs in water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction ozonation is one of the advanced water treatment processes and widely applied for the control of taste odor and micropollutants and for microbial disinfection von gunten 2018 viruses are major microbial contaminants that cause waterborne diseases world health organization 2011 because of the high probability of infection with a given exposure the acceptable concentration of viruses in drinking water is low e g 1 90 000 l to achieve 10 6 disability adjusted life year person world health organization 2011 this requires regulators to achieve a high rate of virus reduction through water treatment e g 12 log reduction for indirect potable reuse title 22 and 17 california code of regulations 2015 the current treatment system heavily relies on disinfection to achieve a high level of virus reduction log credit allocable to ozonation is up to 6 log olivieri et al 2016 therefore the efficacy of virus reduction by ozonation should be carefully examined the efficiency of virus inactivation is primarily governed by the exposure to the disinfectant the so called ct value which is defined as the time dependent disinfectant concentration integrated over time usepa 1999 currently such a dose response relationship is critical for estimating the efficiency of microbial inactivation in a full scale plant as well as the information on the disinfectant decay and reactor hydraulics bellamy et al 1998 manoli et al 2019 although the dose response relationship has been investigated and meta analyzed in major disinfectants free chlorine monochloramine cromeans et al 2010 rachmadi et al 2020 and ultraviolet irradiation gerba et al 2002 hijnen et al 2006 studies on ozonation are scarce the lack of ozonation studies was mainly due to the difficulty of measuring both the ct value and the rate of virus inactivation simultaneously ozone is quickly decomposed in the aqueous phase gardoni et al 2012 and consumed by organic substances contained in the virus stock solution dunkin et al 2017 furthermore measurable virus inactivation is often completed within several seconds after contact with ozone hall and sobsey 1993 shin and sobsey 2003 hence most ozonation studies miss either information on the ct value or the rate of virus inactivation finch and fairbairn 1991 hall and sobsey 1993 herbold et al 1989 shin and sobsey 2003 sigmon et al 2015 thurston enriquez et al 2005 the batch experiment is a golden standard for analyzing inactivation kinetics in disinfection studies however it is not feasible for ozonation because it is necessary to obtain samples that have reacted with a disinfectant for a few seconds as such several studies have modified the experimental setup to obtain both the ct value and the rate of virus inactivation for example early studies applied the method of continuous stirred tank reactor cstr in which the virus and ozone solution are continuously fed to the stirred tank while the solution in the tank is withdrawn at a constant flow rate roy et al 1982 a recent study developed a unique experimental batch system that enables the simultaneous determination of the ct value and virus inactivation wolf et al 2018 despite the researchers efforts to improve the experimental setup the reported inactivation rate constants were inconsistent among available studies one of the underlying causes of the inconsistency is the sparse approximations of exposure time of collected samples for example roy et al 1982 conducted virus ozonation in cstr and reported the required time for 2 log virus inactivation under a certain ozone concentration the united states environmental protection agency usepa simply multiplied the required time with the ozone concentration and reported it as required ct values for 2 log virus inactivation usepa 2010 1991 however the required time represents just an average residence time τ in cstr in other words not every virus travels the reactor for time τ theoretically the short circuiting flow which travels in the reactor for a shorter time than the mean residence time in which much greater portion of viruses remains infective affects the average virus concentration at a given time therefore the currently proposed values do not represent the actual ct value but rather the cτ value which virtually includes the effect of the heterogeneity of hydraulics another cause is the reduced mixing efficiency of the disinfectant solution with the virus solution wolf et al 2018 noted that their system might underestimate the rate constants because a large portion of inactivation had occurred before the system reached a state of complete mixing the continuous quench flow system cqfs is a bench scale experiment technique that comprises a pump small mixer and reaction tube it was developed to analyze the kinetics of fast reactions several studies have applied this system to evaluate the degradation of chemicals such as carbamazepine buffle et al 2006 and textile dyes gomes et al 2010 generally the system drives the test solution and ozone solution separately mixes them in a small reactor and facilitates the mixture to flow in the reaction tube continuously the exposure time is controlled by changing the length of the tube or flow rate this setup makes it possible to obtain the samples reacting for a few seconds therefore cqfs is a potential solution to measure both the ozone ct value and the rate of virus inactivation simultaneously in this study we introduced a cqfs in which the flow regime is laminar to evaluate the first order rate constants for the waterborne virus inactivation with ozone the challenge for cqfs used in previous studies was a tacit assumption of flow hydraulics in reaction tubes several studies assumed the flow regime in the reaction tube to be a plug flow although it was actually laminar flow buffle et al 2006 hunt and mariñas 1997 or not described czekalski et al 2016 gomes et al 2010 wolf et al 2018 moreover scattered or biphasic data were observed in a single dose response relationship determined by cqfs possibly because the flow regime was not controlled among data points hunt and mariñas 1997 wolf et al 2018 these properties required researchers to develop more solid experimental protocols specifically it is necessary to develop a pseudo first order kinetic model that takes the residence time distribution rtd function into account and to control the flow regime throughout the entire experiment the objectives of this study were 1 to develop a cqfs and pseudo first order kinetics model that considers rtd for an accurate measurement of inactivation rate constants by ozone 2 to evaluate inactivation rate constants for the waterborne virus inactivation and 3 to compare the results with previous studies and usepa guidance manual ct values 2 materials and methods 2 1 virus propagation purification and enumeration f rna coliphages ms2 fr ga qβ and somatic coliphage φx 174 were

of infective cvb3 cvb5 and pv1 was enumerated by most probable number mpn assay using bgm cells on 96 well plates with five replicates and four dilutions per sample meister et al 2018 the samples to be quantified were serially diluted 10 fold by maintenance medium supplemented with 1 fetal bovine serum each well was inoculated with 150 μl of diluted samples after the incubation at 37 c with 5 co2 for 5 to 6 days the presence of cytopathic effects was monitored by microscope the number of positive wells of each dilution was counted and analyzed by an r package ferguson and ihrie 2019 the concentrations of cvb3 cvb5 and pv1 were reported as mpn ml 2 2 setup of continuous quench flow system cqfs the cqfs was set up as shown in fig 1 the reactor comprised two peristaltic pumps perista pump ac 2110ii atto co ltd japan to drive two solutions virus solution and disinfectant solution a t connector mixer vrft6 isis co ltd japan in which the magnetic ball was stirred and a silicone tube outer diameter 4 mm inner diameter 2 mm to facilitate the reaction with disinfectant the virus solution was driven at 0 31 ml s and mixed at a 1 1 ratio with a disinfectant solution resulting in the mixed solution flowing at 0 62 ml s in the silicone tube the velocity of the mixed solution was 20 cm s the flow rate was not changed for any of cqfs experiments to maintain the flow regime at a reynolds number re of 395 in the silicone tube the reaction time can be controlled by selecting different tube lengths l 20τ s where l cm represents the length of the silicone tube and τ s represents the desired retention time a preliminary experiment showed that virus loss by the attachment to the reaction tube was negligible even when using the tube length of 180 cm at the outlet of the reaction tube an exceeded amount of sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 was prepared in a petri dish to stop the reaction immediately in this study the disinfected sample at the outlet of the mixer was regarded as the 0 s sample this was because this cqfs has a dead volume from mixing point to the point at which the first data point was collectable the average dead time i e residence time of the mixer was estimated to be 0 24 seconds all of the experiments were conducted at 22 1 c the mixer and each reaction tube were rinsed thoroughly with milliq before and after the cqfs operation 2 3 ozone production and measurement an ozone generator ebara ozsd 3000a japan was used to produce ozone gas from oxygen the obtained gas was bubbled through chilled milliq pre acidified by phosphoric acid ph 3 5 to prepare the ozone stock solution at a final concentration of 5 mg l 1 the concentration of the stock solution was determined by direct spectrophotometry with an absorption coefficient of ozone ε260 3 200 m 1 cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in ozonation experiments the concentration was determined by the decolorization of indigo trisulfonate with an adsorption coefficient ε600 20 000 m 1 cm 1 as described elsewhere bader and hoigné 1981 2 4 validation of cqfs 2 4 1 chlorination of ms2 in the batch system batch chlorination of ms2 was conducted in a 50 ml glass beaker a free chlorine working solution was prepared by diluting sodium hypochlorite with 10 mm pb at ph 7 0 to obtain a final concentration of 7 8 to 7 9 mg l 1 as cl2 free chlorine was measured by the spectrophotometric method using n n diethyl p phenylene diamine dpd with a dr890 colorimeter hach company loveland co before each experiment the glass beaker was washed with milliq and the working solution then 20 μl of purified ms2 stocks were spiked into 20 ml of stirred working solution one milliliter of aliquot was harvested and directly mixed with 50 μl of na2s2o3 at a concentration of 5 000 mg l at 6 s and 12 s the initial virus concentration was sampled from 20 ml of pb spiked with 20 μl virus stock the initial virus concentration was 106 7 pfu ml note that the concentration of free chlorine was not decayed at 30 s for the whole experiment data not shown this batch experiment was conducted four times 2 4 2 chlorination of ms2 in the cqfs ms2 chlorination was conducted by the developed cqfs ms2 was suspended in 10 mm pb at ph 7 0 as the virus solution and free chlorine at a concentration of 15 to 16 mg l 1 as cl2 in 10 mm pb was prepared as the disinfectant solution then different lengths of reaction tubes 60 120 180 cm were installed on the outlet of the mixer depending on the desired retention time 3 6 9 s of the samples the sample at 0 s was taken at the outlet of the mixer for a single experiment 6 2 ml of samples at 0 s 3 s 6 s and 9 s were taken in petri dishes with na2s2o3 for enumeration of ms2 additional samples 3 1 ml were taken in petri dishes without na2s2o3 in the collection of 0 s and 9 s samples a 1 ml of the sample on the petri dish was taken immediately mixed with 9 ml of dpd solution and examined for free chlorine the free chlorine concentration of the mixed solution at time 0 s ranged from 7 6 to 8 1 mg l 1 as cl2 the ms2 concentration at time 0s ranged from 3 0 105 to 5 0 105 pfu ml the decay in free chlorine was 0 1 mg l as cl2 data not shown the experiment was run four times 2 4 3 ozonation of phenol in the batch system an ozone solution was prepared at a final concentration of 2 9 mg l 1 before each experiment the glass beaker was washed with milliq and the ozone solution the ozone solution was acidified to ph 3 0 by phosphoric acid and spiked with tert butanol at a final concentration of 10 mm as a radical scavenger then 150 μl of phenol stocks 25 mg l 1 were spiked into 15 ml of the stirred ozone solution the reaction was stopped at 10 s by adding the excess amount of na2s2o3 at the final concentration of 100 mg l 1 the initial phenol concentration was determined by sampling from 15 ml of milliq spiked with 150 μl phenol stock the concentration of phenol was determined by the spectrophotometric method using 4 aminoantipyrine described in usepa method 420 1 this batch experiment was conducted at 22 1 c in triplicate in the batch system we could not measure the phenol and ozone concentration simultaneously thus we measured the ozone decay during the reaction above separately the ozone concentration was maintained at 59 7 during the reaction of phenol and ozone n 2 data not shown the ct value was calculated by multiplying the time dependent concentration integrated over time see fig s1 2 4 4 ozonation of phenol in the cqfs phenol was suspended at the final concentration of 500 μg l in pre acidified milliq at ph 3 0 with tert butanol at a final concentration of 10 mm the ozone solution was prepared at the concentration of at ph 3 0 then reaction tubes were prepared to achieve the retention time of 0 2 4 6 s the sample at 0 s was taken at the outlet of the mixer for a single experiment approximately 12 ml of samples were taken in petri dishes with na2s2o3 at each time point to measure the phenol concentration additional samples were collected on a petri dish with 6 ml of indigo solution ii for approximately 8 s at each time point the collected volume was measured by a balance and ranged from 5 1 to 5 8 ml the solution was used to measure the residual ozone concentration see the si the concentration of ozone at time 0s was 2 4 to 3 3 mg l 1 the ozone concentration at 6s was maintained at 72 10 compared with 0 s the cτ value was calculated by multiplying the τ dependent concentration integrated over τ see fig s1 the ozonation of phenol in the cqfs was performed in triplicate 2 4 5 analysis of inactivation rate constants the inactivation rate constants determined by the batch system k batch were modeled by the following equation n t n 0 e k c t where nt is the infective virus concentration at time t pfu ml 1 or mpn ml 1 n 0 is the infective virus concentration at time 0 pfu ml 1 or mpn ml 1 k is the first order inactivation rate constant mg 1 sec 1 l c is the disinfectant concentration mg l 1 and t is time s the inactivation rate constants determined by cqfs k cqfs were determined by two models in which the assumption of flow regime in the reaction tube was different plug flow or laminar flow in the plug flow assumption the velocity profile was constant independent on the location of the reaction tube in the laminar flow assumption it was parabolic as determined by the hagen poiseuille law under the plug flow assumption the pseudo first order reaction is described as model 1 1 n τ n 0 e k c τ where τ is the average residence time in the reaction tube seconds which is given by l v where l is the length of the reaction tube cm and v is the mean velocity cm s 1 under the laminar flow assumption the pseudo first order reaction is modeled as model 2 fogler 2008 hilder 1979 the derivation process was described in si 2 n τ n 0 1 1 0 25 k c τ e 0 5 k c τ 0 25 k c τ the abatement of phenol was also modeled as above n τ n 0 was replaced with phenol τ phenol 0 2 5 ozone disinfection experiments ozone disinfection was conducted by the developed cqfs purified coliphage or mammalian viruses suspended in 20 mm pb at ph 7 0 and an ozone solution in milliq were prepared as the virus solution and disinfectant solution respectively the ozone concentration before mixing was 0 03 0 12 mg l 1 when testing coliphages and 0 24 0 30 mg l 1 when testing enteroviruses it should be noted that the tert butanol was not added to mimic inactivation during ozonation in water treatment the resultant mixed solution had a ph of 7 reaction tubes were then installed to the outlet of the mixer the length of the reaction tube was set depending on the desired retention time 0 5 1 1 5 s or 1 2 3 s for a single ozonation experiment samples were taken at four time points including the 0 s sample first the reacting solution was collected on a petri dish with 1 08 ml of indigo solution i for approximately 15 s the collected volume was measured by a balance and ranged from 8 9 to 9 5 ml the solution was used to measure the residual ozone concentration see the si the concentration of ozone at time 0 s was 0 01 to 0 06 mg l 1 for coliphages and 0 07 to 0 13 mg l 1 for enteroviruses the ozone concentration was maintained at 80 8 for coliphages and 92 3 5 for enteroviruses during the reaction the cτ value was calculated by multiplying the τ dependent concentration integrated over τ see fig s1 furthermore an approximately 5 ml of sample was collected in petri dishes with an excessive amount of quenching solution 50 μl of 5 000 mg l 1 of na2s2o3 for virus enumeration the ozonation experiment was performed in triplicate for each virus 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed with r model fitting was conducted using the function nls multiple comparisons were performed with the tukey kramer test after checking the homogeneity of the variances by bartlett test a p value of 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 2 7 data availability all the data on to ozone disinfection experiments such as log inactivation rate ozone concentration cτ value at each time point were provided in the supplemental spreadsheet 3 results 3 1 validation of the cqfs the validation of the cqfs was performed as follows firstly we validated the hydraulics of the cqfs by comparing the two models which consider different flow regimes in the reaction tubes model 1 assumes plug flow whereas model 2 assumes it as a laminar flow to this end the first order rate constant of ms2 inactivation with free chlorine k ms2 fc was investigated by the batch experiment then ms2 inactivation was also performed in cqfs at the comparable physico chemical conditions free chlorine was chosen as a model disinfectant because of its slower reaction compared with ozone allowing us to analyze the kinetics by both the batch system and cqfs moreover we checked if the cqfs can accurately analyze the rate constant of ozone reaction for this purpose we analyzed the abatement of phenol in cqfs by applying the selected pseudo first order reaction model the log inactivation rate of ms2 in the batch system was plotted in fig s2 as a function of ct value the determined k ms2 fc was 0 120 0 002 mg 1 sec 1 l mean standard error se this was comparable with a previous report 0 130 0 010 mg 1 min 1 l that performed ms2 inactivation with free chlorine under similar physico chemical conditions sigstam et al 2013 the log inactivation rate of ms2 in cqfs was plotted in fig 2 as a function of cτ value the root mean square error rmse of the two models in which 0 120 k ms2 fc determined by the batch system was substituted for k were described in table 1 excellent agreement between experimental data and model 2 predictions was achieved the rmse was smaller in model 2 compared with model 1 indicating that model 2 fitted better to the experimental data moreover the k ms2 fc was determined to be 0 080 0 002 or 0 124 0 004 mg 1 sec 1 l if we fit model 1 or model 2 to the experimental data respectively hence model 2 was able to provide inactivation rate constant comparable to that determined by the batch system for the following experiments using cqfs we maintained the same flow regime namely the same reynolds number and adopted model 2 to analyze the rate constants the abatement rate of phenol was plotted in fig s3 as a function of cτ the reaction rate constant of k phenol ozone was determined to be 839 23 m 1 sec 1 using model 2 this was nearly comparable 1 2 fold difference to k phenol ozone determined by the batch system 993 75 m 1 sec 1 in this study see si moreover k phenol ozone in this study was consistent with the reported value 1300 300 m 1 sec 1 in previous research hoigné and bader 1983 these results suggest that the developed cqfs combining with model 2 can be applicable to analyze the rate constants of ozone reaction 3 2 ozone inactivation rate constants of various type of viruses log virus inactivation as a function of cτ was plotted in fig 3 the inactivation rate constants k were estimated by fitting model 2 to the experimental data the predicted 4 log ct value was given by 4 klog10e these results are summarized in table 2 the inactivation rate constants ranged from 58 to 511 mg 1 sec 1 l the predicted 4 log ct values from 0 018 to 0 16 mg sec l 1 statistically significant differences in ozone resistance were observed namely qβ ms2 fr ga φx 174 pv1 sabin cvb3 nancy cvb5 faulkner 3 3 ozone inactivation rate constants of coxsackievirus lab strain and environmental strains environmental strains cvb3 n 3 cvb5 n 3 were tested for their ozone resistance the log inactivation was plotted versus cτ value as shown in fig s4 the inactivation rate constants and predicted 4 log ct values were obtained in the same manner as described in section 3 2 and summarized in table s1 the predicted 4 log ct values of environmental strains were compared with each lab strain as presented in fig 4 the 4 log ct values of environmental cvb3 and cvb5 ranged from 0 16 to 0 31 mg sec l 1 and from 0 14 to 0 21 mg sec l 1 respectively the 4 log ct values of environmental strains were up to 2 fold and 1 8 fold greater than the lab strains of cvb3 and cvb5 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 agreement between cqfs and batch experiments the inactivation rate constants are theoretically specific to the type of virus and should not change depending on the experimental system however a previous ozonation study reported different inactivation rate constants of ms2 between the cqfs and batch system 5 fold wolf et al 2018 others did not compare their testing system with another experimental system finch and fairbairn 1991 roy et al 1982 we hypothesized that the observed difference among the experimental system was due to the inappropriate assumption on reactor hydraulics for example some studies tacitly regarded it as plug flow and considered the hydraulic residence time as uniform distribution even though the flow regime was actually laminar re 460 buffle et al 2006 or not clear gomes et al 2010 thus we first validated the cqfs to check if the inactivation rate constants can be consistently obtained by both the batch experiment and the cqfs our experimental results did not agree with model 1 this indicates that the assumption on plug flow leads to inaccurate measurement of inactivation rate constants in our cqfs the flow regime was laminar re 395 where the velocity is twice as fast as the average velocity at the center of the tube this means that the reaction time is half at the center resulting in the presence of more infective viruses thus model 2 which considers the effect of short circuiting flow predicted the experimental data better than model 1 did it should be noted that buffle et al 2006 and wolf et al 2018 reported that the kinetics of the abatement of phenol and carbamazepine were 10 different between the cqfs and batch experiment although they adopted model 1 in the cqfs buffle et al 2006 wolf et al 2018 this contradiction was due to the difference in the extent of the achieved rate of abatement inactivation between the chemical and microbial experiments in a typical bench scale experiment the achieved rate of chemical abatement is up to 1 log 90 whereas that of microbial inactivation is 2 3 log hence for the chemical abatement experiment the assumption of hydraulics has little effect on the analysis of inactivation kinetics the extent of degradation taking place in the bulk of the water was so small that small volumes with little degradation have a tiny effect on the average concentration after ozonation this is highlighted in fig 2 the gap between model 1 and model 2 was smaller until 1 log i e 90 reduction whereas it became larger as the rate of inactivation increased as a result the appropriateness of model 2 was apparent in this study therefore it is important to consider the rtd in cqfs especially in the case of the microbial inactivation experiment 4 2 comparison of inactivation rate constants with previous studies the observed ozone resistance trend was similar to that reported by previous studies which investigated in buffered water wolf et al 2018 namely qβ ms2 φx 174 cvb5 and which examined in secondary effluent of municipal wastewater sigmon et al 2015 namely ms2 φx 174 cvb5 coliphage ms2 qβ and φx 174 are typical surrogates to assess the removability of enteric viruses through water treatment such as coagulation sedimentation kato et al 2018 membrane filtration torii et al 2019b and chlorination sano et al 2016 however our results showed that they were more susceptible than all the tested poliovirus and coxsackievirus except cvb5 faulkner table 2 thus ms2 qβ and φx 174 are not the conservative indicators in the assessment of enteric virus reduction by ozonation systems inactivation rate constants of all of the tested viruses including environmental strains 30 511 mg 1 sec 1 l were larger than those of e coli wr1 strain 19 1 mg 1 sec 1 l at 22 c smeets et al 2006 suggesting that viruses were 1 5 fold more susceptible to ozonation than the e coli strain this result supports a previous suggestion sigmon et al 2015 that e coli could be used as a surrogate to ensure virus reduction through ozonation the predicted 4 log ct values were compared with the available literature which conducted ozonation under the comparable physico chemical conditions fig 5 finch and fairbairn 1991 hall and sobsey 1993 roy et al 1982 sigmon et al 2015 wolf et al 2018 details of the calculation of the 4 log ct values in each study are described in the si the 4 log ct value of ms2 in this study was similar 1 2 fold difference to the previous investigation using cqfs wolf et al 2018 the slight difference was partially due to the choice of the inactivation model discussed above the 4 log ct values of ms2 determined by the unique batch system wolf et al 2018 were 5 fold larger than ours this was because a large portion of the inactivation had proceeded before the system reached the state of complete mixing in their experimental system wolf et al 2018 this effect contributed to the discrepancies of other viruses between wolf et al 2018 and our study we reported smaller 4 log ct values by 7 4 fold in qβ 2 6 fold in φx 174 and 8 4 fold in cvb5 respectively note that a further consideration on the impact of hydroxyl radicals is required to explain the difference they added a radical scavenger i e tert butanol into their experimental system which largely reduced the formation of hydroxyl radicals this also may lead to slower reaction compared to ours although the contribution of hydroxyl radicals on virus inactivation was estimated to be negligible in lake water and wastewater wolf et al 2018 it might be larger in pure water such as buffer solution the 4 log ct values of cvb5 and pv1 in this study were 72 fold and 60 fold smaller than those of roy et al 1982 this might be because of the improper assumption of exposure time they assumed the average hydraulic retention time to be the exposure time in cstr without any adjustment of hydraulics roy et al 1982 suggesting that the impact of short circuiting flow on the ct value was not considered such an assumption may lead to overestimation of the required ct for 4 log inactivation by 22 fold see the si and fig s5 the remaining difference might be explained by the incomplete mixing of ozone over the water volume which made streamlines with little ozone in the reactor 4 3 underlying causes of the difference in ozone resistance between lab strains and environmental strains the difference in ozone resistance among lab strains and environmental strains might be due to the variety in capsid structure and composition phylogenetic clustering of cvb3 based on the vp1 region revealed that its lab strain belonged to minor coevolving clades genotype i chu et al 2010 lukashev and vakulenko 2017 that of cvb5 also suggested another major clade rather than the one including the lab strain henquell et al 2013 lukashev and vakulenko 2017 this indicates that environmental strains can be genetically discrete from lab strains the different genome sequence directly changes the amino acid composition and solvent exposed moieties of the capsid protein torrey et al 2019 which are related to the disinfection resistance of viruses mayer et al 2015 wigginton and kohn 2012 these studies support the hypothesis that currently circulating strains have different ozone resistance from that of the lab strain meister et al 2018 also reported an environmental cvb5 strain having a 6 fold higher resistance against free chlorine than the cvb5 faulkner strain based on these results caution is urged regarding the current reliance on lab strain to assess the inactivation of reference virus by disinfection 4 4 implications for the ozone dose management the current usepa guidance manual ct values are given by multiplying the required ct value for pv1 inactivation from roy et al 1982 with a safety factor of 3 usepa 2010 1999 1991 this value has been widely cited in the literature on bench scale inactivation lim et al 2010 thurston enriquez et al 2005 and in the prediction of virus inactivation in full scale treatment amoueyan et al 2019 smeets et al 2006 however 4 log ct values in our study were 166 fold smaller than usepa guidance manual ct values therefore following the usepa guidance manual ct values might lead to excessive ozone dosing in terms of virus inactivation although overdosing is accepted as a safer approach from the viewpoint of microbial risks it results in increased operational cost and health risks from disinfection by products andrzejewski et al 2008 von gunten and hoigne 1994 hence the required ct value for virus inactivation should be reconsidered to minimize both environmental costs and health risks it should be noted that the required ct values for the 4 log10 virus inactivation shown in this study were determined by extrapolating the pseudo first order relation between ct and inactivation rate thus caution should be taken before interpreting these results a recent pilot scale experiment reported that the linear relationship between log virus inactivation and the ozone ct value were observed only at lower rate of virus inactivation until the initial 4 to 5 log inactivation in surface water or 1 to 2 log inactivation in secondary effluent wolf et al 2019 they did not observe a log linear trend but rather a tailing trend versus ct value at a higher rate of virus inactivation this is assumingly because a small portion of the virus was protected by the water matrix which enhanced the virus resistance against ozone i e tailing effect therefore the dose response relationship in this study can only be applied to predict virus inactivation up to the reported range in the actual ozonation system to predict the upper range of inactivation e g 6 log inactivation in surface water and 3 log inactivation in secondary effluent further research is required to consider how to incorporate such a protective effect of the water matrix into the inactivation model 5 conclusions a simple plug flow assumption in the reaction tube of cqfs leads to underestimating the first order rate constants of virus inactivation under laminar flow conditions the pseudo first order inactivation model that takes into account the rtd i e laminar flow assumption in the reaction tubes of cqfs made it possible to determine the inactivation rate constants equivalently to those determined by conventional batch system coliphage ms2 qβ and φx 174 which are common surrogates to assess the efficiency of virus reduction through water treatment were more susceptible to ozonation than all the poliovirus and coxsackievirus except cvb5 faulkner this indicates that they are not conservative indicators to assess the inactivation of enteric viruses by the ozonation system the tested environmental cvb3 and cvb5 strains were more resistant than lab strains by up to 2 fold the difference in ozone resistance between lab and environmental strains should be taken into account to predict virus inactivation by ozone in a full scale plant we predicted that the ozone ct values for 4 log reduction of pv1 0 15 mg sec l 1 cvb3 nancy 0 16 mg sec l 1 and cvb5 faulkner 0 12 mg sec l 1 which were 166 156 and 208 fold smaller than usepa guidance manual ct values respectively the required ct values should be reconsidered to minimize the health risks and operational costs simultaneously declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17511,ozone has a strong oxidation power that allows effective inactivation of waterborne viruses few studies have accurately measured the kinetic relationship between virus inactivation and ozone exposure because the high reactivity of ozone makes it difficult to measure them simultaneously a continuous quench flow system cqfs is a possible solution for analyzing such a fast reaction however previous studies reported that cqfs provided different results of inactivation rate constants from the batch system the objectives of this study were 1 to develop a cqfs to evaluate the kinetics of microbial inactivation accurately 2 to evaluate the inactivation rate constants of waterborne virus by ozone and 3 to compare the results with previous studies the results indicated that the simple plug flow assumption in the reaction tube of cqfs led to underestimation of the rate constants the accurate measurement of rate constants was achieved by the pseudo first order reaction model that takes the residence time distribution rtd i e the laminar flow assumption into account the results of inactivation experiments suggested that the resistance of viruses were getting higher in the following order qβ ms2 fr ga cvb5 faulkner φx 174 pv1 sabin cvb3 nancy the environmental isolates of cvb3 and cvb5 had a 2 fold higher resistance compared with their lab strains predicted ct values for 4 log inactivation ranged from 0 018 mg sec l 1 qβ to 0 31 mg sec l 1 cvb3 environmental strain the required ct values for 4 log pv1 inactivation was 0 15 mg sec l 1 which was 166 fold smaller than those reported in the united states environmental protection agency guidance manuals the overestimation in previous studies was due to the sparse assumption of rtd in the reactor consequently the required ozone ct values for virus inactivation should be reconsidered to minimize the health risks and environmental costs in water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction ozonation is one of the advanced water treatment processes and widely applied for the control of taste odor and micropollutants and for microbial disinfection von gunten 2018 viruses are major microbial contaminants that cause waterborne diseases world health organization 2011 because of the high probability of infection with a given exposure the acceptable concentration of viruses in drinking water is low e g 1 90 000 l to achieve 10 6 disability adjusted life year person world health organization 2011 this requires regulators to achieve a high rate of virus reduction through water treatment e g 12 log reduction for indirect potable reuse title 22 and 17 california code of regulations 2015 the current treatment system heavily relies on disinfection to achieve a high level of virus reduction log credit allocable to ozonation is up to 6 log olivieri et al 2016 therefore the efficacy of virus reduction by ozonation should be carefully examined the efficiency of virus inactivation is primarily governed by the exposure to the disinfectant the so called ct value which is defined as the time dependent disinfectant concentration integrated over time usepa 1999 currently such a dose response relationship is critical for estimating the efficiency of microbial inactivation in a full scale plant as well as the information on the disinfectant decay and reactor hydraulics bellamy et al 1998 manoli et al 2019 although the dose response relationship has been investigated and meta analyzed in major disinfectants free chlorine monochloramine cromeans et al 2010 rachmadi et al 2020 and ultraviolet irradiation gerba et al 2002 hijnen et al 2006 studies on ozonation are scarce the lack of ozonation studies was mainly due to the difficulty of measuring both the ct value and the rate of virus inactivation simultaneously ozone is quickly decomposed in the aqueous phase gardoni et al 2012 and consumed by organic substances contained in the virus stock solution dunkin et al 2017 furthermore measurable virus inactivation is often completed within several seconds after contact with ozone hall and sobsey 1993 shin and sobsey 2003 hence most ozonation studies miss either information on the ct value or the rate of virus inactivation finch and fairbairn 1991 hall and sobsey 1993 herbold et al 1989 shin and sobsey 2003 sigmon et al 2015 thurston enriquez et al 2005 the batch experiment is a golden standard for analyzing inactivation kinetics in disinfection studies however it is not feasible for ozonation because it is necessary to obtain samples that have reacted with a disinfectant for a few seconds as such several studies have modified the experimental setup to obtain both the ct value and the rate of virus inactivation for example early studies applied the method of continuous stirred tank reactor cstr in which the virus and ozone solution are continuously fed to the stirred tank while the solution in the tank is withdrawn at a constant flow rate roy et al 1982 a recent study developed a unique experimental batch system that enables the simultaneous determination of the ct value and virus inactivation wolf et al 2018 despite the researchers efforts to improve the experimental setup the reported inactivation rate constants were inconsistent among available studies one of the underlying causes of the inconsistency is the sparse approximations of exposure time of collected samples for example roy et al 1982 conducted virus ozonation in cstr and reported the required time for 2 log virus inactivation under a certain ozone concentration the united states environmental protection agency usepa simply multiplied the required time with the ozone concentration and reported it as required ct values for 2 log virus inactivation usepa 2010 1991 however the required time represents just an average residence time τ in cstr in other words not every virus travels the reactor for time τ theoretically the short circuiting flow which travels in the reactor for a shorter time than the mean residence time in which much greater portion of viruses remains infective affects the average virus concentration at a given time therefore the currently proposed values do not represent the actual ct value but rather the cτ value which virtually includes the effect of the heterogeneity of hydraulics another cause is the reduced mixing efficiency of the disinfectant solution with the virus solution wolf et al 2018 noted that their system might underestimate the rate constants because a large portion of inactivation had occurred before the system reached a state of complete mixing the continuous quench flow system cqfs is a bench scale experiment technique that comprises a pump small mixer and reaction tube it was developed to analyze the kinetics of fast reactions several studies have applied this system to evaluate the degradation of chemicals such as carbamazepine buffle et al 2006 and textile dyes gomes et al 2010 generally the system drives the test solution and ozone solution separately mixes them in a small reactor and facilitates the mixture to flow in the reaction tube continuously the exposure time is controlled by changing the length of the tube or flow rate this setup makes it possible to obtain the samples reacting for a few seconds therefore cqfs is a potential solution to measure both the ozone ct value and the rate of virus inactivation simultaneously in this study we introduced a cqfs in which the flow regime is laminar to evaluate the first order rate constants for the waterborne virus inactivation with ozone the challenge for cqfs used in previous studies was a tacit assumption of flow hydraulics in reaction tubes several studies assumed the flow regime in the reaction tube to be a plug flow although it was actually laminar flow buffle et al 2006 hunt and mariñas 1997 or not described czekalski et al 2016 gomes et al 2010 wolf et al 2018 moreover scattered or biphasic data were observed in a single dose response relationship determined by cqfs possibly because the flow regime was not controlled among data points hunt and mariñas 1997 wolf et al 2018 these properties required researchers to develop more solid experimental protocols specifically it is necessary to develop a pseudo first order kinetic model that takes the residence time distribution rtd function into account and to control the flow regime throughout the entire experiment the objectives of this study were 1 to develop a cqfs and pseudo first order kinetics model that considers rtd for an accurate measurement of inactivation rate constants by ozone 2 to evaluate inactivation rate constants for the waterborne virus inactivation and 3 to compare the results with previous studies and usepa guidance manual ct values 2 materials and methods 2 1 virus propagation purification and enumeration f rna coliphages ms2 fr ga qβ and somatic coliphage φx 174 were propagated by e coli k12a λ f and e coli c nbrc13898 respectively coxsackievirus b3 cvb3 nancy strain coxsackievirus b5 cvb5 faulkner strain and poliovirus type 1 pv1 sabin strain a total of six environmental strains cvb3 env1 2 3 and cvb5 env1 2 3 were propagated by buffalo green monkey kidney bgm cells the environmental strains were isolated from the influent of municipal wastewater in toyama japan from 2006 to 2018 by the adsorption and elution method using negatively charged membranes iwai et al 2006 their serotypes were identified by specific antisera denka co ltd tokyo japan the propagated stocks were clarified by centrifugation followed by 0 2 μm filtration then the filtrate was concentrated by uf membrane finally the concentrate was purified by density gradient centrifugation as described elsewhere loison et al 2016 torii et al 2019a with slight modification the details were described in supporting information si the number of infective coliphages were quantified by a single agar layer sal procedure for each sample a series of 10 fold dilutions was prepared in 10 mm phosphate buffer pb at ph 7 0 then 0 1 or 1 ml samples were added to petri dishes and mixed with lb agar containing propagated host e coli and incubated at 37 c overnight each dilution was enumerated in duplicate the concentrations of coliphages were reported as pfu ml the number of infective cvb3 cvb5 and pv1 was enumerated by most probable number mpn assay using bgm cells on 96 well plates with five replicates and four dilutions per sample meister et al 2018 the samples to be quantified were serially diluted 10 fold by maintenance medium supplemented with 1 fetal bovine serum each well was inoculated with 150 μl of diluted samples after the incubation at 37 c with 5 co2 for 5 to 6 days the presence of cytopathic effects was monitored by microscope the number of positive wells of each dilution was counted and analyzed by an r package ferguson and ihrie 2019 the concentrations of cvb3 cvb5 and pv1 were reported as mpn ml 2 2 setup of continuous quench flow system cqfs the cqfs was set up as shown in fig 1 the reactor comprised two peristaltic pumps perista pump ac 2110ii atto co ltd japan to drive two solutions virus solution and disinfectant solution a t connector mixer vrft6 isis co ltd japan in which the magnetic ball was stirred and a silicone tube outer diameter 4 mm inner diameter 2 mm to facilitate the reaction with disinfectant the virus solution was driven at 0 31 ml s and mixed at a 1 1 ratio with a disinfectant solution resulting in the mixed solution flowing at 0 62 ml s in the silicone tube the velocity of the mixed solution was 20 cm s the flow rate was not changed for any of cqfs experiments to maintain the flow regime at a reynolds number re of 395 in the silicone tube the reaction time can be controlled by selecting different tube lengths l 20τ s where l cm represents the length of the silicone tube and τ s represents the desired retention time a preliminary experiment showed that virus loss by the attachment to the reaction tube was negligible even when using the tube length of 180 cm at the outlet of the reaction tube an exceeded amount of sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 was prepared in a petri dish to stop the reaction immediately in this study the disinfected sample at the outlet of the mixer was regarded as the 0 s sample this was because this cqfs has a dead volume from mixing point to the point at which the first data point was collectable the average dead time i e residence time of the mixer was estimated to be 0 24 seconds all of the experiments were conducted at 22 1 c the mixer and each reaction tube were rinsed thoroughly with milliq before and after the cqfs operation 2 3 ozone production and measurement an ozone generator ebara ozsd 3000a japan was used to produce ozone gas from oxygen the obtained gas was bubbled through chilled milliq pre acidified by phosphoric acid ph 3 5 to prepare the ozone stock solution at a final concentration of 5 mg l 1 the concentration of the stock solution was determined by direct spectrophotometry with an absorption coefficient of ozone ε260 3 200 m 1 cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 in ozonation experiments the concentration was determined by the decolorization of indigo trisulfonate with an adsorption coefficient ε600 20 000 m 1 cm 1 as described elsewhere bader and hoigné 1981 2 4 validation of cqfs 2 4 1 chlorination of ms2 in the batch system batch chlorination of ms2 was conducted in a 50 ml glass beaker a free chlorine working solution was prepared by diluting sodium hypochlorite with 10 mm pb at ph 7 0 to obtain a final concentration of 7 8 to 7 9 mg l 1 as cl2 free chlorine was measured by the spectrophotometric method using n n diethyl p phenylene diamine dpd with a dr890 colorimeter hach company loveland co before each experiment the glass beaker was washed with milliq and the working solution then 20 μl of purified ms2 stocks were spiked into 20 ml of stirred working solution one milliliter of aliquot was harvested and directly mixed with 50 μl of na2s2o3 at a concentration of 5 000 mg l at 6 s and 12 s the initial virus concentration was sampled from 20 ml of pb spiked with 20 μl virus stock the initial virus concentration was 106 7 pfu ml note that the concentration of free chlorine was not decayed at 30 s for the whole experiment data not shown this batch experiment was conducted four times 2 4 2 chlorination of ms2 in the cqfs ms2 chlorination was conducted by the developed cqfs ms2 was suspended in 10 mm pb at ph 7 0 as the virus solution and free chlorine at a concentration of 15 to 16 mg l 1 as cl2 in 10 mm pb was prepared as the disinfectant solution then different lengths of reaction tubes 60 120 180 cm were installed on the outlet of the mixer depending on the desired retention time 3 6 9 s of the samples the sample at 0 s was taken at the outlet of the mixer for a single experiment 6 2 ml of samples at 0 s 3 s 6 s and 9 s were taken in petri dishes with na2s2o3 for enumeration of ms2 additional samples 3 1 ml were taken in petri dishes without na2s2o3 in the collection of 0 s and 9 s samples a 1 ml of the sample on the petri dish was taken immediately mixed with 9 ml of dpd solution and examined for free chlorine the free chlorine concentration of the mixed solution at time 0 s ranged from 7 6 to 8 1 mg l 1 as cl2 the ms2 concentration at time 0s ranged from 3 0 105 to 5 0 105 pfu ml the decay in free chlorine was 0 1 mg l as cl2 data not shown the experiment was run four times 2 4 3 ozonation of phenol in the batch system an ozone solution was prepared at a final concentration of 2 9 mg l 1 before each experiment the glass beaker was washed with milliq and the ozone solution the ozone solution was acidified to ph 3 0 by phosphoric acid and spiked with tert butanol at a final concentration of 10 mm as a radical scavenger then 150 μl of phenol stocks 25 mg l 1 were spiked into 15 ml of the stirred ozone solution the reaction was stopped at 10 s by adding the excess amount of na2s2o3 at the final concentration of 100 mg l 1 the initial phenol concentration was determined by sampling from 15 ml of milliq spiked with 150 μl phenol stock the concentration of phenol was determined by the spectrophotometric method using 4 aminoantipyrine described in usepa method 420 1 this batch experiment was conducted at 22 1 c in triplicate in the batch system we could not measure the phenol and ozone concentration simultaneously thus we measured the ozone decay during the reaction above separately the ozone concentration was maintained at 59 7 during the reaction of phenol and ozone n 2 data not shown the ct value was calculated by multiplying the time dependent concentration integrated over time see fig s1 2 4 4 ozonation of phenol in the cqfs phenol was suspended at the final concentration of 500 μg l in pre acidified milliq at ph 3 0 with tert butanol at a final concentration of 10 mm the ozone solution was prepared at the concentration of at ph 3 0 then reaction tubes were prepared to achieve the retention time of 0 2 4 6 s the sample at 0 s was taken at the outlet of the mixer for a single experiment approximately 12 ml of samples were taken in petri dishes with na2s2o3 at each time point to measure the phenol concentration additional samples were collected on a petri dish with 6 ml of indigo solution ii for approximately 8 s at each time point the collected volume was measured by a balance and ranged from 5 1 to 5 8 ml the solution was used to measure the residual ozone concentration see the si the concentration of ozone at time 0s was 2 4 to 3 3 mg l 1 the ozone concentration at 6s was maintained at 72 10 compared with 0 s the cτ value was calculated by multiplying the τ dependent concentration integrated over τ see fig s1 the ozonation of phenol in the cqfs was performed in triplicate 2 4 5 analysis of inactivation rate constants the inactivation rate constants determined by the batch system k batch were modeled by the following equation n t n 0 e k c t where nt is the infective virus concentration at time t pfu ml 1 or mpn ml 1 n 0 is the infective virus concentration at time 0 pfu ml 1 or mpn ml 1 k is the first order inactivation rate constant mg 1 sec 1 l c is the disinfectant concentration mg l 1 and t is time s the inactivation rate constants determined by cqfs k cqfs were determined by two models in which the assumption of flow regime in the reaction tube was different plug flow or laminar flow in the plug flow assumption the velocity profile was constant independent on the location of the reaction tube in the laminar flow assumption it was parabolic as determined by the hagen poiseuille law under the plug flow assumption the pseudo first order reaction is described as model 1 1 n τ n 0 e k c τ where τ is the average residence time in the reaction tube seconds which is given by l v where l is the length of the reaction tube cm and v is the mean velocity cm s 1 under the laminar flow assumption the pseudo first order reaction is modeled as model 2 fogler 2008 hilder 1979 the derivation process was described in si 2 n τ n 0 1 1 0 25 k c τ e 0 5 k c τ 0 25 k c τ the abatement of phenol was also modeled as above n τ n 0 was replaced with phenol τ phenol 0 2 5 ozone disinfection experiments ozone disinfection was conducted by the developed cqfs purified coliphage or mammalian viruses suspended in 20 mm pb at ph 7 0 and an ozone solution in milliq were prepared as the virus solution and disinfectant solution respectively the ozone concentration before mixing was 0 03 0 12 mg l 1 when testing coliphages and 0 24 0 30 mg l 1 when testing enteroviruses it should be noted that the tert butanol was not added to mimic inactivation during ozonation in water treatment the resultant mixed solution had a ph of 7 reaction tubes were then installed to the outlet of the mixer the length of the reaction tube was set depending on the desired retention time 0 5 1 1 5 s or 1 2 3 s for a single ozonation experiment samples were taken at four time points including the 0 s sample first the reacting solution was collected on a petri dish with 1 08 ml of indigo solution i for approximately 15 s the collected volume was measured by a balance and ranged from 8 9 to 9 5 ml the solution was used to measure the residual ozone concentration see the si the concentration of ozone at time 0 s was 0 01 to 0 06 mg l 1 for coliphages and 0 07 to 0 13 mg l 1 for enteroviruses the ozone concentration was maintained at 80 8 for coliphages and 92 3 5 for enteroviruses during the reaction the cτ value was calculated by multiplying the τ dependent concentration integrated over τ see fig s1 furthermore an approximately 5 ml of sample was collected in petri dishes with an excessive amount of quenching solution 50 μl of 5 000 mg l 1 of na2s2o3 for virus enumeration the ozonation experiment was performed in triplicate for each virus 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed with r model fitting was conducted using the function nls multiple comparisons were performed with the tukey kramer test after checking the homogeneity of the variances by bartlett test a p value of 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 2 7 data availability all the data on to ozone disinfection experiments such as log inactivation rate ozone concentration cτ value at each time point were provided in the supplemental spreadsheet 3 results 3 1 validation of the cqfs the validation of the cqfs was performed as follows firstly we validated the hydraulics of the cqfs by comparing the two models which consider different flow regimes in the reaction tubes model 1 assumes plug flow whereas model 2 assumes it as a laminar flow to this end the first order rate constant of ms2 inactivation with free chlorine k ms2 fc was investigated by the batch experiment then ms2 inactivation was also performed in cqfs at the comparable physico chemical conditions free chlorine was chosen as a model disinfectant because of its slower reaction compared with ozone allowing us to analyze the kinetics by both the batch system and cqfs moreover we checked if the cqfs can accurately analyze the rate constant of ozone reaction for this purpose we analyzed the abatement of phenol in cqfs by applying the selected pseudo first order reaction model the log inactivation rate of ms2 in the batch system was plotted in fig s2 as a function of ct value the determined k ms2 fc was 0 120 0 002 mg 1 sec 1 l mean standard error se this was comparable with a previous report 0 130 0 010 mg 1 min 1 l that performed ms2 inactivation with free chlorine under similar physico chemical conditions sigstam et al 2013 the log inactivation rate of ms2 in cqfs was plotted in fig 2 as a function of cτ value the root mean square error rmse of the two models in which 0 120 k ms2 fc determined by the batch system was substituted for k were described in table 1 excellent agreement between experimental data and model 2 predictions was achieved the rmse was smaller in model 2 compared with model 1 indicating that model 2 fitted better to the experimental data moreover the k ms2 fc was determined to be 0 080 0 002 or 0 124 0 004 mg 1 sec 1 l if we fit model 1 or model 2 to the experimental data respectively hence model 2 was able to provide inactivation rate constant comparable to that determined by the batch system for the following experiments using cqfs we maintained the same flow regime namely the same reynolds number and adopted model 2 to analyze the rate constants the abatement rate of phenol was plotted in fig s3 as a function of cτ the reaction rate constant of k phenol ozone was determined to be 839 23 m 1 sec 1 using model 2 this was nearly comparable 1 2 fold difference to k phenol ozone determined by the batch system 993 75 m 1 sec 1 in this study see si moreover k phenol ozone in this study was consistent with the reported value 1300 300 m 1 sec 1 in previous research hoigné and bader 1983 these results suggest that the developed cqfs combining with model 2 can be applicable to analyze the rate constants of ozone reaction 3 2 ozone inactivation rate constants of various type of viruses log virus inactivation as a function of cτ was plotted in fig 3 the inactivation rate constants k were estimated by fitting model 2 to the experimental data the predicted 4 log ct value was given by 4 klog10e these results are summarized in table 2 the inactivation rate constants ranged from 58 to 511 mg 1 sec 1 l the predicted 4 log ct values from 0 018 to 0 16 mg sec l 1 statistically significant differences in ozone resistance were observed namely qβ ms2 fr ga φx 174 pv1 sabin cvb3 nancy cvb5 faulkner 3 3 ozone inactivation rate constants of coxsackievirus lab strain and environmental strains environmental strains cvb3 n 3 cvb5 n 3 were tested for their ozone resistance the log inactivation was plotted versus cτ value as shown in fig s4 the inactivation rate constants and predicted 4 log ct values were obtained in the same manner as described in section 3 2 and summarized in table s1 the predicted 4 log ct values of environmental strains were compared with each lab strain as presented in fig 4 the 4 log ct values of environmental cvb3 and cvb5 ranged from 0 16 to 0 31 mg sec l 1 and from 0 14 to 0 21 mg sec l 1 respectively the 4 log ct values of environmental strains were up to 2 fold and 1 8 fold greater than the lab strains of cvb3 and cvb5 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 agreement between cqfs and batch experiments the inactivation rate constants are theoretically specific to the type of virus and should not change depending on the experimental system however a previous ozonation study reported different inactivation rate constants of ms2 between the cqfs and batch system 5 fold wolf et al 2018 others did not compare their testing system with another experimental system finch and fairbairn 1991 roy et al 1982 we hypothesized that the observed difference among the experimental system was due to the inappropriate assumption on reactor hydraulics for example some studies tacitly regarded it as plug flow and considered the hydraulic residence time as uniform distribution even though the flow regime was actually laminar re 460 buffle et al 2006 or not clear gomes et al 2010 thus we first validated the cqfs to check if the inactivation rate constants can be consistently obtained by both the batch experiment and the cqfs our experimental results did not agree with model 1 this indicates that the assumption on plug flow leads to inaccurate measurement of inactivation rate constants in our cqfs the flow regime was laminar re 395 where the velocity is twice as fast as the average velocity at the center of the tube this means that the reaction time is half at the center resulting in the presence of more infective viruses thus model 2 which considers the effect of short circuiting flow predicted the experimental data better than model 1 did it should be noted that buffle et al 2006 and wolf et al 2018 reported that the kinetics of the abatement of phenol and carbamazepine were 10 different between the cqfs and batch experiment although they adopted model 1 in the cqfs buffle et al 2006 wolf et al 2018 this contradiction was due to the difference in the extent of the achieved rate of abatement inactivation between the chemical and microbial experiments in a typical bench scale experiment the achieved rate of chemical abatement is up to 1 log 90 whereas that of microbial inactivation is 2 3 log hence for the chemical abatement experiment the assumption of hydraulics has little effect on the analysis of inactivation kinetics the extent of degradation taking place in the bulk of the water was so small that small volumes with little degradation have a tiny effect on the average concentration after ozonation this is highlighted in fig 2 the gap between model 1 and model 2 was smaller until 1 log i e 90 reduction whereas it became larger as the rate of inactivation increased as a result the appropriateness of model 2 was apparent in this study therefore it is important to consider the rtd in cqfs especially in the case of the microbial inactivation experiment 4 2 comparison of inactivation rate constants with previous studies the observed ozone resistance trend was similar to that reported by previous studies which investigated in buffered water wolf et al 2018 namely qβ ms2 φx 174 cvb5 and which examined in secondary effluent of municipal wastewater sigmon et al 2015 namely ms2 φx 174 cvb5 coliphage ms2 qβ and φx 174 are typical surrogates to assess the removability of enteric viruses through water treatment such as coagulation sedimentation kato et al 2018 membrane filtration torii et al 2019b and chlorination sano et al 2016 however our results showed that they were more susceptible than all the tested poliovirus and coxsackievirus except cvb5 faulkner table 2 thus ms2 qβ and φx 174 are not the conservative indicators in the assessment of enteric virus reduction by ozonation systems inactivation rate constants of all of the tested viruses including environmental strains 30 511 mg 1 sec 1 l were larger than those of e coli wr1 strain 19 1 mg 1 sec 1 l at 22 c smeets et al 2006 suggesting that viruses were 1 5 fold more susceptible to ozonation than the e coli strain this result supports a previous suggestion sigmon et al 2015 that e coli could be used as a surrogate to ensure virus reduction through ozonation the predicted 4 log ct values were compared with the available literature which conducted ozonation under the comparable physico chemical conditions fig 5 finch and fairbairn 1991 hall and sobsey 1993 roy et al 1982 sigmon et al 2015 wolf et al 2018 details of the calculation of the 4 log ct values in each study are described in the si the 4 log ct value of ms2 in this study was similar 1 2 fold difference to the previous investigation using cqfs wolf et al 2018 the slight difference was partially due to the choice of the inactivation model discussed above the 4 log ct values of ms2 determined by the unique batch system wolf et al 2018 were 5 fold larger than ours this was because a large portion of the inactivation had proceeded before the system reached the state of complete mixing in their experimental system wolf et al 2018 this effect contributed to the discrepancies of other viruses between wolf et al 2018 and our study we reported smaller 4 log ct values by 7 4 fold in qβ 2 6 fold in φx 174 and 8 4 fold in cvb5 respectively note that a further consideration on the impact of hydroxyl radicals is required to explain the difference they added a radical scavenger i e tert butanol into their experimental system which largely reduced the formation of hydroxyl radicals this also may lead to slower reaction compared to ours although the contribution of hydroxyl radicals on virus inactivation was estimated to be negligible in lake water and wastewater wolf et al 2018 it might be larger in pure water such as buffer solution the 4 log ct values of cvb5 and pv1 in this study were 72 fold and 60 fold smaller than those of roy et al 1982 this might be because of the improper assumption of exposure time they assumed the average hydraulic retention time to be the exposure time in cstr without any adjustment of hydraulics roy et al 1982 suggesting that the impact of short circuiting flow on the ct value was not considered such an assumption may lead to overestimation of the required ct for 4 log inactivation by 22 fold see the si and fig s5 the remaining difference might be explained by the incomplete mixing of ozone over the water volume which made streamlines with little ozone in the reactor 4 3 underlying causes of the difference in ozone resistance between lab strains and environmental strains the difference in ozone resistance among lab strains and environmental strains might be due to the variety in capsid structure and composition phylogenetic clustering of cvb3 based on the vp1 region revealed that its lab strain belonged to minor coevolving clades genotype i chu et al 2010 lukashev and vakulenko 2017 that of cvb5 also suggested another major clade rather than the one including the lab strain henquell et al 2013 lukashev and vakulenko 2017 this indicates that environmental strains can be genetically discrete from lab strains the different genome sequence directly changes the amino acid composition and solvent exposed moieties of the capsid protein torrey et al 2019 which are related to the disinfection resistance of viruses mayer et al 2015 wigginton and kohn 2012 these studies support the hypothesis that currently circulating strains have different ozone resistance from that of the lab strain meister et al 2018 also reported an environmental cvb5 strain having a 6 fold higher resistance against free chlorine than the cvb5 faulkner strain based on these results caution is urged regarding the current reliance on lab strain to assess the inactivation of reference virus by disinfection 4 4 implications for the ozone dose management the current usepa guidance manual ct values are given by multiplying the required ct value for pv1 inactivation from roy et al 1982 with a safety factor of 3 usepa 2010 1999 1991 this value has been widely cited in the literature on bench scale inactivation lim et al 2010 thurston enriquez et al 2005 and in the prediction of virus inactivation in full scale treatment amoueyan et al 2019 smeets et al 2006 however 4 log ct values in our study were 166 fold smaller than usepa guidance manual ct values therefore following the usepa guidance manual ct values might lead to excessive ozone dosing in terms of virus inactivation although overdosing is accepted as a safer approach from the viewpoint of microbial risks it results in increased operational cost and health risks from disinfection by products andrzejewski et al 2008 von gunten and hoigne 1994 hence the required ct value for virus inactivation should be reconsidered to minimize both environmental costs and health risks it should be noted that the required ct values for the 4 log10 virus inactivation shown in this study were determined by extrapolating the pseudo first order relation between ct and inactivation rate thus caution should be taken before interpreting these results a recent pilot scale experiment reported that the linear relationship between log virus inactivation and the ozone ct value were observed only at lower rate of virus inactivation until the initial 4 to 5 log inactivation in surface water or 1 to 2 log inactivation in secondary effluent wolf et al 2019 they did not observe a log linear trend but rather a tailing trend versus ct value at a higher rate of virus inactivation this is assumingly because a small portion of the virus was protected by the water matrix which enhanced the virus resistance against ozone i e tailing effect therefore the dose response relationship in this study can only be applied to predict virus inactivation up to the reported range in the actual ozonation system to predict the upper range of inactivation e g 6 log inactivation in surface water and 3 log inactivation in secondary effluent further research is required to consider how to incorporate such a protective effect of the water matrix into the inactivation model 5 conclusions a simple plug flow assumption in the reaction tube of cqfs leads to underestimating the first order rate constants of virus inactivation under laminar flow conditions the pseudo first order inactivation model that takes into account the rtd i e laminar flow assumption in the reaction tubes of cqfs made it possible to determine the inactivation rate constants equivalently to those determined by conventional batch system coliphage ms2 qβ and φx 174 which are common surrogates to assess the efficiency of virus reduction through water treatment were more susceptible to ozonation than all the poliovirus and coxsackievirus except cvb5 faulkner this indicates that they are not conservative indicators to assess the inactivation of enteric viruses by the ozonation system the tested environmental cvb3 and cvb5 strains were more resistant than lab strains by up to 2 fold the difference in ozone resistance between lab and environmental strains should be taken into account to predict virus inactivation by ozone in a full scale plant we predicted that the ozone ct values for 4 log reduction of pv1 0 15 mg sec l 1 cvb3 nancy 0 16 mg sec l 1 and cvb5 faulkner 0 12 mg sec l 1 which were 166 156 and 208 fold smaller than usepa guidance manual ct values respectively the required ct values should be reconsidered to minimize the health risks and operational costs simultaneously declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

2 is an enveloped single stranded rna virus that has been characterized by high infectivity relatively high asymptomatic ratio in the population and potential to result in serious health complications bai et al 2020 gerrityet al 2020 zhou et al 2020 although covid 19 clinical tests were developed rapidly production and distribution did not keep up with high demand thus testing was often reserved only for individuals who met strict requirements including symptomology and recent travel to high risk areas cdc 2020 with these limitations on clinical testing it is likely that many individuals both with and without symptoms were not included in the covid 19 case estimates being used to make public health decisions murakami et al 2020 seropositive testing shows promise for retrospective understanding of asymptomatic rates disease spread within a population and reinfection risks yongchenet al 2020 however an additional method for real time or near real time tracking of disease spread

various markers in wastewater to make inferences about the population choi et al 2018 although recent wbe studies have primarily focused on pharmaceutical and illicit drug use choi et al 2018 causanilleset al 2017 baz lombaet al 2016 van nuijis et al 2011 this approach has promise for better understanding the spread of infectious disease within a population in fact some studies looking at various pathogens with wbe were published prior to the covid 19 pandemic hoviet al 2012 hellmeret al 2014 bisseuxet al 2018 brouweret al 2018 because wastewater sampling captures the aggregated community signal it can potentially be used to identify regions where disease incidence is increasing but remains undetected via individual clinical testing peccia et al 2020 in addition wbe has the potential to identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals bivinset al 2020 this not only results in a less biased dataset particularly when individual test kits are limited murakami et al 2020 but can also incorporate the asymptomatic population into the crucial assessment of the true population prevalence for epidemiological response and modeling lack of a reliable sars cov 2 stool

between individual assays 3 results and discussion 3 1 confirmed covid 19 cases in southeastern virginia usa the first confirmed case of covid 19 in southeastern virginia was reported on march 9 2020 in the city of virginia beach between that time and july 28 2020 the total number of clinically confirmed cases within the hampton roads region grew to 14 904 the total number of cases within the state of virginia grew to 86 994 during the same time period overall virginia beach saw the greatest number of clinical cases 3 788 while suffolk had the greatest amount of deaths 46 most other cities within the service area reported total cases in the hundreds while smaller communities had totals ranging from 34 poquoson to 518 james city fig 1 a however when normalized to population size there is less of a discrepancy in confirmed case data amongst all the cities and counties fig 1b clinical covid 19 testing for the state of virginia began on march 5 2020 and increased dramatically during the time of this study on the first wastewater sampling date in the present study a total of 69 patients in all of virginia had been tested this increased to 1 180 000 as of july 28th although it is likely that the observed increases documented the active spread of the sars cov 2 virus the inherent confounding influence of increased testing on clinical data should be acknowledged murakami et al 2020 3 2 viral assay performance total surrogate recovery the theoretical limits of detection lod for assays n1 n2 and n3 were 14 6 2 and 2 18 copies per reaction respectively the n2 assay proved to be the most sensitive for our rt ddpcr workflow which is why the n2 assay results were used in subsequent loading analyses and visualizations this was in contrast to others e g lu et al 2020 vogels et al 2020 but is likely due to the matrix and specific rt ddpcr workflows bovine coronavirus bcov and bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv were used to assess recoveries without concentration as well as with concentration using innovaprep and electronegative filtration recoveries of the surrogates without concentration direct extraction of 2 ml samples were 59 14 and 75 13 for bcov and brsv respectively innovaprep with centrifugation workflow total recoveries for bcov and brsv were 5 5 2 1 and 7 6 3 0 respectively electronegative filtration workflow total recoveries for bcov and brsv were 4 8 2 8 and 6 6 3 8 respectively although concentration steps used in both workflows during this study likely resulted in reductions of virus signal concentration was ultimately necessary in order to detect the low viral concentrations documented in the region at the beginning of the study total recoveries were similar across surrogates and workflows therefore results from the entire 21 week study were reported together and without adjustment matrix inhibition of the rt ddpcr assay expressed as recovered hepatitis g spike averaged 50 19 and 9 4 9 4 for innovaprep and electronegative filtration workflows respectively while the total surrogate recoveries were similar for the 2 workflows the innovaprep workflow was less affected by inhibition as seen in the hepatitis g recoveries it is likely that the centrifugation step in the innovaprep workflow removed solids from suspension which resulted in less matrix inhibition but also a lower sars cov 2 signal from particle attached virus losses in contrast the electronegative filtration workflow retained a high percentage of wastewater solids which likely retained particle attached viruses but resulted in greater matrix inhibition as documented by hepatitis g recoveries further dilution of samples was not done to alleviate inhibition seen in some samples to maximize low detections 3 3 assessment of n1 n2 and n3 assays in wastewater at the start of this study the cdc recommended three different assays for sars cov 2 detection n1 n2 and n3 while n1 and n2 were designed specific to sars cov 2 n3 was designed as a more universal assay for the clade 2 and 3 viruses of the sarbecovirus subgenus lu et al 2020 typically environmental microbiology studies use one assay to determine pathogen concentrations in samples e g worley morse et al 2019 rose 2005 to date several sars cov 2 wbe studies have incorporated multiple assays including all three cdc assays e g ahmed et al 2020 medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 wu et al 2020 while others have incorporated alternative assays la rosa et al 2020 kocamemi et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020a 2020b to better understand if future wbe studies should run all three cdc assays we compared detection rates and concentrations among all three throughout the 21 week long study sars cov 2 rna was detected in raw wastewater influent from at least one wwtp on all sample dates even during the first week of sampling when there were only two clinical detections in the region fig 2 a detections were sporadic in the first several weeks of sampling with inconsistent detections among the three assays when estimated raw wastewater concentrations of viral rna were low for all samples n 198 98 had detections for all 3 assays 22 had detections for 2 of the 3 assays and 30 had detections for only 1 assay as total detections increased between march 24th and july 28th agreement among the three assays improved and detections became more consistent across treatment facilities fig 2a the n2 assay proved dominant in detection frequency n 198 with cumulative detections over the 21 week period totaling 107 125 and 113 for assays n1 n2 and n3 respectively there was a statistical difference kruskal wallis chi squared 32 49 p 0 001 in the number of n2 and n3 detections from n1 p 0 001 but no difference between n2 and n3 p 0 26 it should be noted that n1 had fewer detections for all but two of the sample dates most likely due to the higher lod established for this assay fig 2b future work will use a different standard to determine the theoretical lod 3 4 sars cov 2 trends in wastewater over the course of the entire 21 week study sars cov 2 concentrations in positive samples were between 101 and 104 copies 100 ml 1 these concentrations are in line with those documented in australia and turkey ahmed et al 2020 kocamemi et al 2020 sherchan et al 2020 wu et al 2020 studies in spain and france however have documented concentrations that were at least two orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations measured in the present study randazzo et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020b multiple factors could account for these differences including disease prevalence in the study regions efficiency of concentration methods used and variability in pcr based workflows aggregated detection trends for all three assays show both increasing and decreasing occurrence over the course of the 21 week sample period fig 2c samples collected on the first two sample dates march 11th and 16th showed detections at low concentrations at three wwtps all less than 300 copies 100ml 1 a sharp increase in detections was documented between march 16th and march 24th after which a sustained increase in detections was documented over the course of three weeks through april 14th fig 2c during this time between five and seven treatment plants had positive detections with the maximum number of detections on april 6th fig 2c following the peak on april 6th there was a gradual decline in the total number of detections for the subsequent three sampling dates with the smallest number of detections since the peak documented on april 23rd 8 detections fig 2a starting april 28th through the remaining sample dates there was an increase in detections documented most notably in the ab service area where the highest concentrations seen to date were recorded 3 5 service area and regional loading estimates fig 3 shows the range of population normalized loading by date for each wwtp this allows end users to easily visualize specific outbreaks and major trends overall trends increased across all catchments during the study period in addition notable shifts in trends can be seen at several of the wwtps for example in the bh service area there were no detections for the first several months until the last five weeks when loading increased indicating a notable rise in the total number of infected people another example is in the ce service area loadings were consistent from march through mid june after which loading began to trend upwards data presented in fig 3 can also be compared to known outbreaks that were documented by the health department during this study e g one in the wb service area and one in the np service area increases in detection in the wb service area that were documented in mid march were likely caused by an outbreak in james city county which saw a total of 34 people infected within 7 days of sampling based on clinical data the np service area spike in mid april was associated with an isle of wight outbreak that infected a total of 55 people within 7 days of sampling based on clinical data much in the same way these data can be used to identify potential areas where signs of elevated infection are not documented based on clinical data or areas where there may be evidence of reduced infection rates over time for example vip showed increased evidence of infection within the catchment starting in late march followed by a steady decline on the following six sample dates this indicates an increase followed by a drop in cases in the vip service area the capability to observe declining numbers of cases at the sub city scale could prove particularly useful as this information is likely obscured in the clinical testing data future monitoring of the hampton roads wastewater will hopefully provide more evidence of the usefulness of wbe during major declines in the infected population the combination of clinical testing results and wbe data can provide a more complete picture of how the virus and disease are transmitting in the population fig 4 shows spatial data by week in the form of heat maps representing population normalized loading in sampled wwtp catchments only one heat map is shown per month but supplemental video s1 shows an animation of all weeks sampled maps such as these are helpful to spatially visualize the data and identify likely locations for regional outbreaks for example on march 11th evidence of infection was low throughout the entire region however on april 14th there was early evidence of widespread cases in three wb vip np of the nine studied catchments the may 20th panel shows evidence of increased loading at other service areas yr jr while catchments i e np that previously had high loading were reduced june and july highlight the increase and spread of sars cov 2 loading throughout the region and delineate more densely impacted areas spatially displaying population normalized loadings show the irregular outbreak of localized hot spots this demonstrates that while clinically confirmed cases uniformly increase for a city as more testing is completed the actual viral spread is likely more heterogeneous being heavily influenced by local outbreaks thus wbe has the potential to target where more localized clinical testing might be needed to fully understand sporadic hotspots that are likely to emerge as the covid 19 pandemic wanes fig 5 shows regional loading estimates over time wbe instantaneous loading data from all 9 wwtp catchments were combined weekly to estimate instantaneous regional loading the hampton roads regional loading estimates mirror the trends in catchment level population normalized loading starting in mid june there is an obvious significant inflection upwards in loading corresponding with the virginia phase reopenings the late march to mid april increase in loading prior to the stay at home was evident as well as the small decline and plateau in loading before the phase reopenings the rising limb of regional loading could be incorporated into analyses of clinical testing data to determine the extent to which increases in clinical detection are simply a product of increased testing future work will also examine the lead lag association between hampton roads sars cov 2 wastewater data and regional confirmed clinical data 4 conclusion it is important that public health officials have an array of reliable data sources available to them when making regional decisions clinical datasets can be inherently biased depending on various factors including patient screening prior to testing testing supply limitations and how invasive and or unpleasant testing is for patients wbe methods are often less impacted by these types of sample collection biasbut may incorporate uncertainly associated with temporal and spatial variations in molecular signals within the sewer decay of nucleic acids and rainfall impacts on overall load measurements here we propose methods for analyzing and presenting wbe data so that it can be used in concert with clinical results to provide a more complete picture for community officials funding this work was supported by hampton roads sanitation district and the

bai et al 2020 gerrityet al 2020 zhou et al 2020 although covid 19 clinical tests were developed rapidly production and distribution did not keep up with high demand thus testing was often reserved only for individuals who met strict requirements including symptomology and recent travel to high risk areas cdc 2020 with these limitations on clinical testing it is likely that many individuals both with and without symptoms were not included in the covid 19 case estimates being used to make public health decisions murakami et al 2020 seropositive testing shows promise for retrospective understanding of asymptomatic rates disease spread within a population and reinfection risks yongchenet al 2020 however an additional method for real time or near real time tracking of disease spread

causanilleset al 2017 baz lombaet al 2016 van nuijis et al 2011 this approach has promise for better understanding the spread of infectious disease within a population in fact some studies looking at various pathogens with wbe were published prior to the covid 19 pandemic hoviet al 2012 hellmeret al 2014 bisseuxet al 2018 brouweret al 2018 because wastewater sampling captures the aggregated

state of virginia grew to 86 994 during the same time period overall virginia beach saw the greatest number of clinical cases 3 788 while suffolk had the greatest amount of deaths 46 most other cities within the service area reported total cases in the hundreds while smaller communities had totals ranging from 34 poquoson to 518 james city fig 1 a however when normalized to population size there is less of a discrepancy in confirmed case data amongst all the cities and counties fig 1b clinical covid 19 testing for the state of virginia began on march 5 2020 and increased dramatically during the time of this study on the first wastewater sampling date in the present study a total of 69 patients in all of virginia had been tested this increased to 1 180 000 as of july 28th although it is likely that the observed increases documented the active spread of the sars cov 2 virus the inherent confounding influence of increased testing on clinical data should be acknowledged murakami et al 2020 3 2 viral assay performance total surrogate recovery the theoretical limits of detection lod for assays n1 n2 and n3 were 14 6 2 and 2 18 copies per reaction respectively the n2 assay proved to be the most sensitive for our rt ddpcr workflow which is why the n2 assay results were used in subsequent loading analyses and visualizations this was in contrast to others e g lu et al 2020 vogels et al 2020 but is likely due to the matrix and specific rt ddpcr workflows bovine coronavirus bcov and bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv were used to assess recoveries without concentration as well as with concentration using innovaprep and electronegative filtration recoveries of the surrogates without concentration direct extraction of 2 ml samples were 59 14 and 75 13 for bcov and brsv respectively innovaprep with centrifugation workflow total recoveries for bcov and brsv were 5 5 2 1 and 7 6 3 0 respectively electronegative filtration workflow total recoveries for bcov and brsv were 4 8 2 8 and 6 6 3 8 respectively although concentration steps used in both workflows during this study likely resulted in reductions of virus signal concentration was ultimately necessary in order to detect the low viral concentrations documented in the region at the beginning of the study total recoveries were similar across surrogates and workflows therefore results from the entire 21 week study were reported together and without adjustment matrix inhibition of the rt ddpcr assay expressed as recovered hepatitis g spike averaged 50 19 and 9 4 9 4 for innovaprep and electronegative filtration workflows respectively while the total surrogate recoveries were similar for the 2 workflows the innovaprep workflow was less affected by inhibition as seen in the hepatitis g recoveries it is likely that the centrifugation step in the innovaprep workflow removed solids from suspension which resulted in less matrix inhibition but also a lower sars cov 2 signal from particle attached virus losses in contrast the electronegative filtration workflow retained a high percentage of wastewater solids which likely retained particle attached viruses but resulted in greater matrix inhibition as documented by hepatitis g recoveries further dilution of samples was not done to alleviate inhibition seen in some samples to maximize low detections 3 3 assessment of n1 n2 and n3 assays in wastewater at the start of this study the cdc recommended three different assays for sars cov 2 detection n1 n2 and n3 while n1 and n2 were designed specific to sars cov 2 n3 was designed as a more universal assay for the clade 2 and 3 viruses of the sarbecovirus subgenus lu et al 2020 typically environmental microbiology studies use one assay to determine pathogen concentrations in samples e g worley morse et al 2019 rose 2005 to date several sars cov 2 wbe studies have incorporated multiple assays including all three cdc assays e g ahmed et al 2020 medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 wu et al 2020 while others have incorporated alternative assays la rosa et al 2020 kocamemi et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020a 2020b to better understand if future wbe studies should run all three cdc assays we compared detection rates and concentrations among all three throughout the 21 week long study sars cov 2 rna was detected in raw wastewater influent from at least one wwtp on all sample dates even during the first week of sampling when there were only two clinical detections in the region fig 2 a detections were sporadic in the first several weeks of sampling with inconsistent detections among the three assays when estimated raw wastewater concentrations of viral rna were low for all samples n 198 98 had detections for all 3 assays 22 had detections for 2 of the 3 assays and 30 had detections for only 1 assay as total detections increased between march 24th and july 28th agreement among the three assays improved and detections became more consistent across treatment facilities fig 2a the n2 assay proved dominant in detection frequency n 198 with cumulative detections over the 21 week period totaling 107 125 and 113 for assays n1 n2 and n3 respectively there was a statistical difference kruskal wallis chi squared 32 49 p 0 001 in the number of n2 and n3 detections from n1 p 0 001 but no difference between n2 and n3 p 0 26 it should be noted that n1 had fewer detections for all but two of the sample dates most likely due to the higher lod established for this assay fig 2b future work will use a different standard to determine the theoretical lod 3 4 sars cov 2 trends in wastewater over the course of the entire 21 week study sars cov 2 concentrations in positive samples were between 101 and 104 copies 100 ml 1 these concentrations are in line with those documented in australia and turkey ahmed et al 2020 kocamemi et al 2020 sherchan et al 2020 wu et al 2020 studies in spain and france however have documented concentrations that were at least two orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations measured in the present study randazzo et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020b multiple factors could account for these differences including disease prevalence in the study regions efficiency of concentration methods used and variability in pcr based workflows aggregated detection trends for all three assays show both increasing and decreasing occurrence over the course of the 21 week sample period fig 2c samples collected on the first two sample dates march 11th and 16th showed detections at low concentrations at three wwtps all less than 300 copies 100ml 1 a sharp increase in detections was documented between march 16th and march 24th after which a sustained increase in detections was documented over the course of three weeks through april 14th fig 2c during this time between five and seven treatment plants had positive detections with the maximum number of detections on april 6th fig 2c following the peak on april 6th there was a gradual decline in the total number of detections for the subsequent three sampling dates with the smallest number of detections since the peak documented on april 23rd 8 detections fig 2a starting april 28th through the remaining sample dates there was an increase in detections documented most notably in the ab service area where the highest concentrations seen to date were recorded 3 5 service area and regional loading estimates fig 3 shows the range of population normalized loading by date for each wwtp this allows end users to easily visualize specific outbreaks and major trends overall trends increased across all catchments during the study period in addition notable shifts in trends can be seen at several of the wwtps for example in the bh service area there were no detections for the first several months until the last five weeks when loading increased indicating a notable rise in the total number of infected people another example is in the ce service area loadings were consistent from march through mid june after which loading began to trend upwards data presented in fig 3 can also be compared to known outbreaks that were documented by the health department during this study e g one in the wb service area and one in the np service area increases in detection in the wb service area that were documented in mid march were likely caused by an outbreak in james city county which saw a total of 34 people infected within 7 days of sampling based on clinical data the np service area spike in mid april was associated with an isle of wight outbreak that infected a total of 55 people within 7 days of sampling based on clinical data much in the same way these data can be used to identify potential areas where signs of elevated infection are not documented based on clinical data or areas where there may be evidence of reduced infection rates over time for example vip showed increased evidence of infection within the catchment starting in late march followed by a steady decline on the following six sample dates this indicates an increase followed by a drop in cases in the vip service area the capability to observe declining numbers of cases at the sub city scale could prove particularly useful as this information is likely obscured in the clinical testing data future monitoring of the hampton roads wastewater will hopefully provide more evidence of the usefulness of wbe during major declines in the infected population the combination of clinical testing results and wbe data can provide a more complete picture of how the virus and disease are transmitting in the population fig 4 shows spatial data by week in the form of heat maps representing population normalized loading in sampled wwtp catchments only one heat map is shown per month but supplemental video s1 shows an animation of all weeks sampled maps such as these are helpful to spatially visualize the data and identify likely locations for regional outbreaks for example on march 11th evidence of infection was low throughout the entire region however on april 14th there was early evidence of widespread cases in three wb vip np of the nine studied catchments the may 20th panel shows evidence of increased loading at other service areas yr jr while catchments i e np that previously had high loading were reduced june and july highlight the increase and spread of sars cov 2 loading throughout the region and delineate more densely impacted areas spatially displaying population normalized loadings show the irregular outbreak of localized hot spots this demonstrates that while clinically confirmed cases uniformly increase for a city as more testing is completed the actual viral spread is likely more heterogeneous being heavily influenced by local outbreaks thus wbe has the potential to target where more localized clinical testing might be needed to fully understand sporadic hotspots that are likely to emerge as the covid 19 pandemic wanes fig 5 shows regional loading estimates over time wbe instantaneous loading data from all 9 wwtp catchments were combined weekly to estimate instantaneous regional loading the hampton roads regional loading estimates mirror the trends in catchment level population normalized loading starting in mid june there is an obvious significant inflection upwards in loading corresponding with the virginia phase reopenings the late march to mid april increase in loading prior to the stay at home was evident as well as the small decline and plateau in loading before the phase reopenings the rising limb of regional loading could be incorporated into analyses of clinical testing data to determine the extent to which increases in clinical detection are simply a product of increased testing future work will also examine the lead lag association between hampton roads sars cov 2 wastewater data and regional confirmed clinical data 4 conclusion it is important that public health officials have an array of reliable data sources available to them when making regional decisions clinical datasets can be inherently biased depending on various factors including patient screening prior to testing testing supply limitations and how invasive and or unpleasant testing is for patients wbe methods are often less impacted by these types of sample collection biasbut may incorporate uncertainly associated with temporal and spatial variations in molecular signals within the sewer decay of nucleic acids and rainfall impacts on overall load measurements here we propose methods for analyzing and presenting wbe data so that it can be used in concert with clinical results to provide a more complete picture for community officials funding this work was supported by hampton roads sanitation district and the

17513,degradation of betrixaban an oral anticoagulant recently approved by the u s food and drug administration fda and its n nitrosodimethylamine ndma formation potential were studied mechanistically in the presence of monochloramine nh2cl free chlorine and ozone upon monochloramination the formation of ndma exceeded 1 at basic ph and was significant at circumneutral ph as well the kinetic studies revealed that the reaction between betrixaban and monochloramine followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics increasing monochloramine concentration its reaction time and ph all significantly enhanced the ndma formation yield which also increased three fold in the presence of bromide during monochloraminantion the presence of nitrite inhibited the formation of ndma under the same conditions this study revealed a new potent and significant precursor of ndma indicating that monochloramination of waters containing betrixaban can lead to the formation of ndma and other disinfection by products such as dichloroacetonitrile dcan and dimethylformamide dmf moreover chlorination of betrixaban by hypochlorite also yielded ndma albeit at two orders of magnitude lower yield than chloramination while no ndma formation was observed from ozonation of betrixaban graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords betrixaban ndma formation monochloramination chlorination ozonation kinetics 1 introduction the disinfection process is practised during water treatment for inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms furthermore the disinfectant residual should be maintained at a sufficient level in the water distribution system to prevent the unwanted microbial regrowth ding et al 2019 however most commonly used disinfectants such as free chlorine monochloramine chlorine dioxide and ozone can generate disinfection by products dbps due to the reaction with various dissolved constituents in water ding et al 2019 to minimize the formation of dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acid haa and to meet drinking water regulations many drinking water treatment plants have switched from free chlorine to monochloramine as a residual disinfectant although chloramines yield less amount of conventional dbps they can form nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps at a higher yield than other disinfectants due to the presence of nitrogen in their structures mitch et al 2003 roux et al 2012 xu et al 2012 in the last two decades considerable attention has been drawn to n nitrosamines and other n dbps due to their carcinogenicity mutagenicity and teratogenicity padhye et al 2011 n dbps have also been found to exhibit more toxicity than carbonaceous dbps c dbps plewa et al 2008 wu et al 2016 n nitrosodimethylamine ndma the most commonly detected member of the nitrosamines group can be formed during chlorination chloramination and ozonation of drinking water and wastewater lv et al 2017 padhye et al 2011 spahr et al 2017 the guideline value for ndma in drinking water was set at 100 ng l by the world health organisation who hatt et al 2013 ndma is also listed in the u s epa s contaminant candidate list 4 su et al 2017 the oxidation of amine containing organic compounds has been identified as the main source of ndma spahr et al 2017 hence many studies have been conducted on ndma precursors including their screening identification and characterization krasner et al 2013 there are various nitrosamine precursors such as secondary tertiary and quaternary amines leavey roback et al 2016 among which secondary amines such as dimethylamine dma are considered as the direct nitrosamine precursors spahr et al 2017 different sources of ndma precursors including pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps mitch and sedlak 2002b shen and andrews 2011 2013 song et al 2017 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 and pesticides bei et al 2016 padhye et al 2013 have been already studied recently the focus on ppcps containing dma moieties is expanding lv et al 2017 as more and more ppcps are frequently detected in all compartments of the aqueous environment padhye et al 2014 in this study betrixaban was selected due to its recent approval by the u s fda and because of its molecular structure which contains an aryl amidinyl moiety with dimethylamine group fig 1 betrixaban was approved in 2017 by the u s fda as an anticoagulant drug to be used in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism vte in adult patients hospitalized for an acute medical illness the fda s approval of this pharmaceutical is considered as a huge step forward for the treatment of the prophylaxis of vte in patients chan et al 2015 traynor 2017 the fact that betrixaban has the potential of being used in wide scale applications in treatment leading to its environmental presence generates a need to understand its fate in the environment its high water solubility 2 7 mg ml and established stability under light and heat mean that it will persist longer in the aqueous environment and during conventional water and wastewater treatments ema 2018 further significant release of betrixaban in the aquatic environment is expected considering its increased use through an increasing number of prescriptions its low bioavailability longest half life within human body among all anticoagulants excretion through urine as well as feces and the high dosage requirements for patients 80 160 mg day for 35 40 days skelley et al 2018 according to the european medicines agency it is predicted that betrixaban will be detected even in surface waters and the detailed environmental risk assessment is required ema 2018 there is no prior research conducted on the fate of betrixaban in the environment as such its removal or degradation during water wastewater treatment has not been studied however considering its increased use through an increasing number of prescriptions and the high dosage prescribed for patients it is expected to be present in the aqueous environment and particularly in surface waters ema 2018 the primary aim of this study was to investigate the fate of betrixaban during the disinfection process in the presence of commonly used water and wastewater disinfectants and to investigate its ndma formation potential the secondary objective was to investigate reaction kinetics and reaction mechanism of ndma formation during chloramination as monochloramine was found to yield the highest amount of ndma upon oxidation of betrixaban 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents betrixaban was purchased from medkoo biosciences inc u s ndma 99 9 purity methylamine ma solution in methanol 2 m dma hydrochloride 99 dichloromethane gc ms grade benzenesulfonyl chloride acetonitrile sodium bromide nabr sodium nitrite nano2 and methanol hplc ms grade were purchased from sigma aldrich new zealand ammonium formate sigma aldrich 99 purity was used to prepare the lc ms ms eluent ammonium chloride nh4cl sigma aldrich 99 5 purity sodium hypochlorite naocl solution sigma aldrich reagent grade available chlorine 4 4 99 and sodium hydroxide naoh sigma aldrich 98 pellets were used for the preparation of monochloramine nh2cl disodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 and potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 both from sigma aldrich were used to prepare phosphate buffer solutions ascorbic acid sigma aldrich was used to quench excess monochloramine and the excess chlorine and ozone were quenched by sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 sigma aldrich ultra pure water was obtained from a millipore milli q water system resistivity 18 2 mω cm all other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and commercially available 2 2 experimental procedure a stock solution of betrixaban 1 mm was prepared in methanol and stored in an amber glass bottle in the freezer 20 c until use the samples were diluted to 8 5 µm of the initial concentration of betrixaban the experiments were conducted with 6 12 60 120 240 and 600 fold excess of nh2cl at a ph range of 5 9 and reaction times of 3 h to 10 days respectively for studying the effects of concentration ph and contact time of monochloramination reactions the effects of bromide and nitrite ions on ndma formation were investigated by adding 1 mm sodium bromide and nitrite before monochloramination these concentrations were selected to form detectable levels of disinfection by products and hence to better understand reaction mechanisms experiments were conducted in 200 ml amber colored borosilicate glass bottles to exclude potential light interference to prevent betrixaban loss through hydrolysis the diluted solution of betrixaban was freshly prepared for each experiment the desired volume of nh2cl stock solution was spiked in buffered milli q solution to initiate the reaction all bottles were on the shaker 140 rpm for the duration of the reaction at pre selected time intervals the residual oxidant was quenched with excess ascorbic acid or sodium thiosulfate all batch experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 c from each sample 1 ml aliquot was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms to quantify betrixaban concentration two ml aliquot was also used for quantification of ma and dma by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms the rest of the sample was used for ndma analysis by gc ms all experiments were carried out in duplicates error bars in all the figures indicate the maximum and minimum measurements 2 3 chlorination and monochloramination experiments chlorination samples were prepared by dilution of the 4 5 naocl stock solution and stored at 4 c for use within 24 h monochloramine stock solution was prepared freshly before each experiment by dropwise addition of hypochlorite aliquots to freshly prepared monochloramine solutions at a cl n molar ratio of 0 8 with continuous stirring at ph 8 as per the standard methods clesceri et al 2005 then it was stirred for 30 min in the amber bottle and stored in a dark place this stock solution was used for experiments within one day padhye et al 2013 as specified in the standard methods the final concentrations of free chlorine and monochloramine were determined by n n diethyl p phenylenediamine ferrous ammonium sulfate dpd fas titration prior to each experiment clesceri et al 2005 2 4 ozonation experiments ozone was generated by a corona discharge n 300 ozonator novozone auckland new zealand fed by ultra high purity oxygen a stock solution of dissolved ozone was prepared in a 200 ml milli q water in amber borosilicate bottle with teflon lined cap for the immediate use the ozone concentration was determined by the indigo colorimetric method specified in standard methods clesceri et al 2005 uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2700 at 600 nm was used to measure the absorbance owing to the decolorization of indigo trisulfonate resulting from its reaction with ozone after knowing the exact concentration of the stock of the ozonated water it was diluted to the desired concentration immediately as ozone decays rapidly 2 5 analysis of betrixaban and other reaction by products the residual concentrations of betrixaban were analyzed using lc ms ms shimadzu japan the details of the method are published elsewhere jasemizad and padhye 2019 text s1 of the supporting information concentrations of ndma in samples were analyzed following the u s epa method 521 clesceri et al 2005 munch and bassett 2004a b with some modifications samples were pre concentrated by solid phase extraction spe using superclean coconut charcoal cartridges 2 g 6 cm3 supelco and then analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms shimadzu japan with a capillary column hp 5 30 m 0 25 mm i d 0 25 µm film thickness u s additional details regarding spe and ndma analysis on gc ms can be found in text s1 ndma molar yield was calculated using the initial molar concentration of betrixaban betrixaban 0 following eq 1 le roux et al 2011 selbes et al 2018 1 ndma yield ndma formed nm betrixaban 0 nm 100 ma and dma were analyzed by a method involving derivatization with benzenesulfonyl chloride and then gc ms analysis padhye et al 2009 text s1 to identify the reaction intermediates and other end products the samples at different contact times ph and nh2cl dosages were analyzed in the ms scan mode on lc ms ms furthermore remaining by products were identified by injecting the samples into the gc ms and analyzing in the tic mode 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of monochloramine dosage betrixaban has not been evaluated for ndma formation potential by water disinfectants however previous studies have reported that monochloramination of some organic compounds with secondary amine moieties can form nitrosamines padhye et al 2013 roux et al 2012 shen and andrews 2011 the formation of ndma as a function of monochloramine dosage at a fixed betrixaban concentration was assessed to evaluate ndma formation potential of betrixaban upon monochloramination ndma formation from betrixaban equilibrated at ph 7 5 at 25 c for seven days increased from 2 3 to 25 2 nm upon increasing the monochloramine concentration from 0 05 to 5 mm fig 2 results revealed that ndma formation potential was correlated with monochloramine dosage this observation is in accordance with the results of similar studies on monochloramination of ndma precursors such as dma choi and valentine 2002 trimethylamine diethylamine dipropylamine ethylmethylamine 3 dimethylaminomethyl indole 4 dimethylaminoantipyrine west et al 2016 chlortoluron xu et al 2012 and dithiocarbamate pesticides padhye et al 2013 choi and valentine 2002 also observed an enhanced ndma formation by increasing the concentration of nh2cl to a secondarily treated wastewater at neutral ph demonstrating that this is indeed an environmentally relevant ndma formation pathway correspondingly the final betrixaban concentration percentage of betrixaban remaining in the system after seven days decreased from approximately 4 µm 50 to 1 µm 14 by increasing the dosage of monochloramine from 0 05 to 5 mm fig 2 the formation of ndma and degradation of betrixaban appeared to reach an apparent plateau after addition of 2 mm monochloramine the results indicated that at higher nh2cl concentration ndma formation only slightly increased from 0 25 with 2 mm nh2cl to 0 3 with 5 mm nh2cl which was consistent with the observed low residual betrixaban concentrations results were also consistent with 24 h monochloramination of dma where ndma formation was also shown to reach a plateau at higher nh2cl dma ratio 2 0 1 choi and valentine 2002 moreover wang et al 2013 also observed a similar effect upon the chloramination of raw water containing 3 21 mg l of dissolved organic carbon doc at ph 8 when nh2cl concentration was greater than 15 mg l the authors suggested that this phenomenon can be due to complete exhaustion of the ndma precursors in the raw water after reaction with more than 15 mg l monochloramine 3 2 effect of chloramination time to study the influence of monochloramination time on the formation of ndma from betrixaban 2 mm preformed monochloramine was added to betrixaban solutions at ph 7 5 fig 3 a shows the effect of different contact times on ndma formation and betrixaban degradation ndma concentrations increased rapidly at the beginning of the reaction and slowed down after five days whereas the concentration of betrixaban levelled off after seven days approximately 23 nm ndma was formed after ten days from the reaction of betrixaban and monochloramine as can be seen from fig 3a there was no change in the concentration of betrixaban and no ndma formation was observed in control samples at different contact times chen and young 2008 investigated the formation of ndma from the reaction of diuron 0 09 mm with naocl 3 45 mm and nh3 4 1 mm they found a steady increase in ndma concentrations at the beginning of the reaction up to 10 days at ph 8 the authors stated that a higher ndma formation in their study was the result of a longer contact time similarly xu et al 2012 who investigated chloramination of chlortoluron 94 µm with 2 mm nh2cl reported an increase in the formation of ndma from approximately 4 to 23 µg l by increasing the reaction time from 12 h to 10 days respectively residual concentrations of monochloramine were also measured at the end of the reaction and the trend of monochloramine depletion was found to be consistent with ndma formation fig 3b monochloramine concentration decreased from 2 mm to about 0 015 mm after 10 days similar chloramine decay was observed for control samples the results showed that having excess monochloramine 2 mm causes a relatively rapid ndma formation roux et al 2012 investigated the degradation of 12 μm ranitidine in the presence of an excess of nh2cl 2 5 mm at ph 8 over 48 h and found that ndma yield was maximum under such conditions 3 3 kinetic studies many studies have shown that the reaction between monochloramine and organic compounds follows pseudo first order kinetics chamberlain and adams 2006 spahr et al 2017 wan et al 2013 in the presence of excess about 6 to 600 fold of monochloramine the reactions exhibit a pseudo first order kinetic dependence on the precursor concentration fig 4 represents the pseudo first order kinetics for betrixaban degradation with 2 mm monochloramine at ph 7 5 as can be seen there was strong linearity r 2 0 99 for the log curve which indicated a first order reaction the pseudo first order rate constant kobs 0 01 hr 1 was found from the slope of the plot in the c c0 vs time coordinates according to the equation lv and li 2018 2 ln c c 0 k obs t where c0 and c are the initial and current concentrations of betrixaban respectively while kobs is the pseudo first order rate constant of betrixaban degradation 3 4 effect of ph to assess the influence of ph on the ndma formation experiments were conducted with betrixaban and 2 mm monochloramine with a contact time of seven days and the results are presented in fig 5 results revealed that ndma concentration increased from 7 nm to 88 nm by increasing the ph from 5 to 9 furthermore the observed degradation of betrixaban increased from 53 at ph 5 to 95 degradation at ph 9 betrixaban degradation and ndma formation were both favored at basic ph hence ndma formation was found to be correlated with betrixaban decomposition ndma formation from monochloramination of betrixaban exhibited a maximum yield of 1 1 at ph 9 this is higher than with the majority of the ndma precursors studied to date table s1 the observed ndma yield trend with ph was found to be different than in most of the studies reported with ndma precursors mitch and sedlak 2002b showed that the maximum ndma formation rate from dma was between ph 7 and 8 similarly padhye et al 2013 found that ndma formation from monochloramination of dithiocarbamates was highest near ph 7 5 to 8 le roux et al 2011 investigated the formation of ndma from several tertiary amines ranitidine 3 µm revealed the highest molar conversion to ndma upon monochloramination with 2 5 mm concentration of nh2cl at ph 8 and five days of contact time in another study shen and andrews 2013 investigated the role of ph dependency on the ndma formation from 25 nm ranitidine and sumatriptan by 2 5 mg l chloramine they found that ph affected the ndma formation and the reaction kinetics furthermore the maximum formation of ndma was near ph 7 8 in contrast chen and young 2008 demonstrated that ndma formation from chloramination of diuron had a maximum yield at ph 4 it is reported that the maximum ndma yield generally occurs at a ph approximately 1 2 1 6 units lower than the pka of the precursor amine group shen and andrews 2013 consistent with that hypothesis the chloramination of betrixaban with pka of 11 63 harshalatha et al 2018 yielded highest ndma formation at most basic ph used in this study ph 9 according to valentine and jafvert 1988 monochloramine s self decomposition through hydrolysis at ph less than 8 leads to the formation of dichloramine nhcl2 which is considered responsible for the formation of ndma from dma schreiber and mitch 2006 in the present study nhcl2 does not seem to play a role in the formation of ndma since at ph lower than 7 when nhcl2 dominates the formation of ndma is not significant ndma formation from betrixaban at ph 9 when nh2cl dominates was an order of magnitude higher than at ph 5 when nhcl2 dominates indicating that the formation of ndma can be strongly correlated to monochloramine concentration in the solution the study by le roux et al 2011 had a similar finding which led them to conclude that nhcl2 was not responsible for ndma formation from ranitidine 3 5 effect of bromide and nitrite on ndma formation bromide and nitrite influence on ndma formation has been studied in the literature as these are commonly occurring anions in the drinking water and wastewater in this study the influence of bromide 1 mm and nitrite 1 mm on the yield of ndma was assessed by performing the experiments at 8 5 µm of betrixaban and 2 mm monochloramine at ph 7 5 for 24 h contact time fig 6 presents the resulting ndma yield and concentrations nm from monochloramination of betrixaban in the presence and the absence of these anions in the absence of nh2cl for control samples no ndma formation was observed moreover compared to the results obtained in the absence of bromide 0 13 yield or 10 8 nm ndma monochloramination of betrixaban in the presence of bromide resulted in a seven fold increase in the concentration of ndma 0 92 yield or 78 nm a significant amount of dma 3 4 or 300 nm was detected after monochloramination of betrixaban in the absence of the bromide the increase in the concentration of dma suggested the degradation of betrixaban releasing dma in comparison only a trace amount of dma 0 45 or 40 nm was detected in the presence of bromide meanwhile in the presence of bromide the concentration of methylamine ma during chloramination of betrixaban was almost double 6 2 or 500 nm than that in the control samples without bromide 2 9 or 250 nm moreover monochloramination of betrixaban revealed almost similar level of degradation for betrixaban 82 in the presence and absence of bromide figure s1 in supplementary information hence we hypothesized that in the presence of bromide most of the released dma could be converted to ndma the higher ndma formation in the presence of bromide can be explained by the generation of bromochloramine nhbrcl with a higher electronegativity of the brominated nitrogen atom than that in nh2cl which results in the rapid nucleophilic substitution with dma beita sandí et al 2020 luh and mariñas 2012 found that the presence of bromide enhanced ndma formation at the relatively high ph 8 and 9 after 24 h reaction time by monochloramination of dma however ndma formation from dma was lower at ph 6 7 in the presence of bromide compared to that in the absence of bromide in another study valentine et al 2005 showed that in the presence of 0 2 mm bromide and 0 1 mm monochloramine an enhancement in ndma formation from dma was observed at ph ranging from 3 5 to 11 after 24 h contact time with maximum yield at ph 8 5 opposite to the bromide effect herein ndma formation decreased in the presence of nitrite the concentration of ndma 0 01 or 1 nm was reduced by an order of magnitude by the addition of nitrite moreover a reduced amount of dma 1 2 or 100 nm was detected during chloramination of betrixaban in nitrite containing samples this can be explained by the observed lower degradation of betrixaban in the presence of nitrite 65 than in its absence 82 figure s1 furthermore the methylamine concentration in chloraminated samples with nitrite was higher than in the absence of monochloramine the observed reduction in ndma formation by nitrite is hypothesized to be partly due to the loss of significant amounts of nh2cl since nitrite is expected to react with monochloramine and generate nitrate and ammonium ions in stoichiometric ratio and therefore acts as an inhibitor of ndma formation reactions during monochloramination choi and valentine 2003 seid et al 2018 xu et al 2012 and seid et al 2018 had reported a similar inhibitory effect of nitrite on ndma formation during monochloramination of chlortoluron and ranitidine respectively 3 6 by products of betrixaban monochloramination samples of the monochloramination of betrixaban were analysed by gc ms for the identification of by products the results are shown in table 1 no other nitrosamines apart from ndma were detected during monochloramination of betrixaban two other by products were identified from the reaction of betrixaban with monochloramine dimethyl formamide dmf and dichloroacetonitrile dcan furthermore bromoform chbr3 was detected for samples with bromide the generation of dmf le roux et al 2011 mitch and sedlak 2002b and dcan xu et al 2012 yang et al 2010 has been reported previously during chlorination and monochloramination of organic compounds le roux et al 2011 reported dmf and dcan as by products of the monochloramination of diuron and ranitidine in another study the formation of dcan by tetracycline oxytetracycline chlortetracycline and doxycycline degradation was found to be higher for chloramination than chlorination zhou et al 2014 yang et al 2010 also found dcan formation during chloramination of several nitrogenous organic compounds including cysteine cytosine glutamic acid and tryptophan likewise the formation of brominated species of thms such as bromoform during chlorination or chloramination of bromide containing waters has been reported in the literature hua and reckhow 2008 le roux et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 the gc ms chromatogram of ndma dcan and dmf are shown in the supplementary information si figure s2 spectra of the by products monitored by gc ms are presented in the supplementary information si figure s3 the concentration of betrixaban decreased gradually during monochloramination as betrixaban transformed into reaction intermediates and end products including ndma the samples were analysed for unknown m z peaks through lc ms ms for hydrophilic intermediates and end products table 1 summarizes the detected m z of the intermediates on lc ms ms from the reaction of betrixaban with monochloramine under different conditions the lc ms ms spectra of the monochloraminated betrixaban solution at ph 9 after seven days of contact time at 1 87 1 249 and 1 32 min retention time are shown in the supplementary information si figure s4 3 7 ndma formation pathways from betrixaban during monochloramination betrixaban molecule possesses a n n dimethylbenzamidinyl two aryl amide and a 3 chloropyridinyl moieties all of which could be a source of nitrogen for the eventual formation of ndma upon betrixaban s hydrolysis and chloroamination induced degradation the n n dimethylbenzamidinyl group belongs to arylimidamides with somewhat lower pka values than many typical aromatic amidines with pka values as high as 11 and above oszczapowicz and krawczyk 1989 soeiro et al 2013 hence it is generally less charged and exhibits better bioavailability which rationalizes its presence in betrixaban nevertheless this group is quite prone to the hydrolytic reactions under mild aqueous conditions clearly the pathway of the reactive alkyl arylaminidinyl group degradation typically producing n alkyl arylamine depending on the amidinyl structure is likely to dominate the ndma producing degradation routes of betrixaban halliday and symons 1978 the hydrolytic degradation with concomitant monochloramination of betrixaban is depicted in fig 7 chloramine reacts with the dimethylamidine group via nucleophilic substitution reaction calvo et al 2007 and the resulting intermediate undergoes facile hydrolysis with the formation of dimethylamine which consequently results in the ndma detected in our experiments mechanistic aspects of the amidine hydrolysis have been studied in detail in the literature jia et al 2017 dimethylchloramine the product of the amidinyl group hydrolysis is likely to rapidly exchange chlorine with the amide product of betrixaban darwich et al 2009 higuchi and hasegawa 1965 forming dimethylamine dma facile formation of ndma from dma upon chloramination is well documented mitch and sedlak 2002a of note hydrolysis of betrixaban in the absence of monochloramine within the range of ph studied is retarded whereas the nucleophilic attack of h2o on the cn double bond jia et al 2017 is promoted by the presence of monochloramine the formation of ndma can be further augmented by the chloramination induced formation of hypochlorite ion which is known to n chlorinate the aromatic amides leading to the orton rearrangement ring chlorination and subsequent n c scission chloramination and oxidation these processes can eventually produce ndma especially when monochloramine is present in excess during chloramination nh2cl can serve as another n source the presence of amide groups explains the observed higher yield of ndma from betrixaban compared to the values reported in the literature for dma the possible ndma formation pathway from the oxidation of dma was suggested by a reaction between nh2cl and organic amine precursors choi and valentine 2002 mitch and sedlak 2002b the revised ndma pathway proposed by schreiber and mitch 2006 suggested the reaction of secondary amine precursors with traces of nhcl2 formed via disproportionation of nh2cl followed by a chlorinated unsymmetrical dialkylhydrazine intermediate cl udmh generation due to nucleophilic attack of unprotonated secondary amines on nhcl2 subsequently the oxidation of cl udmh in the presence of dissolved oxygen yields ndma and other by products the possible reaction pathway in the presence of bromide as proposed by le roux et al 2012 and chen et al 2010 is the reaction of dma moiety of betrixaban with bromaminated oxidant species such as nhbrcl and therefore the formation of udmh br which would subsequently oxidise into ndma and other by products such as bromoform the larger amount of ndma formed in the presence of bromide can be attributed to the formation of nhbrcl with higher reactivity than nh2cl and also a weaker n br bond in udmh br than n cl bond which leads to the higher amount of the udmh br intermediate as compared to cl udmh this increase in ndma formation is more significant at high ph values and in waters containing elevated concentrations of bromide 500 µg l sgroi et al 2018 in the presence of nitrite nh2cl available for reaction with dma reduces due to reacting with nitrite and hence reduced available nh2cl results in lower ndma formation seid et al 2018 no2 may intervene not only with the initial attack of monochloramine and the reaction intermediates formation but also with the further transformation of the reaction intermediates similar to our observations mitch and sedlack 2002b also reported a decrease in ndma formation from monochloramination of dma in the presence of nitrite 3 8 chlorination and ozonation the degradation of betrixaban with 8 5 µm initial concentration at ph 7 5 was observed to be approximately 100 by chlorination with 5 mm free chlorine over seven days the concentration of ndma formed under chlorination was only 1 2 nm yield 0 014 hence ndma yield from monochloramination was found to be an order of magnitude higher than under chlorination which is in agreement with the results reported in the literature for most ndma precursors the higher yield of ndma during monochloramination can be explained by the presence of one more n in monochloramine s structure which provides an additional nitrogen atom for the nitroso group in ndma xu et al 2012 the other by product detected during chlorination of betrixaban was dmf jasemizad and padhye 2020 the degradation of betrixaban was also studied by high 2 mm and low 0 1 mm dosages of chlorine and exhibited almost 100 degradation even after a brief contact time of lower than two minutes this indicated that the reaction between chlorine and betrixaban occurred almost instantaneously for ozonation the degradation of betrixaban with 15 mg l ozone concentration at ph 7 5 increased from about 40 after 1 min to almost complete degradation after 6 min figure s5a in the supplementary information si this indicated that ozone is also effective in the removal of betrixaban at fairly low values of residual disinfectant concentration disinfectant contact time c t due to the fast reaction between betrixaban and ozone the reaction kinetics was studied from 1 to 6 min which fitted well with pseudo first order reaction r 2 0 98 figure s5b in the supplementary information si similar reaction kinetics during ozonation of organic compounds have been reported lv and li 2018 lv et al 2017 lv et al 2015 however ndma was not detected during ozonation of betrixaban the only product detected by ozonation of betrixaban was dmf jasemizad and padhye 2020 more discussion has been provided in text s2 si 4 conclusions betrixaban was found to be a potent ndma precursor and its potential to form ndma was examined in depth in this study with respect to monochloramine dosage monochloramine exposure time and ph betrixaban degradation and ndma formation were enhanced by increasing each of the above mentioned parameters consistent with the literature the results of our study also showed that the presence of bromide enhanced the formation of ndma during betrixaban monochloramination whereas nitrite inhibited its formation other by products generated during monochloramination were dmf and dcan while bromoform was detected in the presence of bromide betrixaban may be removed or degraded by different treatment mechanisms in conventional drinking water or wastewater treatment facilities therefore the potential removal of betrixaban must be taken into account before disinfection treatment in order to correctly determine its health risk in terms of ndma formation potential however some betrixaban is expected to pass through conventional water and wastewater treatment especially considering its high water solubility and resistance to photolysis or may come in contact with oxidants in effluents from medical facilities in such cases our study results demonstrate that even small amounts of betrixaban can lead to significant ndma formation upon monochloramination given its relatively high yield environmentally relevant concentrations of betrixaban are still not ascertained and since there is not enough information about the environmental fate of betrixaban it is difficult to predict overall ndma contribution by betrixaban in the current environment however as the use of betrixaban will widen and its presence in surface waters and wastewaters will increase ndma formation risks in the environment will also increase our study highlights these risks and through the detailed study of contributing factors kinetics and reaction mechanism provides useful information to mitigate such

17513,degradation of betrixaban an oral anticoagulant recently approved by the u s food and drug administration fda and its n nitrosodimethylamine ndma formation potential were studied mechanistically in the presence of monochloramine nh2cl free chlorine and ozone upon monochloramination the formation of ndma exceeded 1 at basic ph and was significant at circumneutral ph as well the kinetic studies revealed that the reaction between betrixaban and monochloramine followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics increasing monochloramine concentration its reaction time and ph all significantly enhanced the ndma formation yield which also increased three fold in the presence of bromide during monochloraminantion the presence of nitrite inhibited the formation of ndma under the same conditions this study revealed a new potent and significant precursor of ndma indicating that monochloramination of waters containing betrixaban can lead to the formation of ndma and other disinfection by products such as dichloroacetonitrile dcan and dimethylformamide dmf moreover chlorination of betrixaban by hypochlorite also yielded ndma albeit at two orders of magnitude lower yield than chloramination while no ndma formation was observed from ozonation of betrixaban graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords betrixaban ndma formation monochloramination chlorination ozonation kinetics 1 introduction the disinfection process is practised during water treatment for inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms furthermore the disinfectant residual should be maintained at a sufficient level in the water distribution system to prevent the unwanted microbial regrowth ding et al 2019 however most commonly used disinfectants such as free chlorine monochloramine chlorine dioxide and ozone can generate disinfection by products dbps due to the reaction with various dissolved constituents in water ding et al 2019 to minimize the formation of dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acid haa and to meet drinking water regulations many drinking water treatment plants have switched from free chlorine to monochloramine as a residual disinfectant although chloramines yield less amount of conventional dbps they can form nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps at a higher yield than other disinfectants due to the presence of nitrogen in their structures mitch et al 2003 roux et al 2012 xu et al 2012 in the last two decades considerable attention has been drawn to n nitrosamines and other n dbps due to their carcinogenicity mutagenicity and teratogenicity padhye et al 2011 n dbps have also been found to exhibit more toxicity than carbonaceous dbps c dbps plewa et al 2008 wu et al 2016 n nitrosodimethylamine ndma the most commonly detected member of the nitrosamines group can be formed during chlorination chloramination and ozonation of drinking water and wastewater lv et al 2017 padhye et al 2011 spahr et al 2017 the guideline value for ndma in drinking water was set at 100 ng l by the world health organisation who hatt et al 2013 ndma is also listed in the u s epa s contaminant candidate list 4 su et al 2017 the oxidation of amine containing organic compounds has been identified as the main source of ndma spahr et al 2017 hence many studies have been conducted on ndma precursors including their screening identification and characterization krasner et al 2013 there are various nitrosamine precursors such as secondary tertiary and quaternary amines leavey roback et al 2016 among which secondary amines such as dimethylamine dma are considered as the direct nitrosamine precursors spahr et al 2017 different sources of ndma precursors including pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps mitch and sedlak

moieties is expanding lv et al 2017 as more and more ppcps are frequently detected in all compartments of the aqueous environment padhye et al 2014 in this study betrixaban was selected due to its recent approval by the u s fda and because of its molecular structure which contains an aryl amidinyl moiety with dimethylamine group fig 1 betrixaban was approved in 2017 by the u s fda as an anticoagulant drug to be used in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism vte in adult patients hospitalized for an acute medical illness the fda s approval of this pharmaceutical is considered as a huge step forward for the treatment of the prophylaxis of vte in patients chan et al 2015 traynor 2017 the fact that betrixaban has the potential of being used in wide scale applications in treatment leading to its environmental presence generates a need to understand its fate in the environment its high water solubility 2 7 mg ml and established stability under light and heat mean that it will persist longer in the aqueous environment and during conventional water and wastewater treatments ema 2018 further significant release of betrixaban in the aquatic environment is expected considering its increased use through an increasing number of prescriptions its low bioavailability longest half life within human body among all anticoagulants excretion through urine as well as feces and the high dosage requirements for patients 80 160 mg day for 35 40 days skelley et al 2018 according to the european medicines agency it is predicted that betrixaban will be detected even in surface waters and the detailed environmental risk assessment is required ema 2018 there is no prior research conducted on the fate of betrixaban in the environment as such its removal or degradation during water wastewater treatment has not been studied however considering its increased use through an increasing number of prescriptions and the high dosage prescribed for patients it is expected to be present in the aqueous environment and particularly in surface waters ema 2018 the primary aim of this study was to investigate the fate of betrixaban during the disinfection process in the presence of commonly used water and wastewater disinfectants and to investigate its ndma formation potential the secondary objective was to investigate reaction kinetics and reaction mechanism of ndma formation during chloramination as monochloramine was found to yield the highest amount of ndma upon oxidation of betrixaban 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents betrixaban was purchased from medkoo biosciences inc u s ndma 99 9 purity methylamine ma solution in methanol 2 m dma hydrochloride 99 dichloromethane gc ms grade benzenesulfonyl chloride acetonitrile sodium bromide nabr sodium nitrite nano2 and methanol hplc ms grade were purchased from sigma aldrich new zealand ammonium formate sigma aldrich 99 purity was used to prepare the lc ms ms eluent ammonium chloride nh4cl sigma aldrich 99 5 purity sodium hypochlorite naocl solution sigma aldrich reagent grade available chlorine 4 4 99 and sodium hydroxide naoh sigma aldrich 98 pellets were used for the preparation of monochloramine nh2cl disodium hydrogen phosphate na2hpo4 and potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 both from sigma aldrich were used to prepare phosphate buffer solutions ascorbic acid sigma aldrich was used to quench excess monochloramine and the excess chlorine and ozone were quenched by sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 sigma aldrich ultra pure water was obtained from a millipore milli q water system resistivity 18 2 mω cm all other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and commercially available 2 2 experimental procedure a stock solution of betrixaban 1 mm was prepared in methanol and stored in an amber glass bottle in the freezer 20 c until use the samples were diluted to 8 5 µm of the initial concentration of betrixaban the experiments were conducted with 6 12 60 120 240 and 600 fold excess of nh2cl at a ph range of 5 9 and reaction times of 3 h to 10 days respectively for studying the effects of concentration ph and contact time of monochloramination reactions the effects of bromide and nitrite ions on ndma formation were investigated by adding 1 mm sodium bromide and nitrite before monochloramination these concentrations were selected to form detectable levels of disinfection by products and hence to better understand reaction mechanisms experiments were conducted in 200 ml amber colored borosilicate glass bottles to exclude potential light interference to prevent betrixaban loss through hydrolysis the diluted solution of betrixaban was freshly prepared for each experiment the desired volume of nh2cl stock solution was spiked in buffered milli q solution to initiate the reaction all bottles were on the shaker 140 rpm for the duration of the reaction at pre selected time intervals the residual oxidant was quenched with excess ascorbic acid or sodium thiosulfate all batch experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 c from each sample 1 ml aliquot was analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms to quantify betrixaban concentration two ml aliquot was also used for quantification of ma and dma by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms the rest of the sample was used for ndma analysis by gc ms all experiments were carried out in duplicates error bars in all the figures indicate the maximum and minimum measurements 2 3 chlorination and monochloramination experiments chlorination samples were prepared by dilution of the 4 5 naocl stock solution and stored at 4 c for use within 24 h monochloramine stock solution was prepared freshly before each experiment by dropwise addition of hypochlorite aliquots to freshly prepared monochloramine solutions at a cl n molar ratio of 0 8 with continuous stirring at ph 8 as per the standard methods clesceri et al 2005 then it was stirred for 30 min in the amber bottle and stored in a dark place this stock solution was used for experiments within one day padhye et al 2013 as specified in the standard methods the final concentrations of free chlorine and monochloramine were determined by n n diethyl p phenylenediamine ferrous ammonium sulfate dpd fas titration prior to each experiment clesceri et al 2005 2 4 ozonation experiments ozone was generated by a corona discharge n 300 ozonator novozone auckland new zealand fed by ultra high purity oxygen a stock solution of dissolved ozone was prepared in a 200 ml milli q water in amber borosilicate bottle with teflon lined cap for the immediate use the ozone concentration was determined by the indigo colorimetric method specified in standard methods clesceri et al 2005 uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2700 at 600 nm was used to measure the absorbance owing to the decolorization of indigo trisulfonate resulting from its reaction with ozone after knowing the exact concentration of the stock of the ozonated water it was diluted to the desired concentration immediately as ozone decays rapidly 2 5 analysis of betrixaban and other reaction by products the residual concentrations of betrixaban were analyzed using lc ms ms shimadzu japan the details of the method are published elsewhere jasemizad and padhye 2019 text s1 of the supporting information concentrations of ndma in samples were analyzed following the u s epa method 521 clesceri et al 2005 munch and bassett 2004a b with some modifications samples were pre concentrated by solid phase

betrixaban betrixaban 0 following eq 1 le roux et al 2011 selbes et al 2018 1 ndma yield ndma formed nm betrixaban 0 nm 100 ma and dma were analyzed by a method involving derivatization with benzenesulfonyl chloride and then gc ms analysis padhye et al 2009 text s1 to identify the reaction intermediates and other end products the samples at different contact times ph and nh2cl dosages were analyzed in the ms scan mode on lc ms ms furthermore remaining by products were identified by injecting the samples into the gc ms and analyzing in the tic mode 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of monochloramine dosage betrixaban has not been evaluated for ndma formation potential by water disinfectants however previous studies have reported that monochloramination of some organic compounds with secondary amine moieties can form nitrosamines padhye et al 2013 roux et al 2012 shen and andrews 2011 the formation of ndma as a function of monochloramine dosage at a fixed betrixaban concentration was assessed to evaluate ndma formation potential of betrixaban upon monochloramination ndma formation from betrixaban equilibrated at ph 7 5 at 25 c for seven days increased from 2 3 to 25 2 nm upon increasing the monochloramine concentration from 0 05 to 5 mm fig 2 results revealed that ndma formation potential was correlated with monochloramine dosage this observation is in accordance with the results of similar studies on monochloramination of ndma precursors such as dma choi and valentine 2002 trimethylamine diethylamine dipropylamine ethylmethylamine 3 dimethylaminomethyl indole 4 dimethylaminoantipyrine west et al 2016 chlortoluron xu et al 2012 and dithiocarbamate pesticides padhye et al 2013 choi and valentine 2002 also observed an enhanced ndma formation by increasing the concentration of nh2cl to a secondarily treated wastewater at neutral ph demonstrating that this is indeed an environmentally relevant ndma formation pathway correspondingly the final betrixaban concentration percentage of betrixaban remaining in the system after seven days decreased from approximately 4 µm 50 to 1 µm 14 by increasing the dosage of monochloramine from 0 05 to 5 mm fig 2 the formation of ndma and degradation of betrixaban appeared to reach an apparent plateau after addition of 2 mm monochloramine the results indicated that at higher nh2cl concentration ndma formation only slightly increased from 0 25 with 2 mm nh2cl to 0 3 with 5 mm nh2cl which was consistent with the observed low residual betrixaban concentrations results were also consistent with 24 h monochloramination of dma where ndma formation was also shown to reach a plateau at higher nh2cl dma ratio 2 0 1 choi and valentine 2002 moreover wang et al 2013 also observed a similar effect upon the chloramination of raw water containing 3 21 mg l of dissolved organic carbon doc at ph 8 when nh2cl concentration was greater than 15 mg l the authors suggested that this phenomenon can be due to complete exhaustion of the ndma precursors in the raw water after reaction with more than 15 mg l monochloramine 3 2 effect of chloramination time to study the influence of monochloramination time on the formation of ndma from betrixaban 2 mm preformed monochloramine was added to betrixaban solutions at ph 7 5 fig 3 a shows the effect of different contact times on ndma formation and betrixaban degradation ndma concentrations increased rapidly at the beginning of the reaction and slowed down after five days whereas the concentration of betrixaban levelled off after seven days approximately 23 nm ndma was formed after ten days from the reaction of betrixaban and monochloramine as can be seen from fig 3a there was no change in the concentration of betrixaban and no ndma formation was observed in control samples at different contact times chen and young 2008 investigated the formation of ndma from the reaction of diuron 0 09 mm with naocl 3 45 mm and nh3 4 1 mm they found a steady increase in ndma concentrations at the beginning of the reaction up to 10 days at ph 8 the authors stated that a higher ndma formation in their study was the result of a longer contact time similarly xu et al 2012 who investigated chloramination of chlortoluron 94 µm with 2 mm nh2cl reported an increase in the formation of ndma from approximately 4 to 23 µg l by increasing the reaction time from 12 h to 10 days respectively residual concentrations of monochloramine were also measured at the end of the reaction and the trend of monochloramine depletion was found to be consistent with ndma formation fig 3b monochloramine concentration decreased from 2 mm to about 0 015 mm after 10 days similar chloramine decay was observed for control samples the results showed that having excess monochloramine 2 mm causes a relatively rapid ndma formation roux et al 2012 investigated the degradation of 12 μm ranitidine in the presence of an excess of nh2cl 2 5 mm at ph 8 over 48 h and found that ndma yield was maximum under such conditions 3 3 kinetic studies many studies have shown that the reaction between monochloramine and organic compounds follows pseudo first order kinetics chamberlain and adams 2006 spahr et al 2017 wan et al 2013 in the presence of excess about 6 to 600 fold of monochloramine the reactions exhibit a pseudo first order kinetic dependence on the precursor concentration fig 4 represents the pseudo first order kinetics for betrixaban degradation with 2 mm monochloramine at ph 7 5 as can be seen there was strong linearity r 2 0 99 for the log curve which indicated a first order reaction the pseudo first order rate constant kobs 0 01 hr 1 was found from the slope of the plot in the c c0 vs time coordinates according to the equation lv and li 2018 2 ln c c 0 k obs t where c0 and c are the initial and current concentrations of betrixaban respectively while kobs is the pseudo first order rate constant of betrixaban degradation 3 4 effect of ph to assess the influence of ph on the ndma formation experiments were conducted with betrixaban and 2 mm monochloramine with a contact time of seven days and the results are presented in fig 5 results revealed that ndma concentration increased from 7 nm to 88 nm by increasing the ph from 5 to 9 furthermore the observed degradation of betrixaban increased from 53 at ph 5 to 95 degradation at ph 9 betrixaban degradation and ndma formation were both favored at basic ph hence ndma formation was found to be correlated with betrixaban decomposition ndma formation from monochloramination of betrixaban exhibited a maximum yield of 1 1 at ph 9 this is higher than with the majority of the ndma precursors studied to date table s1 the observed ndma yield trend with ph was found to be different than in most of the studies reported with ndma precursors mitch and sedlak 2002b showed that the maximum ndma formation rate from dma was between ph 7 and 8 similarly padhye et al 2013 found that ndma formation from monochloramination of dithiocarbamates was highest near ph 7 5 to 8 le roux et al 2011 investigated the formation of ndma from several tertiary amines ranitidine 3 µm revealed the highest molar conversion to ndma upon monochloramination with 2 5 mm concentration of nh2cl at ph 8 and five days of contact time in another study shen and andrews 2013 investigated the role of ph dependency on the ndma formation from 25 nm ranitidine and sumatriptan by 2 5 mg l chloramine they found that ph affected the ndma formation and the reaction kinetics furthermore the maximum formation of ndma was near ph 7 8 in contrast chen and young 2008 demonstrated that ndma formation from chloramination of diuron had a maximum yield at ph 4 it is reported that the maximum ndma yield generally occurs at a ph approximately 1 2 1 6 units lower than the pka of the precursor amine group shen and andrews 2013 consistent with that hypothesis the chloramination of betrixaban with pka of 11 63 harshalatha et al 2018 yielded highest ndma formation at most basic ph used in this study ph 9 according to valentine and jafvert 1988 monochloramine s self decomposition through hydrolysis at ph less than 8 leads to the formation of dichloramine nhcl2 which is considered responsible for the formation of ndma from dma schreiber and mitch 2006 in the present study nhcl2 does not seem to play a role in the formation of ndma since at ph lower than 7 when nhcl2 dominates the formation of ndma is not significant ndma formation from betrixaban at ph 9 when nh2cl dominates was an order of magnitude higher than at ph 5 when nhcl2 dominates indicating that the formation of ndma can be strongly correlated to monochloramine concentration in the solution the study by le roux et al 2011 had a similar finding which led them to conclude that nhcl2 was not responsible for ndma formation from ranitidine 3 5 effect of bromide and nitrite on ndma formation bromide and nitrite influence on ndma formation has been studied in the literature as these are commonly occurring anions in the drinking water and wastewater in this study the influence of bromide 1 mm and nitrite 1 mm on the yield of ndma was assessed by performing the experiments at 8 5 µm of betrixaban and 2 mm monochloramine at ph 7 5 for 24 h contact time fig 6 presents the resulting ndma yield and concentrations nm from monochloramination of betrixaban in the presence and the absence of these anions in the absence of nh2cl for control samples no ndma formation was observed moreover compared to the results obtained in the absence of bromide 0 13 yield or 10 8 nm ndma monochloramination of betrixaban in the presence of bromide resulted in a seven fold increase in the concentration of ndma 0 92 yield or 78 nm a significant amount of dma 3 4 or 300 nm was detected after monochloramination of betrixaban in the absence of the bromide the increase in the concentration of dma suggested the degradation of betrixaban releasing dma in comparison only a trace amount of dma 0 45 or 40 nm was detected in the presence of bromide meanwhile in the presence of bromide the concentration of methylamine ma during chloramination of betrixaban was almost double 6 2 or 500 nm than that in the control samples without bromide 2 9 or 250 nm moreover monochloramination of betrixaban revealed almost similar level of degradation for betrixaban 82 in the presence and absence of bromide figure s1 in supplementary information hence we hypothesized that in the presence of bromide most of the released dma could be converted to ndma the higher ndma formation in the presence of bromide can be explained by the generation of bromochloramine nhbrcl with a higher electronegativity of the brominated nitrogen atom than that in nh2cl which results in the rapid nucleophilic substitution with dma beita sandí et al 2020 luh and mariñas 2012 found that the presence of bromide enhanced ndma formation at the relatively high ph 8 and 9 after 24 h reaction time by monochloramination of dma however ndma formation from dma was lower at ph 6 7 in the presence of bromide compared to that in the absence of bromide in another study valentine et al 2005 showed that in the presence of 0 2 mm bromide and 0 1 mm monochloramine an enhancement in ndma formation from dma was observed at ph ranging from 3 5 to 11 after 24 h contact time with maximum yield at ph 8 5 opposite to the bromide effect herein ndma formation decreased in the presence of nitrite the concentration of ndma 0 01 or 1 nm was reduced by an order of magnitude by the addition of nitrite moreover a reduced amount of dma 1 2 or 100 nm was detected during chloramination of betrixaban in nitrite containing samples this can be explained by the observed lower degradation of betrixaban in the presence of nitrite 65 than in its absence 82 figure s1 furthermore the methylamine concentration in chloraminated samples with nitrite was higher than in the absence of monochloramine the observed reduction in ndma formation by nitrite is hypothesized to be partly due to the loss of significant amounts of nh2cl since nitrite is expected to react with monochloramine and generate nitrate and ammonium ions in stoichiometric ratio and therefore acts as an inhibitor of ndma formation reactions during monochloramination choi and valentine 2003 seid et al 2018 xu et al 2012 and seid et al 2018 had reported a similar inhibitory effect of nitrite on ndma formation during monochloramination of chlortoluron and ranitidine respectively 3 6 by products of betrixaban monochloramination samples of the monochloramination of betrixaban were analysed by gc ms for the identification of by products the results are shown in table 1 no other nitrosamines apart from ndma were detected during monochloramination of betrixaban two other by products were identified from the reaction of betrixaban with monochloramine dimethyl formamide dmf and dichloroacetonitrile dcan furthermore bromoform chbr3 was detected for samples with bromide the generation of dmf le roux et al 2011 mitch and sedlak 2002b and dcan xu et al 2012 yang et al 2010 has been reported previously during chlorination and monochloramination of organic compounds le roux et al 2011 reported dmf and dcan as by products of the monochloramination of diuron and ranitidine in another study the formation of dcan by tetracycline oxytetracycline chlortetracycline and doxycycline degradation was found to be higher for chloramination than chlorination zhou et al 2014 yang et al 2010 also found dcan formation during chloramination of several nitrogenous organic compounds including cysteine cytosine glutamic acid and tryptophan likewise the formation of brominated species of thms such as bromoform during chlorination or chloramination of bromide containing waters has been reported in the literature hua and reckhow 2008 le roux et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 the gc ms chromatogram of ndma dcan and dmf are shown in the supplementary information si figure s2 spectra of the by products monitored by gc ms are presented in the supplementary information si figure s3 the concentration of betrixaban decreased gradually during monochloramination as betrixaban transformed into reaction intermediates and end products including ndma the samples were analysed for unknown m z peaks through lc ms ms for hydrophilic intermediates and end products table 1 summarizes the detected m z of the intermediates on lc ms ms from the reaction of betrixaban with monochloramine under different conditions the lc ms ms spectra of the monochloraminated betrixaban solution at ph 9 after seven days of contact time at 1 87 1 249 and 1 32 min retention time are shown in the supplementary information si figure s4 3 7 ndma formation pathways from betrixaban during monochloramination betrixaban molecule possesses a n n dimethylbenzamidinyl two aryl amide and a 3 chloropyridinyl moieties all of which could be a source of nitrogen for the eventual formation of ndma upon betrixaban s hydrolysis and chloroamination induced degradation the n n dimethylbenzamidinyl group belongs to arylimidamides with somewhat lower pka values than many typical aromatic amidines with pka values as high as 11 and above oszczapowicz and krawczyk 1989 soeiro et al 2013 hence it is generally less charged and exhibits better bioavailability which rationalizes its presence in betrixaban nevertheless this group is quite prone to the hydrolytic reactions under mild aqueous conditions clearly the pathway of the reactive alkyl arylaminidinyl group degradation typically producing n alkyl arylamine depending on the amidinyl structure is likely to dominate the ndma producing degradation routes of betrixaban halliday and symons 1978 the hydrolytic degradation with concomitant monochloramination of betrixaban is depicted in fig 7 chloramine reacts with the dimethylamidine group via nucleophilic substitution reaction calvo et al 2007 and the resulting intermediate undergoes facile hydrolysis with the formation of dimethylamine which consequently results in the ndma detected in our experiments mechanistic aspects of the amidine hydrolysis have been studied in detail in the literature jia et al 2017 dimethylchloramine the product of the amidinyl group hydrolysis is likely to rapidly exchange chlorine with the amide product of betrixaban darwich et al 2009 higuchi and hasegawa 1965 forming dimethylamine dma facile formation of ndma from dma upon chloramination is well documented mitch and sedlak 2002a of note hydrolysis of betrixaban in the absence of monochloramine within the range of ph studied is retarded whereas the nucleophilic attack of h2o on the cn double bond jia et al 2017 is promoted by the presence of monochloramine the formation of ndma can be further augmented by the chloramination induced formation of hypochlorite ion which is known to n chlorinate the aromatic amides leading to the orton rearrangement ring chlorination and subsequent n c scission chloramination and oxidation these processes can eventually produce ndma especially when monochloramine is present in excess during chloramination nh2cl can serve as another n source the presence of amide groups explains the observed higher yield of ndma from betrixaban compared to the values reported in the literature for dma the possible ndma formation pathway from the oxidation of dma was suggested by a reaction between nh2cl and organic amine precursors choi and valentine 2002 mitch and sedlak 2002b the revised ndma pathway proposed by schreiber and mitch 2006 suggested the reaction of secondary amine precursors with traces of nhcl2 formed via disproportionation of nh2cl followed by a chlorinated unsymmetrical dialkylhydrazine intermediate cl udmh generation due to nucleophilic attack of unprotonated secondary amines on nhcl2 subsequently the oxidation of cl udmh in the presence of dissolved oxygen yields ndma and other by products the possible reaction pathway in the presence of bromide as proposed by le roux et al 2012 and chen et al 2010 is the reaction of dma moiety of betrixaban with bromaminated oxidant species such as nhbrcl and therefore the formation of udmh br which would subsequently oxidise into ndma and other by products such as bromoform the larger amount of ndma formed in the presence of bromide can be attributed to the formation of nhbrcl with higher reactivity than nh2cl and also a weaker n br bond in udmh br than n cl bond which leads to the higher amount of the udmh br intermediate as compared to cl udmh this increase in ndma formation is more significant at high ph values and in waters containing elevated concentrations of bromide 500 µg l sgroi et al 2018 in the presence of nitrite nh2cl available for reaction with dma reduces due to reacting with nitrite and hence reduced available nh2cl results in lower ndma formation seid et al 2018 no2 may intervene not only with the initial attack of monochloramine and the reaction intermediates formation but also with the further transformation of the reaction intermediates similar to our observations mitch and sedlack 2002b also reported a decrease in ndma formation from monochloramination of dma in the presence of nitrite 3 8 chlorination and ozonation the degradation of betrixaban with 8 5 µm initial concentration at ph 7 5 was observed to be approximately 100 by chlorination with 5 mm free chlorine over seven days the concentration of ndma formed under chlorination was only 1 2 nm yield 0 014 hence ndma yield from monochloramination was found to be an order of magnitude higher than under chlorination which is in agreement with the results reported in the literature for most ndma precursors the higher yield of ndma during monochloramination can be explained by the presence of one more n in monochloramine s structure which provides an additional nitrogen atom for the nitroso group in ndma xu et al 2012 the other by product detected during chlorination of betrixaban was dmf jasemizad and padhye 2020 the degradation of betrixaban was also studied by high 2 mm and low 0 1 mm dosages of chlorine and exhibited almost 100 degradation even after a brief contact time of lower than two minutes this indicated that the reaction between chlorine and betrixaban occurred almost instantaneously for ozonation the degradation of betrixaban with 15 mg l ozone concentration at ph 7 5 increased from about 40 after 1 min to almost complete degradation after 6 min figure s5a in the supplementary information si this indicated that ozone is also effective in the removal of betrixaban at fairly low values of residual disinfectant concentration disinfectant contact time c t due to the fast reaction between betrixaban and ozone the reaction kinetics was studied from 1 to 6 min which fitted well with pseudo first order reaction r 2 0 98 figure s5b in the supplementary information si similar reaction kinetics during ozonation of organic compounds have been reported lv and li 2018 lv et al 2017 lv et al 2015 however ndma was not detected during ozonation of betrixaban the only product detected by ozonation of betrixaban was dmf jasemizad and padhye 2020 more discussion has been provided in text s2 si 4 conclusions betrixaban was found to be a potent ndma precursor and its potential to form ndma was examined in depth in this study with respect to monochloramine dosage monochloramine exposure time and ph betrixaban degradation and ndma formation were enhanced by increasing each of the above mentioned parameters consistent with the literature the results of our study also showed that the presence of bromide enhanced the formation of ndma during betrixaban monochloramination whereas nitrite inhibited its formation other by products generated during monochloramination were dmf and dcan while bromoform was detected in the presence of bromide betrixaban may be removed or degraded by different treatment mechanisms in conventional drinking water or wastewater treatment facilities therefore the potential removal of betrixaban must be taken into account before disinfection treatment in order to correctly determine its health risk in terms of ndma formation potential however some betrixaban is expected to pass through conventional water and wastewater treatment especially considering its high water solubility and resistance to photolysis or may come in contact with oxidants in effluents from medical facilities in such cases our study results demonstrate that even small amounts of betrixaban can lead to significant ndma formation upon monochloramination given its relatively high yield environmentally relevant concentrations of betrixaban are still not ascertained and since there is not enough information about the environmental fate of betrixaban it is difficult to predict overall ndma contribution by betrixaban in the current environment however as the use of betrixaban will widen and its presence in surface waters and wastewaters will increase ndma formation risks in the environment will also increase our study highlights these risks and through the detailed study of contributing factors kinetics and reaction mechanism provides useful information to mitigate such

17514,nanoplastics derived from degradation of micro or macroplastics are emerging contaminants in aquatic environments where their fate and transport as well as toxicity are affected by aggregation this study employed time resolved dynamic light scattering to investigate the aggregation kinetics of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps in the presence of four macromolecules sodium alginate sa bovine serum albumin bsa extracellular polymeric substance eps and suwannee river humic acid ha in solutions containing monovalent nacl and divalent cacl2 salts at different ph our results showed that the macromolecules enhanced psnp stability in nacl solutions but destabilized psnps in cacl2 solutions at ph 6 in nacl solutions macromolecules inhibited psnp aggregation due to steric hindrance originated from macromolecular layer adsorbed on psnps the strongest stabilization effect was observed for bsa having the greatest hydrodynamic adsorption layer thickness of 21 9 nm followed by ha eps and sa in cacl2 solutions sa significantly destabilized psnps via alginate bridging with ca2 which enhanced with concentrations of sa and cacl2 the destabilization effects of other three macromolecules in cacl2 solutions were governed by the interplay among molecular bridging charge screening and steric hindrance an increased ph in nacl or cacl2 solutions containing macromolecules all stabilized psnps due to elevated electrostatic repulsion except that sa destabilized psnps in cacl2 solutions via enhanced molecular bridging the stabilization effect of macromolecules may also compete with the destabilization effect under seawater condition this study suggested that psnp aggregation in aquatic environments could be strongly affected by macromolecules and solution chemistry

in 2018 and continues to increase at an annual rate of 3 67 europe 2015 the enormous production amount and unmatched recycling management have resulted in the ubiquitous distribution of plastic wastes in the aquatic e g lake jabeen et al 2017 river ding et al 2019 estuary zhao et al 2014 and ocean thompson et al 2004 terrestrial rillig 2012 and atmospheric environments cai et al 2017 once released to the environment plastic debris is subject to degradation or fragment processes including photo oxidation photo thermal oxidation mechanical abrasion as well as microbial degradation which will result in smaller plastic particles of various sizes such as microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps with sizes below 5 mm and 100 nm respectively ter halle et al 2016 investigations on the size distribution of mp samples collected from global ocean surface provided evidence for the formation of nps in the environment due to degradation of plastics in millimeter scale cozar et al 2014 mattsson et al 2015 gigault et al 2016 identified for the first time the presence of nps in aquatic systems then several other researchers also detected nps in water samples collected from north atlantic subtropical gyre ter halle et al 2017 and from personal care products hernandez et al 2017 it is now widely recognized that nps are an emerging type of contaminant in aquatic environments unlike mps nps with much smaller sizes could be readily ingested by organisms and enter cells and blood brandts et al 2018 the large specific surface area e g 85 0 2 9 m2 g ma et al 2016 of nps makes them an excellent carrier for pollutants such as hydrophobic organic chemicals ding et al 2020 and heavy metals mao et al 2020 therefore it is crucial to understand the fate and transport of nps as well as their interactions with background constituents in aquatic environments upon entering natural aquatic systems the aggregation state of nps is a key factor governing their particle size morphology and specific surface area which has strong influence on their environmental processes such as adsorption deposition and ingestion alimi et al 2018 previous studies have investigated factors affecting the aggregation behavior of nps in aquatic environments including electrolyte composition concentration cai et al 2018 solution ph li et al 2018 as well as surface functional groups e g carboxyl and amino groups on nps della torre et al 2014 our research group also reported that uv irradiation could strongly enhance or retard the aggregation kinetics of polystyrene nps psnps

g humic ha and fulvic acids fa polysaccharides proteins and extracellular polymeric substance eps are ubiquitous in aquatic environments hyung et al 2007 mohamed 2008 omoike and chorover 2006 shi kam et al 2004 due to their hydrophobic properties nps could inevitably interact with and adsorb these macromolecules when released into aquatic systems saleh et al 2010 such interactions may affect the

and biological activities e g ingestion and reproduction zhang et al 2019 a recent study investigated the influence of one macromolecule i e suwannee river nom on the aggregation kinetics of unmodified carboxyl modified and amino modified psnps yu et al 2019 however different types of macromolecules are present in aquatic environments and their complex variation in structures and properties e g chemical composition space configuration hydrophobicity and functional groups may result in distinct interactions with nps for instance different macromolecular adsorption behaviors on

macromolecules thus exerting different effects on the aggregation process of nps walker and bob 2001 the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of environmental and biological macromolecules on the aggregation kinetics of psnps under different solution conditions of environmental relevance manufactured psnps were selected as model nps since they are a typical plastic widely detected in the environment alimi et al 2018 li et al 2018 and were used in our previous study liu et al 2019 to make a comprehensive comparison four types of macromolecules with different chemical structures and properties were chosen in this study including polysaccharide e g sodium alginate sa humic substance e g suwannee river ha protein e g bovine serum albumin bsa and eps for instance sa represents hydrophilic linear and semi flexible polysaccharides while ha is a hydrophobic globular and semi rigid humic substance compared with the previous two macromolecules bsa is a more hydrophobic and globular macromolecule with protein tertiary structure finally eps extracted from culture medium of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 is composed of polysaccharide and protein having random coils with partly extending chains the aggregation kinetics of psnps in the presence of various macromolecules were quantified in solutions containing monovalent nacl and divalent cacl2 salts under different ph conditions the measured aggregation data were used to construct stability profiles for determination of the critical coagulation concentrations cccs for psnps systematic characterization was employed to elucidate the aggregation mechanisms of psnps under the influence of different macromolecules our results suggested that macromolecules stabilized psnps in monovalent salt na due to steric hindrance but destabilized psnps in divalent salt ca2 via molecular bridging and edl compression therefore macromolecules and solution chemistry may play a vital role on the fate and transport of psnps in aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the psnp particles with diameter of 0 05 0 1 μm were purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china according to the manufacturer the psnp samples received were the stock suspension containing 2 5 w v i e 25 g l of psnps and having no surface modification the working suspension containing 20 mg l psnps was prepared by diluting 0 4 ml stock solution in 500 ml milli q water resistivity 18 2 mω cm and stored at 4 8 c until use all experiments were conducted at a final psnp concentration of 10 mg l therefore dispersing agent if any added by the manufacturer in the stock suspension of psnps was diluted by 2 500 times with milli q water in experiments and may not affect their aggregation behavior the psnp concentration of 10 mg l was also used in previous studies cai et al 2018 oncsik et al 2014 and should be representative of np concentrations in natural aquatic systems gigault et al 2016 suwannee river ha srha cat 3s101h standard ⅲ purchased from international humic substances society ihss st paul mn was used as the representative aquatic humic substance the representative biomacromolecules including sa and bsa were obtained from sigma aldrich shanghai china whereas eps was extracted from the cultural medium of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 with the detailed procedure described in s1 of the supplementary material the macromolecule concentrations were studied at 1 2 and 5 mg c l i e total organic carbon content in solution phase which were within the range of nom concentrations typically found in natural aquatic environments thurman 1985 additionally monovalent nacl or divalent cacl2 electrolytes analytical grade obtained from shanghai titan scientific co ltd shanghai china were used without further purification the detailed preparation procedures for electrolyte and macromolecule solutions are presented in s2 of the supplementary material 2 2 characterizations the hydrodynamic sizes and zeta ζ potentials of psnps were measured at 25 c by dynamic light scattering dls using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk operated with a he ne laser at a wavelength of 633 nm and scattering angle of 90 the refractive and absorption indexes for psnps were set at 1 59 and 0 01 respectively to determine the macromolecular influence on the surface charge of psnps their ζ potentials with or without macromolecules were measured over a range of electrolyte concentrations triplicate samples were each measured 10 times for electrophoretic mobilities which were converted to ζ potentials using the smoluchowski approximation smoluchowski 1903 the size and morphology of psnp particles in the absence or presence of macromolecules were characterized under transmission electron microscope tem the elemental compositions and functional groups of eps and psnps were characterized with elemental analyzer and x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was employed to study the structures and functional groups of psnps and macromolecules as well as their interactions detailed procedures of these characterization techniques are presented in s3 of the supplementary material 2 3 aggregation experiments time resolved dynamic light scattering technique was used to record the change of intensity weighted average hydrodynamic diameter d h of psnps as a function of time on zetasizer nano zs90 at ambient temperature 25 c and with or without background macromolecules before test the psnp suspension electrolyte and macromolecule solutions were adjusted to the designated ph predetermined aliquots of psnp suspension 1 ml milli q water macromolecule and electrolyte solutions were transferred sequentially to a pre cleaned new cuvette dts0012 germany to make a total volume of 2 ml the cuvette was immediately vortexed vortex genie fisher scientific for 1 s and then inserted into the dls instrument the increase of d h was monitored over 20 to 100 min with the autocorrelation function accumulated for a period of 15 s all measurements of aggregation experiments were conducted in triplicates to increase the statistical power for data analysis the initial aggregation rate k which is proportional to the initial slope regime where d h increases linearly over time was determined for each aggregation test to quantify the aggregation rates the attachment efficiency α ranging from 0 to 1 was then calculated by normalizing k under different solution conditions by the slope obtained under diffusion limited k fast aggregation conditions saleh et al 2008 more detailed calculation procedure is presented in s4 of the supplementary material 2 4 measurements of hydrodynamic adsorption layer thickness halt photon correlation spectrometer was used to determine the halt of macromolecules attached to the psnp surface following the method of walker and bob 2001 samples were prepared following the same procedure for aggregation experiments by adding each of the four macromolecule solutions into a cuvette and allowed to stand for 30 min before test to ensure high polymer surface coverage all measurements were conducted under low electrolyte concentration 10 mm nacl and at 25 c the measured halt values for different macromolecules were accurate to within 1 6 4 8 of the psnp diameter which corresponded to about 2 5 nm thickness of adsorbed macromolecule layer at least 10 measurements were conducted for each reported halt value to increase the statistical power for data analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of psnps fig s1a presents the tem images taken for psnps indicating that they were regular microspheres with a uniform diameter of approximately 100 nm the dls measurements demonstrated that they had diameters of 60 282 nm with an average d h of 119 4 3 8 nm and a polydispersity index pdi of 0 074 0 043 fig s1b in the absence of macromolecules psnps had strong negative surface charges with ζ potential of 40 12 1 5 mv as measured at 1 mm nacl and ph 6 0 fig 1 a such surface charge favors greater stability for the psnp suspension larsson et al 2012 the negative ζ potential values changed from 40 12 to 17 mv and from 27 30 to 18 17 mv when nacl and cacl2 concentrations increased from 1 to 1000 mm and from 0 01 to 9 mm respectively fig 1 the xps and ftir analysis of psnps figures s1c d and associated discussions in the supplementary material showed comparable results obtained in our previous characterizations liu et al 2019 demonstrating that the psnps possess an excellent structural stability in aqueous systems fig 1 presents the ζ potentials of psnps as functions of nacl and cacl2 concentrations in the presence of four environmental and biological macromolecules at all tested concentrations of nacl and low cacl2 concentrations 0 6 mm sa eps and ha had little or no effect on the surface charge of psnps while at high cacl2 concentrations 1 mm eps and ha significantly reduced the negative charge of psnps whereas sa showed negligible influence the greatest negative ζ value 44 91 mv was obtained at 1 mm nacl and 2 mg c l ha different from the above three macromolecules bsa notably reduced the negative charge of psnps in both nacl and cacl2 solutions the results were similar to the prior reports that macromolecules e g sa and ha had negligible effects on the surface charges of single walled carbon nanotubes swnts saleh et al 2010 and diesel soot nanoparticles chen et al 2019 however other previous studies observed significant increase of negative charge on swnt surface with adsorbed anionic surfactant e g sodium dodecyl and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate and polyelectrolyte e g sa and ha liu et al 2007 white et al 2007 in addition the negative charge of psnps decreased in the presence of bsa which was consistent with previous research that this was attributed to strong protein adsorption onto surfaces of nanoparticles including gold dominguez medina et al 2013 swnts kopac and bozgeyik 2016 and diesel soot chen et al 2019 table 1 presents the halt value of each adsorbed macromolecule on psnp surface under different total organic carbon contents at 2 mg c l which was the macromolecule concentration selected for most ζ potential measurements and aggregation experiments in this study the greatest halt value of 21 9 nm was observed for bsa demonstrating its strong adsorption affinity onto psnp surface bsa with an isoelectric point iep of 5 2 was negatively charged ζ potential 22 65 mv in the tested solution at ph 6 0 figure s2 and so were psnps the protein molecules with negative charge could be spontaneously adsorbed onto negatively charged particle surface only via hydrophobic interactions dominguez medina et al 2013 to prevent the build up of high electrostatic potentials various cations e g na and ca2 could be simultaneously adsorbed into the protein sorbent contact zone dulm et al 1981 elgersma et al 1989 this co adsorption process consequently reduced the total negative charge on psnps after the attachment of negatively charged bsa onto psnp surface furthermore similar to bsa the adsorption of ca2 into the eps psnp or ha psnp contact zones was also observed except that it only occurred at sufficiently high cacl2 concentration i e 1 mm chen and elimelech 2006 zhang et al 2019 meanwhile such phenomenon did not occur in the presence of sa which may be attributed to its thinnest halt on psnps among four macromolecules that did not provide enough macromolecule sorbent contact region 3 2 psnp aggregation kinetics in the presence of monovalent na cation fig 2 a shows the stability curves of psnps as a function of nacl concentrations with or without single background macromolecules as nacl was the only background electrolyte psnps exhibited distinct reaction limited slow and diffusion limited fast aggregation regimes that followed the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory chen and huang 2017 mylon et al 2004 at low nacl concentrations the aggregation process was defined as reaction limited α 1 under which more na was required to neutralize the negative charge on psnps and consequently weaken their electrostatic repulsion as a result the aggregation rate increased with increasing nacl concentration however when nacl concentration reached its critical coagulation concentration ccc value which is the minimum electrolyte concentration to induce diffusion limited α 1 aggregation the energy barrier was completely eliminated and van der waals attractive force dominated the particle interactions chen et al 2006 li et al 2018 the attachment efficiencies as a function of nacl concentration were empirically fitted grolimund et al 2001 yielding a ccc value of 460 mm nacl that was close to our previous report of 450 mm nacl liu et al 2019 similar result was also observed for nano ps jodar reyes et al 2006 with a ccc value of 460 20 mm nacl an average diameter d of 364 nm and ζ potential of 44 mv however the ccc values obtained here for psnps were almost 30 times higher than those previously reported for micro ps for example a ccc value of 14 9 mm nacl was reported for micro ps which had a d value of 17 9 mm and ζ potential of 22 mv in 1 mm nacl li et al 2018 likewise oncsik et al 2014 showed that sulfate ps latex d 0 53 μm ccc 100 mm nacl exhibited stronger colloidal stability than carboxylate ps d 1 μm ccc 50 mm nacl it appears that both surface functional groups and particle diameters of mps or nps are important factors determining their colloidal stability and hence their fate and transport in aqueous systems fig 2a shows that the stability of psnps was significantly enhanced in the presence of macromolecules in nacl solutions none of the four macromolecules exhibited diffusion limited aggregation regimes even under the highest nacl concentration tested i e 1000 mm that is well above the salinity of seawater such stabilization effects on psnps followed the order of bsa ha eps sa these results suggested that macromolecules could strongly enhance the colloidal stability hence the mobility of psnps in aquatic environments this may also facilitate the transport and affect the fate of other pollutants such as heavy metals and organic chemicals in natural aquatic systems the observed stabilization effect on psnps by macromolecules were not likely resulted from the electrical double layer edl compression mechanism as discussed above the ζ potentials of psnps measured in the presence of a given macromolecule except for bsa were not significantly different from those measured in nacl only solution fig 1a it is highly likely that the enhanced colloidal stability was due to adsorption of macromolecules on psnp surface our prior study liu et al 2019 reported a contact angle of 108 2 for psnps in pure water indicating the hydrophobic nature of these nano sized plastics these hydrophobic psnps should presumably favor adsorption of organic molecules including the tested macromolecules therefore steric repulsion derived from adsorbed macromolecule layer may be the primary mechanism of such enhanced psnp stability chen and elimelech 2007 saleh et al 2010 such conjecture was supported with the order of halt values for the macromolecules measured at 2 mg c l which corresponded to their stabilization effects on psnps in nacl solutions table 1 it should be noted that the four macromolecules exhibited different extent of stabilization effects on the psnps in nacl solutions for instance sa showed the weakest stabilization effect and the thinnest halt which were likely related to its greater hydrophilicity the sa used in this study was extracted from brown algae and represents a linear semi flexible polysaccharide composed of α l guluronic acid g and β d mannuronic acid m residues boontheekul et al 2005 these functional groups could form hydrogen bonding with water resulting in relatively stronger hydrophilicity and thus weaker adsorption affinity to psnps unlike sa ha is a hydrophobic more globular and semi rigid macromolecule buffle et al 1998 that is prone to attachment to the psnp surface it is thus expected to exhibit vital steric hindrance effects on inhibiting psnp aggregation similar to the above trends previous studies have also reported that sa exerted weak stabilization effects on swnts saleh et al 2010 fullerene c60 nanoparticles chen and elimelech 2008 and soot nanoparticles chen et al 2019 while ha significantly enhanced the colloidal stability of these nanoparticles in nacl solutions the strongest stabilization effect of bsa on psnp aggregation in nacl solution was likely attributed to its strongest adsorption to psnp surface as evidenced from its greatest halt value table 1 and the most significant reduction of psnp negative charge among four macromolecules fig 1 other than hydrophobic interactions the driving force for bsa adsorption on psnp surface probably also stemmed from structural rearrangements resulting in a higher conformational entropy in the protein molecule norde and anusiem 1992 this was revealed from the detailed analysis of ftir spectra on the secondary protein structures in the amide i region 1700 1600 cm 1 for psnps bsa and psnps bound bsa figure s3 and table s1 with associated discussions in the supplementary material such structural change after contact with psnps indicated that bsa exhibited a more compact globular structure after adsorption badireddy et al 2010 therefore bsa may have the strongest adsorption affinity to the hydrophobic psnp surface as well as a globular protein structure and likely induce a longer range steric repulsive force between psnps as compared with sa and ha with relatively more linear molecular structures norde and giacomelli 2000 the chemical compositions and functional groups of eps were characterized by elemental analysis xps and ftir fig s4 and tables s2 s5 with the detailed descriptions presented in the supplementary material the experimental results indicated that polysaccharide 22 and protein 51 were the major components in eps table s5 which was extracted from culture medium of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and is widely distributed in aquatic environments zhang et al 2016 the above characteristics are consistent with prior studies that eps macromolecule is typically composed of polysaccharide 30 and protein 50 li et al 2016 furthermore eps usually exists as random coils with partly extending chains under neutral conditions wang et al 2012 having a less compacted structure than bsa but is more globular than sa as a result both the halt value of 6 2 nm for eps adsorption on psnp surface and the retardation effect of eps on psnp aggregation fell between those for bsa and sa table 1 and fig 2a 3 3 psnp aggregation kinetics in the presence of divalent ca2 cations the aggregation kinetics of psnps in the absence or presence of each macromolecule were investigated in solutions containing varying concentrations of divalent salt cacl2 the results were presented as attachment efficiencies fig 2b or aggregation rates fig 2c similar to the results obtained in nacl solutions the aggregation kinetics of psnps in cacl2 solutions without macromolecules also exhibited both reaction limited and diffusion limited aggregation regimes the attachment efficiency data were empirically fitted grolimund et al 2001 to yield a ccc value of 32 mm cacl2 which is in close agreement with our prior study of 33 mm cacl2 liu et al 2019 previous study reported similar ccc values of 34 mm cacl2 and 20 mm cacl2 for sulfate coated d 0 53 μm ζ potential 49 mv at 1 mm cacl2 and carboxyl coated ps particles d 1 μm ζ potential 26 mv at 1 mm cacl2 oncsik et al 2014 respectively but much lower ccc value 2 95 mm cacl2 for micro ps particles d 17 9 μm ζ potential 22 mv at 0 2 mm cacl2 li et al 2018 the difference in ccc values should be related to the particle size and surface charge of ps particles the ratio between the ccc values for ca2 and na was proportional to z 3 85 where z 2 is the counterion valence for calcium which is reasonable because dlvo theory predicts a varied ratio for colloidal particle ranging from z 2 to z 6 schulze hardy rule elimelech et al 1995 fig 2c shows that all four macromolecules destabilized psnps and promoted their aggregation in cacl2 solutions at cacl2 concentration below 10 mm the destabilization effects followed the order of bsa ha sa eps while such order changed to sa ha eps bsa at cacl2 concentration above 10 mm in the presence of eps bsa or ha the aggregation behaviors of psnps in cacl2 solutions still followed the dlvo type interaction with two distinct reaction limited and diffusion limited regimes allowing for empirical fitting to yield their ccc values of 15 6 and 10 mm cacl2 respectively fig 2b these ccc values were 46 8 18 7 and 31 2 compared to those obtained in background solutions containing only cacl2 indicating that the overall destabilization effects on psnps in cacl2 solution were bsa ha eps however unlike the other three tested macromolecules the promotion of psnp aggregation rates by sa showed no sign of plateauing at any higher cacl2 concentrations e g even at 60 mm cacl2 which is beyond average ionic strength of seawater fig 2c therefore the stability curve could not be constructed for psnp aggregation in cacl2 solutions with the presence of sa the above results indicated that the colloidal stability of psnps could be lowered variously by these macromolecules in cacl2 solutions the strongest destabilization effect on psnps was observed for sa which was likely related to its molecular structure the ftir results revealed that sa contained abundant oxygen containing functional groups e g carboxyl and hydroxyl groups fig s5a which could form molecular bridging with ca2 and significantly enhance the aggregation of psnps as presented in fig 2d the formation of alginate gel at 10 mm cacl2 and 5 mg c l sa enmeshed psnps together to form larger clusters previous studies have reported that the guluronic acid blocks g blocks of alginate polymers could complex with calcium ions to crosslink the polymers and form alginate gel networks thereby significantly promoting nanoparticle aggregation chen and elimelech 2006 chen and elimelech 2007 it is likely that the destabilization mechanisms of eps bsa and ha on psnps should be mainly ascribed to edl compression and molecular bridging as described above the aggregation behaviors of psnps in cacl2 solutions with the presence of each macromolecule except for sa still followed the dlvo theory meanwhile the ζ potential measurements fig 1b also indicated that the order of surface charge reduction of psnps by three macromolecules in cacl2 solutions followed the same order of their destabilization effects on psnp aggregation i e bsa ha eps especially under 1 10 mm cacl2 whereas sa exerted negligible effect in addition the ftir analyses revealed that eps bsa and ha contained carboxyl groups figs s3a and s5a so that these three macromolecules could also form gel like structure with ca2 to promote the aggregation of psnps as shown by tem figs s5b d chen et al 2016 xu et al 2016 in summary when cacl2 was the only background electrolyte sa destabilized psnps mainly via molecular bridging whereas the destabilization of psnps by eps bsa and ha were governed by edl compression and molecular bridging 3 4 effects of macromolecule concentration on psnp aggregation to further characterize the influence of macromolecules on the aggregation behavior of psnps their aggregation rates were measured at macromolecules concentrations of 0 1 2 and 5 mg c l in 500 mm nacl fig 3 a or 20 mm cacl2 fig 3b fig 3a shows that at an nacl concentration 500 mm relevant to seawater level the presence of 1 mg c l sa or eps exerted negligible influence on psnp aggregation while the stabilization effect on psnps started to appear at 2 and 5 mg c l sa or eps for example the aggregation rates decreased by 44 2 and 86 2 as sa concentration increased to 2 and 5 mg c l respectively additionally d h of psnps only increased from 170 to 300 nm at 5 mg c l sa and remained unchanged for eps in 20 min fig s6a b different from sa and eps bsa and ha significantly inhibited psnp aggregation at even lower macromolecule concentrations 1 mg c l which could be attributed to the stronger steric hindrance as reflected by their higher halt values 18 9 and 12 6 nm for bsa and ha respectively compared to those for sa 3 4 nm and eps 4 5 nm table 1 in the presence of 2 and 5 mg c l bsa and ha the d h of psnps remained consistently unchanged as so did for 5 mg c l eps fig s6c d the results demonstrated that the stabilization effects of macromolecules on psnp aggregation in monovalent electrolyte solutions were positively correlated with the macromolecule concentrations which agreed with the results observed for carbon nanotubes hyung et al 2007 and titanium dioxide domingos et al 2009 in addition a prior study also reported that an increased concentration of suwannee river nom resulted in enhanced stabilization for psnps psnps cooh and psnps nh2 yu et al 2019 although a different macromolecule and various psnps were studied it should be pointed out that bsa and ha exhibited stronger effects for stabilizing psnps suggesting that humic substances and proteins are more likely to enhance the mobility of psnps under typical freshwater or estuary conditions opposite trend was observed for the cacl2 solutions fig 3b illustrates the aggregation rates of psnps in the presence of 1 2 and 5 mg c l macromolecules with fixed divalent cation concentration 20 mm cacl2 it clearly shows that all macromolecules promoted the aggregation of psnps at their respective three tested concentration levels in comparison to the absence of these macromolecules i e 0 mg c l fig 3b shows that sa exhibited significant destabilization effect on psnps and such an effect increased as a function of its concentration this could be attributed to the presence of more available carboxylic groups in the guluronic acid blocks g blocks of sa fig s5a that could complex with ca2 at higher sa concentrations boontheekul et al 2005 therefore stronger molecular bridging occurred between sa and ca2 under higher concentrations of sa fig 3b or cacl2 fig 2c or both resulting in more significantly enhanced aggregation rates of psnps different from sa an increased concentration of eps bsa or ha did not always correspond to a stronger destabilization effect on psnps in cacl2 solutions the aggregation rates of psnps were decreased instead when the concentrations of these three macromolecules increased to 5 mg c l fig 3b for instance the aggregation rate increased by almost 4 3 times from 0 37 to 1 59 nm s as eps concentration raised from 1 to 2 mg c l but it decreased to 0 77 nm s as eps concentration further increased to 5 mg c l as pointed out in the last section the destabilization effects of these three macromolecules in cacl2 solutions mainly originated from molecular bridging and edl compression however under higher concentrations e g 5 mg c l of eps bsa or ha an elevated steric hindrance may appear due to the thicker adsorbed macromolecule layer table 1 such stabilization effect on psnps arise from steric hindrance could compete with the former two destabilization effects yu et al 2018 leading to an overall weakened destabilization and thus the observed less enhanced psnp aggregation under such circumstances fig 3b 3 5 effects of ph on psnp aggregation 3 5 1 nacl solutions the psnp aggregation as a function of ph in the presence of 2 mg c l sa eps bsa or ha was studied at various concentrations of nacl fig 4 and cacl2 fig 5 in the presence of sa the aggregation rates of psnps at all tested nacl concentrations i e 100 200 500 and 900 mm decreased as ph increased from 3 to 10 fig 4a the most significant decrease in aggregation rates were observed under basic conditions as reflected by the slightly increased ph 8 fig s7a or unchanged ph 10 figure s7b d h values of psnps similarly the increase of ph also retarded psnp aggregation in the presence of ha figs 4d and s7g h the above results for sa and ha should be attributed to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion between psnps at higher ph as their ζ potentials became more negative figs s8a and d due to adsorption of hydroxyl groups onto psnp surfaces liu et al 2019 different from sa and ha psnps aggregated rapidly in the presence of eps even at low nacl concentrations at ph 3 fig 4b with the aggregation rates reaching 1 0 and 1 16 nm s respectively at 10 and 100 mm nacl such phenomenon may be derived from the positive surface charge of eps at ph 3 with an iep of 4 3 figure s2 fig s8b shows that the psnp suspension containing eps at ph 3 exhibited overall slightly positive to zero ζ potentials over the tested nacl concentrations resulting in fast psnp aggregation as ph increased from 4 5 to 10 eps was deprotonated and gradually lowered the aggregation rates figs 4b and s7c d due to enhanced negative charge on psnps fig s8b unlike eps the presence of bsa in nacl solutions significantly stabilized psnps at ph 3 fig 4c figure s2 shows that bsa with an iep of 5 2 was positively charged at ph 3 which imparted positive charge 10 30 mv on psnps fig s8c and electrostatic repulsion however the positive charge of bsa weakened at ph 4 5 figure s2 resulting in ζ potentials of psnps near zero at 100 mm nacl fig s8c and thus aggregation fig 4c the gradual decrease in aggregation rates with increased nacl concentration at ph 4 5 was attributed to more negative ζ potentials e g 11 mv at 900 mm nacl on psnps fig s8c as ph increased to 6 8 and 10 psnps were stabilized by their negative charge in the presence of bsa fig s8c several previous studies reported that macromolecular structure may became more expanded with increased ph due to deprotonation and exposure of more hydrophilic surface functional groups palmer and von wandruszka 2001 varga et al 2016 wang et al 2012 the steric hindrance effect of macromolecules may be consequently weakened at higher ph however the aggregation rates generally decreased in nacl solutions with increased ph for all macromolecules fig 4 indicating that the enhanced electrostatic repulsion overcame the weakened steric hindrance effect 3 5 2 cacl2 solutions the psnp aggregation as a function of ph at various cacl2 concentrations in the presence of macromolecules fig 5 showed similar trends with the results obtained in nacl solutions fig 4 for eps bsa and ha however an opposite trend was observed for sa fig 5a shows that in the presence of sa the aggregation was enhanced as ph increased from 3 to 10 for instance the aggregation rates at 6 mm cacl2 reached 5 nm s at ph 10 in the presence of sa while remained 0 5 nm s for the other three macromolecules this should be attributed to the formation of more binding sites on sa available for bridging with ca2 at higher ph due to deprotonation of sa figure s2 the positively charged eps at ph 3 figure s2 resulted in psnp aggregation in cacl2 solutions fig 5b due to charge neutralization as similarly observed above in nacl solutions fig 4b as ph increased from 4 5 to 10 the functional groups e g hydroxyl and carboxyl on eps became more negative figure s2 and thus provided more sites for ca2 bridging however the increased ph also simultaneously led to an elevated electrostatic repulsion as reflected by more negative ζ potentials of psnps fig s9b therefore the aggregation rates peaked at ph 6 and then decreased from ph 8 to 10 fig 5b similar to the results observed in nacl solutions psnps were stabilized by bsa at ph 3 in cacl2 solutions fig 5c with an overall strong positive charge 15 32 mv fig s9c at ph 4 5 the aggregation rates increased significantly to the maximum likely due to the combined effects of weak surface charge 0 10 mv and bsa bridging with ca2 however the aggregation rates gradually decreased with further increase of ph which should be related to the elevated electrostatic repulsion derived from more negative charge of psnps fig s9c furthermore an increased ph may inhibit the activity of functional groups on bsa and even result in denaturation due to cleavage of hydrogen bond and forming salts with free amino or carboxyl groups varga et al 2016 thus weakening the molecular bridging between bsa and ca2 for ha fig 5d the aggregation rates decreased as ph increased from 6 to 8 which was mainly due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion as reflected by more negative ζ potentials fig s9d however further increase of ph from 8 to 10 exerted different effects on the aggregation rates depending on cacl2 concentration at cacl2 concentrations near or below 20 mm the aggregation rates increased due to enhanced molecular bridging between ca2 and deprotonated ha figure s2 zhang et al 2013 at cacl2 concentrations above 20 mm such effect may be overcome by enhanced steric hindrance derived from more compact and thicker structure of ha palmer and von wandruszka 2001 because more ca2 was adsorbed by ha or psnp surface as reflected by the upper shift of ζ potentials at ph 10 fig s9d overall the ph effect on psnp aggregation in the presence of ha was governed by electrostatic repulsion molecular bridging and steric hindrance since both monovalent and divalent salts are present in natural water and their stabilization or destabilization effects may be counterbalanced the aggregation behavior of psnps was further studied in artificial seawater solution table s6 at ph 8 in the absence or presence of single macromolecule at 2 mg c l fig s10 the overall results showed that the psnp aggregation was promoted respectively by sa and eps inhibited by bsa and unaffected by ha in artificial seawater therefore the stabilization effect may compete with the destabilization effect on psnps depending on the macromolecules and solution chemistry 4 conclusion aggregation and stability of psnps strongly affect their fate transport and ecological risks in aquatic environments this study demonstrated that environmental and biological macromolecules ubiquitously present in aquatic systems could variously interact with psnps and exert different effects on their aggregation behavior all four studied macromolecules significantly stabilized psnps in monovalent na salt mainly due to steric hindrance originated from the adsorbed macromolecule layer such stabilization effect correlated positively with the halt values of four macromolecules i e bsa ha eps sa in divalent ca2 salt solutions molecular bridging between sa and ca2 significantly destabilized psnps which enhanced with concentrations of sa and cacl2 the other three macromolecules i e bsa ha and eps also destabilized psnps in cacl2 solutions due to the combined effects of edl compression and molecular bridging however their destabilization effects could be weakened by steric hindrance at higher macromolecule concentration e g 5 mg c l an increased ph in nacl or cacl2 solutions containing macromolecules all stabilized psnps due to elevated electrostatic repulsion except that sa destabilized psnps in cacl2 solutions because of enhanced molecular bridging the stabilization effect of macromolecules in monovalent salt may also compete with the destabilization effect in divalent salt at high concentration in seawater overall our results suggested that both macromolecules and solution chemistry are important factors affecting the fate and ecological risks of psnps in aquatic systems the interactions of macromolecules with plastic materials other than polystyrene should also be considered in

17514,nanoplastics derived from degradation of micro or macroplastics are emerging contaminants in aquatic environments where their fate and transport as well as toxicity are affected by aggregation this study employed time resolved dynamic light scattering to investigate the aggregation kinetics of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps in the presence of four macromolecules sodium alginate sa bovine serum albumin bsa extracellular polymeric substance eps and suwannee river humic acid ha in solutions containing monovalent nacl and divalent cacl2 salts at different ph our results showed that the macromolecules enhanced psnp stability in nacl solutions but destabilized psnps in cacl2 solutions at ph 6 in nacl solutions macromolecules inhibited psnp aggregation due to steric hindrance originated from macromolecular layer adsorbed on psnps the strongest stabilization effect was observed for bsa having the greatest hydrodynamic adsorption layer thickness of 21 9 nm followed by ha eps and sa in cacl2 solutions sa significantly destabilized psnps via alginate bridging with ca2 which enhanced with concentrations of sa and cacl2 the destabilization effects of other three macromolecules in cacl2 solutions were governed by the interplay among molecular bridging charge screening and steric hindrance an increased ph in nacl or cacl2 solutions containing macromolecules all stabilized psnps due to elevated electrostatic repulsion except that sa destabilized psnps in cacl2 solutions via enhanced molecular bridging the stabilization effect of macromolecules may also compete with the destabilization effect under seawater condition this study suggested that psnp aggregation in aquatic environments could be strongly affected by macromolecules and solution chemistry

to the environment plastic debris is subject to degradation or fragment processes including photo oxidation photo thermal oxidation mechanical abrasion as well as microbial degradation which will result in smaller plastic particles of various sizes such as microplastics mps and nanoplastics nps with sizes below 5 mm and 100 nm respectively ter halle et al 2016 investigations on the size distribution of mp samples collected from global ocean surface provided evidence for the formation of nps in the environment due to degradation of plastics in millimeter scale cozar et al 2014 mattsson et al 2015 gigault et al 2016 identified for the first time the presence of nps in aquatic systems then several other researchers also detected nps in water samples collected from north atlantic subtropical gyre ter halle et al 2017 and from personal care products hernandez et al 2017 it is now widely recognized that nps are an emerging type of contaminant in aquatic environments unlike mps nps with much smaller sizes could be readily ingested by organisms and enter cells and blood brandts et al 2018 the large specific surface area e g 85 0 2 9 m2 g ma et al 2016 of nps makes them an excellent carrier for pollutants such as hydrophobic organic chemicals ding et al 2020 and heavy metals mao et al 2020 therefore it is crucial to understand the fate and transport of nps as well as their interactions with background constituents in aquatic environments upon entering natural aquatic systems the aggregation state of nps is a key factor governing their particle size morphology and specific surface area which has strong influence on their environmental processes such as adsorption deposition and ingestion alimi et al 2018 previous studies have investigated factors affecting the aggregation behavior of nps in aquatic environments including electrolyte composition concentration cai et al 2018 solution ph li et al 2018 as well as surface functional groups e g carboxyl and amino groups on nps della torre et al 2014 our research group also reported that uv irradiation could strongly enhance or retard the aggregation kinetics of polystyrene nps psnps

g humic ha and fulvic acids fa polysaccharides proteins and extracellular polymeric substance eps are ubiquitous in aquatic environments hyung et al 2007 mohamed 2008 omoike and chorover 2006 shi kam et al 2004 due to their hydrophobic properties nps could inevitably interact with and adsorb these macromolecules when released into aquatic systems saleh et al 2010 such interactions may affect the

and biological activities e g ingestion and reproduction zhang et al 2019 a recent study investigated the influence of one macromolecule i e suwannee river nom on the aggregation kinetics of unmodified carboxyl modified and amino modified psnps yu et al 2019 however different types of macromolecules are present in aquatic environments and their complex variation in structures and properties e g chemical composition space configuration hydrophobicity and functional groups may result in distinct interactions with nps for instance different macromolecular adsorption behaviors on the plastic surface may occur under the influence of ambient solution conditions which could greatly modify the surface properties e g charge density and hydrophilicity of both plastics and macromolecules thus exerting different effects on the aggregation process of nps walker and bob 2001 the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of environmental and biological macromolecules on the aggregation kinetics of psnps under different solution conditions of environmental relevance manufactured psnps were selected as model nps since they are a typical plastic widely detected in the environment alimi et al 2018 li et al 2018 and were used in our previous study liu et al 2019 to make a comprehensive comparison four types of macromolecules with different chemical structures and properties were chosen in this study including polysaccharide e g sodium alginate sa humic substance e g suwannee river ha protein e g bovine serum albumin bsa and eps for instance sa represents hydrophilic linear and semi flexible polysaccharides while ha is a hydrophobic globular and semi rigid humic substance compared with the previous two macromolecules bsa is a more hydrophobic and globular macromolecule with protein tertiary structure finally eps extracted from culture medium of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 is composed of polysaccharide and protein having random coils with partly extending chains the aggregation kinetics of psnps in the presence of various macromolecules were quantified in solutions containing monovalent nacl and divalent cacl2 salts under different ph conditions the measured aggregation data were used to construct stability profiles for determination of the critical coagulation concentrations cccs for psnps systematic characterization was employed to elucidate the aggregation mechanisms of psnps under the influence of different macromolecules our results suggested that macromolecules stabilized psnps in monovalent salt na due to steric hindrance but destabilized psnps in divalent salt ca2 via molecular bridging and edl compression therefore macromolecules and solution chemistry may play a vital role on the fate and transport of psnps in aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the psnp particles with diameter of 0 05 0 1 μm were purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china according to the manufacturer the psnp samples received were the stock suspension containing 2 5 w v i e 25 g l of psnps and having no surface modification the working suspension containing 20 mg l psnps was prepared by diluting 0 4 ml stock solution in 500 ml milli q water resistivity 18 2 mω cm and stored at 4 8 c until use all experiments were conducted at a final psnp concentration of 10 mg l therefore dispersing agent if any added by the manufacturer in the stock suspension of psnps was diluted by 2 500 times with milli q water in experiments and may not affect their aggregation behavior the psnp concentration of 10 mg l was also used in previous studies cai et al 2018 oncsik et al 2014 and should be representative of np concentrations in natural aquatic systems gigault et al 2016 suwannee river ha srha cat 3s101h standard ⅲ purchased from international humic substances society ihss st paul mn was used as the representative aquatic humic substance the representative biomacromolecules including sa and bsa were obtained from sigma aldrich shanghai china whereas eps was extracted from the cultural medium of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 with the detailed procedure described in s1 of the supplementary material the macromolecule concentrations were studied at 1 2 and 5 mg c l i e total organic carbon content in solution phase which were within the range of nom concentrations typically found in natural aquatic environments thurman 1985 additionally monovalent nacl or divalent cacl2 electrolytes analytical grade obtained from shanghai titan scientific co ltd shanghai china were used without further purification the detailed preparation procedures for electrolyte and macromolecule solutions are presented in s2 of the supplementary material 2 2 characterizations the hydrodynamic sizes and zeta ζ potentials of psnps were measured at 25 c by dynamic light scattering dls using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk operated with a he ne laser at a wavelength of 633 nm and scattering angle of 90 the refractive and absorption indexes for psnps were set at 1 59 and 0 01 respectively to determine the macromolecular influence on the surface charge of psnps their ζ potentials with or without macromolecules were measured over a range of electrolyte concentrations triplicate samples were each measured 10 times for electrophoretic mobilities which were converted to ζ potentials using the smoluchowski approximation smoluchowski 1903 the size and morphology of psnp particles in the absence or presence of macromolecules were characterized under transmission electron microscope tem the elemental compositions and functional groups of eps and psnps were characterized with elemental analyzer and x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was employed to study the structures and functional groups of psnps and macromolecules as well as their interactions detailed procedures of these characterization techniques are presented in s3 of the supplementary material 2 3 aggregation experiments time resolved dynamic light scattering technique was used to record the change of intensity weighted average hydrodynamic diameter d h of psnps as a function of time on zetasizer nano zs90 at ambient temperature 25 c and with or without background macromolecules before test the psnp suspension electrolyte and macromolecule solutions were adjusted to the designated ph predetermined aliquots of psnp suspension 1 ml milli q water macromolecule and electrolyte solutions were transferred sequentially to a pre cleaned new cuvette dts0012 germany to make a total volume of 2 ml the cuvette was immediately vortexed vortex genie fisher scientific for 1 s and then inserted into the dls instrument the increase of d h was monitored over 20 to 100 min with the autocorrelation function accumulated for a period of 15 s all measurements of aggregation experiments were conducted in triplicates to increase the statistical power for data analysis the initial aggregation rate k which is proportional to the initial slope regime where d h increases linearly over time was determined for each aggregation test to quantify the aggregation rates the attachment efficiency α ranging from 0 to 1 was then calculated by normalizing k under different solution conditions by the slope obtained under diffusion limited k fast aggregation conditions saleh et al 2008 more detailed calculation procedure is presented in s4 of the supplementary material 2 4 measurements of hydrodynamic adsorption layer thickness halt photon correlation spectrometer was used to determine the halt of macromolecules attached to the psnp surface following the method of walker and bob 2001 samples were prepared following the same procedure for aggregation experiments by adding each of the four macromolecule solutions into a cuvette and allowed to stand for 30 min before test to ensure high polymer surface coverage all measurements were conducted under low electrolyte concentration 10 mm nacl and at 25 c the measured halt values for different macromolecules were accurate to within 1 6 4 8 of the psnp diameter which corresponded to about 2 5 nm thickness of adsorbed macromolecule layer at least 10 measurements were conducted for each reported halt value to increase the statistical power for data analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of psnps fig s1a presents the tem images taken for psnps indicating that they were regular microspheres with a uniform diameter of approximately 100 nm the dls measurements demonstrated that they had diameters of 60 282 nm with an average d h of 119 4 3 8 nm and a polydispersity index pdi of 0 074 0 043 fig s1b in the absence of macromolecules psnps had strong negative surface charges with ζ potential of 40 12 1 5 mv as measured at 1 mm nacl and ph 6 0 fig 1 a such surface charge favors greater stability for the psnp suspension larsson et al 2012 the negative ζ potential values changed from 40 12 to 17 mv and from 27 30 to 18 17 mv when nacl and cacl2 concentrations increased from 1 to 1000 mm and from 0 01 to 9 mm respectively fig 1 the xps and ftir analysis of psnps figures s1c d and associated discussions in the supplementary material showed comparable results obtained in our previous characterizations liu et al 2019 demonstrating that the psnps possess an excellent structural stability in aqueous systems fig 1 presents the ζ potentials of psnps as functions of nacl and cacl2 concentrations in the presence of four environmental and biological macromolecules at all tested concentrations of nacl and low cacl2 concentrations 0 6 mm sa eps and ha had little or no effect on the surface charge of psnps while at high cacl2 concentrations 1 mm eps and ha significantly reduced the negative charge of psnps whereas sa showed negligible influence the greatest negative ζ value 44 91 mv was obtained at 1 mm nacl and 2 mg c l ha different from the above three macromolecules bsa notably reduced the negative charge of psnps in both nacl and cacl2 solutions the results were similar to the prior reports that macromolecules e g sa and ha had negligible effects on the surface charges of single walled carbon nanotubes swnts saleh et al 2010 and diesel soot nanoparticles chen et al 2019 however other previous studies observed significant increase of negative charge on swnt surface with adsorbed anionic surfactant e g sodium dodecyl and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate and polyelectrolyte e g sa and ha liu et al 2007 white et al 2007 in addition the negative charge of psnps decreased in the presence of bsa which was consistent with previous research that this was attributed to strong protein adsorption onto surfaces of nanoparticles including gold dominguez medina et al 2013 swnts kopac and bozgeyik 2016 and diesel soot chen et al 2019 table 1 presents the halt value of each adsorbed macromolecule on psnp surface under different total organic carbon contents at 2 mg c l which was the macromolecule concentration selected for most ζ potential measurements and aggregation experiments in this study the greatest halt value of 21 9 nm was observed for bsa demonstrating its strong adsorption affinity onto psnp surface bsa with an isoelectric point iep of 5 2 was negatively charged ζ potential 22 65 mv in the tested solution at ph 6 0 figure s2 and so were psnps the protein molecules with negative charge could be spontaneously adsorbed onto negatively charged particle surface only via hydrophobic interactions dominguez medina et al 2013 to prevent the build up of high electrostatic potentials various cations e g na and ca2 could be simultaneously adsorbed into the protein sorbent contact zone dulm et al 1981 elgersma et al 1989 this co adsorption process consequently reduced the total negative charge on psnps after the attachment of negatively charged bsa onto psnp surface furthermore similar to bsa the adsorption of ca2 into the eps psnp or ha psnp contact zones was also observed except that it only occurred at sufficiently high cacl2 concentration i e 1 mm chen and elimelech 2006 zhang et al 2019 meanwhile such phenomenon did not occur in the presence of sa which may be attributed to its thinnest halt on psnps among four macromolecules that did not provide enough macromolecule sorbent contact region 3 2 psnp aggregation kinetics in the presence of monovalent na cation fig 2 a shows the stability curves of psnps as a function of nacl concentrations with or without single background macromolecules as nacl was the only background electrolyte psnps exhibited distinct reaction limited slow and diffusion limited fast aggregation regimes that followed the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory chen and huang 2017 mylon et al 2004 at low nacl concentrations the aggregation process was defined as reaction limited α 1 under which more na was required to neutralize the negative charge on psnps and consequently weaken their electrostatic repulsion as a result the aggregation rate increased with increasing nacl concentration however when nacl concentration reached its critical coagulation concentration ccc value which is the minimum electrolyte concentration to induce diffusion limited α 1 aggregation the energy barrier was completely eliminated and van der waals attractive force dominated the particle interactions chen et al 2006 li et al 2018 the attachment efficiencies as a function of nacl concentration were empirically fitted grolimund et al 2001 yielding a ccc value of 460 mm nacl that was close to our previous report of 450 mm nacl liu et al 2019 similar result was also observed for nano ps jodar reyes et al 2006 with a ccc value of 460 20 mm nacl an average diameter d of 364 nm and ζ potential of 44 mv however the ccc values obtained here for psnps were almost 30 times higher than those previously reported for micro ps for example a ccc value of 14 9 mm nacl was reported for micro ps which had a d value of 17 9 mm and ζ potential of 22 mv in 1 mm nacl li et al 2018 likewise oncsik et al 2014 showed that sulfate ps latex d 0 53 μm ccc 100 mm nacl exhibited stronger colloidal stability than carboxylate ps d 1 μm ccc 50 mm nacl it appears that both surface functional groups and particle diameters of mps or nps are important factors determining their colloidal stability and hence their fate and transport in aqueous systems fig 2a shows that the stability of psnps was significantly enhanced in the presence of macromolecules in nacl solutions none of the four macromolecules exhibited diffusion limited aggregation regimes even under the highest nacl concentration tested i e 1000 mm that is well above the salinity of seawater such stabilization effects on psnps followed the order of bsa ha eps sa these results suggested that macromolecules could strongly enhance the colloidal stability hence the mobility of psnps in aquatic environments this may also facilitate the transport and affect the fate of other pollutants such as heavy metals and organic chemicals in natural aquatic systems the observed stabilization effect on psnps by macromolecules were not likely resulted from the electrical double layer edl compression mechanism as discussed above the ζ potentials of psnps measured in the presence of a given macromolecule except for bsa were not significantly different from those measured in nacl only solution fig 1a it is highly likely that the enhanced colloidal stability was due to adsorption of macromolecules on psnp surface our prior study liu et al 2019 reported a contact angle of 108 2 for psnps in pure water indicating the hydrophobic nature of these nano sized plastics these hydrophobic psnps should presumably favor adsorption of organic molecules including the tested macromolecules therefore steric repulsion derived from adsorbed macromolecule layer may be the primary mechanism of such enhanced psnp stability chen and elimelech 2007 saleh et al 2010 such conjecture was supported with the order of halt values for the macromolecules measured at 2 mg c l which corresponded to their stabilization effects on psnps in nacl solutions table 1 it should be noted that the four macromolecules exhibited different extent of stabilization effects on the psnps in nacl solutions for instance sa showed the weakest stabilization effect and the thinnest halt which were likely related to its greater hydrophilicity the sa used in this study was extracted from brown algae and represents a linear semi flexible polysaccharide composed of α l guluronic acid g and β d mannuronic acid m residues boontheekul et al 2005 these functional groups could form hydrogen bonding with water resulting in relatively stronger hydrophilicity and thus weaker adsorption affinity to psnps unlike sa ha is a hydrophobic more globular and semi rigid macromolecule buffle et al 1998 that is prone to attachment to the psnp surface it is thus expected to exhibit vital steric hindrance effects on inhibiting psnp aggregation similar to the above trends previous studies have also reported that sa exerted weak stabilization effects on swnts saleh et al 2010 fullerene c60 nanoparticles chen and elimelech 2008 and soot nanoparticles chen et al 2019 while ha significantly enhanced the colloidal stability of these nanoparticles in nacl solutions the strongest stabilization effect of bsa on psnp aggregation in nacl solution was likely attributed to its strongest adsorption to psnp surface as evidenced from its greatest halt value table 1 and the most significant reduction of psnp negative charge among four macromolecules fig 1 other than hydrophobic interactions the driving force for bsa adsorption on psnp surface probably also stemmed from structural rearrangements resulting in a higher conformational entropy in the protein molecule norde and anusiem 1992 this was revealed from the detailed analysis of ftir spectra on the secondary protein structures in the amide i region 1700 1600 cm 1 for psnps bsa and psnps bound bsa figure s3 and table s1 with associated discussions in the supplementary material such structural change after contact with psnps indicated that bsa exhibited a more compact globular structure after adsorption badireddy et al 2010 therefore bsa may have the strongest adsorption affinity to the hydrophobic psnp surface as well as a globular protein structure and likely induce a longer range steric repulsive force between psnps as compared with sa and ha with relatively more linear molecular structures norde and giacomelli 2000 the chemical compositions and functional groups of eps were characterized by elemental analysis xps and ftir fig s4 and tables s2 s5 with the detailed descriptions presented in the supplementary material the experimental results indicated that polysaccharide 22 and protein 51 were the major components in eps table s5 which was extracted from culture medium of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 and is widely distributed in aquatic environments zhang et al 2016 the above characteristics are consistent with prior studies that eps macromolecule is typically composed of polysaccharide 30 and protein 50 li et al 2016 furthermore eps usually exists as random coils with partly extending chains under neutral conditions wang et al 2012 having a less compacted structure than bsa but is more globular than sa as a result both the halt value of 6 2 nm for eps adsorption on psnp surface and the retardation effect of eps on psnp aggregation fell between those for bsa and sa table 1 and fig 2a 3 3 psnp aggregation kinetics in the presence of divalent ca2 cations the aggregation kinetics of psnps in the absence or presence of each macromolecule were investigated in solutions containing varying concentrations of divalent salt cacl2 the results were presented as attachment efficiencies fig 2b or aggregation rates fig 2c similar to the results obtained in nacl solutions the aggregation kinetics of psnps in cacl2 solutions without macromolecules also exhibited both reaction limited and diffusion limited aggregation regimes the attachment efficiency data were empirically fitted grolimund et al 2001 to yield a ccc value of 32 mm cacl2 which is in close agreement with our prior study of 33 mm cacl2 liu et al 2019 previous study reported similar ccc values of 34 mm cacl2 and 20 mm cacl2 for sulfate coated d 0 53 μm ζ potential 49 mv at 1 mm cacl2 and carboxyl coated ps particles d 1 μm ζ potential 26 mv at 1 mm cacl2 oncsik et al 2014 respectively but much lower ccc value 2 95 mm cacl2 for micro ps particles d 17 9 μm ζ potential 22 mv at 0 2 mm cacl2 li et al 2018 the difference in ccc values should be related to the particle size and surface charge of ps particles the ratio between the ccc values for ca2 and na was proportional to z 3 85 where z 2 is the counterion valence for calcium which is reasonable because dlvo theory predicts a varied ratio for colloidal particle ranging from z 2 to z 6 schulze hardy rule elimelech et al 1995 fig 2c shows that all four macromolecules destabilized psnps and promoted their aggregation in cacl2 solutions at cacl2 concentration below 10 mm the destabilization effects followed the order of bsa ha sa eps while such order changed to sa ha eps bsa at cacl2 concentration above 10 mm in the presence of eps bsa or ha the aggregation behaviors of psnps in cacl2 solutions still followed the dlvo type interaction with two distinct reaction limited and diffusion limited regimes allowing for empirical fitting to yield their ccc values of 15 6 and 10 mm cacl2 respectively fig 2b these ccc values were 46 8 18 7 and 31 2 compared to those obtained in background solutions containing only cacl2 indicating that the overall destabilization effects on psnps in cacl2 solution were bsa ha eps however unlike the other three tested macromolecules the promotion of psnp aggregation rates by sa showed no sign of plateauing at any higher cacl2 concentrations e g even at 60 mm cacl2 which is beyond average ionic strength of seawater fig 2c therefore the stability curve could not be constructed for psnp aggregation in cacl2 solutions with the presence of sa the above results indicated that the colloidal stability of psnps could be lowered variously by these macromolecules in cacl2 solutions the strongest destabilization effect on psnps was observed for sa which was likely related to its molecular structure the ftir results revealed that sa contained abundant oxygen containing functional groups e g carboxyl and hydroxyl groups fig s5a which could form molecular bridging with ca2 and significantly enhance the aggregation of psnps as presented in fig 2d the formation of alginate gel at 10 mm cacl2 and 5 mg c l sa enmeshed psnps together to form larger clusters previous studies have reported that the guluronic acid blocks g blocks of alginate polymers could complex with calcium ions to crosslink the polymers and form alginate gel networks thereby significantly promoting nanoparticle aggregation chen and elimelech 2006 chen and elimelech 2007 it is likely that the destabilization mechanisms of eps bsa and ha on psnps should be mainly ascribed to edl compression and molecular bridging as described above the aggregation behaviors of psnps in cacl2 solutions with the presence of each macromolecule except for sa still followed the dlvo theory meanwhile the ζ potential measurements fig 1b also indicated that the order of surface charge reduction of psnps by three macromolecules in cacl2 solutions followed the same order of their destabilization effects on psnp aggregation i e bsa ha eps especially under 1 10 mm cacl2 whereas sa exerted negligible effect in addition the ftir analyses revealed that eps bsa and ha contained carboxyl groups figs s3a and s5a so that these three macromolecules could also form gel like structure with ca2 to promote the aggregation of psnps as shown by tem figs s5b d chen et al 2016 xu et al 2016 in summary when cacl2 was the only background electrolyte sa destabilized psnps mainly via molecular bridging whereas the destabilization of psnps by eps bsa and ha were governed by edl compression and molecular bridging 3 4 effects of macromolecule concentration on psnp aggregation to further characterize the influence of macromolecules on the aggregation behavior of psnps their aggregation rates were measured at macromolecules concentrations of 0 1 2 and 5 mg c l in 500 mm nacl fig 3 a or 20 mm cacl2 fig 3b fig 3a shows that at an nacl concentration 500 mm relevant to seawater level the presence of 1 mg c l sa or eps exerted negligible influence on psnp aggregation while the stabilization effect on psnps started to appear at 2 and 5 mg c l sa or eps for example the aggregation rates decreased by 44 2 and 86 2 as sa concentration increased to 2 and 5 mg c l respectively additionally d h of psnps only increased from 170 to 300 nm at 5 mg c l sa and remained unchanged for eps in 20 min fig s6a b different from sa and eps bsa and ha significantly inhibited psnp aggregation at even lower macromolecule concentrations 1 mg c l which could be attributed to the stronger steric hindrance as reflected by their higher halt values 18 9 and 12 6 nm for bsa and ha respectively compared to those for sa 3 4 nm and eps 4 5 nm table 1 in the presence of 2 and 5 mg c l bsa and ha the d h of psnps remained consistently unchanged as so did for 5 mg c l eps fig s6c d the results demonstrated that the stabilization effects of macromolecules on psnp aggregation in monovalent electrolyte solutions were positively correlated with the macromolecule concentrations which agreed with the results observed for carbon nanotubes hyung et al 2007 and titanium dioxide domingos et al 2009 in addition a prior study also reported that an increased concentration of suwannee river nom resulted in enhanced stabilization for psnps psnps cooh and psnps nh2 yu et al 2019 although a different macromolecule and various psnps were studied it should be pointed out that bsa and ha exhibited stronger effects for stabilizing psnps suggesting that humic substances and proteins are more likely to enhance the mobility of psnps under typical freshwater or estuary conditions opposite trend was observed for the cacl2 solutions fig 3b illustrates the aggregation rates of psnps in the presence of 1 2 and 5 mg c l macromolecules with fixed divalent cation concentration 20 mm cacl2 it clearly shows that all macromolecules promoted the aggregation of psnps at their respective three tested concentration levels in comparison to the absence of these macromolecules i e 0 mg c l fig 3b shows that sa exhibited significant destabilization effect on psnps and such an effect increased as a function of its concentration this could be attributed to the presence of more available carboxylic groups in the guluronic acid blocks g blocks of sa fig s5a that could complex with ca2 at higher sa concentrations boontheekul et al 2005 therefore stronger molecular bridging occurred between sa and ca2 under higher concentrations of sa fig 3b or cacl2 fig 2c or both resulting in more significantly enhanced aggregation rates of psnps different from sa an increased concentration of eps bsa or ha did not always correspond to a stronger destabilization effect on psnps in cacl2 solutions the aggregation rates of psnps were decreased instead when the concentrations of these three macromolecules increased to 5 mg c l fig 3b for instance the aggregation rate increased by almost 4 3 times from 0 37 to 1 59 nm s as eps concentration raised from 1 to 2 mg c l but it decreased to 0 77 nm s as eps concentration further increased to 5 mg c l as pointed out in the last section the destabilization effects of these three macromolecules in cacl2 solutions mainly originated from molecular bridging and edl compression however under higher concentrations e g 5 mg c l of eps bsa or ha an elevated steric hindrance may appear due to the thicker adsorbed macromolecule layer table 1 such stabilization effect on psnps arise from steric hindrance could compete with the former two destabilization effects yu et al 2018 leading to an overall weakened destabilization and thus the observed less enhanced psnp aggregation under such circumstances fig 3b 3 5 effects of ph on psnp aggregation 3 5 1 nacl solutions the psnp aggregation as a function of ph in the presence of 2 mg c l sa eps bsa or ha was studied at various concentrations of nacl fig 4 and cacl2 fig 5 in the presence of sa the aggregation rates of psnps at all tested nacl concentrations i e 100 200 500 and 900 mm decreased as ph increased from 3 to 10 fig 4a the most significant decrease in aggregation rates were observed under basic conditions as reflected by the slightly increased ph 8 fig s7a or unchanged ph 10 figure s7b d h values of psnps similarly the increase of ph also retarded psnp aggregation in the presence of ha figs 4d and s7g h the above results for sa and ha should be attributed to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion between psnps at higher ph as their ζ potentials became more negative figs s8a and d due to adsorption of hydroxyl groups onto psnp surfaces liu et al 2019 different from sa and ha psnps aggregated rapidly in the presence of eps even at low nacl concentrations at ph 3 fig 4b with the aggregation rates reaching 1 0 and 1 16 nm s respectively at 10 and 100 mm nacl such phenomenon may be derived from the positive surface charge of eps at ph 3 with an iep of 4 3 figure s2 fig s8b shows that the psnp suspension containing eps at ph 3 exhibited overall slightly positive to zero ζ potentials over the tested nacl concentrations resulting in fast psnp aggregation as ph increased from 4 5 to 10 eps was deprotonated and gradually lowered the aggregation rates figs 4b and s7c d due to enhanced negative charge on psnps fig s8b unlike eps the presence of bsa in nacl solutions significantly stabilized psnps at ph 3 fig 4c figure s2 shows that bsa with an iep of 5 2 was positively charged at ph 3 which imparted positive charge 10 30 mv on psnps fig s8c and electrostatic repulsion however the positive charge of bsa weakened at ph 4 5 figure s2 resulting in ζ potentials of psnps near zero at 100 mm nacl fig s8c and thus aggregation fig 4c the gradual decrease in aggregation rates with increased nacl concentration at ph 4 5 was attributed to more negative ζ potentials e g 11 mv at 900 mm nacl on psnps fig s8c as ph increased to 6 8 and 10 psnps were stabilized by their negative charge in the presence of bsa fig s8c several previous studies reported that macromolecular structure may became more expanded with increased ph due to deprotonation and exposure of more hydrophilic surface functional groups palmer and von wandruszka 2001 varga et al 2016 wang et al 2012 the steric hindrance effect of macromolecules may be consequently weakened at higher ph however the aggregation rates generally decreased in nacl solutions with increased ph for all macromolecules fig 4 indicating that the enhanced electrostatic repulsion overcame the weakened steric hindrance effect 3 5 2 cacl2 solutions the psnp aggregation as a function of ph at various cacl2 concentrations in the presence of macromolecules fig 5 showed similar trends with the results obtained in nacl solutions fig 4 for eps bsa and ha however an opposite trend was observed for sa fig 5a shows that in the presence of sa the aggregation was enhanced as ph increased from 3 to 10 for instance the aggregation rates at 6 mm cacl2 reached 5 nm s at ph 10 in the presence of sa while remained 0 5 nm s for the other three macromolecules this should be attributed to the formation of more binding sites on sa available for bridging with ca2 at higher ph due to deprotonation of sa figure s2 the positively charged eps at ph 3 figure s2 resulted in psnp aggregation in cacl2 solutions fig 5b due to charge neutralization as similarly observed above in nacl solutions fig 4b as ph increased from 4 5 to 10 the functional groups e g hydroxyl and carboxyl on eps became more negative figure s2 and thus provided more sites for ca2 bridging however the increased ph also simultaneously led to an elevated electrostatic repulsion as reflected by more negative ζ potentials of psnps fig s9b therefore the aggregation rates peaked at ph 6 and then decreased from ph 8 to 10 fig 5b similar to the results observed in nacl solutions psnps were stabilized by bsa at ph 3 in cacl2 solutions fig 5c with an overall strong positive charge 15 32 mv fig s9c at ph 4 5 the aggregation rates increased significantly to the maximum likely due to the combined effects of weak surface charge 0 10 mv and bsa bridging with ca2 however the aggregation rates gradually decreased with further increase of ph which should be related to the elevated electrostatic repulsion derived from more negative charge of psnps fig s9c furthermore an increased ph may inhibit the activity of functional groups on bsa and even result in denaturation due to cleavage of hydrogen bond and forming salts with free amino or carboxyl groups varga et al 2016 thus weakening the molecular bridging between bsa and ca2 for ha fig 5d the aggregation rates decreased as ph increased from 6 to 8 which was mainly due to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion as reflected by more negative ζ potentials fig s9d however further increase of ph from 8 to 10 exerted different effects on the aggregation rates depending on cacl2 concentration at cacl2 concentrations near or below 20 mm the aggregation rates increased due to enhanced molecular bridging between ca2 and deprotonated ha figure s2 zhang et al 2013 at cacl2 concentrations above 20 mm such effect may be overcome by enhanced steric hindrance derived from more compact and thicker structure of ha palmer and von wandruszka 2001 because more ca2 was adsorbed by ha or psnp surface as reflected by the upper shift of ζ potentials at ph 10 fig s9d overall the ph effect on psnp aggregation in the presence of ha was governed by electrostatic repulsion molecular bridging and steric hindrance since both monovalent and divalent salts are present in natural water and their stabilization or destabilization effects may be counterbalanced the aggregation behavior of psnps was further studied in artificial seawater solution table s6 at ph 8 in the absence or presence of single macromolecule at 2 mg c l fig s10 the overall results showed that the psnp aggregation was promoted respectively by sa and eps inhibited by bsa and unaffected by ha in artificial seawater therefore the stabilization effect may compete with the destabilization effect on psnps depending on the macromolecules and solution chemistry 4 conclusion aggregation and stability of psnps strongly affect their fate transport and ecological risks in aquatic environments this study demonstrated that environmental and biological macromolecules ubiquitously present in aquatic systems could variously interact with psnps and exert different effects on their aggregation behavior all four studied macromolecules significantly stabilized psnps in monovalent na salt mainly due to steric hindrance originated from the adsorbed macromolecule layer such stabilization effect correlated positively with the halt values of four macromolecules i e bsa ha eps sa in divalent ca2 salt solutions molecular bridging between sa and ca2 significantly destabilized psnps which enhanced with concentrations of sa and cacl2 the other three macromolecules i e bsa ha and eps also destabilized psnps in cacl2 solutions due to the combined effects of edl compression and molecular bridging however their destabilization effects could be weakened by steric hindrance at higher macromolecule concentration e g 5 mg c l an increased ph in nacl or cacl2 solutions containing macromolecules all stabilized psnps due to elevated electrostatic repulsion except that sa destabilized psnps in cacl2 solutions because of enhanced molecular bridging the stabilization effect of macromolecules in monovalent salt may also compete with the destabilization effect in divalent salt at high concentration in seawater overall our results suggested that both macromolecules and solution chemistry are important factors affecting the fate and ecological risks of psnps in aquatic systems the interactions of macromolecules with plastic materials other than polystyrene should also be considered in
